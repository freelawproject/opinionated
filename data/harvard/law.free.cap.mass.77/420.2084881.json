A verdict rendered at September term 1856 of the court of common pleas was set aside by this court. 7 Gray, 100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">At the second trial in the court of common pleas at March term 1858, before Perkins, J., the defendants denied that the plaintiff had received any injury from the accident. The plaintiff called Dr. Kimball, an experienced surgeon, and the only one who had visited her to prescribe for her. He testified as follows: \u201c Three months, more or less, after the accident, I was called upon by the plaintiff\u2019s sister to visit the plaintiff. I examined the limb, but cannot describe particularly what I then discovered. I saw some appreciable evidence of injury to the limb, and gave the plaintiff some directions (I cannot tell what) about keeping quiet and the use of the limb. She seemed to be in pain. My opinion from what I saw was that she was suf fering pain.\u201d He was then asked : <em>\u201c </em>From the declarations of the patient as to her then state of feeling, and the examination you made, can you form any opinion as to the extent of the injury she was then laboring under ? \u201d This question was objected to by the defendants, and the judge ruled that the witness could be allowed to state only the opinion formed from what he saw of the condition of the plaintiff, and not from any answers, statements or declarations of the plaintiff. The wit ness continued : \u201c I shall have to say that the injur) was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>nature of a sprain. There was room for a reasonable hypothesis that there might be a fracture of the small bone of the leg. I cannot tell the specific injury, nor is it in the power of man to tell. There are often injuries that cannot be located. I saw the plaintiff next time a year or more afterwards, about the time of the last trial, and then made an examination in order to be a witness at the trial, and again last evening for the same purpose. These were the only times I saw the plaintiff.\u201d The witness then, in answer to a question, said: \u201c I cannot tell what opinion I formed from the examination at the last trial; I do not know what I saw then. I cannot say what appearances the limb exhibited that she was suffering pain. I think from her appearance then that she was suffering pain, but from local appearances I could discover no data from which to form an opinion; could only compare it with other cases.\u201d The question was then put, \u201c From your examination of the patient at the time, and from your knowledge and experience as a surgeon, could you form any opinion as to the permanency of the injury ? \u201d This question was objected to; but the judge overruled the objection; and the witness answered, \u201c I should say it was a permanent injury, from the examination I made, independently of anything said by her. When I went to see her, I noticed the fact that she went lame.\u201d This statement was objected to, but the objection was overruled. The witness then testified : \u201c The examination of last evening settles the question of its being a permanent injury. The injured limb is larger than the other, and has not the appearance of a healthy limb.\u201d On cross-examination, he said that he did not know what he prescribed for the leg the first time he saw her, or whether he prescribed anything; that there was talk about her suing the city; that he saw no difference then between the size of he legs, nor did he remember any difference at the second exam ination in September 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">A physician called by the defendants was asked on cross-examination : \u201cIs it not a fact in your experience that injuries may exist and do often exist where there are no outward manifestations ? \u201d The defendants objected to this question, but the objection was overruled</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-5\"><em>B.

Dr. Kimball was not called in until three months after the accident, and after a \u201c talk of suing the city; \u201d never saw the patient again until called as a witness at the first trial; and could not tell what he saw then or at the first time, or what directions he gave, if any. The opinion which he then formed from his examination, but which he had no present knowledge of any facts to support or means of testing, and without any means of ascertaining whether it would be his present opinion, should not have been admitted. <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Tyngsborough, </em>9 Cush. 36. The question and answer as to the permanency of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were objectionable, as putting to an expert the fact to be tried by the jury. And the answer that \u201c she went lame \u201d was incompetent, because not within the peculiar knowledge of an expert. <em>New England Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Lovell, </em>7 Cush. 319. An expert in surgery ought not to give his opinion as to acts of the plaintiff, done for the purpose of making evidence for herself after action brought. <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Lothrop, </em>10 Cush. 457. <em>Stranger </em>v. <em>Searle, </em>1 Esp.
