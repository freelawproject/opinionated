The defendant, within the time allowed for answering, but without leave of court, on different days filed two answers to the declaration, setting forth different grounds of defence; and at the trial in the court of common pleas was allowed by <em>Mellen, </em>C. J., against the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, and without having made any motion for leave to file an additional answer, to introduce evidence under both answers; and obtained a verdict. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-8\"><em>J.

Both these answers were seasonably filed, although one of them reached the clerk\u2019s office a day before the other. Any irregularity in filing two papers instead of one was cured by the permission of the court to introduce evidence under both, which was equivalent to granting leave to file the second, if any leave was necessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-10\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AWV\">The defendant has a right to make one answer at one time.
