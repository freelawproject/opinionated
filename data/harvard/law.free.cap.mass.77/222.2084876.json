Answer, payment. The action was entered and the answer filed at March term 1857 of the court of common pleas. Afterwards, before June term, the plaintiff went into insolvency and an assignee was duly appointed. Before December term 1857 the plaintiff died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b232-8\">At March term 1858, Morris, J., against the defendants\u2019 objection, allowed the assignee, upon his motion, to come in and prosecute the suit; and overruled a motion to dismiss the action for want of any party to prosecute it; and at the trial permitted him to testify to conversations and declarations of the defendants, after the assignee\u2019s appointment and after the plaintiff\u2019s death, tending to show that the note had not been paid in the plaintiff\u2019s lifetime. The defendants offered themselves as witnesses to rebut the testimony of the assignee and others, but were not allowed to testify. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-9\"><em>W. A. </em>Williams, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMj\">1. The writ abated by the plaintiff\u2019s death. Gould Pl. <em>c. </em>5, \u00a7 90. 1 Chit. Pl. (6th Amer. ed.) 482. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>93, \u00a7 1. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>6 Gray, 523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-10\">2. After the assignee had been admitted to prosecute the suit, and had testified to matters which had occurred since the death of the' insolvent, the defendant ought to have been allowed to testify upon the same matters. <em>Fischer </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>9 Gray, 440.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-11\">P. <em>E. Aldrich, </em>for the assignee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A5_t\">1. The right of action on this note passed by the assignment to the assignee in insolvency, and was not affected by the subsequent death of the debtor; and the assignee, upon motion made while the action was still pending in court, was rightly admitted to prosecute it for the benefit of the estate. <em>St. </em>1838, c. 163, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">2. The assignee was also a competent witness; but by the terms of the statute the defendants could not be witnesses. <em>St. </em>1857, <em>c. </em>305, \u00a7 1. <em>Howe </em>v. Merrick, <em>ante, </em>129.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The defendants also moved for a new trial, upon the ground of a discovery of a receipt since the verdict, and, although the plaintiff objected that the evidence was merely cumulative, a new trial was granted, upon which the plaintiff obtained a verdict and judgment. 13 Gray, 525.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
