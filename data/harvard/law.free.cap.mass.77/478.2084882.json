And the court have no doubt that they are so' entitled. It is only <em>\u201c </em>after breach of the condition of a mortgage,\u201d that a mortgagee or his assignee can make an open and peaceable entry on the mortgaged premises for the purpose of foreclosure, and, after recording a certificate of such entry, effect a foreclosure by keeping possession peaceably for three years. Rev. Sts. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 1 2,7. A record of such certificate is prerequisite to a foreclosure but is not conclusive evidence that the mortgagee had a legal right thus to enter. <em>Case to stand for trial.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em> </em>This and the following cases for this term were argued at Boston in January 1859 before Shaw, C.
