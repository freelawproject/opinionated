The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-8\"><em>W. S.

The evidence of the defendant\u2019s statements in the present case clearly falls within the latter class, and the rule of law was correctly applied by the court. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
