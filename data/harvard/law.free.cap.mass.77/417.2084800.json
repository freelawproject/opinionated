Answer, a right of way by prescription.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-8\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, the evidence tended to show that the defendant, and those under whom he claimed title, had used the way since 1819, and that this use originated in a trespass known to be such by them. <em>Mellen, </em>C. J. instructed the jury, that, to establish a right of way by prescription, the defendant must show that he, or those under whom he claimed, had used the way, with the knowledge of the owner of the land, for twenty years and upwards, uninterruptedly, adversely and under a claim of right; and that the use of the vray, although originally known to be a trespass such as would at any time before the expiration of twenty years enable the owner to maintain an action of trespass, would after the expiration of twenty years ripen into a prescriptive right. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-9\"><em>J.
