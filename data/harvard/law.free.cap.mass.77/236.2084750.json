But the defendant cannot ask his agent, who settled a former similar account for him with the plaintiff, to testify whether he settled it because he thought him liable; nor give in evidence the reasons of his having at the time of that settlement paid bills contracted by others with the plaintiff; nor that another clerk of the plaintiff, after the delivery, of the goods sued for, asked the defendant\u2019s agent about the solvency of the third person, and spoke of him as running up a bill with the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-8\">Action of contract for goods sold to the defendant, and delivered by his order to Jeremiah B. Wheeler since February 1854. The answer denied any sale to the defendant, or delivery to Jeremiah B. Wheeler by his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, before Perkins, J., the plaintiffs introduced evidence tending to show that Jeremiah B. Wheeler was engaged by the defendant to carry on a mill, and was directed by him to obtain the goods needed on his account at the plaintiffs\u2019 shop; <em>/ </em>and communicated this to J. L. Perkins, the plaintiffs\u2019 head clerk, and obtained goods which were charged on the plaintiffs\u2019 books to Jeremiah B. Wheeler; and that the defendant, on being afterwards told by the clerk what Jeremiah had said and done, said \u201c it was all right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\">The plaintiffs then asked Perkins, Upon whose credit the goods were delivered to Jeremiah, and upon whom he relied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>payment for them. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected. But the judge allowed the question to be put, for the purpose of showing that, notwithstanding the charges on the books, the plaintiffs really gave credit to the defendant; and the witness answered that after his conversation with Jeremiah he relied upon the defendant for payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">The plaintiffs introduced evidence that Jeremiah B. Wheeler was, as they knew, a poor man, having but little property, if any; and one of them was allowed, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to testify that Jeremiah was not in good pecuniary credit at the time of the sale of the goods, <em>\u201c </em>for the purpose of arguing to the jury from it, in connection with the other facts in the case, upon the probabilities of credit being given to so large an amount, under the circumstances, by him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">Charles B. Eaton, another clerk of the plaintiffs, who had charge of their books and settled their accounts, testified, without opposition, that in February 1854 he settled a previous account with Jeremiah B. Wheeler, for goods delivered (as the plaintiffs claimed) under the same agreement, by transferring it to the defendant, who by his agent, Holland Fan-, paid it, without objection ; and that one of the plaintiffs was present at that settlement. Farr, being called by the defendant, testified that the plaintiffs had no bill of Jeremiah B. Wheeler\u2019s account, but said that Jeremiah had a <em>\u201c </em>pass book,\u201d and if it was not all right they would make it so ; and so the witness allowed it. The defendant then asked, \u201c Did you settle that account because you considered Jonathan Wheeler liable ? \u201d This question was objected to by the plaintiffs and excluded by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">The defendant was allowed to prove all that occurred at and in connection with that settlement, and to read to the jury all the items of account settled, and in this manner it appeared that at the time of that settlement bills due from other persons were allowed to be transferred to and were paid for in the account of the defendant. The defendant thereupon offered to show that these persons were in the defendant\u2019s employment, and were then in his debt. But the judge excluded the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-8\">The defendant further offered to show by Farr that Eaton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>had inquired of him, after about $125 worth of goods had been delivered, as to the solvency of Jeremiah B. Wheeler, and had informed him that \u201c Jeremiah had run up considerable of a bill there.\u201d But the judge ruled, \u201c that, so far as this was offered for the purpose of affecting the plaintiffs by Eaton\u2019s conversations as their agent, it was not admissible, as the inquiry of Eaton did not appear to be a part of any transaction in which Eaton was engaged for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-6\"><em>C.

The plaintiffs might explain the charges on their books by evidence of facts and conversations bearing upon or making the contract. <em>James </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>4 Gray, 451. But the statement of Perkins that he relied on\" the defendant for payment was incompetent, both .as contradicting the entry in the plaintiffs\u2019 books of account, and as stating the agent\u2019s intention only. <em>Given </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>5 W. &amp; S. 333. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>10 Alab. 460. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>The State, </em>10 Georgia, 511.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">2. The evidence as to the pecuniary credit of Jeremiah B. Wheeler was inadmissible. It was too remote, and had no direct bearing upon the question whether a contract had been made with the defendant. <em>Swamscot Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>2 Foster, 457. <em>Orcutt </em>v. <em>Ranney, </em>10 Cush. 183. <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Scarborough, </em>5 Gray, 422. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>5 Conn. 335 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 52, 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">3. If the evidence of the intention of the plaintiffs\u2019 agent in making the entry was admissible, evidence of the intention of the defendant\u2019s agent in settling the accounts was equally admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\">4. The evidence as to the defendant\u2019s payments of other persons\u2019 bills, at the time of his settlement with the plaintiffs in 1854, was relevant, as showing that the reasons which induced him to pay those bills influenced him when settling Jeremiah B. Wheeler\u2019s account. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>5 Pick. 15. <em>Tibbetts </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>19 Pick. 166. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Obear, </em>10 N. H. 477.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-10\">5. Eaton\u2019s inquiry of Farr about Jeremiah B. Wheeler\u2019s insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>vency was within the scope of Eaton\u2019s agency, and should have been admitted to show that the plaintiffs\u2019 agent who sold the goods relied on Jeremiah B. Wheeler for payment. <em>Dorne </em>v. <em>Southwork Manuf. Co. </em>11 Cush. 205, &amp; cases there cited. 1 Parsons on Con. 49, &amp; cases cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-5\"><em>N. Wood, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6d\">1. The testimony of Perkins that he relied on the defendant to pay for the goods delivered to Jeremiah B. Wheeler was rightly admitted. Perkins had the general charge of the plaintiffs\u2019 store, and it was to him that Jeremiah B. made the statement, before the goods were delivered, that the defendant was to pay for them. The case of <em>James </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>4 Gray, 451, decides that the charge on the books was not conclusive against the plaintiffs, but that they might show, by oral testimony, that the sale was to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">2. The evidence of Jeremiah B. Wheeler\u2019s poverty and want of pecuniary credit, we think, was competent, for the purpose for which it was introduced. In connection with the other evidence in the case, it might rightly have an influence on the jurors\u2019 minds. No case cited for the defendant, to show that it was inadmissible, bears on that point, except <em>Swamscot Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Walker, 2 </em>Foster, 457. And the decision in that case shows this only; that the plaintiffs could not have been permitted to give evidence that, before the delivery of the goods now sued for, they had refused to receive Jeremiah B. Wheeler\u2019s note in payment for goods sold by them to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">3. The defendant was rightly refused permission to inquire of Farr \u2014 his agent in the settlement of Jeremiah B.\u2019s account in February 1854 by transferring it to the defendant on the plaintiffs\u2019 books \u2014whether he so settled that account because he considered the defendant liable to pay it. Farr\u2019s opinion of the defendant\u2019s legal liability to the plaintiffs was not admissible in evidence for or against either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">4. The testimony offered by the defendant respecting his pecuniary relation to those other persons 'whose accounts, as well as those of Jeremiah B., were transferred to him on the plaintiffs\u2019 books in February 1854, and which he paid, was imma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>terial, and was therefore rightly excluded. The question at the trial was, whether the defendant was liable to the plaintiffs fat the goods delivered to Jeremiah B. subsequently to February 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">5. The testimony, which the defendant proposed to introduce as to a conversation between Farr and Eaton, was rightly rejected, for the reason assigned by the judge at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
