But until such allowance and order have been made, we think it clear that a county cannot be so held. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>109, \u00a7 30. In <em>Fellows </em>v. Duncan, 13 Met. 332, where an order of the city council of Lowell was passed, that a certain sum be paid to D. for land taken for a street, but for the payment of which sum no order had been drawn on the city treasurer, it was decided that the city could not be held as trustee of D.; there being no debt due to him, for which he could maintain an action of debt against the city. The decision in that case is decisive of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>Trustees discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
