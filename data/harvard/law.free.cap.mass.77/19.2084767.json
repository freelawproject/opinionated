Miller <em>vs. </em>Lyman Carrier &amp; trustee.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-8\">When one adjudged a trustee in foreign attachment appears by his answers to be chargeable for a less amount than his caste as taxed, he is entitled, under the <em>St. </em>of 1845, <em>c. </em>188, to judgment and execution for the balance, deducting that amount, without waiting for a <em>scire facias </em>against him.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-9\">Trustee process. The trustee in his answers disclosed that he had in his hands the sum of two dollars of the goods, effects and credits of the principal defendant; and was adjudged a trustee. After final judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant, the trustee moved that he might have judgment against the plaintiff for the balance of Ms costs after deducting the said sum of two dollars, according to the provisions of the <em>St. </em>of 1845, <em>c. </em>188. The court of common pleas overruled the motion, and the trustee appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-10\"><em>J.

It is true that ordinarily the court does not ascertain in the first instance for how much the trustee is to be charged. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>109, \u00a7 42. But here it becomes necessary to ascertain it, in order to determine what judgment for costs shall be entered. Otherwise, it may not be possible to carry the <em>St. </em>of 1845 into effect; for <em>scire facias </em>may never be brought. The court must therefore ascertain from the trustee\u2019s answers, whether the goods in his hands are insufficient to pay his costs as taxed, and if they are, then award execution against the plaintiff for the balance. <em>Motion granted.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
