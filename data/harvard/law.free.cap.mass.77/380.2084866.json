Sts. <em>c. </em>121, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28,) we are of opinion that <em>audita querela </em>is not his remedy for the erroneous taxation. The case is within the rule which denies this remedy to a party who has had an opportunity, and has neglected it, to avail himself of all his defences and rights. 1 Rol. Ab. 306. Com. Dig. Audita Querela, C. <em>Faxon </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>11 Cush. 35. Whether the plaintiff can maintain a writ of error, when, as in this case, the illegal taxation of costs is apparent on the taxed bill, we express no opinion, but leave that question for decision when it shall be regularly brought before us. It has been decided that a writ of error will not lie to correct the taxation of too many days\u2019 attendance of the prevailing party, or too much travel and attendance of witnesses.\u2019 <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>8 Cush. 236. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Berkshire Woollen Co. </em>1 Gray, 420. But the error did not, in those cases, appear on the face of the taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
