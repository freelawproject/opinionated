Underwood. The officer returned upon the execution in the original suit that he had made demand upon Haynes to pay over all goods and effects belonging to Underwood in his hands, but that he had wholly neglected and refused so to do, and the execution was returned unsatisfied. Answer, that the defendant did offer to pay the amount in his hands to the officer, and the officer refused to take it.

But no rule of law is better settled than this, namely, that the return of an officer, as to all matters which are properly the subject of his return, is conclusive, so far as it affects parties and privies to the returned process. Their only remedy for a false return is by action against the officer. <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>4 Mass. 478. <em>Bott </em>v. <em>Burnell, </em>11 Mass. 165. <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>15 Mass. 230. <em>Bern </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>17 Mass. 601. <em>Tilden </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Cush. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
