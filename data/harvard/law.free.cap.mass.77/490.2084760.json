The commissioners appointed by the court of common pleas reported that, after notice to all parties interested, they had viewed and appraised the premises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201c and having adjudged that the same cannot be divided without injury thereto and depreciating the value thereof,\u201d had set off and assigned the whole to the petitioner, he paying the respondents a fixed sum, \u201c as the full value of their one tenth part thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The respondents objected to the acceptance of the report, because the commissioners had \u201c not offered or given the respondents the privilege of taking the whole of said premises by paying the value of the petitioner\u2019s share therein to him.\u201d This objection was overruled, and the report accepted, and judgment given accordingly; and the respondents appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-6\"><em>G.

There may be strong reasons why one should have it rather than another. To be divested of his estate may be a greater injury to one than to another.

Sts. <em>c. </em>103, \u00a7 25, when the premises of which partition is demanded cannot be divided without damage to the owners, the whole estate \u201c may be set off to any one of the parties, who will accept it, he paying to any one or more of the others such sums of money as the commissioners shall award, to make the partition just and equal.\u201d This statute confers upon the commissioners full power to determine whether the estate can be divided without damage to the owners, and, if not, to which of the owners it shall be assigned, paying such sums by way of owelty as may be fixed by the commissioners. The objection that the respondents had no opportunity to be heard is not well founded; for the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sioners had authority to hear them, and, in the absence of anything appearing on the record to show the contrary, it is to be presumed that they did hear all parties upon every matter within their jurisdiction. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
