But <em>Briggs, </em>J. ruled that upon this evidence the action could be maintained, and a verdict was taken for the plaintiff for the amount of the tax and interest. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-10\"><em>B. Sanford, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A14\">1. The evidence did not show that the clerk of the district certified truly to the assessors the vote of the district for raising by tax the sum of money voted at the district meeting. Rev. Sts. c. 23, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-11\">2. The money was received by the collector as collector and not as treasurer, and the presumption is that he holds it as collector until he actually applies it to the use of the town, or as treasurer pays it over to the committee authorized to receive it, or renders his annual account. Rev. Sts. c. 15, \u00a7 64. But whether received by him as treasurer or collector of the town, he is not, in either capacity, the defendants\u2019 agent; but must account to the town for the money which he receives ; and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>pay it, not to the district, but to a committee, to be by them applied to specified purposes. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>15, \u00a7 64; c. 23, \u00a7 39. There is no evidence that the defendants bad such a committee to receive it or who did receive it, or that the money has ever been applied to the defendants\u2019 benefit. <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>School District in </em>Egremont, 3 Cush. 571, 573.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-5\"><em>G. I. </em>Reed, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b498-6\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ain\">It seems to be conceded that this tax was illegally assessed upon the plaintiff, the meeting of the school district not having been notified properly. The only question raised therefore is of the liability of the school district to a member of the district for the money that he has paid upon an illegal tax, under the circumstances stated in the bill of exceptions. The money was paid to the town collector and treasurer. But such person acts in this matter as the agent of the school district. The receipt of the money as collector, where the two offices of collector and treasurer are united in the same person,' is to be taken to be a receipt of the money by the town treasurer. This money is properly the money of the school district, and the treasurer of the town holds it as the agent of the school district. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>23, \u00a7 39. <em>Perry </em>v. Dover, 12 Pick. 206. <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>School District in </em>Egremont, 3 Cush. 573. The action was therefore properly brought against the school district, they having the money subject to their order and control in the hands of an agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">An1 objection was taken at the argument of this case, that it did not appear upon the evidence that the clerk of the district certified truly to the assessors the vote of the district for raising the tax. Waiving any question as to this point being now open to the defendants, we think it does not affect the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. Although it might subject the assessors to an individual liability, if no such certificate was filed with them, yet it does not render the tax less illegal, nor justify the school district in retaining the money collected on the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
