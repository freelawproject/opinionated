It is no excuse for not doing this that the declaration alleges that \u201c the defendant wrongfully, wilfully and without right\u201d dug and excavated a sluice way or ditch along the line of the highway and near the dwelling-house of the plaintiff, thereby injuring the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling-house. Such form of declaring does not require the plaintiff to prove as a part of his case in the first instance that the same was not done by a surveyor of highways, acting under the written appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>bation of the selectmen of the town. The proof of the acts set forth in the declaration, and the alleged injury to the plaintiff thereby, would require of the defendant to justify, if he would maintain his defence. Such justification or substantive defence should be stated in his answer. He not having done so, but merely filed a general denial of \u201c each and every allegation contained in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration,\u201d has no right upon these pleadings to justify his acts under any authority derived from a surveyor of highways. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
