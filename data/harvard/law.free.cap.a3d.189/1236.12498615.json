The ODC also charged Mr. Beauregard with filing an inaccurate 2015 Certificate of Compliance. After a hearing, a panel of the Board submitted a Report and Recommendation finding that Mr. Beauregard violated Delaware Lawyers' Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 5.3(c), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). The Panel recommended a public reprimand and a two-year probation with conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Beauregard did not file objections to the Report and Recommendation. The ODC filed objections, claiming the Board erred by considering Mr. Beauregard's mental state for what the ODC argues are strict liability offenses, and misinterpreted Rules 1.15(a) and 8.4(c) leading to erroneous conclusions for several of the alleged books and records violations. The ODC also objected to the Board's recommended sanction. According to the ODC, after considering Mr. Beauregard's earlier public reprimand for similar violations and his knowledge of the current violations, suspension for not less than one year, instead of a public reprimand, is the proper sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With the exceptions explained later, we accept the Board's findings regarding violations of Rules 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 5.3(c), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). The record supports the Board's conclusion that Mr. Beauregard, as the managing partner of his law firm: (a) did not exercise reasonable supervision over non-lawyer employees charged with keeping the law firm's books and records; (b) knew of books and records violations and did not take reasonable action to correct them; and (c) incorrectly certified in 2015 his law firm's compliance with the rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As for the ODC's objections, first, we agree with the ODC that Rule 1.15, does not contain a state of mind requirement. But, we agree with the Board that, in Mr. Beauregard's case, he supervised non-lawyers managing the law firm's accounting functions. Under Rule 5.3, he is responsible for Rule 1.15 recordkeeping violations\n   when, as the supervising lawyer, he fails to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the non-lawyers performing accounting functions comply with the rules. Further, as a supervising lawyer who knows of books and records rule violations and fails to take reasonable remedial action to correct errors, he violates Rule 5.3 and is responsible for the law firm's Rule 1.15 violations. Mr. Beauregard failed on both fronts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We also agree with the ODC that, under Rule 1.15(a), Mr. Beauregard failed to safeguard client property as provided by the Rule. Although the Board's interpretation of the rule-that \"other property\" does not include client funds-is not unreasonable, we believe that the Rule, when read as a whole, includes as violations a lawyer's or law firm's failure to account for all client funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As for Rule 8.4(c) -engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation-and 8.4(d)-conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice-we agree with the ODC that the Rule's focus is on conduct. But, under Rule 8.4(c) the conduct involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, all words that imply a state of mind requirement. Rule 8.4(d), however, does not require any specific underlying conduct or imply a state of mind. Thus, we agree with the Board's findings that Mr. Beauregard knew when he signed and submitted a Certificate of Compliance containing inaccuracies, he violated Rule 8.4(c). Mr. Beauregard also violated Rule 8.4(d) when he filed the inaccurate Certificate of Compliance with the Court, regardless of his state of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   And finally, following our independent review, we agree with the ODC that suspension is the presumptive sanction and should be imposed instead of a public reprimand. We impose a six-month suspension with conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court accepts the facts as found by the Board, most of which were undisputed. Admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1986, Mr. Beauregard practices primarily as a criminal defense attorney in Kent and Sussex Counties. He represents private clients and those assigned to him by the Office of Defense Services when conflicts arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2005, Mr. Beauregard, as the managing partner of his prior law firm, admitted violating Rules 1.15(a), 1.15(b), 1.15(c), 5.3, and 8.4(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like here, Mr. Beauregard failed to maintain real estate account records, failed to supervise nonlawyer employees, and filed inaccurate certificates of compliance with the Court. The Court reprimanded Mr. Beauregard publicly and imposed a three-year probation period with conditions. In 2008, Mr. Beauregard completed his probationary period successfully, and the ODC closed the 2005 disciplinary complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Beauregard formed a new law firm in 2012, Brown, Shiels &amp; Beauregard, LLC, and served as its managing partner. Having been through the earlier disciplinary proceedings, Mr. Beauregard knew that he was required to keep the law firm's records in compliance with Rule 1.15, and that he was responsible to report compliance with Rule 1.15 accurately on the law\n   firm's annual Certificate of Compliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, having been sanctioned previously for errors by non-lawyer employees responsible for keeping the firm's financial records, he understood his supervisory responsibility to ensure these employees complied with Rule 1.15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At his new firm, Mr. Beauregard employed Joseph O'Donnell, who had a Ph.D. in business administration and previously worked at other law firms. Mr. O'Donnell was responsible for the firm's accounting records, except for the real estate accounts. Even though Mr. Beauregard knew the importance of Rule 1.15 recordkeeping requirements and the need to supervise non-lawyer employees performing accounting functions, he only generally reviewed Rule 1.15 with Mr. O'Donnell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beauregard did review on a monthly basis the client subsidiary records for the firm's trust accounts, which listed the funds allocated to over sixty clients. That review could not have been done with any precision, however, because each month from November 2014 to April 2015, these records showed negative balances for four to five clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beauregard discussed these negative client balances with Mr. O'Donnell, who stated that they were a \"glitch in the program,\" but that they \"had nothing to do with money being missing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beauregard did, however, identify them as \"red flags\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   but did not investigate them further. Mr. O'Donnell later testified that he investigated the negative balances and found \"they were actually overpayments made, and we had money that had to be taken back from the client.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Beauregard hired Luke O'Brien to manage the law firm's books and records for the firm's real estate account,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and retained Thomas Sombar, CPA, to handle the firm's tax filings. Mr. Beauregard asked Mr. Sombar to perform a precertification audit for the 2015 Certificate of Compliance, but Mr. Sombar declined, explaining he had not taken a necessary course.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beauregard did not seek a precertification audit from anyone else. On February 25, 2015, he filed a 2015 Certificate of Compliance with this Court, certifying that his law firm's books and records complied with Rule 1.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In March 2015, a client filed a complaint with the ODC because she received two $1,000 checks from Mr. Beauregard's firm\n   attempting to refund a $1,000 balance remaining on a retainer. Upon receiving the complaint, Mr. Beauregard suspended Mr. O'Donnell and hired two new bookkeepers to audit the books. They found that no money was missing and that there were sufficient other funds in the account to cover the negative balances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In September 2015, the Lawyers' Fund conducted a Rule 1.15 compliance audit of the law firm's books and records. The report from the Fund's accountant found thirteen instances of noncompliance:\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) Multiple client balances included earned fees and expense reimbursements the firm should have removed, and two accounts were incorrectly identified as Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (\"IOLTA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) The firm failed to list a non-fiduciary account that had closed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (3) The firm did not maintain all books and records necessary for a non-fiduciary and a real estate account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (4) The general ledger balance for a non-fiduciary account did not match the monthly adjusted bank balance;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (5) A closed non-fiduciary account was incorrectly titled;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (6) The firm did not prepare monthly bank reconciliations for a closed non-fiduciary account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (7) A fiduciary account was not an IOLTA account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (8) A check drawn from a fiduciary account was outstanding for over two years;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (9) A fiduciary account's end-of-month cash balance did not match the total client funds held;\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (10) A fiduciary account had negative client balances each month;\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (11) A fiduciary account had multiple old balances, some of which were earned fees and expense reimbursements the firm should have removed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (12) The real estate account did not have monthly bank reconciliations; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (13) The real estate account did not have monthly client listings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the audit, Mr. Beauregard addressed the deficiencies, hired an in-house and an outside bookkeeper, upgraded the firm's accounting software, increased the time spent supervising the non-lawyer employees, and hired an accounting firm to complete Rule 1.15 compliance audits quarterly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Following the Rule 1.15 compliance audit, the ODC filed a petition for discipline on September 7, 2016, alleging that Mr. Beauregard violated Rules 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 5.3, 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). Mr. Beauregard admitted to violating Rule 1.15 as to certain inaccuracies revealed in the 2015 Audit, but denied the remaining charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Board held a combined liability and sanction hearing on March 23, 2017. After finding that the parties appeared to agree that none of the rules Mr. Beauregard allegedly violated provide for strict liability, but instead require a state of mind of negligence or worse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Board made the\n   following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 1.15(a)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Beauregard did not violate Rule 1.15(a) as to the negative account balances, because client funds do not fall within the definition of \"other property\" that must be safeguarded under Rule 1.15(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Board found that \"[a] negative client balance ledger ... does not mean that the funds of the particular client with the negative balance have not been safeguarded.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, because Mr. Beauregard did not misuse the funds, he did not violate Rule 1.15(a) due to the negative balances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Beauregard violated Rule 1.15(a) by failing to prepare monthly client listings and

<blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Beauregard violated Rule 1.15(d)(12)(D) because the end-of-month cash balance did not agree with the total client funds held in the time period reviewed, of

 </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Board next addressed sanctions using the framework from the American Bar Association's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board found Mr. Beauregard violated Rules 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 5.3(c), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d), acting knowingly by failing to remove the earned fees and expense reimbursements from the fiduciary account, and negligently in all other respects. As to injury, the Board found the inaccurate Certificate of Compliance caused actual injury to the legal system, but found the Rule 1.15 violations did not cause actual or potential injury because the law firm had sufficient funds to cover the negative balances. In considering aggravating factors, the Board found that Mr. Beauregard's prior discipline and substantial experience counted against him; however, the Board found the prior discipline was dissimilar and remote in time from the current conduct. The Board also considered the mitigating factors of Mr. Beauregard's lack of a dishonest motive, good faith effort to remedy the violations, cooperation and full disclosure with the Board, and positive character evidence. The Board concluded that a public reprimand and two-year probation with various conditions was the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We review the Board's factual findings to determine whether the record contains substantial evidence to support those findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board's conclusions of law are reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   After our independent review, we find the Board's factual findings are supported by the record, as are the Board's ultimate conclusions that Mr. Beauregard violated Rules 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 5.3(c), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). Thus, we accept the Board's recommendations regarding rule violations. Although we have accepted the Board's violation findings in this difficult case, we agree with the ODC that the Board erred in some respects, as explained next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In its Report and Recommendation, the Board found that \"[n]one of these Rules provides for strict liability, each requires a\n   state of mind of negligence or worse.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, each of the Rule violations charged in the proceeding required the Board to assess Mr. Beauregard's state of mind before finding a violation. The ODC objects to this conclusion, claiming that unless a Rule has an express state of mind requirement, the default standard is strict liability-meaning a Rule has been violated regardless of the respondent's mental state. According to the ODC, a respondent's state of mind is relevant only to the sanction imposed, not to whether a rule violation has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We understand the Board's confusion about the issue, given what the Board thought was agreement by the parties on the state of mind issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the absence of a mental state requirement in some of our rules implies a strict liability standard for those rules has not been addressed by our Court and is the subject of debate under the Model Rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we have as a reference the commentary and reports accompanying the rules at both the national and state levels, the best that can be gleaned from those resources is the purposeful addition of a state of mind requirement to some rules, and its absence from others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lacking pre-adoption guidance on the state of mind issue, we look to the plain language of each rule\n   and interpret the rules as \"rules of reason\" and \"with reference to the purposes of legal representation and of the law itself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Rules 1.15, 5.3, 8.4, and State of Mind\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Rule 1.15 requires a lawyer to protect client property through detailed books and records requirements. As noted in the comments to Rule 1.15, \"[a] lawyer should hold property of others with the care required of a professional fiduciary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Rule's purpose is plain-to put financial recordkeeping requirements in place that track to the penny all funds and property received and disbursed by the lawyer or law firm, and to ensure that client funds are accounted for and kept separate from all other funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Rule 1.15 does not have a mental state requirement. But, that does not mean that every technical violation merits the ODC's involvement or a disciplinary proceeding. In a case like this, when a lawyer did not keep the books and records but instead hired a non-lawyer to perform the function, Rule 5.3 must be read with Rule 1.15. Under Rule 5.3, Responsibilities Regarding Non-Lawyer Assistants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (a) a partner in a law firm, and a lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable managerial authority in a law firm, shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (b) a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (c) a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of such a person that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if: (1) the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or (2) the lawyer is a partner or has comparable managerial authority in the law firm in which the person is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the person, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated\n   but fails to take reasonable remedial action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Rule 5.3 contains \"reasonable\" and \"reasonableness\" standards of care, as well as a \"knowing\" state of mind requirement. Our Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Bailey\n   </em>\n   explained how these standards of care and state of mind bear on the supervising lawyer's responsibilities: \"Although a managing partner cannot guarantee absolutely the integrity of the firms books and records, it is the managing partner's responsibility to implement reasonable safeguards to ensure that the firm is meeting its obligations with respect to books and records.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, when there has been a \"sustained and systematic failure\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   by a managing partner to supervise a firm's employees to ensure compliance with Rule 1.15, such conduct \"may not be characterized as simple negligence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, when a supervising lawyer fails to meet their obligations under Rule 5.3, and books and records violations have been proven under Rule 1.15, the supervising lawyer is responsible for those violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Board properly took into account Mr. Beauregard's state of mind to decide whether, as managing partner, he put reasonable supervisory procedures in place or knew of violations and took prompt remedial actions to ensure the violations were corrected. We agree with the Board's conclusion that Mr. Beauregard was at least negligent in overseeing Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. O'Brien to ensure the books and records were maintained in compliance with Rule 1.15, and that he knew of Rule 1.15 violations due to the negative balances in the account and failed to take prompt remedial action to correct them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Board correctly found that Mr. Beauregard violated Rule 5.3(c) and Rule 1.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Turning to Rule 8.4(c) and (d), they do not contain express state of mind requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The ODC argues that the Rule's focus is on conduct, and not state of mind. As to Rule 8.4(c), however, this distinction is one without a difference. The specific conduct referred to in Rule 8.4(c) -dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation-implies a state of mind requirement. In other words, a lawyer knows that their conduct is something other than truthful, accurate, or forthright, but engages in the conduct anyway. Here, the Board found that Mr. Beauregard knew of rule violations, but nonetheless filed an inaccurate 2015 Certificate of Compliance with the Court. Thus, the Board properly found\n   that Mr. Beauregard violated Rule 8.4(c) by making misrepresentations to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In contrast, Rule 8.4(d) focuses purely on the conduct, and not any specific underlying deceptive activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, state of mind does not enter into a rule violation under Rule 8.4(d). Mr. Beauregard's conduct-submitting a 2015 Certificate of Compliance containing misrepresentations-violated Rule 8.4(c) and (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In summary, by violating Rule 5.3, Mr. Beauregard is responsible for the law firm's Rule 1.15 violations-failing to prepare monthly client listings and reconciliations; failing to reconcile the end-of-month cash balances with total client funds; failing to address the negative client balances; failing to remove earned fees and expenses from fiduciary accounts; incorrectly titling an operating account; and failing to reconcile the operating account's general ledger balance with the monthly bank statement balance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beauregard also violated Rule 8.4(c) and (d) by filing with the Court a Certificate of Compliance that misrepresented the law firm's compliance with Rule 1.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Rule 1.15(a) and Client Funds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Under Rule 1.15(a), a lawyer must \"safeguard\" a client's property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Rule 1.15. Safekeeping property\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property. Funds shall be kept\n   in a separate account designated solely for funds held in connection with the practice of law in this jurisdiction. Such funds shall be maintained in the state in which the lawyer's office is situated, or elsewhere with the consent of the client or third person. Funds of the lawyer that are reasonably sufficient to pay bank charges may be deposited therein; however, such amount may not exceed $1,000 and must be separately stated and accounted for in the same manner as clients' funds deposited therein. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after the completion of the events that they record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Board parsed the language of the statute and focused on the specific sentence referring to \"other property\" and \"appropriately safeguard[ing]\" that other property. According to the Board, the safeguarding qualifier of that sentence refers only to \"other property,\" and \"other property\" refers to property other than client funds. Thus, the Board concluded, Mr. Beauregard did not violate Rule 1.15(a) because he only failed to safeguard client funds-not \"other property\" of his clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Board's interpretation of the rule is not unreasonable. But, we think it focuses too narrowly on the one sentence and gives insufficient weight to the subsection read as a whole. The title of the Rule is \"Safekeeping Property,\" which does not differentiate between money and other property of clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Rule's requirements-to hold money separate from the lawyer's own property; maintain the funds in the state where the lawyer's office is situated or elsewhere by consent; and keep complete records for a period of five years-are all aimed at safeguarding both client funds and other property. We have long held that a lawyer or law firm fails to safeguard a client's funds when he fails to comply with Rule 1.15(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Further, even though the Board found that funds were available from other sources sufficient to fill the hole left by the\n   negative balances, this Court has never treated funds in a lawyer's or law firm's trust account as fungible. The covering funds relied on by the Board should not have been considered a substitute for negative balances in the client subsidiary ledger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each client account is treated as a separate account, even if the funds are commingled in a trust account. The law firm had a duty of safeguarding its clients' property-including funds-by complying with Rule 1.15(a), and it failed to do so. As a managing partner who failed to supervise non-attorney employees, Mr. Beauregard is responsible for those deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We turn to the Board's recommended discipline of a public reprimand with conditions. The Board considered the four factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Bailey\n   </em>\n   using the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions: (a) the ethical duty violated; (b) the lawyer's mental state; (c) the actual or potential injury caused; and (d) aggravating and mitigating factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Beauregard violated Rules 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 5.3(c), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Beauregard acted knowingly in failing to remove the earned fees and expense reimbursements from the fiduciary account and acted negligently in all other respects;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Beauregard filed an inaccurate Certificate of Compliance that caused \"actual injury to the legal system because the Supreme Court relies on their accuracy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, the Board also found that there was no actual or potential injury because \"the Firm always had sufficient funds on hand to cover any client obligations,\" and thus there was \"no evidence that any clients were ever at risk of their funds being unavailable\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \u2022 Mitigating factors existed-Mr. Beauregard's lack of dishonest or selfish motive, timely and good faith effort to rectify the violations, full and free disclosure to the ODC, cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, favorable character and reputation evidence, and the remoteness of the prior offenses;\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \u2022 Aggravating factors existed-Mr. Beauregard's prior discipline and substantial experience.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Although the Board took into account Mr. Beauregard's prior discipline, the Board found that Mr. Beauregard successfully completed his probation, his prior violations were remote in time, and \"his current conduct falls very far short of the kind of conduct that warranted suspension\" in comparative cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Board concluded that the appropriate sanction was a public reprimand and two-year probation with conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Supreme Court has the inherent and exclusive authority to discipline members of the Bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Board's recommendation is valued and helpful, we are not bound by it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In determining an appropriate sanction, this Court must 'protect the interests of the public and the [B]ar while giving due consideration to the interests of the individual involved.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Disciplinary proceedings are not intended to be punitive. Instead, the primary purpose is \"to protect the public\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to \"foster public confidence in the Bar, to preserve the integrity of the profession, and to deter other lawyers from similar misconduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Of significant weight in determining the appropriate sanction ... is the impact the chosen sanction will have on the preservation of the integrity of the Bar and the public's perception of the Bar.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   When fixing a sanction, we are guided by the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and our prior precedents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   After considering the first three factors, we decide the presumptive sanction. Mitigating and aggravating factors are then considered to determine whether we should depart from the presumptive sanction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In its Report and Recommendation, the Board identified the ethical duties violated (Rules 1.15, 5.3, and 8.4) and characterized Mr. Beauregard's mental state as \"knowing\" for permitting earned fees and expense reimbursements to remain in the\n   law firm's trust account, but negligent for the other violations. We agree with the ODC that the Board took too narrow a view of Mr. Beauregard's overall mental state for the books and records violations and his inaccurate certificate of compliance. Under the ABA Standards, \"knowledge\" is \"the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the conduct but without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we said in\n   <em>\n    In re Bailey\n   </em>\n   , knowing conduct can be inferred from the circumstances because a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of their actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lawyers cannot stick their heads in the sand and blind themselves to their professional obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Here, Mr. Beauregard was previously disciplined for substantially the same books and records violations, and thus should have been in a hyper-vigilant state when he assumed the same supervisory responsibilities at his new law firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears from the record that he did not train his non-lawyer staff properly to comply with the Rule 1.15 requirements, never verified compliance of the law firm's real estate account with Rule 1.15, and, after becoming aware of problems with the fiduciary account balances, took feeble and ineffective steps to bring the account into compliance. Thus, under the overall circumstances, we find Mr. Beauregard acted with a knowing state of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We also agree with the ODC that the Board should have given more weight to the potential injury Mr. Beauregard's violations could have caused the legal system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Books and records violations create a serious risk of harm to clients, third parties, and the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   The inaccurate\n   certificate of compliance, Mr. Beauregard's disregard for negative balances that had been called to his attention, a neglected real estate trust account, and books and records managed by non-lawyers with inadequate training on recordkeeping requirements all contributed to a serious risk of harm to clients and the public. Under ABA Standard 4.12, absent aggravating and mitigating circumstances, \"[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Because Mr. Beauregard knew or should have known that he was \"dealing improperly with client property,\" which created potential injury to his clients, we find suspension from the practice of law the presumptive sanction under ABA Standard 4.12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   And given Mr. Beauregard's prior discipline for substantially the same violations, a presumptive sanction of suspension is especially warranted when ABA Standard 8.2 is also considered. Under this standard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer has been reprimanded for the same or similar misconduct and engages in further acts of misconduct that cause injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Board considered the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to increase or decrease the degree of discipline to be imposed. As aggravating circumstances, the Board found Mr. Beauregard's prior disciplinary offenses and substantial experience in the practice of law. In mitigation, the Board found Mr. Beauregard's lack of a dishonest or selfish motive, remedial action taken before and after receiving the 2015 Audit Report, and cooperative attitude with the ODC and its investigation. The Board also placed substantial emphasis on the remoteness of Mr. Beauregard's prior offenses as a mitigating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Although we agree with most of the Board's aggravating and mitigating factors, we place less emphasis on the remoteness of his prior disciplinary offenses. As the ODC points out, there was only a four-year period between Mr. Beauregard's completion of his disciplinary probation period and the misconduct leading to the violations in this proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is\n   hard to imagine remoteness in time to be a factor in repetitive books and records violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   The recent violations were not minor recordkeeping errors by subordinates. Client escrow funds were mismanaged. The real estate trust account was neglected and lacked client subsidiary ledgers to track specific client funds. Thus, in our view, the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, and under the ABA Standards, the presumptive sanction of suspension should be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Our disciplinary cases are consistent with this result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Bailey\n   </em>\n   , this Court suspended the respondent for six months for various books and records and tax violations. The Court emphasized the \"enhanced duties\" of a managing partner \"to ensure the law firm's compliance with its recordkeeping and tax obligations,\" which he must discharge \"faithfully and with the utmost diligence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that \"the Firm's operating account was repeatedly in an overdraft condition,\" and \"[the respondent], as the managing partner, knew or should have known\" about the violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concluded that the respondent showed a \"sustained and systematic failure\" to supervise his employees and oversee the books and records, resulting in potential harm to his clients and the legal profession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court imposed a six-month suspension, even though the respondent had no disciplinary record, made extensive remedial efforts, and cooperated with the proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Nowak\n   </em>\n   , this Court suspended an attorney for one year for failing to safeguard client funds, maintain books and records, supervise non-lawyer employees, and for filing inaccurate Certificates of Compliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that Nowak's books and records violations continued even after he was alerted to the violations-supporting the finding of a \"sustained and systematic failure\" to exercise diligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court found that \"[w]hen a lawyer (as is the case here) knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client property and causing injury or potential injury to a client, suspension is generally appropriate under the ABA Standards.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though Nowak\n   did not have any disciplinary history, the Court imposed a one year suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Subject to the condition stated below, Mr. Beauregard is suspended from the practice of law for six months beginning July 2, 2018.

The ODC has also challenged the Board's findings that Mr. Beauregard did not know about a client check that had been outstanding for over two years, as well as a separate bank account that was not disclosed in the law firm's certificate of compliance, and therefore he could not be held responsible for those errors. Although the Board's findings on these issues are not material to the outcome of this proceeding, we note that the reasonable care requirement of Rule 5.3 extends to a pre-filing detailed review and discussion with the law firm's accounting professionals to ensure that the law firm's certificate of compliance is accurate. It is possible that a detailed review would have alerted Mr. Beauregard to these issues, and he could have taken prompt remedial action to correct them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"53\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Del.
