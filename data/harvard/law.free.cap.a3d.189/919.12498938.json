This Ordinance enables the Borough of Belmar to finance the project while obtaining reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

This Ordinance was unanimously approved by Belmar Mayor and Council on July 7, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs DeSanctis and Bean first learned of the interpretive statement on September 9, 2015; that day Bean expressed to the\n   County Clerk his concern about information in the interpretive statement. The County Clerk replied to him on September 17 that she did \"not believe there is any legal recourse at this point as to the explanation [in the interpretive statement] in terms of changing the ballot\"; the County Clerk mailed those ballots to the public the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit on September 22, 2015 seeking judgment declaring the interpretive statement invalid because it was never voted on by the Mayor and Council, thereby depriving plaintiffs and the public an opportunity to comment on and object to its content, which contained \"inaccurate, misleading and extraneous information,\" presenting another ground for invalidation. They also sought removal of the interpretive statement-in whole or part-from the ballot; and a determination of their claim under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act (CRA), N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 to -2, including a request for attorneys' fees and costs. We perpend Judge Katie A. Gummer's rulings on these issues, which arise from a series of orders that: (1) held the interpretive\n   statement invalid because it was not submitted to the Mayor and Council for resolution and no such resolution was made, and because it was misleading and contained extraneous information intended to influence-not inform-voters; (2) held defendants violated the CRA by depriving plaintiffs a free and fair election, thus entitling plaintiffs to attorneys' fees and costs; and (3) awarded attorneys' fees and costs and prohibited payment from the Borough of Belmar's Beach Utility Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Gummer found persuasive the holding in\n   <em>\n    Town of Harrison Board of Education v.

If the Legislature, under N.J.S.A. 19:14-31, granted the Attorney General the discretion to decide if a summary statement should be provided to the public-and if so, the wording of that statement-the Court saw \"no reason why the Legislature would have intended a different procedure in the case of [a] brief interpretive statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=438%20A.2d%20519\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court specifically excluded the Secretary of State as an alternate interpretive statement author, concluding the Legislature invested no similar authority as that conferred on the Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=438%20A.2d%20519\">\n    438 A.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the Attorney General may do so when an interpretive statement is mandated, that authority is derived from the statutory framework pertinent only to that scenario. And the Attorney General may act only when the Legislature declines.\n   <em>\n    Kimmelman v.
