Here, we return to the often-complicated question of exceptional circumstances in the context of terminating parental rights (\"TPR\") under Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-323 of the Family Law Article (\"FL\"). We consider if, when assessing whether exceptional circumstances exist that make continuing the parental relationship detrimental to a child's best interests, a juvenile court errs by considering custody-specific factors used to\n   determine exceptional circumstances in third-party custody disputes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

(\"Mother\"), an 18-year-old former CINA\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and M.W. (\"Father\"). Father had been convicted in Connecticut seven years earlier of sexual assault in the first degree and\n   was released in 2009. Four months before H.W. was born, Father was extradited from Maryland to Connecticut and incarcerated there. Father was released in January 2013 and remained in Connecticut on probation. He has never seen H.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2012, Mother left H.W. unattended during a bath. When she returned, she found him face down in the water. H.W. was hospitalized and on life support for two weeks. In December 2012, H.W. was found to be a CINA and was placed in Mother's care under an Order of Protective Supervision. Some months later, the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (\"Department\") sought emergency removal of H.W. from the home, which a juvenile court granted. In July 2013, H.W. was returned to Mother's care under another Order of Protective Supervision, which was rescinded in December 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mother gave birth to twins, H.J. (\"Brother\") and H.J. (\"Sister\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in January 2014. In June 2014, Mother was bathing\n   Brother in the kitchen sink under running water. Sister was in her car seat in a different room with a bottle. Sister began choking and Mother left Brother unattended to respond. When Mother returned to the kitchen, she discovered that Brother had suffered severe burns. He was hospitalized for nearly a month. The Department promptly filed Petitions with Requests for Shelter Care for all three children, which the juvenile court granted. H.W. and Sister were placed in a foster home belonging to Mr. and Mrs. M. on June 20, 2014. After being discharged from the hospital, Brother was placed in a separate foster home to address his specific medical needs, but he eventually joined H.W. and Sister at the M. home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   All three children were declared CINA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time H.W. was removed, he had a healed burn on the side of his forehead. Mother told the Department caseworker that H.W. had run into a lit cigarette while playing. Mother reported that she contacted his pediatrician, who advised her to put Vaseline on the burn, but sought no other medical attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lori Lee, H.W.'s caseworker, attempted to locate Father in July 2014 and received information that he was incarcerated in Kentucky. She sent a letter to him but received no response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In late 2014, while on probation in Connecticut, Father learned that H.W. was in the State's custody, through either a summons or a letter from Lee. Father obtained permission to travel to Baltimore for a CINA hearing in December 2014. Mother introduced Lee to Father the morning of the hearing. Father had thought the hearing was in the morning and he wanted to visit H.W. When Lee explained that the hearing was scheduled for the afternoon, Father informed Lee that he would not be able to stay because he had to return to\n   Connecticut. Lee told Father why H.W. was in the State's care, and that she would like for him to visit with H.W. Father indicated that he would speak with his probation officer, so he could return to Baltimore to visit with H.W. Father, however, did not immediately return to Connecticut. Instead, he left the courthouse with Mother and made alternate travel arrangements to leave the\n   next day. He did not attend the December 2014 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2015, Lee had a phone conversation with Father's probation officer while Father was present. Father wanted to attend an upcoming hearing and his probation officer indicated that she and Father would discuss whether or not he would receive permission to do so. Later that month, Lee sent a letter to Father's probation officer providing additional information about the hearing. She did not receive a response and Father did not attend the hearing. Lee sent additional letters to Father in July and August, notifying him of upcoming hearings and enclosing copies of court orders. She invited Father to contact her to \"discuss any questions you may have regarding [H.W.] and [to] schedule visits.\" Lee did not receive a response. In August 2015, Father was incarcerated again for violating his probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Father wrote Lee a letter in October 2015, notifying her of his incarceration. He identified an aunt and his brothers as relative resources for H.W. He included contact information for his aunt and mother, but not for his brothers. Father expressed that he wanted to be in H.W.'s life. He claimed that his probation officer had refused to allow him to attend hearings in Maryland. Father had \"requested to be sentenced to prison in pursuit of no more probation, which will allow [him] to relocate back to Baltimore ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Father explained that he had difficulty communicating with Mother by phone but occasionally reached her through social media. He stated that Mother became \"stubborn and withdrawn when [he] asked of [H.W.]'s whereabouts.\" Father also asked Lee for resources, \"I don't know what you can do for [H.W.] and I, but I am sincerely asking for your help for our unity?\" Father anticipated being \"incarcerated for approximately\n   2 y[ea]rs\" but hoped that \"you and your department have left me some options as [H.W.]'s father.\" He asked Lee to send \"any information about the progress that has been made with [H.W.]'s placement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lee investigated Father's aunt, who passed her fingerprint and background checks. When Lee contacted the aunt about completing a home inspection, she declined to be a resource. Rather, she was willing to be \"a back-up plan to [the Department's] back-up plan\" and thought it best that H.W. remain with his foster family. Lee sent Father a letter in November 2015 notifying him of this development and informing him that his brothers had not contacted her regarding H.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lee explained that H.W.'s foster family was willing and able to adopt him, and that H.W. was having behavioral issues. She also advised Father of an upcoming hearing in December and asked him to contact her if his situation changed, or if he had other relatives the Department could investigate. Between March and November 2016, Lee sent Father six more letters with copies of court orders concerning H.W. Father did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In October 2015, the Department filed a Petition for Guardianship with the Right to Consent to Adoption or Long Term Care Short of Adoption for H.W. Father and Mother objected, but later consented. Father, however, withdrew his consent and the matter proceeded to a contested hearing in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    The TPR Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lee testified at the hearing, describing her meeting with Father in 2014, subsequent attempts at communication with him, and her investigation of Father's aunt. Lee acknowledged that Father had been under legal constraints since before H.W. went into care. During her testimony,\n   she also described H.W.'s placement with the M. family and her monthly visits with the children. H.W. had some special needs relating to behavioral problems and had been diagnosed with ADHD. He was receiving treatment and the M. family worked with him through therapy. The M. family was in contact with Mother through phone and e-mail.\n   Lee testified that H.W. is emotionally attached to Mr. and Mrs. M., and calls them PopPop and Mommy. H.W.'s twin siblings are also placed with the M. family and H.W. has bonded with them-\"truly a big brother.\" Lee stated that she had no concerns about H.W.'s care and opined that it would be detrimental to H.W. to remove him from the M. home because of his emotional attachments and because it would \"set him backwards in his treatment, the therapy that he's been going through for his behavioral problems.\" Lee recommended that Mr. and Mrs. M. adopt H.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Father testified by phone from the Brooklyn Correctional Facility in Connecticut, where he was serving a 30-month sentence for violating his probation. During his testimony, Father explained that Mother did not contact him after he was extradited from Maryland in 2011. He had sporadic contact with Mother and, although he always asked to speak to H.W. during phone calls, this rarely happened. Mother did not share much information about H.W. with him, and on at least one occasion, they argued about money. Father explained that his probation officer had denied him permission to attend other hearings for H.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Father had several probation violations and had tested positive for marijuana. He explained that since he had been in Connecticut, \"the majority of [his] situation has been homelessness,\" and that he had not been able to provide for himself. Father had been employed during his probation with a fast food restaurant and with a printing company. In early 2014 he sent money to his brother, who babysat H.W., for \"Pampers, ... for food, for a haircut, things like that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Father's mandatory release date was in February 2018, but he anticipated release as early as November or December 2017 based on earned credits. Upon release, he would no longer be subject to probation conditions. He testified that he enrolled in a program called \"Good Intentions[,] Bad Choices\" but that no other programs had been recommended to, or required of him. He had been referred to programs during his probation, including a drug treatment program, which he had\n   not completed. Father did not think he needed counseling, explaining that he writes in his journal and has been doing his own reading to educate himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After release, Father planned to come to Baltimore and obtain custody of H.W. Although most of Father's family is in Baltimore, he did not have any resources identified in Baltimore-he was not in \"re-entry stage\" to \"transition back into society\" yet. He was unsure where he would live in Baltimore but hoped that family might help him. Father admitted that he had \"no support at all.\" He was not sure how long he would stay in Baltimore, but if he did obtain custody of H.W., the maximum he would stay would be five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Father said he would keep H.W. in contact with the twins, and introduce H.W. to his teenage daughter, who lives in Philadelphia with her mother. Father explained that he was changing his life and did not want to give his son away to another family. He testified that he wanted to keep his parental rights because he wanted to be a \"present\" and \"active\" father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    The Juvenile Court's Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The juvenile court considered Lee's and Father's testimony, as well as court orders, H.W.'s medical records, Lee's letters to Father, Father's letter to Lee, and a bonding evaluation between H.W. and the M. family.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Acknowledging the fundamental right of parents, the court also emphasized that the State has an interest in protecting vulnerable children and that the juvenile court must give \"primary consideration to the health and safety of the child and consideration to all other factors needed to determine whether terminating a parent's rights is in the child's best interests ....\" The court then analyzed the statutory factors set forth in FL \u00a7 5-323(d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as\n   well as nine additional factors\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to \"determin[e] whether exceptional circumstances exist[ed]:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1.

The juvenile court found \"by clear and convincing evidence[,] based on the relevant statutory factors[,] that exceptional circumstances exist[ed] to make the continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interests of the child.\" It awarded guardianship to the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals vacated the juvenile court's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption/Guardianship of H.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491032,12314020\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/234/237/\">\n    234 Md.

Based on the differences between a proceeding to terminate parental rights and a custody proceeding, the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that factors relating solely to custody did not belong in a TPR analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491032,12314020\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/234/237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to resolve the following question:\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1. Are juvenile courts permitted to consider custody-specific factors in termination of parental rights proceedings, specifically: (a) the potential emotional effect of the change in custody; (b) the instability and uncertainty of the child's future in the parent's custody; and (c) the stability and certainty of the child's future in the custody of the prospective adoptive parents?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We shall conclude that, when terminating parental rights, a juvenile court must base its assessment on the statutory factors set forth in FL \u00a7 5-323. Consideration of exclusively custodial factors risks blurring important distinctions between parents and third-party custodians. In this case, the juvenile court's inclusion of custody-specific factors did not taint its decision because it made specific findings on each relevant statutory factor and its\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   findings were substantively the same as its more appropriate statutory findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We use three distinct, but interrelated standards to review a juvenile court's decision to terminate parental rights.\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Ta'Niya C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696684\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/90/#p100\">\n    417 Md. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696684\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/90/#p100\">\n    8 A.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

Because the ultimate standard is the child's best interests, they reason that a juvenile court should be free to assess any relevant factors, including custody.

Lee and Father had not discussed service agreements. Father's incarceration made it difficult to offer\n   reunification services, and Father did not testify that he had \"availed himself of any services or programs while incarcerated.\" Because there were no service agreements, the juvenile court was unable to make findings under subsection (d)(1)(iii), regarding the extent to which the Department and Father had fulfilled obligations under any service agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Turning to subsection (d)(2), which assesses \"the results of the parent's effort to adjust the parent's circumstances, condition, or conduct to make it in the child's best interests for the child to be returned to the parent's home,\" the juvenile court considered Father's efforts to maintain regular contact with H.W., the Department, and the M. family.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720370\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/433/50/#p66\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (d)(2)(i). Father has never met H.W. Although Father asked to visit his son when he was at the December 2014 hearing and presumably was available because he stayed an extra day, he chose not to see H.W. Father had \"limited contact\" with the Department and there is no evidence that he had contact with the M. family. The juvenile court also found under subsection (d)(2)(ii) that Father had not provided support to H.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In considering Father's incarceration, the juvenile court observed that TPR proceedings involving an incarcerated parent turn on the specific facts of each case. The court considered precedent demonstrating that lengthier sentences of incarceration may weigh in favor of terminating parental rights, but the ultimate consideration was the best interests of the child. Under subsection (d)(2)(iii), Father's incarceration was not a parental disability, but it impacted H.W.'s wellbeing. Father had been incarcerated or under supervision throughout H.W.'s life, and he would be incarcerated for approximately another year. Although this was \"short term\" incarceration, the court found that Father's incarceration and lack of contact did not serve H.W.'s best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Subsection (d)(2)(iv) requires considering whether additional services are likely to bring about an adjustment \"so that the child could be returned to the parent within an ascertainable time not to exceed 18 months from the date of placement[.]\" A juvenile court may extend that period for an identifiable time\n   upon a specific finding that it is in the child's best interests to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720370\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/433/50/#p66\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The juvenile court found that H.W. had been in the Department's care for almost three years, and Father had been incarcerated, or out of state, and had only minimal contact with the Department. Although Father planned to return to Baltimore and attempt reunification, he would be incarcerated for another year and had no concrete plans or resources available upon his release. The court concluded that it would not be in H.W.'s best interests to leave the case open for an additional year in the hope that Father would come to Baltimore to reunify with H.W. \"The Court can point to no behavior or pattern of the father that would persuade the Court to believe that additional time ... [or] additional services would be likely to bring about a lasting parental adjustment so that the child could be returned to the parent.\"\n   The juvenile court determined that subsections (d)(3)(ii)-(v)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not apply, but concluded that under (d)(3)(i), which considers whether \"the parent has abused or neglected the child or a minor and the seriousness of the abuse or neglect,\" Father had \"responsibility for the supervision of the child[,]\" and his \"inability through his actions that have resulted in incarceration ha[ve] resulted in [n]eglect by omission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   FL \u00a7 5-323(d)(4)(i) requires the juvenile court to assess \"the child's emotional ties with and feelings towards the child's parents, the child's siblings, and others who may affect the child's best interests significantly.\" The court referred to the bonding study with the M. family and observed that H.W. has bonded with his siblings. Although Father said he would keep H.W. in touch with the twins, Father expressed an intention to take H.W. away from Baltimore, which would separate him from his siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Subsection (d)(4)(ii) examines the child's adjustment to the community, home, placement, and school. The juvenile court cited Lee's testimony about H.W.'s current placement and his attachment to the M. family. Subsections (d)(4)(iii) and (iv) look to the effect terminating parental rights would have on the child. In considering H.W.'s feelings about the severance of the parent-child relationship under subsection (d)(4)(iii), the court found that H.W., who was four at the time of the hearing, had never met Father and did not know that Father existed. Applying (d)(4)(iv), the hearing judge concluded that terminating parental rights would impact H.W.'s well-being by permitting him to be \"adopted with [his] siblings by [his] current caregiver ....\" who had cared for him \"for the majority of his 4 years of life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The juvenile court then considered nine additional factors, which it identified as \"[f]actors for determining whether exceptional circumstances existed.\" The juvenile court's finding under the first factor, the \"[l]ength of time [the] child has been away from the biological parent,\" was identical with its finding under subsection (d)(2)(i)-that H.W. has never been in Father's care and Father has never seen H.W. Under the second factor, the \"[a]ge of [the] child when care was assumed by [the] caretakers,\" the court found that H.W. had been placed with the M. family since June 20, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The third factor the court applied was the \"[p]ossible emotional effect on [the] child if custody changed to the biological parent.\" It found that \"[a]ny change that would remove the child from a home that he has only known would more than likely have a detrimental effect\" and that H.W. \"does not know his father ....\" Here, the court was repeating assessments it had already made in analyzing the factors in subsections (d)(4)(ii) and (iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   With regard to the fourth factor, the \"[p]ossible emotional effect on [the] child if custody is given to the caretaker[,]\" the court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   [H.W.] has been in the care of the current caretakers not to[o] long after his birth.... [H.W.] is in the unique\n   position of being placed with his two other siblings in a home that has been characterized as loving.... [He] is bonded to the only parents he has known since birth. Remaining with the\n   current caretakers would continue the positive emotional effect on ... [H.W.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The length of H.W.'s placement with the M. family, the positive nature of his placement and emotional attachment to the M family, and his relationship to his siblings had already been addressed in the court's earlier findings under subsection (d)(4)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The fifth and seventh factors, the time elapsed before Father sought to reclaim H.W., his efforts towards reclamation, as well as the \"intensity and genuineness\" of his desire to have H.W., necessitated examination of facts and circumstances related to Father's efforts under (d)(1)-(2). The juvenile court found that Father \"has stated in a letter and in testimony a desire to have the child but has done nothing further to promote that agenda. Father has shown no genuineness or intensity to have his child.\" Here too, the juvenile court's analysis and findings were consistent with its existing statutory findings. In considering the sixth factor, the \"nature and strength of the ties between [the] child and current caretaker,\" the juvenile court repeated its findings from Lee's testimony about her recent visit to the M. family, which it had already set forth under findings for subsection (d)(4)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Regarding factor eight, the stability and certainty as to H.W.'s future in Father's custody, the juvenile court reiterated its findings under subsections (d)(1)(i)-(ii), regarding Father's incarceration, and that he had not sought any services or programs while incarcerated. The hearing judge also found that Father could be released in a year and intended to come to Baltimore, but he \"does not have any resources in place to provide stability for himself[,] let alone a child.\" Further,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   [t]he father's family in Baltimore is not a resource for him, let alone a child.... Father did not, while on parole, seek any stability. Father could not successfully complete the terms of his probation, which resulted in his current\n   incarceration.... [H.W.'s] stability and certainty ... in [F]ather's care would be one of instability and uncertainty ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The juvenile court had already made these findings under subsection (d)(2)(iv), when it considered whether additional services could bring about a lasting parental adjustment to permit H.W. to return to Father's care. The juvenile court's specific conclusion regarding Father's stability, although not identical to other findings, was consistent with the court's earlier determination that Father had not demonstrated any \"behavior or pattern\" that persuaded the court that \"additional services would be likely to bring about a lasting parental adjustment\" such that he could safely and appropriately care for H.W. within the statutory timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, in considering the ninth factor, the stability and certainty as to H.W.'s future in the custody of the M. family, the juvenile court determined only that \"[H.W.] has gained stability and certainty in the care and custody of the current caretaker and has thrived and progressed under their care.\" This conclusion recycled the juvenile court's previous statutory findings regarding H.W.'s placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As we have explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the focus of the inquiry in a TPR proceeding revolves around whether the\n   <strong>\n    continued parental relationship\n   </strong>\n   is detrimental to the child's best interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rashawn H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/402/477/\">\n    402 Md. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490,5569324\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/937/177/\">\n    937 A.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consequently, the juvenile court examined whether the Department had shown by clear and convincing evidence, exceptional circumstances that rendered a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child. In order to determine whether exceptional circumstances existed, the juvenile court relied on four custody-specific factors which are not expressly stated in \u00a7 5-323(d) and which we have addressed within the context of a child custody action. Those factors were: (1) the possible emotional effect on the child if custody changed to biological parent; (2) the possible emotional effect on the child if custody is given to a caretaker; (3) the stability and certainty as to the child's future in the custody of the parent; and (4) the stability and certainty as to the child's future in the custody of the caretaker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burak v.

The first element in\n   <em>\n    Rashawn H.\n   </em>\n   dictates that it is in the best interest of a child to maintain the parental relationship. Unless there is a finding of unfitness or exceptional circumstances, the parental relationship should not be terminated. In the custody context, unfitness \"means an unfitness to have\n   <em>\n    custody\n   </em>\n   of the child, not an unfitness to remain the child's parent; exceptional circumstances are those that would make parental\n   <em>\n    custody\n   </em>\n   detrimental to the best interest of the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 498,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490,5569324\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/937/177/\">\n    937 A.2d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). In applying the factors enunciated in Fam. Law \u00a7 5-323(d), the juvenile court could not find parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances that would result in a detriment to H.W. Additional factors may be considered in the analysis, as long as the best interest of the child is \"the touchstone for courts in TPR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   cases.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Ta'Niya C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696684\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/90/#p100\">\n    417 Md. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696684\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/90/#p100\">\n    8 A.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757 (2010).

The custody factors considered by the juvenile court indicated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , are directly correlated to a child's best interest in the custody of a particular caretaker. Utilizing custody factors may ultimately bolster a finding of exceptional circumstances where one may not have existed. Although the Majority posits that the juvenile court's reliance on custody factors did not taint the TPR decision, there is, ultimately, no way to guarantee that it did not. Juvenile courts should be cautioned against improperly piecemealing factors from other statutes or cases to bootstrap the desired goal of terminating a parent's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The second element from\n   <em>\n    Rashawn H.\n   </em>\n   similarly leads to a conclusion that custody factors have no place in a TPR proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   A heightened burden of proof reflects the seriousness of TPR proceedings. Because a TPR proceeding could result in a complete rescission of the parental-child relationship, the specific factors enumerated in Fam. Law \u00a7 5-323(d) are necessary measures to ensure protection of a parent's fundamental right to raise a child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Troxel v.
