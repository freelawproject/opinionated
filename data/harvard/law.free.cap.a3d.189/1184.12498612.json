The defendant appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the trial court denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) we should overrule our interpretation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) in\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , (2) under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , the state was required to prove his lack of drug dependency beyond a reasonable doubt because it is a fact that would result in an increased mandatory minimum sentence, and (3) the narcotics statutory scheme, which gives the prosecutor the sole authority to decide whether to proceed under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), rather than the otherwise identical General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 21a-277 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   violates the separation of powers established by article second of the\n   constitution of Connecticut, as amended by article eighteen of the amendments. The state contends to the contrary, and also argues that the trial court lacked\n   subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct because that motion challenged his underlying conviction, rather than his sentence. Although we conclude that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct, we disagree with the merits of the defendant's claims and reaffirm\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   's holding that drug dependency under \u00a7 21a-278 (b) is an affirmative defense that, if proven, reduces a defendant's potential sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On June 16, 2011, the state charged the defendant with one count of the sale of narcotics in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), and one count of possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 21a-279 (a), in connection with the sale of crack cocaine in Bristol. On November 16, 2011, the defendant pleaded guilty, in accordance with the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the sale of narcotics in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b); the state nolled the possession charge. Drug dependency was not discussed during the plea hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court subsequently sentenced the defendant to five years imprisonment with five years special parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   on November 5, 2015, the defendant filed the\n   motion to correct an illegal sentence that underlies the present appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that motion, the defendant claimed that his sentence is illegal because, inter alia, under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    570 U.S. at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed. 2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), the sentence \"exceeds the relevant statutory limits\" and \"the fact triggering the mandatory minimum [sentence] was not found by a proper [fact finder] or admitted by the defendant ....\" On February 9, 2016, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision observing that, in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142752\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/602/\">\n    290 Conn. at 623-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20148\">\n    966 A.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court had concluded that\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , which requires that the state charge, and prove to the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt, any factor, other than a prior conviction, that increases the maximum penalty for a crime; see\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Jersey\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 474-97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; did not apply to proof of drug dependency under \u00a7 21a-278 (b) because such proof constitutes an affirmative defense under that statute. The trial court then rejected the defendant's argument that\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , which extended the rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   to facts\n   that increase a statutory minimum sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 103,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After rejecting the defendant's other challenges to his sentence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court rendered judgment denying the motion to correct an illegal sentence. This appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the present appeal from the trial court's denial of his motion to correct, the defendant claims the following: (1) we should overrule\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142752\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/602/\">\n    290 Conn. at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20148\">\n    966 A.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) the narcotics statutory scheme violates the separation of powers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state disagrees with the merits of the defendant's claims and also contends that the trial court should have dismissed the defendant's motion to correct for lack of subject matter\n   jurisdiction.

When we construe a statute, we act not as plenary lawgivers but as surrogates for another policy maker, [that is] the legislature. In our role as surrogates, our only responsibility is to determine what the legislature, within constitutional limits, intended to do. Sometimes, when we have made such a determination, the legislature instructs us that we have misconstrued its intentions. We are bound by the instructions so provided.... More often, however, the legislature takes no further action to clarify its intentions. Time and again, we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature's acquiescence in our construction of a statute.... Once an appropriate interval to permit legislative reconsideration has passed without corrective legislative action, the inference of legislative acquiescence places a significant jurisprudential limitation on our own authority to reconsider the merits of our earlier decision....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"Factors that may justify overruling a prior decision interpreting a statutory provision include intervening developments in the law, the potential for unconscionable results, the potential for irreconcilable conflicts and difficulty in applying the interpretation....

He suggests, therefore, that he should be resentenced under \u00a7 21a-277 (a), with a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment and no mandatory minimum, insofar as \u00a7 21a-278 (b) only precludes the trial court from suspending, rather than reducing, the mandatory minimum. The defendant notes that the trial court \"had the discretion to impose a nonmandatory minimum portion of the sentence by reducing the mandatory minimum sentence to no mandatory minimum,\" observing that, \"although the mandatory minimum [under \u00a7 21a-278 (b) ] is nonsuspendable, it is not nonreducible.\" Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59a (d) (providing in relevant part that \"[a]ny person found guilty under this section shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of which five years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court\"); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70a (a) (2) (\"ten years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court\"). The defendant also emphasizes that, \"although \u00a7 21a-278 (b) does not provide for ... a nonmandatory sentence, such a sentence is permissible because \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 21a-277 (a) have the same essential elements ... and \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides for a sentence without a mandatory minimum.\" (Citation omitted.) See also General Statutes \u00a7 21a-283a (in sentencing defendant under certain narcotics statutes, including \u00a7 21a-278 [b], when facts of underlying offense \"did not involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person or result in the physical injury or serious physical injury of another person, and in the commission of which such person neither was armed with nor threatened the use of or displayed or represented by word or conduct that such person possessed any firearm, deadly weapon or dangerous instrument ... the court may, upon a showing of good cause by the defendant, depart from the prescribed mandatory minimum sentence, provided the provisions of this section have not previously been invoked on the defendant's behalf and the court, at the time of sentencing, states in open court the reasons for imposing the particular sentence and the specific reason for imposing a sentence that departs from the prescribed mandatory minimum sentence\").

In so concluding, we observed that, particularly with respect to relatively minor offenses that implicated only short terms of imprisonment, this statute requiring immediate incarceration had the effect of rendering the right to appellate review \"meaningless,\" depriving judges of the ability to continue cases for sentencing at a later date, or to impose sentences without incarceration.
