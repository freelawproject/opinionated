BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, the record supports\n   the following facts.\n   <em>\n    State v.

On November 2, 2015, agents from the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA) received information from a confidential informant indicating that McLaughlin was staying in and selling drugs out of room 175 at the Senator Inn in Augusta. Based on this information and their observation of individuals coming and going from room 175, MDEA agents sought and obtained a search warrant for the room. The search warrant referred to McLaughlin by name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 3] At around 6:30 p.m. that evening, with the help of the Augusta Police Department, MDEA agents executed the search warrant for room 175. Upon executing the warrant, the officers and agents secured and identified six individuals in the room, including McLaughlin. In the room, agents observed and seized, among other items, over $10,000 in cash; two firearms and ammunition; a dish in the microwave with white and yellow residue; three digital scales; a plastic bag containing a hard, light-brown material; fourteen individually sealed bags with a hard, off-white material; and an individual bag containing a large \"ball\" of hard, off-white material. All six individuals in room 175 were arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The State conducted a controlled substance analysis on several of the items seized from room 175. The analysis confirmed that the residue on the dish contained cocaine base; all three digital scales had residue containing cocaine and heroin; the light-brown material weighed sixty-five grams and contained heroin; the total weight of the hard, off-white material in the fourteen bags was 3.4 grams and at least one of the bags contained cocaine base; and the large \"ball\" of hard, off-white material weighed 100.6 grams and contained cocaine base. The controlled substance analysis identified the presence of heroin and cocaine base but did not determine the precise weight of each drug in isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] On January 21, 2016, a grand jury indicted McLaughlin on five charges stemming from his November 2, 2015, arrest. Among the charges were Count 1, aggravated trafficking in schedule W drugs (Class A), namely cocaine in the form of cocaine base, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(D), and Count 2, aggravated trafficking in schedule W drugs (Class A), namely heroin, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(H) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A jury trial on the charges took place over three days from November 1 to November 3, 2016. On the first day of the trial, the State orally moved to amend Count 2 to a charge of unlawful trafficking in heroin (Class B), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1103(1-A)(A) (2017), which the court granted without objection by the defendant. At trial, two of the individuals arrested with McLaughlin testified that McLaughlin knowingly trafficked in what he knew to be illegal drugs on November 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 6] At the close of trial, the court provided several instructions to the jury, including the following instruction related to Count 1: \"Cocaine base includes any mixture or preparation that contains any quantity of cocaine base, which is the alkaloid base of cocaine.\" McLaughlin did not object to this instruction. The jury found McLaughlin guilty of Count 1, aggravated trafficking in cocaine in the form of cocaine\n   base and Count 2, unlawful trafficking in heroin, on November 3, 2016. On July 11, 2017, the court sentenced McLaughlin to twenty years in prison with all but twelve years suspended and four years of probation on Count 1, and a concurrent six-year prison sentence on Count 2. McLaughlin appeals only the judgment of conviction for aggravated trafficking in cocaine in the form of cocaine base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115 (2017) ; M.R.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 7] McLaughlin argues that the court erred by instructing the jury that \"[c]ocaine base includes any mixture or preparation that contains any quantity of cocaine base.\" He contends that 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1102(1)(F), 1105-A(1)(D) (2017) require the State to prove the weight of pure cocaine base in isolation-not the overall weight of the mixture or preparation that contains some quantity of cocaine base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.

The Maine Criminal Code, title 17-A, comprises five parts. The statutes establishing drug-related crimes are found in part 2, chapter 45, entitled simply \"Drugs.\" The chapter opens with two statutes containing definitions and schedules of drugs that apply to the entire chapter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 - 1102 (2017). The Legislature defined \"cocaine\" in the second of those statutes, section 1102(1)(F) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n   </strong>\n   Cocaine means:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from which cocaine, ecgonine and derivatives of ecgonine and their salts have been removed; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   A mixture or preparation that contains any quantity of any of the following substances:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n   Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers and salts of isomers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    (b)\n   </strong>\n   Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers and salts of isomers; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    (c)\n   </strong>\n   Cocaine base, which is the alkaloid form of cocaine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 11] In the sections following section 1102, the Legislature set out various types of drug crimes-possession, trafficking, furnishing, and aggravated forms of trafficking and furnishing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1103, 1105-A, 1105-C, 1106, 1107-A (2017). Intentional or knowing possession of any amount of cocaine is a crime, although the amount possessed, the existence or lack of any prior convictions for possession, and whether the cocaine is in the form of cocaine base will determine whether the crime is a Class D, C, or B offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1107-A. In addition, intentionally or knowingly trafficking in any amount of cocaine is a Class B crime, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1103(1-A)(A), and possession of fourteen grams or more of cocaine or four grams or more of cocaine in the form of cocaine base \"gives rise to a permissible inference under the Maine Rules of Evidence, Rule 303, that the person is unlawfully trafficking in scheduled drugs.\" 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1103(3)(B).

At trial, the State presented evidence that, at the time of his arrest for trafficking, McLaughlin was in possession of a hard, off-white material that cumulatively weighed over one-hundred grams and contained some undetermined amount of cocaine base. Based on the weight of this material, McLaughlin was charged with and convicted of aggravated trafficking in cocaine as defined by subsection (1)(D) of section 1105-A, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n   At the time of the offense, the person trafficks in cocaine in a quantity of 112 grams or more\n   <em>\n    or cocaine in the form of cocaine base in a quantity of 32 grams or more\n   </em>\n   . Violation of this paragraph is a Class A crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Emphasis added.)

Section 1102(1)(F)(2) states that \"[c]ocaine means ...

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b6 23] We conclude that section 1105-A(1)(D) does not require the State to prove the weight of \"pure\" cocaine base because the definition of cocaine in the form of cocaine base is \"[a] mixture or preparation that contains any quantity of\" cocaine base. 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1102(1)(F). In this case, the court committed no error, let alone obvious error, when it instructed the jury that \"[c]ocaine base includes any mixture or preparation that contains any quantity of cocaine base, which is the alkaloid base of cocaine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   HJELM, J., with whom JABAR and HUMPHREY, JJ., join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b6 24] As it applies to cocaine, the quantitative threshold necessary to commit the Class A crime of aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs is 112 grams of \"cocaine\" or 32 grams of \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(D) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In my view, when a prosecution is for aggravated trafficking of \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base,\" the plain language of this statute requires the State to prove the weight of that cocaine base in isolation and without regard to the weight of any other accompanying material. Further, even if there is a need to resort to consideration of the legislative history of the relevant statutes, the result is the same. Consequently, the court's instructions to the jury in this case contained\n   obvious error because the instructions misstated a central element of the charge and thereby relieved the State of its burden to prove the quantity of cocaine base required by the statute. More importantly, the State presented\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence whatsoever of the amount of actual cocaine base that Kashawn McLaughlin was charged with trafficking. As a matter of law, the evidence was therefore insufficient to support a conviction for aggravated trafficking in cocaine base. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Court's conclusion affirming the conviction for that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b6 25] The issue presented here is entirely one of statutory construction, which the Court must determine de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

That phrase-\"in\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   form of cocaine base\"-is plainly a restrictive modifier because it explicitly requires the substance to be cocaine in the specific form of cocaine base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b6 30] The Court reaches the contrary conclusion-that \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base\" can be any mixture or preparation containing any amount of cocaine base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.

With respect to its definitions of \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base,\" the Legislature has exhibited that skill. The Legislature established that a substance is \"cocaine,\" no matter whether and what other ingredients may be present, so long as it contains any amount of any of the three forms of cocaine described in section 1102(1)(F)(2)(a)-(c). In contrast, the definition of \"cocaine base\" does not leave room for the presence of any extrinsic ingredients. If the Legislature had intended \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base\" to mean a mixture containing any amount of cocaine base, then, having gone so far as to define cocaine base as the alkaloid form of cocaine,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1102(1)(F)(2)(c), it could and would have done so either as part of that definitional provision or in section 1105-A(1)(D) itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [\u00b6 31] Based on the Court's analysis, the cocaine that would suffice to meet the requirement of section 1105-A(1)(D) is not \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base.\" Rather, the substance could be anything at all, so long as it contains some amount-however miniscule-of cocaine base. For that reason, the Court's conclusion that \"cocaine base\" means any concoction that contains any measure of cocaine base renders the phrase \"in the form of cocaine base\" as surplusage because the phrase is left with little effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Tozier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871887\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1240/\">\n    2015 ME 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871887\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1240/\">\n    115 A.3d 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nothing in a statute may be treated as surplusage if a reasonable construction applying meaning and force is otherwise possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (quotation marks omitted) ). In my view, pursuant to the definition in section 1102(1)(F)(2)(c), \"cocaine base\"\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the alkaloid form of cocaine, and at trial that is what the State must prove the substance to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [\u00b6 32] In contrast to the Court's analysis, when the statutory language at issue is read to require the requisite amount of actual cocaine base, all words in that phrase are given effect. Although I agree that the Legislature could also have simply referred directly to \"cocaine base\" instead of \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base,\" the word choice has meaning because it is a function of the structure of the overall definition of \"cocaine\" that begins with section 1102(1)(F). Starting there, the Legislature simply tracked its way through the definitional layers to end up at the particular subsection that contains \"cocaine base.\" In this way, the Legislature particularized the substance at issue, so that the specific form of \"cocaine\" that must be quantified in a case such as this is-as the words make clear-cocaine in the form of cocaine base and not cocaine base as part of a mixture that in total weighs at least 32 grams. Further, as I discuss below, the legislative history shows that the Legislature used the phrases \"cocaine base\" and \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base\" interchangeably, revealing that the Legislature saw the phrases as having identical meanings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b6 33] Therefore, in my view, pursuant to a plain language reading of sections 1102(1)(F) and 1105-A(1)(D), the State was obligated to prove that McLaughlin possessed at least 32 grams of cocaine base in isolation. No such evidence was presented at trial, and for that reason, McLaughlin cannot be convicted of aggravated trafficking on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   B. Legislative History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b6 34] Even if the relevant statutes were ambiguous, the legislative history supports the conclusion that the Legislature intended \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base\" to mean just that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8447038\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/912/1229/\">\n    2007 ME 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8447038\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/912/1229/\">\n    912 A.2d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that when statutory language is ambiguous, we look to legislative history for guidance).

The Office of the Attorney General presented an amendment to that bill to differentiate between \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base (crack cocaine)\" and \"cocaine hydrochloride (powder cocaine).\" Comm. Amend. A. to L.D. 1457, No. H-696, Statement of Fact (117th Legis. 1995); Comm. Amend. A. to L.D. 1457, No. H-696 (117th Legis. 1995) (letter dated January 16, 1995 to Chairs of the J.

When referring to cocaine base, the Statement of Fact accompanying the Amendment uses the terms \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base\" and \"cocaine base\" interchangeably.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   L.D. 1457, Comm.

Similarly, in testimony presented to the legislative committee of jurisdiction, Lauren, appearing for the Attorney General's office, explained that, pursuant to the Amendment, \"[t]rafficking or furnishing 32 grams or more of\n   <em>\n    cocaine base\n   </em>\n   would constitute an [a]ggravating [f]actor under 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105.\"\n   <em>\n    An Act to Deter the Spread of Crack Cocaine: Hearing on L.D. 1457 Before the J.

Just as the Court places weight on the Amendment, I find it significant that, in his testimony before the Legislature, the representative of the very office that submitted the proposal assigned the same meaning to the term \"cocaine base\" and to the term contained in the Amendment, \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b6 36] Contrary to the Court's view, this demonstrates that there is no statutory difference between the two-\"cocaine in the form of cocaine base\"\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   \"cocaine base\"-and that the Legislature intended that section 1105-A(1)(D) require the State to prove the presence of at least 32 grams of cocaine base, exclusive of any other substance, in order for a defendant to be found guilty of aggravated trafficking of cocaine base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   [\u00b6 37] Second, as the Court notes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21, the legislative history establishes that the Legislature looked to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(iii) (LEXIS through Pub. L. No. 115-191 ), which is included in the federal Controlled Substances Act, as a guide for what became the weight threshold for cocaine base subsequently enacted in section 1105-A(1)(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm. Amend. A. to L.D. 1457, No. H-696, Statement of Fact (117th Legis. 1995). Section 841(a) criminalizes particular drug-related conduct, such as manufacturing and distributing controlled substances and possessing controlled substances with the intent to manufacture or distribute-conduct that is similar to trafficking as defined in Maine law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1101(17) (2017). Section 841(b)(1) then establishes the penalties for violations of section 841(a) based on the nature and weight of the drug.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) (LEXIS through Pub. L. No. 115-191 ). Section 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) sets out sentencing provisions for crimes involving the following forms of cocaine:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii)\n   </strong>\n   500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    (I)\n   </strong>\n   coca leaves ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    (II)\n   </strong>\n   cocaine ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    (III)\n   </strong>\n   ecgonine ...; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    (IV)\n   </strong>\n   any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of any of the substances referred to in subclauses (I) through (III).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Then, section 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) applies the same penalty provisions to crimes involving cocaine base by describing that form of the drug in the following way: \"28 grams or more\n   <em>\n    of a mixture or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   [\u00b6 38] As the Court notes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14, we have recognized the Legislature's proven ability to define its terms clearly when it intends for a compound or mixture that includes some form of cocaine to be treated as cocaine itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinkham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803136\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/203/\">\n    2016 ME 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803136\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/203/\">\n    137 A.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This additional legislative history bolsters that observation. Although the Legislature drew on the quantitative standard found in section 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the federal law, it notably did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   adopt the connected federal language that explicitly states that cocaine base can mean a mixture of substances that merely includes cocaine base. The Legislature's choice to not use the very clear federal language it reviewed suggests that the Legislature purposefully did not intend to define the crime of aggravated trafficking of cocaine base in a way that would allow proof of less than 32 grams of that drug in isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b6 39] In support of its holding, the Court also refers to another element of legislative history that I find to be unenlightening on the present issue. As the Court correctly notes, \"the Legislature intended to impose harsher punishment on individuals in possession of smaller amounts of cocaine in the form of cocaine base because it saw the usable units of that drug as more harmful in smaller quantities than powdered cocaine.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Because the Legislature deemed the weight of a single usage unit of cocaine base to be smaller than a single usage unit of cocaine hydrochloride, the Legislature reasonably concluded that a smaller batch of the former should be treated comparably, for criminological purposes, to a larger batch of the latter. This says nothing, however, about the degree of\n   <em>\n    purity\n   </em>\n   that the Legislature intended to require for the State to prove the quantitative element for cocaine base as set out in section 1105-A(1)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b6 40] In fact, if anything, the Class A sentencing classification for a violation of section 1105-A(1)(D) -which enhances by twenty years in prison the maximum sentence that could be imposed for the straight Class B trafficking crime,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1103(1-A)(A) (2017)-suggests that great care must be exercised in defining the applicable scope of section 1105-A(1)(D). Pursuant to the holding reached by the Court, a person who trafficks in 32 grams of a mixture or substance that contains only an insignificant amount of actual cocaine base would be just as guilty of the Class A offense as a person who possesses 32 grams-or more-of cocaine base in isolation. The Legislature has expressly allowed such a result for \"cocaine\" as defined in section 1102(1)(F)(2), because that reference to \"cocaine\" explicitly includes mixtures and preparations that contain any quantity of certain forms of cocaine. Without similar language assigned to the particularized definition of \"cocaine base,\" the equivalence in criminal exposure for widely divergent levels of culpability does not lend confidence to the Court's conclusion that the Legislature intended them to be treated on the same plane.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solomon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856489\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/120/661/\">\n    2015 ME 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856489\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/120/661/\">\n    120 A.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that statutes are to be construed so as to avoid unreasonable or illogical results);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinkham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803136\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/203/\">\n    2016 ME 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803136\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/203/\">\n    137 A.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen interpreting a criminal statute, we are guided by two interrelated rules of statutory construction: the rule of lenity, and the rule of strict construction.

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   [\u00b6 42] The Legislature did not intend for the words, \"cocaine in the form of cocaine base,\" to encompass adulterated cocaine base. In its case against McLaughlin, the State presented no evidence of the weight of actual cocaine base in which McLaughlin trafficked. Rather, the evidence regarding the composition of the substance took two forms. The first was the Certificate of Controlled Substance Analysis, which indicated the presence of cocaine base mixed with other substances, but without any quantitative information about the weight of the cocaine base itself. Second, the State presented the testimony of its chemist, who was unable to state how much cocaine base was in the larger mixture. Because of the State's failure to present any evidence regarding the weight of the mixture, the court committed obvious error by allowing the jury to deliberate on the amount of cocaine base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clewley v.
