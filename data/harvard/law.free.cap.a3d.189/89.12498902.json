While this dissolution action was pending, the defendant was convicted of several criminal offenses arising from the alleged assault. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction in that case to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, while the criminal appeal was pending, the dissolution trial commenced. At that trial, the court allowed the plaintiff to present evidence of the criminal conviction. More specifically, the court ruled that the defendant's conviction had preclusive effect in this dissolution action under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Consequently, following the trial in the present case, the court concluded, solely on the basis of the evidence of the criminal conviction, that the defendant exclusively was responsible for the marital breakdown. Accordingly, the court entered a property division award that heavily favored the plaintiff. The defendant then filed the present appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, the defendant claims that, because the judgment of conviction was subject to a pending appeal at the time of the dissolution trial, that judgment was not final. The defendant contends that, therefore, the\n   trial court improperly gave the criminal judgment collateral estoppel effect in the present dissolution action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Subsequently, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of conviction in the criminal case. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norman P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488797\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/877/\">\n    169 Conn.

As a result, the parties were ordered to submit supplemental briefs on the effect, if any, of the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction on the defendant's claim in the present appeal from the dissolution judgment. See footnote 3 of this opinion. Thus, given the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction, which this court has recently upheld; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norman P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497176\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/1143/\">\n    329 Conn. 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497176\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/1143/\">\n    186 A.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) ; the precise issue now before us is whether the property award, which was based on that conviction, must also be reversed. To answer that question, we are guided by the principles established in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556187\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/141/240/#p242\">\n    141 U.S. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242-44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556187\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/141/240/#p242\">\n    11 S.Ct. 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556187\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/141/240/#p242\">\n    35 L.Ed. 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1891), which held that a second judgment based upon the preclusive effect of the first judgment should be reversed if the first judgment is reversed. Therefore, under the circumstances presented, we conclude that the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction strips that judgment of any collateral estoppel effect that it may have had in this dissolution action. Because the fact of the criminal conviction was the sole basis for the property division award, we also conclude that the award must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record reveals the following procedural history and facts that were either found by the trial court or are undisputed. On August 10, 2012, the defendant was arrested and charged with sexual assault of the plaintiff and other felony offenses in connection with an incident that took place at the parties' residence on August 2, 2012. On October 20, 2012, the plaintiff commenced the present action seeking dissolution of her marriage to the defendant. The plaintiff consented to the defendant's\n   request to delay the divorce trial until the completion of his criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant ultimately was convicted of several criminal charges and, on February 26, 2015, was sentenced to a lengthy term of incarceration. He filed an appeal from the judgment of conviction on May 14, 2015. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norman P.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488797\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/877/\">\n    169 Conn. App. at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488797\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/877/\">\n    151 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 21, 2015, the day before the dissolution trial was scheduled to commence, the defendant filed three motions: a motion to stay the trial until the appeal from his criminal conviction was resolved; a motion to preclude the admission of evidence of his criminal conviction; and a motion for a pretrial hearing to present evidence concerning the unfairness of the criminal proceeding. In his motion for a pretrial hearing, the defendant contended that it would be unfair to give collateral estoppel effect to his criminal conviction in the dissolution action because the conviction was the result of \"numerous erroneous trial court rulings.\" Attached to his motion for a pretrial hearing were copies of the appeal from his conviction as well as his motion for a new trial in the criminal proceeding. In those filings, the defendant set forth, at length, claims that the trial court in his criminal case had made numerous erroneous rulings that affected the validity of the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 22, 2015, just before the trial began, the trial court conducted a hearing on the defendant's three motions. The court denied the defendant's motion for a stay on the ground that the dissolution action had been pending since November 6, 2012, and any further delay would prejudice the plaintiff. With respect to the motions to preclude evidence of the criminal conviction and for a pretrial hearing on the fairness of that conviction, the court concluded that, \"[i]n any dissolution action, the [c]ourt is called upon to evaluate the situation as it exists at the time of trial. And there are apparently\n   facts that will be offered as to a conviction that would be relevant to the issues in this case; the court is not going to preclude evidence of that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court further concluded that, \"as to the issues that were apparently concluded by the conviction that has been described in an offer of proof ... the court is bound to respect that judgment. And we will not relitigate here the criminal trial.\" Accordingly, the court denied the defendant's motions to preclude evidence of the conviction and for a pretrial hearing to present evidence that the conviction was unfair. The court noted, however, that \"the existence of [a pending] appeal [from the criminal conviction] is something that can be demonstrated and may well enter into the court's deliberations on the overall outcome of the matter ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff called the defendant as a witness, and he testified that he had been convicted of sexually assaulting the plaintiff and of other criminal offenses arising from the events on August 2, 2012. Thereafter, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it found that \"the conduct of the [defendant] in August, 2012, which resulted in his arrest for and conviction of offenses including the sexual assault of the [plaintiff], was the cause of the breakdown of the marriage.\" As a result, the court found that the defendant \"bears sole responsibility for the marriage breakdown.\" The court concluded that the factors enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"clearly call for a\n   property division which heavily favors the plaintiff,\" and it rendered a property division award\n   accordingly. The court rendered no alimony award. The reasons the court gave for declining to award alimony were that the plaintiff had not requested alimony, the defendant would have no opportunity to earn income while he was incarcerated, and the defendant would require income after his release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In support of its conclusion that it could give preclusive effect to the defendant's criminal conviction despite the pending appeal, the court noted that it was required to \"make its decision based on circumstances as they now exist, not as the defendant hopes they might be in the future.\" The court responded to the defendant's complaint that, if the plaintiff received a favorable property award and the defendant's conviction were later reversed on appeal, he would \"be left with a disproportionately small share of the marital property\" by noting that, if that occurred, the defendant \"would have the opportunity to resume gainful employment and retain all of his earnings ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the court's ruling, the defendant filed a motion to reargue. In that motion, he contended that the trial court improperly had determined that the conduct that resulted in his criminal conviction was the cause of the marital breakdown without allowing him to present evidence relating to the validity and reliability of the conviction. He also contended that the dissolution action should have been stayed pending resolution of his appeal in the criminal proceeding. The trial court denied the motion. The defendant then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly gave collateral estoppel effect to the criminal judgment of conviction because that judgment was subject to a pending appeal and, therefore, was\n   not final. After filing his appeal in the present case, the Appellate Court released its decision reversing the defendant's criminal conviction and remanding the criminal case to the trial court for a new trial. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norman. P.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488797\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/877/\">\n    169 Conn.

As a result, the parties to this appeal were ordered to file supplemental briefs addressing the effect of the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction on his claims in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his supplemental brief, the defendant contends that the reversal of his criminal conviction deprives that judgment of preclusive effect and requires the reversal of the property division award. The plaintiff contends that, to the contrary, because the trial court properly rendered the property division award on the basis of the record as it existed at the time, this court has no authority to set aside the award. In the alternative, she claims that, even if this court has such authority, reversal of the property division award is not warranted under the circumstances of this case. We agree with the defendant that the reversal of his criminal conviction deprives the conviction of any preclusive effect and, therefore, warrants the reversal of the trial court's property division award in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin our analysis with the standard of review and relevant legal principles. \"The applicability of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, like the applicability of the closely related doctrine of res judicata, presents a question of law that we review de novo.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cumberland Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Groton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653128\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/45/#p57\">\n    262 Conn. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57-58,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=808%20A.2d%201107\">\n    808 A.2d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). In\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , the\n   United States Supreme Court explained that a judgment should not be allowed to stand on appeal when it is based on\n   a previous judgment that has itself been overturned.

We acknowledge that this appeal initially presented the issue of whether a judgment that was pending on appeal should be given preclusive effect in a second action. Given the reversal of the criminal judgment, however; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norman P.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497176\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/1143/\">\n    329 Conn. at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497176\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/1143/\">\n    186 A.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norman P.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488797\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/877/\">\n    169 Conn.

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Waterbury Hospital\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Health Care Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"515930\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/186/247/#p249\">\n    186 Conn. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249-52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20310\">\n    440 A.2d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) (court dismissed as moot plaintiff's request for injunctive relief to restrain picketing during strike because strike and picketing had ended while appeal was pending). In addition, changes in the law that occur after an appeal has been filed ordinarily apply retroactively to the case on appeal.

We further note that this court may take judicial notice of the files of the Superior Court in any case.

Because there is no dispute that the defendant's criminal conviction has been reversed, and because this court certainly may determine the purely legal consequences of that reversal in the present case, we cannot perceive what would be gained by requiring the defendant to go through \"the delay and expense of taking ulterior proceedings in the court below\" to achieve this same result. See\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556187\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/141/240/#p242\">\n    141 U.S. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556187\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/141/240/#p242\">\n    11 S.Ct. 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff contends, however, that, even if this court has the authority to reverse a judgment because it was based on a prior judgment that now has been reversed, such reversal is not automatic, but there must be a showing that it is warranted. See Restatement, (Second), supra, \u00a7 16, comment (c), p. 146 (\"[t]he current doctrine ... is that the later judgment remains valid, but a party, upon a showing that the earlier judgment has been nullified and that relief from the later judgment is\n   <em>\n    warranted\n   </em>\n   , may by appropriate proceedings secure such relief\" [emphasis added] ). The plaintiff claims that reversal is not warranted in the present case for two reasons. First, she claims that the defendant made a strategic choice to delay the dissolution trial until his criminal trial was completed, and he therefore should be bound by the result of the criminal trial. Second, she claims that the trial court expressly considered the possibility that his criminal conviction might\n   be reversed on appeal and that he might ultimately be acquitted. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We reject the plaintiff's first claim. We note that both parties agreed to delay the dissolution trial until the criminal trial was completed; however, the agreement to delay the dissolution trial is not dispositive under the circumstances of the present case. The overriding issue is that the criminal conviction has been reversed. Although the Appellate Court has held that a judgment that is subject to appeal is final for purposes of collateral estoppel; see\n   <em>\n    Carnemolla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2242667\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/75/319/#p326\">\n    75 Conn.

See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brundage\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20740\">\n    320 Conn. at 753-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%20697\">\n    135 A.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Salem Park, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salem\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1555269\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/149/141/#p144\">\n    149 Conn. at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%20571\">\n    176 A.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, even if we were to assume that the defendant would be bound by the judgment in the criminal case while the appeal was pending, that judgment lost any preclusive effect when it was reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We also are not persuaded by the plaintiff's claim that the trial court considered the possibility of the defendant's acquittal. Although the trial court briefly noted that the defendant would be able to retain all of his earnings if he were acquitted because the court was rendering no alimony award, the\n   <em>\n    reasons\n   </em>\n   that the court gave for the decision not to award alimony were that the plaintiff never requested alimony, the defendant would have no income while he was incarcerated, and that he would require an income after serving his sentence. Accordingly, the record does not reflect that the possibility of the defendant's acquittal had any bearing on the court's disposition of the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff further contends that the defendant has failed to show that he was prejudiced by the trial court's order precluding him from presenting evidence that\n   casted doubt on the validity and reliability of his criminal conviction. Specifically, she argues that the defendant has not shown that, if he had been permitted to present such evidence, there would have been no finding of fault against him. The very reason for the rule that a reversed judgment has no preclusive effect, however, is that the reversal of the subsequent judgment puts the parties in the same position as they would have been in if the previous judgment had\n   <em>\n    never existed\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556187\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/141/240/#p242\">\n    141 U.S. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556187\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/141/240/#p242\">\n    11 S.Ct. 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversed judgment is \"without any validity, force or effect, and ought never to have existed\");\n   <em>\n    Disher\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084565\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/486/790/#p798\">\n    486 F.

The only evidence that was before the trial court regarding the reason for the breakdown of the marriage and the trial court's division of property was the bare fact of the defendant's conviction. Thus, the effect of the reversal of that conviction was to eliminate retroactively the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   basis for the property division award in the present case. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant does not bear a burden, at this stage, of showing that he was not solely responsible for the marital breakdown in order to warrant the reversal of the trial court's property division award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff also contends that a reversal of the property award would violate her rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Specifically, she claims that \"[t]o permit the defendant, after a criminal trial at which the plaintiff testified and [the defendant's] conduct was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, to relitigate that conduct in the dissolution action\" would undermine her state constitutional right to restitution. See Conn. Const., amend. XXIX (b) (9) (\"a victim ... shall have ... the right to restitution which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other cause of action or as otherwise provided by law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is not entirely clear to us how her constitutional rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article twenty-nine of the amendments, are implicated in the present case, and she has cited no authority for the proposition that a dissolution action is the equivalent of an action for restitution for purposes of this constitutional provision. Perhaps more fundamentally, the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction has placed the parties in the same position that they were in before the defendant's conviction, and the plaintiff has failed to explain why she is entitled to restitution under this constitutional provision in the absence of a determination of guilt. Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff contends that none of the factors that this court considers when determining whether it should create an exception to the doctrine of collateral estoppel weighs in favor of creating an\n   exception here. See\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Infinity Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952170\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/594/#p603\">\n    282 Conn. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20A.2d%201073\">\n    922 A.2d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (\"[i]n establishing exceptions to the general application of the preclusion doctrines, we have identified several factors to consider, including: [1] whether another public policy interest outweighs the interest of finality served by the preclusion doctrines ...

[3] whether the opportunity to litigate the claim or issue differs as between the two forums ... and [4] whether the legislature has evinced an intent that the doctrine should not apply\" [citations omitted] ). We have not, however, created an\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   to the doctrine of collateral estoppel in the present case. Rather, we have concluded that the reversal of a judgment prevents that judgment from having preclusive effect under the doctrine in the first instance because that judgment no longer exists.
