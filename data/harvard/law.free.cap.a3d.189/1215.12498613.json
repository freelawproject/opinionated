The question that often emerges from this familiar context is the extent to which the trial court must inquire into the defendant's request. In this case, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to conduct (1) an evidentiary hearing on the defendant's motion to withdraw his plea, and (2) an adequate inquiry into the defendant's request for new counsel. The state appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the judgment of conviction of the defendant, Earl C. Simpson III, following his guilty plea entered under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   doctrine of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488137\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/699/#p171\">\n    169 Conn.

The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court was required to hold hearings on the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his request for new counsel. Alternatively, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court did not conduct such hearings. The defendant counters that hearings on both the motion and the request were required, and that the Appellate Court properly\n   concluded that the trial court failed to conduct them. We conclude that the trial court, after conducting a hearing on the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, properly denied the motion to withdraw, and, therefore, no evidentiary hearing was required. We also conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, no hearing was required on his request for new counsel. Therefore, the\n   judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Appellate Court set forth the following facts and procedural history. \"The defendant, represented by counsel, entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in this case on September 19, 2014. The state, by way of a long form information, filed on June 29, 2012, charged the defendant in count one with felony murder under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54c and 53a-8, in count two with murder as an accessory under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-8, and in count three with robbery or attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1).\" (Footnote added and omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488137\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/699/#p171\">\n    169 Conn.

Then, \"[t]he prosecutor addressed the court to set forth the factual basis underlying the plea\n   with respect to the murder count, as follows: '[W]ith respect to the plea on the second count of murder, the state is prepared to prove the following facts: On July 9, 2011, at about 6 p.m., New Haven police officers responded to the area of Howard Avenue and Putnam Street based upon a report of shots fired. They located the body of John Claude James, age twenty-six. It was evident to them that he had been shot several times. A later autopsy determined that he had been shot five times in the back area. All but one bullet had exited the body. [Those bullets] were never located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \" 'During the investigation, a witness stated she was in her apartment nearby. Moments after hearing the shots, Cody Franklin and the defendant ... ran into her apartment. Franklin said that he had just shot someone. The witness also said [the defendant] offered her weed to say that he and Franklin had not been in her apartment. [The defendant] then called his sister, Isis Hargrove, asking her to pick them up. Franklin and the defendant ... were a short time later seen getting into Isis' car and leaving the area. Also, a witness told [the] police he saw Franklin shoot ... James and [the defendant] was with Franklin at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \" 'The crime scene investigation resulted in the location of six shell casings found in the immediate area where witnesses saw the shots being fired. A ballistics examination disclosed that five casings had been ejected from the same gun, while the sixth casing was ejected from a different gun. Such [evidence] is clearly consistent with there being two shooters. Another witness told police that he saw Franklin and [the defendant] together just before the shooting and saw ... Franklin fire shots, but he did not admit that he had seen [the defendant] fire any shots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \" 'On May 19, 2014, the defendant ... was being interviewed by a member of the State's Attorney's Office\n   in Waterbury\n   in connection with another shooting. When asked about the previous shooting of ... James, the defendant ... admitted that he was one of the shooters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Thereafter, the court canvassed the defendant with respect to his [murder and probation] pleas. During the canvass, the defendant stated that he was not under the influence of any alcohol, drugs or medication; he had had a sufficient opportunity prior to the plea canvass to discuss his pleas with counsel; he was satisfied with his counsel's advice; he was entering his 'guilty plea' and his 'probation plea' voluntarily; and nobody was forcing or threatening him to enter the pleas. The defendant stated that he understood the rights he was giving up by entering his pleas, including his right against compulsory self-incrimination, his right to a trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The following colloquy between the court and the defendant ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \" 'The Court: ... On the crime of murder, the state would have to prove that with the intent to cause the death of another person, you caused the death of such person or of a third person, and that is punishable by up to sixty years in prison, twenty-five years at the minimum or nonsuspendable portion. Do you understand that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \" '[The Defendant]: Yes.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The court proceeded to ask the defendant if he understood the nature of an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea and if he\n   understood the sentence to which he was exposed as well as the agreement in place with the state for a sentence of thirty-two and one-half years imprisonment, with a twenty-five year minimum sentence. The defendant stated that he understood these matters and that no additional promises had been made to him with respect to the pleas. The court stated: 'Once I accept these pleas, you can't change your mind later on unless there's some valid legal reason. Do you understand that?' The defendant replied affirmatively. At the conclusion of the canvass, the defendant stated that he had understood the questions directed to him by the court and that there was nothing that he wished to raise to the court or his attorney prior to the court's acceptance of the pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The court accepted the defendant's pleas, finding that they were 'understandably made with the assistance of competent counsel.' The court found that the defendant was 'guilty' and that he had violated his probation. The court then continued the matter to a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"By handwritten letter dated October 27, 2014, and addressed to the court, the defendant stated that he wanted to withdraw his [murder] plea and that he desired a new attorney. In relevant part, the letter, signed by the defendant, stated: 'I request to withdraw my guilty plea. I have a legitimate claim. I am not guilty of murder. I am claiming ineffective counsel. I was not explained all elements of the crime of murder. There was no testimony at ... Franklin's trial that I assisted, aided, or conspiracy. There was no intent on my part. The mere fact that I did not assist and help ... Franklin from the testimony of the state witnesses is enough to have the charges against me dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \" 'Had my attorney investigated and told me all the facts I wouldn't have pled guilty to a charge that I didn't\n   commit. I felt pressured to take the plea because I was told I had \"no chance\" of winning [at] trial. Individuals trying to say I confessed to things I did not. I didn't sign anything or state anything on the record. (About this so-called confession.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \" 'I need a new attorney and I need for him to request a \"[m]otion to vacate\" and a[n] \"evidentiary hearing.\" My counsel also failed to file a \"motion to dismiss\" the murder charges after ... Franklin's trial. Please look into this matter.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Additionally, the defendant wrote: 'My attorney never told me the difference between accessory after the fact and obstruction of justice, and aiding and abetting. I never and did not encourage, and or facilitate or participate in the crime by the testimony of the state witness. I had \"NO\" knowledge that anyone was going to kill anyone. I request a new attorney and to withdraw my plea. Also a[n] evidence hearing on this matter. Ineffective counsel and evidence hearing. Please withdraw my plea. I couldn't make an intelligent decision. Please look into this matter.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"On December 4, 2014, through counsel, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-26 and 39-27. In relevant part, the motion stated: 'In subsequent written and oral communications between the defendant and undersigned counsel, the defendant has indicated he did not possess knowledge or fully understand the sentence that could be imposed or the consequences thereto at the time he entered the guilty plea.' The state filed a written opposition to the defendant's motion....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"By a second handwritten letter, dated December 8, 2014, and addressed to the court, the defendant renewed his request to withdraw his plea and for new counsel. The letter, signed by the defendant, stated in relevant part: '[T]here are a few things I would like to\n   bring to your attention. First and foremost, I was in (special aid) in school and didn't have enough time to be fully explained anything about my charges. I just came and it was on the table. (Accept or reject.) My lawyer never explained the full conditions to ... such charge I was suppose[d] to plea to in which any evidence points to me as an accessory to. I never had a legal visit or anything. I would really like to take this plea back. My lawyer talked me into something I didn't want to do. I was confused. When I came to court I've told him this personally and that I would like a new lawyer. ( [In]effective counsel.) He didn't put any motions in to try to get any hearings when I asked for some. When I was explained about my charge after the fact I told him to withdraw my plea. He wants to wait until the last minute going against my wishes. This is my life on the line and I would like to withdraw and go to trial. Because I'm not responsible for this charge that's against me. Please. I would really appreciate it a lot. Also requesting a new lawyer. I told my old lawyer, Thomas Farver, [that] I wanted to request a new one and I don't think he put it in and went around what I said. I have [a] court [appearance on December] 19, 2014 that is suppose[d] to be a sentencing date. I really hope you grant the motion for my plea to be withdrawn.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The defendant, represented by counsel, appeared in court on December 19, 2014, for sentencing. At the beginning of the hearing, the court stated: 'I know the defendant had sent some letters to me which seemed to indicate that, possibly, he was interested in withdrawing his plea.' ... The following colloquy then occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \" 'The Court: So, I guess I should ... ask [the defendant] ... is he still pursuing a motion to withdraw this plea? ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \" '[The Defendant]: Mm-hm.

Why is it you ... want to withdraw your plea?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \" '[The Defendant]: Why do I want to-because I feel like everything wasn't explained. It was like, as soon as I got to court, boom, it's just like ... take this right now. You go to trial, you losing. It was like I was forced to take it. I felt like I was forced to take the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \" 'The Court: And who forced you to take the plea; the system, you mean, or the court or-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \" '[The Defendant]: No, my lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \" 'The Court: Your lawyer, how did he force you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \" '[The Defendant]: It's like, he told me right there, if I don't take it ...

The court asked the defendant if he remembered the court having asked him a series of questions at that earlier proceeding. The defendant replied, 'Yeah. Yeah, somewhat.' The court asked the defendant if he recalled answering that he\n   was not under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or medication and that he had had a sufficient opportunity to discuss the plea with his attorney. The defendant replied, 'No.' The court asked the defendant if he recalled answering that he was satisfied with his attorney's advice concerning the pleas, that he was entering the pleas voluntarily, and that nobody was forcing or threatening him to enter the pleas. The defendant replied, 'Yeah, some of it.' Additionally, the court asked the defendant if he recalled answering that no additional promises had been made to him, and that he understood that he would not be permitted to change his mind and withdraw his pleas absent a valid legal reason to do so. The defendant replied, 'Yes.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The following colloquy then ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \" 'The Court: In other words, so the transcript seems to bear out that a lot of questions I asked you was, did you need more time with your lawyer, are you satisfied with your lawyer's advice, is anybody forcing you to do this.

When afforded an opportunity to address the court with respect to the motion to withdraw the plea, the prosecutor added, in addition to his\n   written\n   objection, that the defendant had prior experience in the criminal justice system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"The court stated: 'The problem I'm having ... and I know it was a big decision, and I know we're talking, obviously, about a ... very long prison sentence, I certainly understand that, but, you know, there is no right to have a plea withdrawn after the plea has been entered and [the defendant has been] canvassed by the court. And the burden of proof is certainly on you to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of that.

Therefore, the first issue presented is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court erred in failing to conduct an\n   <em>\n    evidentiary\n   </em>\n   hearing on the defendant's motion to withdraw his plea.

Additionally, the state claims that the trial court was not required to hold a hearing on the defendant's request for new counsel because his complaints were insubstantial.

In response, the defendant argues that his claims, \"if true, constituted sufficient grounds to withdraw the plea as not knowing and voluntary, warranting an evidentiary hearing to determine that issue.\" Thus, the defendant contends, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to hold such a hearing. The defendant also asserts that his statements about counsel indicated a breakdown in communication amounting to a substantial complaint, which required a hearing on the request for new counsel, which the trial court failed to conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We conclude that the trial court conducted a hearing on the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, after which no further evidentiary hearing was required, because his allegations did not furnish a proper basis for withdrawal under Practice Book \u00a7 39-27.

At first, the defendant criticized his attorney's advice, and explained that he believed that his attorney forced him to take the plea. When the trial court subsequently asked if the defendant's rationale was that he had simply changed his mind and had \"buyer's remorse,\" the defendant responded affirmatively. Faced with two conflicting justifications for the motion to withdraw, the trial court then took the time to review the transcript of the prior plea canvass with the defendant. Relying on the transcript, the trial court reminded the defendant that he had already informed the court that he was \"satisfied with [his] attorney's advice,\" had a sufficient opportunity to discuss the plea with his attorney, and was entering the plea of his own free will. The defendant\n   also admitted that, during the prior plea canvass, he had agreed that, once the trial court accepted his plea, he would not be able to withdraw it without a valid legal reason. After the review of the plea canvass, the trial court asked the defendant: \"[I]t sounds like you just thought ... longer over [the plea] since that day and\n   you really just want to change your mind. Is that right?\" The defendant replied, \"[y]es.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The trial court then gave defense counsel and the state the opportunity to speak on the motion. The trial court then terminated the hearing by denying the plea withdrawal motion and the request for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Although the exact contours of a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea may vary in keeping with the trial court's discretion on such matters, we are confident that the trial court's thorough evaluation of the defendant's rationale in the present case was sufficient. It is irrelevant that the court did not explicitly label its inquiry into the defendant's motion as a hearing. Nor does it matter that the trial court addressed the defendant's motion during sentencing. The defendant and his attorney both had ample opportunity to meet their burden of establishing \"a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anthony D.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20842\">\n    320 Conn. at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20219\">\n    134 A.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Additionally, because we do not view the hearing in isolation but can look to other factors, such as the existence of a thorough plea canvass; id., at 857-59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20219\">\n    134 A.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; in the present case, we observe that the trial court had already conducted a proper plea canvass before accepting the defendant's plea.

To begin with, the plea canvass contradicts it, as the trial court confirmed that the plea was voluntary and uncoerced, and that the defendant had been satisfied with his attorney's advice. Second, statements such as, \"I felt pressured to take the plea because I was told [by counsel] I had 'no chance' of winning [at] trial,\" are not coercive, but rather amount to \"an experienced lawyer's analysis of the evidence available to [a defendant] as against the state's evidence ....\"\n   <em>\n    LaReau\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"554505\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/161/303/#p309\">\n    161 Conn. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%2054\">\n    288 A.2d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971).

For example, the defendant complained: \"I need a new attorney and I need for him to request a '[m]otion to vacate' and a[n] 'evidentiary hearing,' \" and \"[m]y counsel also failed to file a 'motion to dismiss' the murder charges after the [Franklin] trial.\" Similarly, the defendant claimed in his second letter that his counsel \"didn't put any motions in to try to get any hearings when I asked for some\" and that his counsel \"wants to wait until the last minute going against my wishes.\" These complaints are also insubstantial. \"Differences of opinion over trial strategy are not unknown, and do not necessarily compel the appointment of new counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Drakeford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498059\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/75/#p83\">\n    202 Conn. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=519%20A.2d%201194\">\n    519 A.2d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). That is especially true in the present case where\n   the plea canvass already established that the defendant was satisfied with his attorney's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The defendant's third group of complaints asserts ineffective assistance of counsel. In his first letter, the defendant wrote, \"I am claiming ineffective counsel. I was not explained all elements of the crime of murder.\" In his second letter, the defendant explained that, \"[w]hen I came to court I've told him [about my confusion regarding the underlying crime] personally and that I would like a new lawyer,\" and characterized this complaint as a matter of ineffective assistance. The defendant's conclusory allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are an insubstantial complaint in the present case because the defendant confirmed during the plea canvass that he was satisfied with his attorney's advice, and he admitted during the plea withdrawal hearing that the true reason behind his dissatisfaction was a change of heart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Indeed, the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his request for new counsel are inextricably linked: both stem from the defendant's changing his\n   mind about his guilty plea after its acceptance by the trial court. This background further supports the conclusion that the defendant's assertions about counsel fell \"short of a seemingly substantial complaint,\" and, therefore, the \"trial court need not [have] inquired into the reasons underlying the defendant's dissatisfaction with his attorney.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710399\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/227/711/#p725\">\n    227 Conn. at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20A.2d%20288\">\n    631 A.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We are not persuaded. First, to the extent that the defendant challenges the plea due to his alleged confusion regarding the distinction between culpability for murder as an accessory, as opposed to as a principal, we observe that \"there is no practical significance in being labeled an accessory or a principal for the purpose of determining criminal responsibility.... The accessory statute merely provides alternate means by which a substantive crime may be committed.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Montanez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5748883\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/735/#p755\">\n     277 Conn. 735\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 755-56,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20A.2d%20928\">\n     894 A.2d 928\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2006). Indeed, in the present case, the state set forth a factual basis for the plea that could have established the defendant's criminal responsibility as an accessory\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    as a principal, given that ballistic evidence indicated two shooters and the defendant admitted to being one of them.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Simpson\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488137\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/699/#p171\">\n     169 Conn.

Thus, any confusion by the defendant over whether he was pleading guilty as an accessory or as a principal is irrelevant-the state's factual basis put him on notice of both theories, and there is no practical difference between them. Second, the defendant's argument that the plea was not knowing and voluntary and, therefore, required an evidentiary hearing, is incorrect. As we explain in part I of this opinion, the trial court held a hearing on the defendant's request to withdraw his plea and properly concluded that an evidentiary hearing was not warranted because the defendant's true reason for withdrawal was that he had simply changed his mind.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The defendant argues that \"the [trial] court did not establish [the] defendant was even aware of defense counsel's motion\" and that the defendant might not have understood this question.

Therefore, we need not consider the defendant's arguments that the trial court should have entertained the letters because we conclude that it did so in the present case. Indeed, the trial court acknowledged receipt and review of the defendant's letters. Thus, we are not persuaded by the defendant's claim that the hearing was inadequate because the court focused on the motion filed by defense counsel, rather than the defendant's letters. By asking an open-ended question, the trial court afforded the defendant an opportunity to present all of his reasons for seeking to withdraw his guilty plea, not only those contained in his attorney's motion. Additionally, as we explain subsequently, the court's questions provided an ample opportunity for the defendant to explain his rationale for the plea withdrawal, including the reasons outlined in the letters.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The defendant attempts to distinguish\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Anthony D.\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20842\">\n     320 Conn. at 860\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20219\">\n     134 A.3d 219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , from the present case because, in that case, \"neither the defendant nor his attorney requested an evidentiary hearing ....\" That distinction is not persuasive, however, because it was not the lack of a request for an evidentiary hearing that was determinative in\n    <em>\n     Anthony D.\n    </em>\n    but, rather, that the defendant failed to articulate \"specific concerns or facts ... to justify the withdrawal of the defendant's guilty plea at sentencing ....\" Id., at 862,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20219\">\n     134 A.3d 219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
