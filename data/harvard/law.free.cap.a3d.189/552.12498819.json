Defendant appeals the trial court's decision that he violated the terms of his juvenile probation by failing to attend school, comply with his GPS-monitoring requirements, and participate in a Restorative Justice Panel. Defendant also appeals the trial court's decision to revoke his youthful-offender status based on these violations. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. In June 2012, defendant was charged with sexual assault, in violation of 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3252(a)(1), based on allegations that he forced his girlfriend to have sexual intercourse with him without her consent. At that time, defendant was seventeen, and his girlfriend was sixteen. The criminal court transferred defendant to juvenile court in September 2013, but it reversed that decision the next month, returning defendant to criminal court. In December 2013, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea, which was contingent on the family division's accepting defendant for participation in the youthful-offender treatment program, pursuant to 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5281. In February 2014, the family division accepted defendant as a youthful offender and entered the terms of his juvenile probation. The court set a two-year juvenile probationary period, anticipating completion in February 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Between June 2014 and November 2014, defendant's probation officer filed six complaints for violations of probation. By the second complaint, dated July 25, 2014, the probation officer recommended removal from the youthful-offender program, arguing that defendant was not \"amenable to treatment as a youthful offender.\" After three days of hearings, beginning in October 2014 and concluding in January 2015, the court found that defendant had violated the terms of his juvenile probation by (1) failing to attend school without excuse,\n   (2) failing to comply with his GPS-monitoring requirements, and (3) failing to participate in a Restorative Justice Panel. Based on these violations, the trial court revoked defendant's youthful-offender status and returned the case to criminal court for sentencing. Defendant was sentenced to serve three years to life, all suspended except for two years, with credit for time served, and was placed on probation. On appeal, defendant challenges each violation finding, the standard the court used to decide revocation, and the revocation decision. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Violations of Probation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. We first address defendant's arguments that the court erred in finding violations of probation. The State has the burden to show that defendant violated the terms of his probation. 33 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5268(b), 5285(b). The State meets its burden if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a violation of a probation condition that is \"express\" or \"so clearly implied that a probationer, in fairness, can be said to have notice of it.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n    165 Vt. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n    685 A.2d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1082 (1996) (quotation and alterations omitted). If the State meets that burden, \"the burden of persuasion shifts to the probationer to prove that his failure to comply was not willful but rather resulted from factors beyond his control and through no fault of his own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation and alterations omitted). A defendant's conduct is willful if the \"defendant intended to do the act that constituted the violation\" and \"the violation could not result from mistake, an accident, or a misunderstanding.\"\n   <em>\n    Benson v. Muscari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942834\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/1/#p4\">\n    172 Vt. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942834\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/1/#p4\">\n    769 A.2d 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1295 (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5.

Decoteau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994784\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/433/\">\n    2007 VT 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994784\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/433/\">\n    182 Vt. 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994784\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/433/\">\n    940 A.2d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude the record supports the trial court's findings with respect to defendant's school-attendance, GPS-monitoring, and Restorative Justice Panel participation violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A. Failing to Attend School\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. Defendant's juvenile probation certificate required that if he was \"enrolled in school or a training program,\" he had to \"attend daily and on time, unless excused.\" The State produced evidence that defendant had nine unexcused absences between June 2014 and October 2014, plus an additional unexcused absence in November 2014. This evidence supports the trial court's conclusion that defendant violated the terms of his probation by failing to attend school without excuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Defendant challenges the court's findings, arguing that the evidence could not prove a violation because the testimony did not identify specific dates on which defendant was absent. However, the State did introduce specific evidence: two absences between April and June 2014; all five days scheduled for July 2014; two in September 2014; and one in November 2014. This evidence is not \"vague\" or \"general,\" as defendant argues. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7455686\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/638/273/#p275\">\n    638 So.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (La. Ct. App. 1994) (finding state did not bear its burden of proof where only evidence of probation violation was \"vague reference\" to certified copy of out-of-state conviction). Defendant also claims the court erred in finding the\n   absences occurred between June 24, 2014, and October 6, 2014, whereas the evidence established absences between April 14, 2014, and September 30, 2014. We reject this argument as unreasonably technical. Cf.\n   <em>\n    In re Twenty-Four Vt. Utils.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5775432\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/159/363/#p369\">\n    159 Vt. 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5775432\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/159/363/#p369\">\n    618 A.2d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1312 (1992) (dismissing argument about administrative board's analysis as \"overly technical\"). The court found repeated unexcused absences before the first violation-of-probation hearing, and the evidence supports that finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. Next, defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding his unexcused absences \"willful,\" stating the absences resulted from housing and transportation difficulties. See\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n    165 Vt. at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n    685 A.2d at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring probationer to show violation was not willful). The evidence shows that in June 2014, defendant and his family were evicted from their apartment and moved to a motel. They shared one car, the closest bus stop was a few miles away, and defendant had difficulty arranging bus pick-ups. Defendant requested to spend a few nights each week at his sister's home, which was located very close to defendant's school, but the probation officer said this would require the Department for Children and Families to investigate defendant's contact with the young children living with defendant's sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. The evidence supports the trial court's conclusion that defendant's\n   <em>\n    unexcused\n   </em>\n   absences were intentional and not beyond his control. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451501\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/202/1/\">\n    2016 VT 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451501\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/202/1/\">\n    202 Vt. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451501\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/202/1/\">\n    146 A.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining conduct willful if it is \"the result of intentional conduct\" and not \"by accident, mistake, or inadvertence\" (quotation omitted) ). Defendant's school liberally excused his absences due to transportation failures. The evidence shows that defendant's\n   <em>\n    unexcused\n   </em>\n   absences, on which the trial court based its determination, resulted not from problems outside his control, but from defendant's failures to get the absences excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B. Failing to Comply with GPS-Monitoring Requirements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. The terms of defendant's probation required that he \"follow the [Department of Corrections'] special conditions for sex offenders,\" which included that he must \"submit to GPS monitoring as directed by [his] Probation Officer.\" Defendant was informed how the GPS unit worked and that he must charge it for at least two hours each day. When the unit's battery ran low, it would turn red and vibrate for ten to forty minutes before shutting down. Defendant testified that the unit once vibrated for sixty minutes before it shut down. The evidence shows defendant understood how to maintain the GPS battery and allowed it to remain uncharged on multiple occasions, causing it to shut off. Based on this evidence, the court reasonably concluded that defendant violated his GPS-monitoring requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. Defendant argues the State's evidence that he failed to charge the GPS unit was hearsay. Defendant concedes he did not object when the evidence\n   was admitted. In fact, defendant testified to repeated shut-downs and introduced evidence of shut-downs on August 10, 2014, for fifty minutes and on August 11 and 12, 2014, for thirty-one hours. Defendant cannot claim error for evidence he introduced. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Massey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174388\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/180/#p185\">\n    169 Vt. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174388\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/180/#p185\">\n    730 A.2d 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627 (1999) (\"We have addressed claims of error based on evidence introduced by the aggrieved party and held that the party must assume the responsibility for whatever prejudice to his case derived from this evidence.\" (quotation omitted) ). Moreover, defendant did not preserve his objection in the trial court proceedings, and we find no plain error, if any error at all, in its admission.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gauthier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453553\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/543/\">\n    2016 VT 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453553\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/543/\">\n    201 Vt. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453553\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/543/\">\n    145 A.3d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying plain-error review where probationer failed to preserve challenge to probation conditions). Because defendant presented the contested evidence, he cannot show the admission affected his substantial rights or resulted in prejudice against him. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10 (finding plain error only when error \"affects substantial rights and results in prejudice to the defendant\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is defendant's burden to show his actions were not willful, and he did not meet that burden here.\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n    165 Vt. at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n    685 A.2d at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the evidence indicates that accident or mistake caused the shut-downs, rather than defendant's intentional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C. Failing to Participate in the Restorative Justice Panel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. Defendant was required to \"appear before the Restorative Justice Panel and actively participate and complete all of the conditions set by the Panel.\" In July 2014, defendant attended an intake meeting for the Restorative Justice Panel in Springfield, Vermont, as his probation officer ordered. After he told his version of the events underlying his conviction, he was asked \"when the sex happened between him and the victim,\" and he said he could not remember. The Panel's director attended the meeting, and she told defendant she personally knew the victim; it is unclear whether she discussed the victim before or after he told his story. The Panel employees determined that defendant refused to take responsibility for his offense, which is a prerequisite for participating in the Panel, and they informed him that failure to participate would constitute a violation. They offered defendant two days to reconsider his answer. Two days later, defendant left a voice message with the Panel stating that he would not participate in the program without speaking to his lawyer and that he would only attend meetings with his parents and at times convenient to his parents. Later that day, the Panel employees\n   wrote a letter to defendant's probation officer stating that he could not participate in the program because he refused to take responsibility for his offense. When defendant and his probation officer discussed the Panel's decision, defendant said he was uncomfortable with the director's personal relationship with the victim, and he asked to participate in a Hartford Restorative Justice Panel, instead. The probation officer refused, reasoning that it was most \"effective\" to \"go back to where the crime happened to repair the crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14. Defendant's Panel participation was an express condition that he has not met, and he does not argue otherwise. Instead, defendant argues that his failure to participate was due to the Panel's refusal to work with him, rather than his own willful noncooperation. He also argues he could not be cited for violating the condition so early in his probationary term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15.

In\n   <em>\n    Blaise\n   </em>\n   , we reversed a violation finding as premature where the probationer had failed to pay his required fines and there was considerable time remaining in his probationary term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. But\n   <em>\n    Blaise\n   </em>\n   is not analogous. First, unlike in this case, the probationer in\n   <em>\n    Blaise\n   </em>\n   did not\n   <em>\n    refuse\n   </em>\n   to pay the fines; he simply did not pay them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, the probation officer in\n   <em>\n    Blaise\n   </em>\n   was authorized to set a payment schedule but did not; the probation officer made no communications whatsoever regarding the fines prior to the violation citation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Essentially, the certificate predicated payment on a communication that never took place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In contrast, in this case, not only did defendant's probation certificate explicitly require participation, the probation officer ordered defendant to attend the Springfield Restorative Justice Panel, and the Panel employees and defendant's probation officer informed him what participation was required and that failure to participate could constitute a violation. Defendant never asked for more time or gave any indication that he was unaware that participation as ordered was required. We also note that the probation officer had already filed two probation violation complaints before filing the complaint based on defendant's failure to participate. We may presume defendant was fully aware of the consequences of noncompliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18. Most importantly, refusing to participate in court-ordered programming is significantly different from simply failing to pay a fine. Participation in the Restorative Justice Panel had a rehabilitative purpose that was central to defendant's treatment and the purpose of the youthful-offender program. See 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5101(a)(2) (stating purpose of juvenile statutes is \"to provide supervision, care, and rehabilitation which ensure\" public safety, accountability, and ability of juvenile offenders to \"become responsible and productive members of the community\");\n   <em>\n    In re P.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4816302\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/156/303/#p310\">\n    156 Vt. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4816302\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/156/303/#p310\">\n    592 A.2d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (1991) (stating rehabilitative purpose of juvenile statutes \"can only be accomplished when children who have committed acts offensive to community standards and proscribed by our laws are held accountable for their actions so that they can be required to participate in appropriate\n   treatment programs\"). Whether a probationer engages in a program at the beginning or end of the probationary term could affect his or her overall treatment and success in the program, and refusing to participate can call into question the probationer's commitment to rehabilitation. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Lawson v.

The record supports the court's conclusion that defendant violated his requirement to participate in the Restorative Justice Panel, and we decline to disturb the court's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. Revocation of Youthful-Offender Status\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19. In addition to challenging the three violations, defendant challenges the trial court's decision to revoke his youthful-offender status. When a trial court finds that a youthful offender has violated his or her probationary terms, the court \"may ... revoke the youth's status as a youthful offender.\" 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5285(c)(2). The court may also modify the probationary conditions or transfer supervision to the Department of Corrections.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362272\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/969/222/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5285(c)(1), (3). Defendant challenges both the standard the trial court used to determine whether to revoke youthful-offender status and the decision itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A. Standard for Revocation of Youthful-Offender Status\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20. The youthful-offender statute does not provide factors the court should use in deciding whether to revoke youthful-offender status. See 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5285(c)(2) (authorizing revocation but not providing standard). The trial court therefore adopted the standard the Legislature provided for determining whether to grant youthful-offender status in the first place. See 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5284(a), (b) (requiring court to consider public safety, probationer's amenability to treatment, and services available for rehabilitation in deciding whether to grant youthful-offender status). In arguing that this was error, defendant attempts to distinguish a youth's situation at the time of the grant from his situation when facing revocation. He argues that revocation, unlike the grant, entails the \"loss\" of statutory \"protections,\" and therefore the court must weigh that loss in its revocation decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21. We disagree. The Legislature expressly provided factors it intended the court to consider when assessing whether youthful-offender status will be appropriate and effective: public safety, amenability to treatment, and sufficient services for rehabilitation. 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5284(a), (b) ; see\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Sherman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"688117\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/167/613/#p614\">\n    167 Vt. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"688117\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/167/613/#p614\">\n    708 A.2d 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1349 (1998) (mem.) (\"In construing statutes, courts have a duty to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature ....\" (citation omitted) ). Despite defendant's arguments to the contrary, we see no significant difference in a youth's situation when youthful-offender status is granted from when it is revoked. There is no reasonable basis for this Court to craft an alternative standard to the one the Legislature adopted. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"688117\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/167/613/#p614\">\n    167 Vt. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"688117\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/167/613/#p614\">\n    708 A.2d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to alter scope of statute because Legislature expressed no intent to do so, stating \"great care should be exercised by the court not to expand proper construction of a statute into judicial legislation\" (quotation omitted) ). Indeed, defendant conceded in the trial court that the court would be on \"strong ground\" to base its\n   decision on the factors for granting youthful-offender status, and that those factors are \"the crux of how the court decides this case.\" Cf.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant challenges the trial court's revocation decision, arguing, among other things, that the court impermissibly weighed defendant's inadequate sex-offender therapy against him. Whether a trial court revokes youthful-offender status is an exercise of discretion. See 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5285(c) (stating court \"may\" modify juvenile probation if court finds youth has violated his or her probation conditions);\n   <em>\n    Marsigli Estate v.

We conclude that the revocation decision was an abuse of discretion. Although the court concluded that defendant was not amenable to treatment based on multiple findings, the court failed to give sufficient weight to the one factor we consider most significant: defendant's inadequate sex-offender therapy. Had it done so, it would not have revoked his youthful-offender status.

The court found that defendant's probation officer assigned him to a therapist who was not qualified to provide sex-offender\n   therapy and who \"enable[d]\" defendant's refusal to accept responsibility for his offense. The court also observed that despite the confidentiality limitations of a youthful offender, \"a more appropriate therapist could have been found to address [defendant's] needs as a sex offender\" and the Department of Corrections \"may have failed\" in assigning defendant an inadequate therapist. However, the court concluded that defendant probably would still have issues of compliance, given \"the inattention he gave several of his probation conditions, ... his attitude toward probation, probation conditions, and his probation officer in general.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24. This conclusion does not align with the circumstances of this case. As a youthful offender, defendant should have received opportunities for treatment and rehabilitation as part of his juvenile probation. See 33 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5281 - 5288. Given that defendant's underlying conviction was for a sex offense, it was particularly important that treatment include appropriate sex-offender therapy. Based on the court's findings, defendant was never offered adequate sex-offender treatment. His failure to rehabilitate while participating in inappropriate therapy hardly demonstrates that defendant was unamenable to treatment. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695446\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/185/92/\">\n    2008 VT 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695446\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/185/92/\">\n    185 Vt. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695446\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/185/92/\">\n    967 A.2d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"By weighing [the Department for Children and Family's] failings against the juvenile, the court improperly penalized the juvenile for the failings of a state agency over which he had no control.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

We find too speculative the court's prediction that defendant would have violated his probation conditions even if he had received appropriate sex-offender therapy. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court exceeded its discretion in revoking defendant's youth-offender status based, in part, on defendant's inadequate sex-offender therapy. In determining whether defendant is amenable to rehabilitation on remand, the court should give proper consideration to the adequacy of defendant's treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25. We acknowledge that remanding this case presents some procedural difficulties. Defendant is now older than twenty-two years old, and the statute permits participation in the youthful-offender program only until age twenty-two. 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5286(d) (\"If the Court finds that it is in the best interest of the youth and consistent with community safety to continue the case past the age of 18, it shall make an order continuing the Court's jurisdiction up to the age of 22.\"). An appropriate solution to the procedural dilemma will depend on an updated record, reflecting, for example, whether defendant is currently on adult probation and what treatment he has received. We do not have that record. In addition, neither party raised or briefed this issue. We therefore restrict our opinion to those issues raised by the parties and supported by the record before us.

Due notice that an act, or a failure to act, constitutes violation of the terms of probation is an essential precondition to a determination that a probationer has violated those terms. Accordingly, where the probation certificate sets no time for commencement or completion of a particular required task-whether programming, payment of restitution, or some other such task-and ample time remains in the probation period for completion of the task, a probationer cannot be deemed to have violated the condition unless the probation officer provides notice that the probationer must comply with the condition by a certain time, or unless the probationer, by words or deeds, manifests an intention to refuse to complete the task.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28. That a defendant can only be punished for violating probation after due notice of the expectation giving rise to the violation is well established in Vermont. \"[D]ue process requires that a convicted offender be given fair notice as to what acts may constitute a violation of ... probation, thereby subjecting [the probationer] to loss of liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

I reject the majority's suggestion that in the absence of any express timing requirements in the probation condition itself, a requirement that a condition be completed at the beginning of the probation period is clearly implied. I can easily think of many reasons why it may not make sense for a probationer to complete a particular task at the very beginning of a lengthy probation period. It may make sense for a probationer to find housing before looking for a job, if both are required; it may make sense for a probationer to complete a substance abuse assessment before beginning counseling, if both are required. And a probationer may need time to marshal the resources to pay a restitution obligation. In fact, defendant's probation officer testified that he did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   want to focus on getting defendant into a restorative justice program immediately at the beginning of his probation. Instead, he said he wanted to \"hold off on that for a little bit to get [defendant] acquainted to probation,\" and that his real focus at the outset of the probation was to get defendant into counseling and school. This record belies the suggestion that a \"start immediately\" requirement is implicit in probation conditions that do not specify a time for completion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 30. That isn't to say that a probation officer can never put a defendant on notice of an expected time frame. This Court has upheld a probation violation determination for failure to complete programming when ample time remained in the probation period to allow for completion of that programming and the defendant had been expressly notified by the probation officer that completion within a specified time frame was expected. In\n   <em>\n    Provost\n   </em>\n   , for example, this Court applied plain error review in rejecting the defendant's argument that he could not be deemed to have violated the requirement that he complete a domestic violence program eight months into his probation, when the State could not show that he could not have completed the program by the end of his probationary term. 2014 VT 86A, \u00b6\u00b6 13-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787270\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/199/568/\">\n    199 Vt. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20A.3d%20826\">\n    133 A.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Court emphasized that the defendant \"was specifically informed by his probation officer that he must complete the third scheduled intake for [the program] or he would be cited for violating probation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31. Moreover, I agree with the majority that where a defendant indicates an intention to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   complete the task or programming required by the probation condition, a court may find a violation. As the majority notes, we have concluded that a probationer's\n   <em>\n    repeated\n   </em>\n   refusals to discuss sex-related issues with his psychotherapist supported a determination that he had violated the counseling requirement in his probation conditions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

And where the court ordered a probationer to complete a mental health screening by a date certain, and defendant then missed two out of three appointments for the screening and refused to discuss the details of his offense at the appointment he kept, we concluded the trial court's violation determination was supported by the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406622\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/442/#p447\">\n    151 Vt. 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446-47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406622\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/442/#p447\">\n    561 A.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (1998) ;\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Peck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4786214\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/617/#p619\">\n    149 Vt. at 620-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4786214\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/617/#p619\">\n    547 A.2d at 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming probation violation determination where defendant attended counseling sessions and continued to refuse to admit sex-related misconduct\n   <em>\n    after a series of warnings\n   </em>\n   that he must do so).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 32. That there is no implied requirement of immediate performance of probation conditions is consistent with our case law. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Blaise\n   </em>\n   , we considered a probation violation complaint against a defendant who had not paid certain fines pursuant to the probation order.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688086\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/191/565/\">\n    2012 VT 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688086\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/191/565/\">\n    191 Vt. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688086\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/191/565/\">\n    38 A.3d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.). Given the time remaining in the defendant's probationary term, we reversed the trial court's violation determination, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant was on probation for two years, from October 2007 to October 2009. The probation condition authorized the probation officer to set a payment schedule for repayment during that period. The probation contract itemized the amount defendant owed but failed to establish a payment schedule. There was no testimony that a payment schedule was established. In the absence of a payment schedule, and well before the expiration of defendant's probation, there was no support for the claim that defendant had violated the probation\n   condition by failing to make a payment before the VOP complaint was filed. We cannot find a violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. By distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Blaise\n   </em>\n   on the basis that the probation officer in that case had not communicated any fine repayment schedule, and there was no evidence that the defendant had refused to pay them, the majority implicitly concedes that in the absence of one of these two factors, the mere failure to complete a task required by a probationer's conditions cannot support a probation violation complaint when ample time remains in the probationary term for those payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 33. That leads to my second major disagreement with the majority: I take issue with its characterization of the record in this case. There is no dispute that there was ample time for defendant to complete the restorative justice program requirement of his probation; the probation violation complaint came five months into his two-year probationary term, and the restorative justice program was a three-month program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 34. Nor is there any evidence that defendant's probation officer notified him that completion of the program earlier than the end of the probationary term was required. To the extent the majority suggests that defendant's probation officer informed him that failure to complete the intake for the restorative justice program at the time of defendant's initial meeting with program staff could constitute a violation,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17, the record does not support this assertion. Defendant went to an intake meeting for the restorative justice program on July 28. At that time, the representatives of the program asked him to go home and think about what happened and to call them back by July 30 at 8 a.m. to continue the intake. They-not defendant's probation officer-told him that failing to complete the program would result in a probation violation. Defendant left them a voicemail before the appointed time indicating that he wanted to speak with his lawyer before signing anything, and that he needed to meet after 4:00 p.m. so his parents could attend. That same day, the Restorative Justice Panel wrote defendant's probation officer declining to accept him into their program. Defendant's probation officer testified that he met with defendant on August 4 and informed him that he was filing a violation of probation complaint, which he did the next day. The probation officer did not testify that defendant was required to complete the program by a set time, that he instructed defendant to contact the restorative justice program to request another intake opportunity, or that he gave defendant any other opportunity to try to reengage with the restorative justice program. In fact, the probation officer's only testimony concerning his communications about the timing of the restorative justice programming was that at the beginning of the probationary period the probation officer wanted to hold off on the restorative justice requirement in order to focus on other programming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 35. Nor does the evidence support the conclusion that defendant refused to engage in the restorative justice programming. This is not like the cases cited above in which a defendant in programming repeatedly declined to take responsibility for criminal actions, or failed to do so after repeated warnings that such failure would lead to a violation complaint. See\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31. In this case, defendant failed to admit his criminal actions during his initial intake session, was afforded an opportunity to think about his actions, and then indicated that he wanted to talk with his lawyer before proceeding further. He said nothing to suggest that he did not intend to reengage after consulting with his lawyer. He did not fail to take responsibility after\n   multiple warnings. He did not repeatedly deny responsibility over a course of time. There isn't even any evidence that he dragged his feet in conferring with his lawyer. Defendant's probation officer filed a probation violation complaint a week after defendant's unsatisfactory intake session without giving defendant any opportunity to talk with his lawyer or to reengage with the restorative justice program. Where defendant was given time to reflect on his answers to the restorative justice program's intake questions, and then indicated that he wanted to talk to his lawyer before proceeding, I do not believe the record can support the conclusion that defendant has indicated by words or actions that he will not timely complete the required programming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 36. Because I believe the trial court erred in concluding that defendant violated the restorative justice panel condition, and because this violation was central to the trial court's decision to revoke defendant's youthful offender status, I would reverse the revocation as well as the violation and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Defendant also argues that the trial court impermissibly considered evidence that defendant failed to attend school without excuse in December 2014 and January 2015, but the trial court made clear during defendant's January 29, 2015 hearing that those absences were relevant only to the revocation of youthful-offender status. In any case, we must uphold the court's findings if \"fairly and reasonably supported by any credible evidence,\" and the record provides ample evidence, apart from the absences in December 2014 and January 2015, to support the court's findings.\n    <em>\n     Austin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n     165 Vt. at 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160149\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/165/389/#p398\">\n     685 A.2d at 1082\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Because defendant introduced sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that he violated his GPS-monitoring requirements, we need not address his arguments that the trial court's admission of shut-down reports prepared by individuals who did not testify at the hearing amounted to plain error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The State argues that defendant failed to preserve this argument below, and therefore we should not consider it.
