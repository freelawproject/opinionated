(Archer),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   committed legal malpractice regarding an insurance claim for fire damage at plaintiff's restaurant. The malpractice claim against appellants required a choice-of-law analysis because plaintiff sued appellants beyond Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations, but within New Jersey's six-year statute of limitations. By leave granted, appellants challenge a May 10, 2017 Law Division order applying New Jersey's six-year statute of limitations and therefore reinstating plaintiff's malpractice claim against them. Because we find Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations applies under the circumstances presented, we reverse and dismiss plaintiff's claims against appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2002, a fire damaged plaintiff's Bethlehem, Pennsylvania restaurant. Plaintiff retained defendant Spencer Robbins, a New Jersey attorney, to pursue an\n   insurance claim against defendant Sirius America Insurance Company (Sirius). Robbins allegedly negotiated a settlement with Sirius for $240,000, but\n   neglected to inform plaintiff of the settlement offer. Robbins eventually asked Grungo to assist with litigation in Pennsylvania. Grungo is licensed in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. At his deposition, Grungo testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I recall Spencer Robbins calling me, [and] asking me ... to file a writ in Pennsylvania as a placeholder in a matter that he was involved in and ... [was] close to settling or resolving.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Under Pennsylvania rules you can file a writ in order to toll a statute of limitations, as opposed to filing a formal complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2006, Grungo accommodated Robbins' request and filed a writ of summons in Pennsylvania on behalf of plaintiff against Sirius. According to Grungo, he never had any contact with plaintiff, explaining \"my only point of contact was Spencer Robbins.\" Approximately eighteen months after he filed the writ, Grungo informed Robbins he could no longer remain as counsel of record in the placeholder proceeding due to a conflict. The Pennsylvania court eventually dismissed the matter, and the statute of limitations on the insurance claim had run by the time plaintiff learned of the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff next consulted with attorney Nick Sabatine, who wrote to Grungo in March 2009, requesting a copy of his file and alerting him of a possible \"legal malpractice claim.\" In August 2010, plaintiff retained another attorney, defendant David Wikstrom, to pursue the legal malpractice claim. Wikstrom never filed a claim against Robbins or appellants; instead, in May 2011, Wikstrom informed plaintiff he believed plaintiff had a legitimate malpractice claim, but he did not wish to pursue a claim against Archer \"for political reasons.\" In 2012, plaintiff filed its initial complaint in Monmouth County. On October 10, 2014, plaintiff amended its complaint to join appellants, asserting legal malpractice claims against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In December 2014, appellants moved to dismiss all claims against them, arguing the Pennsylvania statute of limitations barred the claims. On February 20, 2015, the trial court granted appellants' dismissal motion. The court found an undisputed \"conflict\n   between New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the statute of limitations for a legal malpractice claim.\" In determining whether Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations or New Jersey's six-year statute of limitations applied, the court applied the most-significant-relationship test found in the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 145 and 6 (Am. Law Inst. 1971).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In applying the most-significant-relationship test, the court found \"both states have a substantial interest in regulating the conduct of attorneys [who] practice within their borders\"; however, the court concluded Pennsylvania had the more significant relationship. As a result, the court applied Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations and dismissed plaintiff's complaint against appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 24, 2017, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    McCarrell v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306698\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/227/569/#p574\">\n    227 N.J. 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306680,12306698\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/207/\">\n    153 A.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), which held courts should use the substantial-interest test to resolve statute-of-limitations conflicts, as set forth in the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142 (Am. Law Inst. 1971). Based upon\n   <em>\n    McCarrell\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff successfully moved for reconsideration and the trial court vacated its order dismissing the malpractice claims against appellants. The court concluded, \"Maintenance of the claim\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   serve a substantial interest of the\n   forum state[:] regulating licensed New Jersey attorneys [who] practice law within the state.\" The court noted that it previously found \"both states have a substantial interest in regulating the conduct of attorneys [who] practice within their borders ....\" The court therefore applied New Jersey's six-year statute of limitations and reinstated plaintiff's malpractice claims against appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We apply a de novo standard when reviewing an order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The parties agree that if Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations applies, then plaintiff's claims against appellants fail. However, if New Jersey's six-year statute of limitations applies, then plaintiff's claims against appellants stand. This appeal therefore presents the narrow issue of which state's statute of limitations applies; because this constitutes a strictly legal issue, we review de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McCarrell\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held \"that section 142 of the Second Restatement is now the operative choice-of-law rule for resolving statute-of-limitations conflicts ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306698\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/227/569/#p574\">\n    227 N.J. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306680,12306698\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/207/\">\n    153 A.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    McCarrell\n   </em>\n   , the trial court reconsidered its decision and repeated its finding that New Jersey has a substantial interest. Therefore, it applied the New Jersey statute of limitations in reinstating the claims against appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Appellants contend the trial court misapplied\n   <em>\n    McCarrell\n   </em>\n   in finding New Jersey's statute of limitations applicable. Plaintiff counters that New Jersey has a substantial interest in regulating the conduct of New Jersey licensed attorneys. In reply, appellants emphasize the absence of any \"causal nexus\" between Grungo's New Jersey attorney license and plaintiff's claimed damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We agree with appellants that the trial court erred in concluding the New Jersey statute of limitations applied to this case. The only pertinent connection to New Jersey-that Grungo, a New Jersey licensed attorney, worked in a New Jersey office-falls short of establishing a substantial interest for New Jersey to apply its statute of limitations here. All other relevant facts point to Pennsylvania: the fire and resulting loss occurred in Pennsylvania; plaintiff is incorporated in Pennsylvania; Robbins enlisted Grungo because he is licensed in Pennsylvania; and Grungo filed the underlying complaint in Pennsylvania. The circumstances\n   here are analogous to\n   <em>\n    Heavner\n   </em>\n   where the only connection to New Jersey was the defendant's incorporation in New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heavner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1320989\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/63/130/\">\n    63 N.J. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   134 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20412\">\n    305 A.2d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, unlike the\n   defendants in\n   <em>\n    McCarrell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gantes\n   </em>\n   that manufactured allegedly defective products in New Jersey, here appellants allegedly acted negligently in Pennsylvania by allowing a Pennsylvania court to dismiss a case concerning a loss sustained by a Pennsylvania corporation to its Pennsylvania restaurant. Therefore we find New Jersey does not have a substantial interest in plaintiff's claims against appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, as the New Jersey State Bar Association contends in its amicus brief, applying New Jersey's six-year statute of limitations here would frustrate the purpose of adopting the substantial-interest test and defy public policy. In\n   <em>\n    McCarrell\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained that the substantial-interest test: \"places both this State's and out-of-state's citizens on an equal playing field, thus promoting principles of comity; advances predictability and uniformity in decision-making; and allows for greater certainty in the expectations of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    McCarrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306698\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/227/569/#p574\">\n    227 N.J. at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306680,12306698\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/207/\">\n    153 A.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Robbins had obtained assistance from an attorney in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania statute of limitations would apply without question. That Robbins sought assistance from an attorney, who holds a New Jersey license and works in New Jersey, bears no relation to the malpractice allegation and therefore should not change the outcome here. To hold otherwise would subject New Jersey attorneys also practicing in other states to disparate, unfair treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We also note defendant Wikstrom filed a brief arguing the Rules of Professional Conduct establish that New Jersey has a substantial interest in regulating the conduct of New Jersey attorneys, whether that conduct occurs within or outside New Jersey borders. That argument lacks persuasion. While RPC 8.5(a) does provide for disciplinary action for conduct outside of New Jersey, RPC 8.5(b) clarifies that disciplinary action based on claims filed outside of New Jersey should apply the rules of the jurisdiction where the claim is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the reasons stated, we vacate the trial court's May 10, 2017 order, and remand for the court to enter an order dismissing the\n   claims against appellants as barred by Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Vacated and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We refer to Grungo and Archer collectively as appellants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
