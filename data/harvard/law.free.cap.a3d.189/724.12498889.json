In the matter before us, we conclude that the court's order requiring Todd A. Wood to pay a specific amount of child support to Shelly R. Higgins did not contain a self-effectuating provision that immediately reduced Wood's child support payments upon his oldest child reaching age eighteen. We also conclude that neither administrative collateral estoppel nor administrative equitable estoppel was properly raised and therefore those doctrines cannot provide a remedy to Wood. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment on Wood's post-divorce motions in which the District Court (Bangor,\n   <em>\n    Lucy, J.\n   </em>\n   ) ordered changes in Wood's child support effective only after Wood's service of the post-divorce motion to modify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.

Higgins and Wood were married in May 1997 and have three children who were born in 1991, 1998, and 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Higgins filed a complaint for divorce on March 20, 2007, and a family law magistrate (\n   <em>\n    Langner, M.\n   </em>\n   ) entered a divorce judgment on June 14, 2007, that provided for Higgins to have primary residence and required Wood to pay child support of $297.15 per week for the three children, who were then ages fifteen, nine, and five. The child support worksheet attached to the judgment provided as follows with respect to the overall weekly support obligation of the parents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Basic weekly support for all children up to 18 years (or up to 19 years if still in high school) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a Total number of children 3\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   b Number of children ages 0-11\n   <em>\n    2\n   </em>\n   multiplied by amount from table\n   <em>\n    102 X 2 = 204\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   c Number of children ages 12-17\n   <em>\n    1\n   </em>\n   multiplied by amount from table\n   <em>\n    126\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court added in the $35 cost of health insurance for the three children without apportioning it per child. The order made Wood responsible for ninety-one percent of the weekly support and credited him for paying the cost of health insurance, resulting in the $297 weekly support amount that was required by the judgment for support of the three children. The child support order stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The child support obligation shall continue for each child until that child reaches the age of 18; provided, however, that if the child has not graduated, withdrawn, or been expelled from secondary school as defined in Title 20-A, the child support shall continue until the child graduates or reaches the age of 19, whichever occurs first[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In addition, the order stated, \"Any party to this action may ask the court to review the amount of child support and if appropriate, to modify it in accordance with the state's child support guidelines. To start this process, a party must file with the court a Motion to Modify.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 5] To assure that Wood met his child support obligations, Higgins pursued support enforcement through the Department of Health and Human Services Division of Support Enforcement and Recovery, which withheld Wood's wages to provide Higgins with the ordered child support beginning in the middle of 2008. In 2009, the oldest child turned eighteen, having already graduated from high school. At about that time, Wood asked the Department to reduce his payments, though he did not move to modify the judgment in the District Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department made no adjustment at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Wood continued to pay child support in the amount ordered and took no further action until February 2015 when his telephone calls to the Department prompted the Regional Manager of the Department's Division of Support Enforcement and Recovery to send him a notice that the Department was adjusting the child support obligation down to $182 per week. The $182 amount was apparently intended to reflect a flat reduction of the basic weekly support by the $126 amount originally allocated to the oldest child in the 2007 child support worksheet, with the health insurance provisions remaining the same despite the termination of support for one child, and the support amounts for\n   the other two children remaining unchanged despite the increases that should have occurred when each of the younger children reached age twelve. At the time of the February 2015 letter, the two younger children were ages seventeen and thirteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Several months later, in July 2015, the Director of the Division informed Wood that the February decision was in error and that Wood needed to file, in court, a motion to modify the child support order to seek any reduction in the ordered support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 8] On July 24, 2015, Wood filed two motions in the District Court-a motion to modify and a motion for determination of overpayment. He argued that he had overpaid by more than $35,000 over the course of six years because, after the oldest child turned eighteen, his child support obligation should have been reduced by $114 per week. Although the use of the summary judgment process in family law matters is not authorized,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 56(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wood also moved for summary judgment on his post-judgment motions, submitting a statement of material facts and supporting evidence. In the motion for summary judgment, he raised issues of administrative collateral estoppel and equitable estoppel. The parties filed opposing and reply memoranda and statements of material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 9] On March 21, 2016, the family law magistrate (\n   <em>\n    Chandler, M.\n   </em>\n   ) held a hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties informed the magistrate that they had agreed to a series of three child support orders to apply from the filing of Wood's motion, in July 2015, forward. The first of these orders imposed an obligation of $280.50 per week toward the support of the two youngest children through January 2016 when the middle child turned eighteen. The order explicitly provided that the support would decrease to $207.56 upon the youngest child becoming the only child for whom support was owed, and the final order required Wood to pay $187 per week beginning in August 2016 based on the Department's revised child support table.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    17 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   144 351-15 to -23 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 10] The magistrate then accepted a collection of stipulated exhibits, and the parties offered legal arguments regarding the amount of child support owed from the oldest child's eighteenth birthday in 2009 through the July 31, 2015, effective date of the first agreed-upon order. Thus, the court held the trial on a stipulated record, and the parties presented argument on the applicable law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose v. Parsons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860002\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/118/220/\">\n    2015 ME 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860002\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/118/220/\">\n    118 A.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The magistrate entered the modified child support orders to which the parties had agreed. The magistrate then concluded that Wood could not recover any overpayment for child support paid prior to his service of the motion to modify because the parties' 2007 judgment did not provide dollar amounts by which the child support order would self-adjust upon each\n   child's emancipation or attainment of the age of twelve. The court ordered the Department to determine any amount of overpayment or underpayment that may have arisen while the motion to modify was under consideration by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The Department filed an unopposed motion to amend the findings of fact to correct minor factual errors, which the magistrate granted. Wood objected to the magistrate's order on the grounds that the magistrate applied the incorrect law and that only a judge-not a magistrate-had the authority to rule on the motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 118(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 13] The court (\n   <em>\n    Lucy, J.\n   </em>\n   ) reviewed the magistrate's decision and entered a judgment in which it adopted the magistrate's order on the modification of child support, agreed with the magistrate that the Department did not have the authority to adjust the court-ordered amount of child support, and concluded that summary judgment must be denied, in part because a party may not move for summary judgment on a post-judgment motion in a family matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860002\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/118/220/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to the alleged overpayment, the court explained that, because the divorce judgment did not include explicit prospective calculations of child support based on the children reaching age twelve or eighteen, a motion to modify the judgment was necessary for the court to find the proper amount of child support to be paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Wood appealed from the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1901(1) (2017) ; 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 104 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2 (Tower 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department filed a brief that included a \"supplement\" consisting of the child support worksheet and order from\n   <em>\n    Lund v. Lund\n   </em>\n   , a District Court case that resulted in an opinion from us.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401270\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/927/1185/\">\n    2007 ME 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401270\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/927/1185/\">\n    927 A.2d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Wood objected and moved to strike the supplement because it was not in the record available to the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We ordered that the issue would be considered along with the merits of the appeal, and we now take judicial notice of the documents submitted by the Department and address the merits of Wood's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Evid. 201(b)(2), (d) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jonas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317782\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/120/\">\n    2017 ME 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317782\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/120/\">\n    164 A.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a court may take judicial notice of the action taken by a court in a final judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 15] Wood argues that the child support order included in the 2007 divorce judgment provided for a self-effectuating reduction in the amount of child support when the parties' oldest child turned eighteen in 2009 and that he is therefore entitled to recoup an overpayment of child support. Here, we use the term \"self-effectuating\" to describe a provision in a judgment that explicitly articulates a change in a support obligation on an identified date or upon the occurrence of a specific event, such that the new, explicitly identified amount takes immediate effect and is enforceable. In other words, we have substituted the term \"self-effectuating\" for the longer description used previously for a \"self-executing provision that automatically amends a court order\" upon the occurrence of a specific event or the arrival of a specific date.\n   <em>\n    Bartlett v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    2005 ME 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    866 A.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 16] To review whether the judgment at issue here was self-effectuating such that Wood was entitled to reduce his payments without further order of the court, we (A) summarize the alternative administrative and court processes for establishing and modifying child support, (B) examine the law governing self-effectuating adjustments in court-issued child support orders, (C) review whether the District Court properly applied the law, and (D) address the application of principles of collateral and equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A. Methods of Establishing and Modifying Child Support Orders in Maine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 17] In Maine, there are different methods for parents to obtain enforceable orders of child support. Most commonly, a parent will seek a child support order through (1) the Department in an administrative proceeding,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2304 (2017) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    17 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   144 351-36 to -41, ch. 8 (2016), or (2) the District Court in an action for divorce or for the determination of parental rights and responsibilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 901, 1652, 1653(2)(D)(3), 1653(8) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We summarize the methods for establishing and enforcing each of these types of orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.

Although the worksheet accompanying the 2007 child support order identified the basic weekly support amount for the parties' oldest child as $126 while Wood was responsible for support for three children at younger ages, the order did not specify the amount of support owed upon the termination of support for the oldest child, an event that occurred only after one of the younger children had reached age twelve. Absent such specificity, the court could not enforce any amount other than that specified in the 2007 divorce judgment. The court therefore properly limited Wood to the remedy of moving to\n   <em>\n    modify\n   </em>\n   the child support order to determine how much support was owed for the two younger children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   [\u00b6 45] Once Wood did move to modify the amount of child support, the court, based on the parties' agreement, ordered a very modest change in the amount of support owed for the period beginning when the motion to modify was served. The obligation for that period was reduced from $297 per week to $280.50 per week. The court, again based on the parties' agreement, also entered modified child support orders providing for exact modifications on specific future dates based on the children's changes in age and a change in the child support table.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2009(2) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    17 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   144 351-15 to -23. Because the original judgment lacked this degree of specificity, however, the court correctly concluded that, in the absence of a motion to modify, no change in the amount of child support took effect upon the oldest child reaching age eighteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   [\u00b6 46] To consider fully Wood's argument that he has overpaid by more than $35,000, we attempt to estimate the amount of support that would have resulted\n   from an application of the guidelines if Wood had filed a motion to modify immediately when the oldest child reached age eighteen. Although Wood contends that the 2007 child support worksheet establishes the amount owed for each child, the amount owed per child increased pursuant to the guidelines if there were only two children subject to a child support order, and the amount owed for a younger child increased when the child reached age twelve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Dec. 1, 2008),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2011 (Pamph. 2010);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Feb. 8, 2014),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2011 (Supp. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   [\u00b6 47] Assuming that the cost of health insurance for two children was identical to the cost for coverage for all three children, and assuming that each party's income remained the same, had Wood filed a motion immediately after his oldest child's eighteenth birthday, we estimate that his total child support obligation pursuant to the guidelines in 2009 would only have been reduced by approximately $51 per week, not the $114 per week that he asserts could be subtracted from the original obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Dec. 1, 2008). Moreover, the child support table was updated over time, and based on the table in effect from 2013 when the youngest child turned twelve through 2015 when Wood moved to modify, Wood's obligation for the two youngest children would have\n   <em>\n    exceeded\n   </em>\n   the originally ordered $297 per week in child support for the three children.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Feb. 8, 2014). Therefore, even if Wood had filed a motion to modify immediately upon the oldest child reaching age eighteen, it is unlikely that his child support obligation would have been reduced over the years at issue by the substantial amount that Wood claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   [\u00b6 48] Although the dissent posits that our holding produces an unfair result, any interpretation of the law in this area will produce a result that may seem unfair to one party or the other. Due to the divorce judgment's language and the identified ambiguities in our earlier case law, neither Higgins nor Wood could be certain about the amount of support owed after the oldest child reached age eighteen. Interpreting the judgment as we have, Wood has paid somewhat more than he would have pursuant to the child support guidelines then in effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Feb. 8, 2014); Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Dec. 1, 2008). If we were to interpret the change in support as Wood suggests, however, Higgins-the parent providing primary residence for the children-would have received significantly less than the amount of child support that she was entitled to pursuant to those guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Feb. 8, 2014); Child Support Guidelines and Calculation Tables (effective Dec. 1, 2008). It is hoped that today's clarification of the law will increase certainty and predictability for families and the Department and avoid this shifting sense of unfairness in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   D. Administrative Collateral Estoppel and Equitable Estoppel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [\u00b6 49] Wood raised issues of administrative collateral estoppel and equitable estoppel in his motion for summary judgment, and he now argues that the court\n   erred in failing to grant him relief pursuant to those doctrines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b6 50] The Maine Rules of Civil Procedure do not allow for motions for summary judgment on post-judgment motions in family matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 56(a) (\"A party seeking to recover upon a\n   <em>\n    claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim or to obtain a declaratory judgment\n   </em>\n   may move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in the party's favor upon all or any part thereof.\" (emphasis added) ). Thus, these arguments were not properly raised in the District Court, and neither the magistrate nor the District Court could adjudicate the issues. Wood did not seek conclusions of law concerning either of these doctrines after the court entered its judgment on the post-divorce motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   [\u00b6 51] Thus, although Wood has argued the doctrines of administrative collateral estoppel and equitable estoppel on appeal, these arguments were never properly presented to the trial court for consideration. We cannot, in this procedural posture, provide any meaningful appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b6 52] Moreover, even if the issues had been presented properly, Wood could not prevail. Although Wood contends that Higgins and the Department may not relitigate the determination that the Department reached in its February 2015 letter, administrative collateral estoppel cannot preclude a court from ruling on a legal issue presented through a motion to modify court-ordered child support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larrivee v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b6 54] Judgments in family matters should provide certainty that the amount of court-ordered child support will remain in place unless and until that amount is either (1) superseded by a predictable, prospectively designated amount that is explicitly stated in the child support order itself or (2) modified by the court upon a proper motion. We have not authorized, and do not here authorize, self-help in changing the amount of child support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401270\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/927/1185/\">\n    2007 ME 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401270\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/927/1185/\">\n    927 A.2d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    2005 ME 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    866 A.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to the concerns expressed by the dissent, this clarification and certainty of process will\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   litigation and prevent the stress and surprise that happened here when a parent, after paying a specific amount of child support for six years, sought to reclaim thousands of those dollars from his children's mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   [\u00b6 55] When a judgment entered after January 18, 2005, does not include an explicit amount for the future obligation, a new court order will be necessary to establish the amount owed when circumstances change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    2005 ME 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 12-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    866 A.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither a parent nor the Division of Support Enforcement and Recovery may unilaterally reduce the amount of court-ordered support owed when the judgment does not specify the amount of the reduction.

We are similarly guided by this concept when tasked with interpreting court orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burnell v. Burnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314138\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/390/\">\n    2012 ME 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314138\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/390/\">\n    40 A.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Led by this bedrock tenet, the analysis in this case must begin with an examination of the plain language of 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1653(12)(A) (2017), which states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    12. Termination of order.\n   </strong>\n   A court order requiring the payment of child support remains in force as to each child\n   until the order is altered by the court or until that child:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   Attains 18 years of age....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   [\u00b6 59] As written, the language of section 1653(12)(A) is simple, logical, and clear. Keeping in mind that roughly seventy-five percent of the litigants in family court navigate the system without an attorney,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20Me.%20Laws%201654\">\n    2014 Me. Laws 1654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (State of the Judiciary address of Chief Justice Leigh I. Saufley to 2d Reg. Sess. of 126th Legis.), the language in section 1653(12)(A) clearly states that when a child turns eighteen, the order, as to that child, is no longer in force. Despite this clarity and simplicity, the Court now engrafts two new requirements upon section 1653(12)(A) : (1) a self-effectuation concept that is not present in the plain language of the statute, and (2) an affirmative duty upon litigants to initiate litigation that the statute neither anticipates nor requires. Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 1, 15, 54-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   [\u00b6 60] After today's Opinion, if an obligor has more than one child, that obligor can no longer look to the plain language of section 1653(12)(A) in order to know what happens when one of their children turns eighteen. Section 1653(12)(A) is no longer sufficient on its own. The Court uses the new term, \"self-effectuating,\" which does not appear in case law, in statute, or in the court order at issue in this case. Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 1, 15. In\n   <em>\n    Bartlett v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the Court used the term \"undifferentiated\" to refer to the child support order, which did not provide a different amount when one child, but not the others, had reached the age of eighteen.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    2005 ME 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    866 A.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, undifferentiated orders do not distinguish between the amount owed for each child, but, rather, contain only one figure to represent the amount owed for all children. The\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   Court said that \" section 1653(12)\n   <em>\n    specifies no formula or method\n   </em>\n   to adjust payment obligations when one child, among several covered by a single, undifferentiated child support payment obligation, reaches age eighteen.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   [\u00b6 61] Here, the Court's use of the term \"self-effectuating\" effectively amends section 1653(12)(A) to include a provision that the Legislature did not provide for in the statute. However, contrary to the Court's conclusion, an order can differentiate the amount owed for each child\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   creating a formula for calculating the remaining support owed for the children still under age eighteen. By interposing the concept of a \"self-effectuating\" order, the Court today takes the \"undifferentiated\" language from\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   one step further. Ultimately, the Court should not amend the statute to include a provision that it acknowledges the Legislature did not contemplate in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   [\u00b6 62] The Legislature did not qualify the straightforward plain language of the statute by adding that,\n   <em>\n    if there are other children, then the order remains in effect beyond the oldest child's eighteenth birthday, until such time that the court makes adjustments to the order\n   </em>\n   . Despite the absence of this or similar language in the statute, the Court today amends the plain language of section 1653(12)(A) to include this new requirement. Court's Opinion \u00b6 40. Such a statutory amendment should be left to the Legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [\u00b6 63] Turning to this case, the child support order, which mirrors the statute, is clear: \"The child support obligation shall continue for each child until that child reaches the age of 18 ....\" The child support worksheet, which is incorporated into the child support order, distinguishes between the amount owed for the oldest child and the amount owed for the younger children. Based on the worksheet, it is a simple task to determine how much child support is attributed to the eighteen-year-old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The language in the order is clear and unambiguous and should therefore be given its full weight and effect. The overall child support obligation should have been reduced by the amount specified in the child support worksheet attributed to the oldest child when that child turned eighteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   B. Reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   [\u00b6 64] As the Court acknowledges, subsequent to\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   , the Legislature passed legislation to circumvent the harshness of the holding in that case. Court's Opinion \u00b6 33; P.L. 2005, ch. 352, \u00a7 5 (codified as subsequently amended at 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2006(8)(G) (2017) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because of this legislative action, any reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   [\u00b6 65] The new legislation placed the burden on the courts, not the obligor, and put the obligee, in this case, the State, on notice of the need for an order that makes an automatic adjustment when there are children who have not yet attained the age of eighteen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2006(8)(G). When the court fails to include such a \"self-effectuating\" provision in an order, and the obligee fails to secure such an order, then the plain meaning of the order and the statute should prevail: the obligor's obligation for a child ends when the child reaches age eighteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   [\u00b6 66] Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   did not turn on the need for a \"self-effectuating\" order; rather, it turned on the distinction between differentiated and undifferentiated orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    2005 ME 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n    866 A.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   Court concluded that the order was undifferentiated.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038786\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/829/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, based on the incorporated child support worksheet in\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   , it is arguable that the order there, like the order here, was differentiated because the worksheet delineated the different amounts owed for the children based upon their ages. The\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   opinion does not demonstrate whether that issue-differentiated versus undifferentiated-was fully litigated on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   C. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   [\u00b6 67] With its opinion today, the Court is not only legislating new requirements for litigants involved in family matters, it is increasing the volume of litigation and making the process exceedingly more complicated for the many self-represented litigants in family court. Given the plain language of both section 1653(12)(A) and the order in this case, when the child attained the age of eighteen, the child support obligation for that child should have terminated without the need for the obligor to return to court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    As the Court intimates, the subsequent amendment has no relevance here. Court's Opinion \u00b6 33 n.11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
