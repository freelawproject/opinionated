There are two issues before this Court: (1) whether BHA's Order is a collateral order pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure (Rule) 313 ; and, (2) whether BHA erred or abused its discretion by denying the Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 12, 2012, the Common Pleas Court appointed the Support Center for Child Advocates as attorney and G.A.L. to represent H.M.'s interests in connection with criminal and civil proceedings related to abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   H.M.'s father J.C. is the indicated perpetrator of abuse against H.M., and the appellant in the underlying administrative appeal seeking to have the indicated report expunged. The indicated report was based on allegations that J.C. raped H.M. On February 14, 2017, H.M.'s G.A.L. submitted a letter to BHA requesting acknowledgement of party status based on BHA's Standing Practice Order (SPO),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which governs practice before BHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 24, 2017, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a Rule to Show Cause why H.M.'s G.A.L. should not be considered a party to the proceedings. J.C. and DHS did not object or respond to the Rule. H.M.'s G.A.L., upon receiving no response from his request, filed the Motion on May 3, 2017. On May 11, 2017, the ALJ denied the Motion. The ALJ determined that H.M. was represented by the existing parties therein, that H.M.'s G.A.L.'s request for party status in the underlying matter was a Petition to Intervene under Section 35.28 of the General Rules of Administrative Practice and Procedure (GRAPP),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and H.M.'s G.A.L. did not meet the required criteria to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 7, 2017, GAL appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By September 7, 2017 order, this Court instructed the parties to address in their respective briefs whether\n   BHA's Order constitutes a collateral order and is subject to appeal to this Court pursuant to Rule 313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Collateral Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Initially, Rule 313 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) General rule.\n   </strong>\n   An appeal may be taken as of right from a collateral order of an administrative agency or lower court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Definition.\n   </strong>\n   A collateral order is an order separable from and collateral to the main cause of action where the right involved is too important to be denied review and the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, the claim will be irreparably lost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pa.R.A.P. 313. \"An appeal of an order denying intervention may fall within the definition of an appealable collateral order pursuant to [Rule] 313(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Twp. of Radnor v.

DHS rejoins that the rights involved are J.C.'s reputational interests and H.M.'s interests are represented by DHS.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   As noted above, the collateral order doctrine permits an appeal as of right from a non-final collateral order if the order satisfies the three requirements set forth in Rule 313(b).

The relevant appeal is J.C.'s appeal from the expunction hearing, wherein, BHA will determine whether J.C.'s name is to be maintained on the ChildLine &amp; Abuse Registry (ChildLine Registry).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although H.M. is the child victim in the appeal, we must determine H.M.'s legal connection to the expunction hearing's outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The issue before BHA in an expunction hearing is whether the indicated report of child abuse against a perpetrator should be maintained on the ChildLine Registry. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A report of child abuse is characterized as an 'indicated report' if an investigation by the county agency or [DHS] determines that 'substantial evidence' of the alleged abuse exists based on available medical evidence, the child protective service investigation, or an admission of the facts of abuse by the perpetrator. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303.... The [Section 6331 of the Child Protective Services Law (Law) ] requires [DHS] to maintain a statewide registry consisting of summaries of indicated reports of child abuse. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6331.\n   <strong>\n    The burden is on the appropriate county agency to show that the indicated report of abuse is accurate and being maintained in a manner consistent with the [ ] Law.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6303, 6341(c). After a summary of an indicated report is entered in the [ChildLine] Registry, the perpetrator is notified that his or her ability to obtain employment in a child-care facility or program or a public or private school may be adversely affected by the entry of the report in the Registry. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6338(a). When an individual seeks employment that would bring him or her in direct contact with children or in which there is a significant likelihood of regular contact with children, or when a person resides in a 'family day-care home,' that person must provide a certification, obtained within the preceding year from [DHS], of whether he or she is named in the [ChildLine] Registry as a perpetrator in an indicated report of child abuse. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6344(a), (b)(2), 6344.1(a), (b), 6344.2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    G.V. v.
