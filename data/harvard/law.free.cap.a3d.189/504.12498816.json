East Coast Vapor, LLC (Petitioner), has filed a Petition for Review (Petition) in this Court's original jurisdiction and an Application for Summary Relief (Application) on its Petition seeking a declaratory judgment that the General Assembly's inclusion of these items under the definition of \"tobacco products\" violates the Constitutions. Petitioner similarly claims that Pennsylvania Department of Revenue's (DOR) imposition of the TPTA tax on separately packaged component parts of an e-cigarette that DOR considers \"integral\" to the e-cigarette device violates due process because the \"integral\" component parts do not deliver tobacco. Petitioner also argues that DOR's interpretation of the TPTA as separately taxing the \"integral\" component parts of an e-cigarette is unsupported by the TPTA's plain language and violates the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOR counters that Petitioner prematurely invoked this Court's jurisdiction and should have first exhausted its available administrative remedies by presenting its claims to the Board of Finance and Revenue (Board). DOR contends that Petitioner may not bypass the Board because Petitioner has not raised a substantial constitutional challenge to the TPTA and the Board's review is an available and adequate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner's claim in this case, that the definition of \"tobacco products\" in the TPTA, on its face, violates the right to substantive due process under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions by including items that contain or deliver nicotine even though those products are neither derived from, nor use tobacco, constitutes a direct attack on the validity of the TPTA. Petitioner, therefore, did not need to raise this issue first before the Board. We therefore reach the merits, and hold that there is a rational basis for the General Assembly to define the e-cigarette device and e-liquid that contains nicotine as \"tobacco products.\" However, the plain language of the TPTA does not support authorizing DOR to tax separately packaged component parts of an e-cigarette that DOR considers \"integral\" to the e-cigarette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The TPTA and Petitioner's Substantive Due Process Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In considering the applicability of the TPTA to e-cigarettes and e-liquids, it is helpful to understand how an e-cigarette operates. An \"electronic oral device\" is generally composed of a mouthpiece, a tank, a heating element, and a battery. (Hr'g Tr., Jan. 10, 2018, at 24, 49.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   An \"e-liquid\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is placed into the tank, and when\n   the device is turned on, the battery powers the heating element, which heats the e-liquid into a vapor. A person inhales the vapor through the mouthpiece. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25, 51-52.) This process is sometimes referred to as vaping. E-liquid can contain nicotine in varying concentrations, up to 24 milligrams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The TPTA imposes a 40 percent tax on \"tobacco products,\" which includes \"electronic cigarettes.\" Sections 1201-A, 1202-A(a.1) of the TPTA, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8201-A, 8202-A(a.1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The TPTA defines \"electronic cigarettes\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    An\n   </strong>\n   electronic oral\n   <strong>\n    device\n   </strong>\n   , such as one composed of a heating element and battery or electronic circuit, or both,\n   <strong>\n    which provides a vapor\n   </strong>\n   of nicotine or any other substance and the use or inhalation of which simulates smoking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) The term includes:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (i)\n   <strong>\n    A device\n   </strong>\n   as described in paragraph (1), notwithstanding whether the device is manufactured, distributed, marketed or sold as an e-cigarette, e-cigar and e-pipe or under any other product, name or description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (ii)\n   <strong>\n    A liquid\n   </strong>\n   or substance placed in or sold for use in an electronic cigarette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   72 P.S. \u00a7 8201-A (emphasis added). The 40 percent tax is imposed on the manufacture and wholesale of \"electronic cigarettes,\" which includes both the device and e-liquid. 72 P.S. \u00a7 8202-A(a.1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Petitioner's Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner argues that the TPTA's definition of an e-cigarette as a type of \"tobacco product\" violates the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Petitioner, the TPTA's definition includes items that are neither used to deliver tobacco,\n   nor are actually derived from tobacco. These items include: the \"electronic oral device,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., the e-cigarette; the separately packaged component parts of the e-cigarette that DOR considers \"integral\" to it; \"e-liquid that contains no nicotine\"; and \"e-liquid that contains nicotine that is not derived from tobacco\" but from another source, such as eggplants, potatoes, or tomatoes. (Petition \u00b6\u00b6 27, 58-59, 67, 143, 180; Petitioner's Brief (Br.) at 28.) Therefore, according to Petitioner, these items \"are both logically and scientifically not a tobacco product.\" (Petitioner's Br. at 31.) The General Assembly, Petitioner argues, sought to justify its taxation of these items on the basis that they contain or deliver nicotine, but the General Assembly has not made the required showing that e-cigarettes are harmful to one's health. Moreover, according to Petitioner, \"there is no rational basis for including e-liquid ... without nicotine in the definition of 'tobacco products,' \" while \"not taxing nicotine products sold by pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies as 'tobacco products.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Petitioner seeks a judgment declaring that the definition of \"tobacco products\" as including items not derived or related to tobacco violates its substantive due process rights under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. DOR's Response-Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. DOR's Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, DOR first argues that the Court should dismiss the Petition because Petitioner has not exhausted its administrative remedies. DOR notes that Petitioner claims it is aggrieved by the unlawful collection of taxes, which, DOR argues, Petitioner may contest by petitioning the Board pursuant to Section 503(e) of the Fiscal Code, 72 P.S. \u00a7 503(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOR claims \"a cursory review of the Petition\" shows that Petitioner has not raised a substantial constitutional challenge, so it may not bypass the administrative review process. (DOR's Br. at 9.) Instead, Petitioner merely alleges unconstitutionality and challenges DOR's interpretation of the TPTA. Petitioner has not shown, DOR argues, that it has suffered any harm because Petitioner has paid little in taxes. DOR further argues that \" 'all that [Petitioner] is complaining about is money[,]' \" that is, the amount of tax Petitioner is required to pay based on what items are covered by the TPTA, which, if Petitioner's interpretation of the TPTA is correct, can be refunded to it through the administrative process.

Petitioner's Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, Petitioner argues that it is not required to exhaust its administrative remedies by going before the Board because it has brought a facial constitutional challenge to a statute. Therefore, the administrative agency is not competent to rule on the merits and, thus, the agency cannot provide complete and adequate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Whether Petitioner must exhaust its administrative remedies before invoking this Court's original equity jurisdiction is a threshold question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the doctrine\n   of exhaustion of administrative remedies, \"a party must first exhaust its administrative remedies before invoking this Court's jurisdiction in challenging a final agency adjudication.

Petitioner's Argument Summarized\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although set forth more in depth previously, Petitioner's merits' argument may be summarized as it is a violation of substantive due process for the TPTA to tax items that do not contain or deliver tobacco as \"tobacco products.\" Since these items have no relation to tobacco, Petitioner argues it is irrational to call them \"tobacco products.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. DOR's Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   DOR responds that there is a rational basis for taxing the \"electronic oral device\" and e-liquid containing nicotine as \"tobacco products.\" DOR asserts that it is rational because nicotine is common to both tobacco and some e-liquids, nicotine is addictive, and users of e-cigarettes, particularly younger users, once addicted, may turn to smoking cigarettes. DOR points to the General Assembly's passage of Section 2 of the Tobacco Settlement Agreement Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   35 P.S. \u00a7 5672, as proof of the General Assembly's recognition of the dangers and costs associated with using cigarettes. DOR argues that the tax helps bear the costs of harm resulting from the use of \"tobacco products,\" such as e-cigarettes, while deterring younger people from using these products because of their increased cost. These are rational bases for taxing e-cigarettes, DOR claims. As for e-liquid allegedly containing no nicotine, citing to a study contained in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Final Rule, DOR counters that e-liquid claiming to have no nicotine, in fact, often contains nicotine.

Under certain health care programs, the Commonwealth may provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated\n   with cigarette smoking, and those persons may be eligible to receive such medical assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (3) Under the health care programs described in paragraph (2), the Commonwealth pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (4) Financial burdens imposed on the Commonwealth by cigarette smoking should be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the Commonwealth to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the Commonwealth or are found culpable by the courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (5) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the \"Master Settlement Agreement,\" with the Commonwealth.

Since, as Petitioner acknowledges, the \"electronic oral device\"\n   <strong>\n    can\n   </strong>\n   be used to vape e-liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco, the \"electronic oral device\" has the capability of delivering a \"tobacco product.\" Therefore, there is a rational basis for including \"the electronic oral device\" in the definition of a \"tobacco product.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As for e-liquid containing nicotine from a source other than tobacco, the General Assembly had legitimate state objectives for electing to tax those items. The Surgeon General attributed the prevalence of disease and death stemming from cigarette use to nicotine, which is highly addictive. Office of Smoking and Health, U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., The Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction: a Report of the Surgeon General at 9 (1988) (concluding that \"[c]igarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting,\" that it is the nicotine contained \"in tobacco that causes addiction,\" and that \"[t]he pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Persons, particularly young persons, who start using e-cigarettes and vape e-liquid containing nicotine from tobacco, may become addicted and turn to cigarettes, the use of which can cause diseases that are costly to treat and sometimes deadly. In other\n   words, the use of an e-cigarette to vape e-liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco is a potential gateway to the use of cigarettes. Section 2 of the Tobacco Settlement Agreement Act sets forth legitimate policy objectives seeking to curb the consumption of cigarettes, particularly by young people, in order to reduce the health and financial costs associated with smoking cigarettes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It was these policies that the General Assembly had in mind when the TPTA legislation was proposed.

It is undisputed that some e-liquid contains nicotine. At the preliminary injunction hearing, Joshua Sanders, Petitioner's owner, testified that Petitioner carries e-liquid containing varying concentrations of nicotine, ranging from 0 milligrams up to 24 milligrams. (Hr'g Tr., Jan. 10, 2018, at 52-53.) Petitioner has never alleged that the nicotine contained in e-liquid, albeit allegedly derived from a source other than tobacco, is any different than the nicotine contained in tobacco or any less addicting. Since nicotine is common to both tobacco and e-liquid, and Petitioner has never claimed that the nicotine found in tobacco is any different than the nicotine found in e-liquid, it makes no difference that the nicotine contained in e-liquid contains nicotine from a source other than tobacco. It is, therefore, not \"unreasonable, unduly oppressive or patently beyond the necessities of the case\" to tax a product that is similar to tobacco, when it contains nicotine and is addictive, as a tobacco product.\n   <em>\n    Gambone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20634\">\n    101 A.2d at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, the taxation of e-liquid that contains nicotine and the \"electronic oral device\" that can deliver such e-liquid bears a rational relationship to valid state objectives, as the tax is designed to increase the cost to the consumer, which has the effect of discouraging consumption. With less consumption of e-cigarettes, fewer people may become addicted to nicotine, turn to cigarettes, and suffer the health problems associated therewith, which will, concomitantly, lower the health costs of having to treat the diseases associated with smoking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In short, the General Assembly could have rationally concluded that taxing e-liquid that contains nicotine and the e-cigarette device that can deliver e-liquid containing nicotine as \"tobacco products\" under the TPTA would promote the legitimate state objectives identified in Section 2 of the Tobacco Settlement Agreement Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As for Petitioner's claim about zero-nicotine e-liquid, we need not consider that claim in this facial constitutional challenge. As previously stated, in order to be successful, a facial constitutional challenge requires the challenger to \"demonstrate that a 'substantial number' of the challenged statute's potential applications are unconstitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Clifton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7264164,4192574\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/969/1197/\">\n    969 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1223 n.36. Taxing e-liquid that contains nicotine and the \"electronic oral device\" used to deliver such e-liquid as \"tobacco products\" is plainly legitimate. E-liquid that contains nicotine and the \"electronic oral device\" used to deliver such e-liquid covers a substantial number of potential applications of the TPTA. Thus, regardless of whether it may violate substantive due process to tax zero-nicotine e-liquid as a \"tobacco product,\" Petitioner cannot succeed on its facial constitutional challenge to the TPTA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, to the extent zero-nicotine e-liquid exists as a factual matter, DOR will have an opportunity to interpret and apply the TPTA to those types of e-liquids.\n   <em>\n    Lehman\n   </em>\n   , 839 A.2d at 276 (noting that the agency has the authority \"to interpret the statute it is charged with administering to avoid an unconstitutional application\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Petitioner's Br. at 23.) The General Assembly, Petitioner argues, could have easily defined an e-cigarette to include \"integral\" component parts if the General Assembly had wanted those items taxed when packaged separately, but it did not do so. Petitioner asserts that DOR has, therefore, rewritten the TPTA, which it may not do. While DOR attempts to justify its interpretation on the basis that an e-cigarette could be sold disassembled in order to evade the tax, that issue is for the General Assembly to resolve, Petitioner argues. Based on Petitioner's interpretation of the TPTA, it claims that it owes a \"Floor Tax\" of only $2491,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and not, as DOR agents determined after conducting an inventory of Petitioner's shops in January 2017, a Floor Tax of $30,691.58 before any penalties are assessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Previously, DOR had used a more expansive definition of component parts, but DOR has narrowed its definition to \"integral\" component parts, such as replacement coils, regulated mods, and tanks.

The TPTA defines \"tobacco products\" to include \"electronic cigarettes,\" which it further defines, in relevant part, as \"\n   <strong>\n    [a]n electronic oral device\n   </strong>\n   , such as one composed of a heating element\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   battery or electronic circuit, or both, which provides a vapor of nicotine or any other substance and the use or inhalation of which simulates smoking.\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 8201-A (emphasis added). As can be seen from the plain language of the TPTA, Section 1201-A does not include the term\n   \"integral\" or \"component parts.\" Instead, it refers to a singular, integrated device that contains\n   <strong>\n    both\n   </strong>\n   a heating element and a power source, which, working together, provides a vapor. (Hr'g Tr., Jan. 10, 2018, at 50-51, 143 (testimony that the coil replacement contains a piece of wire that is used to heat the e-cigarette).) Therefore, \"integral\" component parts of an e-cigarette do not fit within the definition of \"electronic cigarette.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   What DOR would have us do, if we were to adopt its interpretation, is add terms to the TPTA under the guise of interpreting it, which we may not do.\n   <em>\n    Shafer Elec. &amp; Constr. v.

Had the General Assembly wanted to include as taxable the \"integral\" component parts of an e-cigarette, it could have easily done so, as the federal statute does.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 201(rr)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20321\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rr)(1) (defining a \"tobacco product\" as \"any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any\n   <strong>\n    component\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    part\n   </strong>\n   , or\n   <strong>\n    accessory\n   </strong>\n   of a tobacco product (except for raw materials other than tobacco used in manufacturing a component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product)\") (emphasis added); Deeming Tobacco Prods.

However, the General Assembly did not do so, and, contrary to DOR's assertion, a plain language interpretation of the TPTA does not lead to absurd results that would require us to otherwise rewrite the TPTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We can posit rational reasons why the General Assembly might have chosen to tax only the \"electronic oral device\" and not its component parts. The General Assembly might have thought, with the TPTA's already high rate of taxation, that also including the component parts of an e-cigarette would drive vaping companies out of business. The General Assembly might also have desired the TPTA to be easily administered and applied so that both the DOR and vaping companies would know what items are taxable. Of course, as with any tax, there will be some who seek to avoid or evade the tax. DOR, however, has the power to enforce the law and to lobby the legislature should evasion of the TPTA tax by disassembly of the \"electronic oral device\" prove to be widespread. We conclude that a plain language interpretation of the TPTA does not lead to absurd results merely because some vaping companies may attempt to evade the tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Therefore, we hold that DOR's interpretation of the TPTA to include as taxable separately packaged component parts of an e-cigarette that DOR considers \"integral\" is unsupported by the plain language of the TPTA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Petitioner has raised a facial constitutional challenge to the TPTA by claiming that it is a violation of substantive due process for the TPTA to tax, as \"tobacco products,\" products that contain or deliver nicotine even though those products are not derived from, nor use tobacco. This challenge may be presented to us without\n   Petitioner first having to exhaust its administrative remedies. However, it is not a violation of substantive due process for the TPTA to tax as \"tobacco products\" the \"electronic oral device\" because it may be used to deliver e-liquid containing nicotine from tobacco. Nor is it a violation of substantive due process for the TPTA to tax as \"tobacco products\" e-liquid that contains nicotine from a non-tobacco source because the use of such e-liquid may lead the e-cigarette user to start smoking cigarettes. As such, Petitioner's facial constitutional challenge must fail. Petitioner's statutory construction claim, on the other hand, has merit. A plain reading of the TPTA does not support including the separately packaged component parts of an e-cigarette that DOR considers \"integral\" in the definition of \"electronic cigarette.\" Those \"integral\" component parts of the e-cigarette device are not taxable under the TPTA. Therefore, we will grant the Petition and Application in part and deny it in part, and declare that these \"integral\" component parts of the e-cigarette device are not taxable under the TPTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW\n   </strong>\n   , June 22, 2018, the Application of East Coast Vapor, LLC (Petitioner), for Summary Relief (Application) on its Petition for Review is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   to the extent it requests declaratory relief regarding the interpretation of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue (DOR) to include as taxable under the Tobacco Products Tax Act (TPTA), Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 6, added by Section 18 of the Act of July 13, 2016, P.L. 526, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8201-A - 8234-A, the separately packaged component parts of an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) that DOR considers \"integral\" to the e-cigarette.
