Tierney contends that the trial court erred or abused its discretion because it (1) considered evidence of events that preceded the issuance of the original protection from abuse order\n   in deciding to extend that original order; and (2) did not give him sufficient notice of the issues to be addressed in the hearing on extension of the original order. He also argues that there was not sufficient evidence to justify extension of the protection from abuse order for two years, with the addition of prohibitions that, by federal law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(8) (LEXIS through Pub. L. No. 115-196),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   have the effect of prohibiting him from possessing firearms and that include an express directive prohibiting his possession of firearms. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. CASE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The record establishes the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff ended a several year relationship with the defendant in October 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Stating that she was afraid of Tierney and that she was concerned by his continuing attempts to contact her, the plaintiff first filed a complaint for protection from abuse against Tierney on February 21, 2017. That same day, the District Court (\n   <em>\n    Dobson, J.\n   </em>\n   ) entered a temporary order for protection from abuse, 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4006(2) (2017), that included a provision explicitly prohibiting Tierney from possessing firearms or dangerous weapons. 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4006 (2-A)(B) (2017). The prohibition on possession of firearms in the temporary order would have put Tierney on notice that firearms prohibitions can be at issue in protection from abuse proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In March 2017, the parties appeared in court for a final hearing on the complaint. At the courthouse, the parties agreed to the entry of a six-month protective order without a finding of abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4007(1). The agreed-to order, which was set to expire in September 2017, did not contain a finding that the defendant had abused the plaintiff, did not prohibit him from possessing firearms, and did not contain provisions that would result in such a prohibition by operation of federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The plaintiff filed a motion to extend the original protection from abuse order on August 18, 2017. Her motion asserted that the extension was necessary because \"the defendant ha[d] been stalking [her].\" The plaintiff included an affidavit with her motion that further described that she was seeking the extension based on the defendant's continued efforts to learn where she lived, who she was dating, and where she worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] On October 6, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion to modify the original protection\n   order to change the reference in that order to her place of employment-from which Tierney was barred during her work hours-to a different location in a different county. The court granted the motion to modify that same day, prohibiting the defendant from being at the plaintiff's new place of employment. The defendant was served with the amended protection from abuse order on October 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The court held a contested hearing on the motion to extend the protection from abuse order on November 3, 2017. The plaintiff testified and called four witnesses. The defendant testified and called one witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 8] After considering the evidence, the court found that the plaintiff was \"credible, fearful, and intimidated\" by the actions of the defendant, which included \"controlling behavior\" and \"obsessive texts and calls.\" In addition, the court specifically found that the defendant had previously abused the plaintiff by threatening to kill any boyfriend she had. Based on its finding of abuse, the court entered an order extending the protection order for two years and entered an order prohibiting the defendant from possessing firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4007(1)(A-1). The order also prohibited Tierney from, among other things, threatening or harassing the plaintiff and \"us[ing], attempt[ing] to use or threaten[ing to] use physical force that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury\" to her. The defendant did not file a motion for further findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 52. He filed this appeal the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Consideration of Events Supporting the Original Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The defendant argues that the court's finding of abuse was improperly based solely on evidence of his behavior prior to the original protection order. Specifically, he argues that the court relied on the statements he made regarding killing the plaintiff's boyfriends and his obsessive texts, calls, and controlling behavior-behavior that occurred prior to the issuance of the original protection order-to support the two-year extension of the protection from abuse order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 10] A court may extend a protection order by agreement of the parties or upon a finding that an extension is \"necessary to protect the plaintiff or minor child from abuse.\" 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4007(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Gehrke v. Gehrke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    2015 ME 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b618,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    115 A.3d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 11] When, as here, an extension of an original protection order entered by agreement and without a finding of abuse is sought prior to the expiration date of that original order, the court can grant the extension only when the court finds that, at some point, before or after the original order, there was, in fact, abuse.\n   <em>\n    Dyer v. Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290384\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/5/1049/\">\n    2010 ME 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290384\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/5/1049/\">\n    5 A.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a court may only extend a protection order by agreement of the parties or upon a finding of abuse). That abuse may have occurred before the time of the entry of the agreed-to order when the court specifically determines that, either because of the nature of the abuse or because of additional threats, concerns, or actions, the plaintiff has established that \"additional time [is] necessary to protect the plaintiff or minor child from abuse.\" 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4007(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290384\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/5/1049/\">\n    2010 ME 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290384\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/5/1049/\">\n    5 A.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that it is proper for a court to consider evidence of earlier abuse and the threat of continuing harm arising out of earlier abuse in extending a protection order);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gehrke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    2015 ME 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b619,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    115 A.3d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Evidence demonstrating a history of abuse, as defined by statute to include\n   actual or attempted infliction of bodily injury or offensive physical contact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4002(1)(A), and threats of such conduct made in an attempt to place another in fear of bodily injury,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4002(1)(B), is relevant and admissible to demonstrate that an extended order of protection is \"necessary,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4007(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Gehrke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    2015 ME 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    115 A.3d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 12] In\n   <em>\n    Gehrke\n   </em>\n   , the defendant challenged the court's finding that an extension of a contested protection order was necessary to protect the plaintiff from abuse when there was little evidence of new abusive conduct since the last modification of the order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. We held that a plaintiff seeking an extension need not allege or prove new abuse but must demonstrate that additional time is necessary to protect him or her from abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. We noted, in that case, that the evidence of the abuse that supported the original order was essential to understand whether an extension of that order was necessary to protect the plaintiff from abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290384\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/5/1049/\">\n    2010 ME 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290384\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/5/1049/\">\n    5 A.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Here, the plaintiff filed for an extension prior to the expiration of the initial six-month protection order. Therefore, it was proper for the court to consider evidence of the conduct that supported the original order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Based on evidence that the court found to be credible of the defendant's statements about threatening to kill any boyfriend the plaintiff may have and \"his obsessive calls, texts and controlling behavior,\" the court found abuse. The court further found that the plaintiff was \"fearful and intimated,\" based, in part, on evidence of the defendant's conduct and inquiries to the plaintiff's friend subsequent to issuance of the original order. That finding supported the determination that the two-year extension was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 15] Although the court did not make other specific findings, in the absence of a motion for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 52(b), we will infer that the trial court made any necessary findings that would be supported by evidence in the record to support its ultimate conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gehrke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    2015 ME 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871959\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/1252/\">\n    115 A.3d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in finding abuse and extending the protection from abuse order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B. Notice of Issues to be Addressed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 16] The defendant argues that he did not receive proper notice of the issues to be addressed at the extension hearing, because he did not know that the court could consider his conduct that led to the original protection order, or that he could be deprived of his right to possess firearms should the court make a finding of abuse against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 17] \"In a procedural due process challenge, we must first determine whether the governmental action has resulted in a deprivation of life, liberty, or property.\"\n   <em>\n    Guardianship of Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708837\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/715/919/\">\n    1998 ME 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708837\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/715/919/\">\n    715 A.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

City of Bangor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11631468\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/728/1268/\">\n    1999 ME 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11631468\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/728/1268/\">\n    728 A.2d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 18] Here, the defendant was notified of, present at, and participated in the hearing on the motion to extend the protection from abuse order. He had the opportunity to present evidence concerning the abuse alleged by the plaintiff, and the court found that the evidence he presented in the form of witness testimony \"didn't really contradict the plaintiff's witnesses' testimony.\" Further, the defendant did not object to the nature or scope of the evidence presented against him, and he did not assert to the court that the hearing and any resulting order should be limited. Thus, his right to procedural due process was not violated. The plaintiff's motion to extend and her accompanying affidavit, the statute, and the initial temporary order gave the defendant sufficient notice of what he needed to defend against at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Support the Extension\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 19] The appeal appears to challenge whether there was sufficient evidence to support the court's extension of the protection order for two years and the order prohibiting the defendant from possessing firearms. We do not find these arguments persuasive. The evidence discussed above is more than sufficient to support the extension of the order for an additional two years, including the prohibition on the possession of firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton v. Ireland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904201\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/104/883/\">\n    2014 ME 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904201\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/104/883/\">\n    104 A.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We review a trial court's finding of abuse for clear error and will affirm a trial court's findings if they are supported by competent evidence in the record, even if the evidence might support alternative findings of fact.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 20] Even if the extended protection order had not included an explicit prohibition against the possession of firearms, that prohibition would have arisen by operation of federal law as a result of the provisions of the order that prohibited the defendant from threatening, harassing, or stalking the plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that prohibited him from using, attempting to use, or threatening to use physical force against the plaintiff that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(8) (LEXIS through Pub. L. No. 115-196). The evidence presented to the court warranted issuance of an order containing these prohibitions.
