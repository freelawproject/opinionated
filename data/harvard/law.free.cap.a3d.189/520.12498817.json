Torsella's (Treasurer) Application for Leave to Effect Service by Publication (Application) of the Treasurer's Amended Complaint (Complaint).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Treasurer filed the\n   Complaint in this Court's original jurisdiction seeking to obtain legal title to certain matured, unredeemed and unclaimed United States (U.S.) savings bonds (Bonds) by way of a valid escheatment proceeding pursuant to Section 1301.10b of The Fiscal Code (Code).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the Complaint, the Treasurer avers that he is seeking to obtain legal title to the following matured, unredeemed and unclaimed Bonds pursuant to Section 1301.10b of the Code:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   12. A vast majority of the matured, unredeemed [Bonds] are Series 'E' bonds, which were first sold in 1941. Nearly 4.6 billion Series E bonds were sold in this country between 1941 and 1980. Between 1941 and November 30, 1965, Series E bonds were sold with 40-year terms. Between December 1965 and June 30, 1980, they carried 30-year terms. The last Series E bond was issued in 1980, and all such bonds had reached maturity by June 30, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   13. Series A-D bonds were sold from March 1, 1935, through April 30, 1941. Series A-D bonds were sold with 10-year terms. The last of these bonds was issued in 1941, and all such bonds had reached maturity by April 30, 1951.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   14. Series F and G bonds were sold from May 1, 1941, through April 30, 1952. Series F and G bonds were sold with 12-year terms. The last of these bonds was issued in 1952, and all such bonds had reached maturity by April 30, 1964.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   15. Series H bonds were sold from June 1, 1952, through December 31, 1979. Between June 1, 1952 and January 31, 1957, Series H bonds were sold with terms of 29 years and 8 months. Between February 1, 1957 and December 31, 1979, they carried 30-year terms. The last Series H bond was issued in 1979, and all such bonds had reached maturity by December 31, 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   16. Series J and K bonds were sold from May 1, 1952, through April 30, 1957. Series J and K bonds were sold with a term of 12 years. The last of these bonds was issued in 1957, and all such bonds had reached maturity by April 30, 1969.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   17. Series EE bonds were first sold in January 1980 and continue to be sold through the present. Series EE bonds were originally sold with different terms but all Series EE bonds earn interest for up to 30 years. The first Series EE bond reached final maturity in January 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   18. Series HH bonds were sold from January 1, 1980, through August 31, 2004. Series HH bonds were sold with 20-year terms. The first Series HH bond reached final maturity and ceased earning interest in January 2000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 12-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Application \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Further, the Treasurer stated in his Application that the Bond purchasers/owners had last known addresses in the Commonwealth 26 to 79 years ago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The only information currently available to the Treasurer regarding the identities and addresses of the current owners of the [Bonds] delivered to the Treasurer's office consists of the names and last known addresses of safe deposit box owners and the information on the face of the [B]onds included among the safe deposit box contents delivered to the Treasurer's office pursuant to [Sections 1301.3(4) and 1301.13 of the Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1301.3(4) and 1301.13 [ (relating to delivery of abandoned or unclaimed property subject to the Commonwealth's custody and control) ]. Each of the [Bonds], however, has remained unclaimed for at least six years after final maturity, and even the most recent of the [B]onds delivered to the Treasurer were issued in 1991. Accordingly, the information is outdated or generally no longer accurate. In many, if not most, cases, these [B]onds will likely have passed by inheritance or to persons other than the original owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Application \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite the Treasurer's efforts to locate the Bonds' owners or their heirs, the age of the Bonds as well as the deaths and relocations of their owners have resulted in many of the Bonds and, consequently, approximately $840 million, remaining unclaimed. Some of the Bonds have been repossessed by the U.S. Treasury, which has not attempted to locate the Bonds' owners or their heirs and refuses to supply information it possesses that may assist the Treasurer in locating them. Accordingly, unless an owner or heir has reason to know that the Treasurer or the U.S. Treasury possesses the Bonds, they will remain unclaimed in perpetuity. The Treasurer's purpose in taking ownership of the Bonds is so the Treasurer has more than a mere custodial interest in them, with the ultimate goal of reuniting the Bonds' proceeds with their owners or their heirs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Initially, Section 1301.2(a) of the Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that \"[a]ll abandoned and unclaimed property ... is subject to the custody and control of the Commonwealth[.]\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 1301.2(a). In 2016, the General Assembly enacted Section 1301.10b of the Code to specifically address U.S. savings bonds, therein declaring:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   It is the intent of the General Assembly to allow the [Treasurer] to obtain possession of unredeemed and unclaimed [U.S.] savings bonds on behalf of residents of this Commonwealth but held by the [f]ederal [g]overnment to permit and facilitate the right of Pennsylvania bond holders to be reunited with the bond holders' [U.S.] savings bonds proceeds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   72 P.S. \u00a7 1301.10b(a).

All property rights and legal title to and ownership of [U.S.] savings bonds or proceeds from the bonds, including all rights, powers and privileges\n   of survivorship of any owner, co-owner or beneficiary, shall vest solely in the Commonwealth according to procedures set forth in subsections (d) [ (relating to civil action commencement) ], (e) [ (relating to service by publication) ], (f) [ (relating to escheatment judgment) ], (g) [ (relating to the Commonwealth's redemption process) ] and (h) [ (relating to the Commonwealth's duty to pay future claims) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   72 P.S. \u00a7 1301.10b(c).

Although that portion of Section 1301.10b(e) of the Code does not specify that judgment will be rendered\n   <em>\n    against the person\n   </em>\n   , the General Assembly further directs in Section 1301.10b(e) of the Code that the published notice shall be substantially in the form set forth in Rule 430(b)(1), which includes language that the person must enter an appearance and file written defenses and, if he or she fails to do so, \"\n   <strong>\n    a judgment may be entered against\n    <em>\n     you\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   without further notice ....\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     You\n    </em>\n    may lose money or property or other rights important to\n    <em>\n     you\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     YOU\n    </em>\n    SHOULD TAKE THIS PAPER TO YOUR LAWYER AT ONCE\n   </strong>\n   .\" Pa.R.C.P. No. 430(b)(1) (bold text and underline emphasis added). This language is certainly appropriate when notifying someone of a civil lawsuit against the individual (the purpose of Rule 430(b)(1) ); however, it is inaccurate and misleading in the bond escheatment process now before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Notwithstanding, in order to substantially comply with the Code to obtain service by publication for an in rem proceeding, the Treasurer has no choice but to name Bond owners as defendants in the legal action and declare that if they fail to respond in some capacity,\n   <strong>\n    judgment will be entered against\n    <em>\n     them\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 1301.10b(e) of the Code;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rule 430(b)(1). As a result, unsuspecting Bond owners or their heirs are led to believe that they require legal counsel, may incur legal expenses, will have judgment entered against them (that may remain on their records in perpetuity),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and/or will forever lose their Bond claim rights once escheatment occurs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite that the Treasurer's Notice contains some explanation of the legal fiction (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the Commonwealth will possess legal title to the Bonds, but it is more like protective custody since the Commonwealth will relinquish title to anyone who can thereafter prove ownership), if used as written, the boilerplate Rule 430(b)(1) notification will lead even those owners who take the time to read it and/or the applicable Code provisions to believe that they are at risk of losing their rights, money or property, require legal counsel, may incur legal expenses, will have judgment entered against them, and/or will forever lose their Bond claim rights once escheatment occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   According to the Treasurer, similar savings bond escheatment legislation has been\n   enacted in 21 states,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 11 of them have completed the escheatment process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, the Louisiana and South Dakota escheatment statutes contain nearly identical language to Section 1301.10b(e) of the Code (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that service by publication shall include notification that the bond owner has been sued and shall answer the complaint or appropriate judgment will be entered). However, rather than mandating a boilerplate Rule 430(b)(1) -type notification be included for service by publication, Louisiana more appropriately requires the advertisement \"be in\n   <strong>\n    a form that, in the judgment of the administrator, is likely to attract the attention of the apparent owner of the unclaimed property\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   ]\" and include the name and last known address, \"[a] statement explaining that\n   <strong>\n    property\n   </strong>\n   of the owner is presumed to be abandoned and\n   <strong>\n    has been taken into the protective custody\n   </strong>\n   of the administrator[, and] [a]\n   <strong>\n    statement that information\n   </strong>\n   about the property and its return ...\n   <strong>\n    is available\n   </strong>\n   ...\n   <strong>\n    upon request\n   </strong>\n   to the administrator.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=La.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209%3A16\">\n    La.
