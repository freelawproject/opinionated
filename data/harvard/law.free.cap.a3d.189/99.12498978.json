We first addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Orkney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins.

Therefore, we decided in\n   <em>\n    Orkney\n   </em>\n   that there was \"nothing inconsistent between the public policy underlying underinsured motorist coverage and a regulation that permits a coverage exclusion\" for vehicles owned by self-insurers.\n   <em>\n    Orkney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins.

In both the present case and in\n   <em>\n    Orkney\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff insureds were injured by an underinsured lessee driving a rental car owned by a self-insured rental car company. See id., at 197-99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20A.2d%20700\">\n    727 A.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The insureds were denied underinsured motorist benefits under their policies because those policies contained a self-insurer exclusion. Id., at 199-200,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20A.2d%20700\">\n    727 A.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since our decision in\n   <em>\n    Orkney\n   </em>\n   , however, Congress passed legislation prohibiting rental car companies from being held vicariously liable for the negligence of their lessees. Specifically, Title 49 of the 2012 edition of the United States Code, \u00a7 30106 (a), commonly known as the Graves Amendment; see\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Testa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086786\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/1/\">\n    296 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20A.2d%20955\">\n    993 A.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ; makes rental car companies immune from vicarious liability for injuries caused by their underinsured lessees-even if a state has designated that company as a self-insurer capable of providing a remedy. Thus, under current law, when the plaintiffs in the present case were denied underinsured motorist benefits pursuant to their policies because of the self-insurer exclusion, they were effectively left without a remedy because they are precluded under the Graves Amendment from recovering from the self-insured rental car company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We are therefore asked in these appeals to reassess, in light of this development in federal law, whether \u00a7 38a-334-6 (c) (2) (B) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which authorizes the self-insurer exclusions in these insurance policies, remains valid as applied to rental car companies. We conclude that, in this scenario, the state regulation conflicts with the public policy manifested in General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) that requires insurance policies to provide underinsured motorist coverage, and, thus, \u00a7 38a-334-6 (c) (2) (B) of the regulations is invalid as applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiffs, Sandra and Patrick Tannone, were lawfully crossing the street when they were struck and seriously injured by an automobile. That automobile was a rental car owned by EAN Holdings, LLC, more commonly known as Enterprise Rent-A-Car (Enterprise). Enterprise had leased the vehicle to Barbara Wasilesky, but she was not driving at the time of the collision. The vehicle was instead operated by a permitted user named Arthur Huffman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wasilesky, the lessee, was the named insured on an automobile insurance liability policy that provided bodily injury coverage in the amounts of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per occurrence-the minimum allowable in Connecticut at the time. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) and 14-112 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs made a claim against Wasilesky, as the lessee, and Huffman, as the vehicle operator, and the parties settled for the full amount of coverage from Wasilesky's policy,\n   namely, $20,000 each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wasilesky and Huffman have no other insurance coverage, and the plaintiffs claim that their damages exceed what they recovered under Wasilesky's insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of the collision, the defendant, Amica Mutual Insurance Company (Amica), insured the plaintiffs through separate policies. Each of their policies carried $500,000 of coverage for personal injuries sustained due to the negligence of an underinsured driver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This underinsured motorist coverage, however, excluded from the term \" 'underinsured motor vehicle' \" any vehicle \"[o]wned ... by a\n   <em>\n    self-insurer\n   </em>\n   under any applicable motor vehicle law.\" (Emphasis added.) Enterprise was designated a self-insurer by the commissioner, making it eligible for the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After settling with Wasilesky and Huffman, the plaintiffs commenced this consolidated action to recover underinsured motorist benefits from their own insurance policies issued by the defendant. In response, the defendant asserted special defenses, including that the policies do not afford underinsured motorist benefits\n   when the tortfeasor's vehicle is owned by a self-insurer. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the vehicle driven by Huffman was owned by a self-insurer, Enterprise, and because the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they had exhausted their remedy from Enterprise. In support of\n   the validity of the exclusion, the defendant pointed to \u00a7 38a-334-6 (c) (2) (B) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which expressly authorizes such exclusions, and to\n   <em>\n    Orkney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hanover Inc. Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520084\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/248/195/#p202\">\n    248 Conn. at 195, 202-206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20A.2d%20700\">\n    727 A.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this court confirmed the validity of that regulation and a similar coverage exclusion. The plaintiffs asserted in response that the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Orkney\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because it predated the Graves Amendment, which eliminated the possibility that the plaintiffs could recover from Enterprise. The trial court nevertheless agreed with the defendant and granted its motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs moved for reargument, and the trial court denied their motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiffs then appealed from the judgments of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and this court transferred the appeals to itself. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) ; Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. Because a trial court's decision granting a motion for summary judgment and issues of statutory construction present questions of law, our review on appeal is plenary. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Testa\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086786\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/1/\">\n    296 Conn. at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20A.2d%20955\">\n    993 A.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (setting forth standard for granting motion for summary judgment); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z (setting forth plain meaning rule governing statutory interpretation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs claim that the self-insured exclusion in their underinsured motorist coverage does not apply to Enterprise due to the fact that the regulation authorizing that exclusion, \u00a7 38a-334-6 (c) (2) (B) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, is invalid as applied to Enterprise because Enterprise cannot be held liable\n   following the Graves Amendment.

We agree with the plaintiffs that, under these circumstances, the regulation giving rise to the self-insurance exclusion in the plaintiffs' policies is inconsistent with the authorizing statutes and, therefore, is invalid as applied to Enterprise. Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the cases to that court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We first consider the interconnected legislative, regulatory, and public policy backdrop confronting us in this appeal, including how that backdrop has changed. Our state law requires all motor vehicle owners to maintain a minimum amount of automobile liability insurance coverage. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-335 (a). The legislature understood that some motorists will not comply with this law, however. Thus, to protect properly insured motorists from the negligence of financially irresponsible motorists, our state law expressly provides that every automobile insurance policy must provide its insured with a minimum amount of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage as provided for in \u00a7 14-112 (a). General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) (A) (\"[e]ach automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured and underinsured\n   motorist coverage ... for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom, from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underinsured motor vehicles\"). Our state has consistently maintained a \"strong public policy favoring uninsured motorist coverage ... since 1967 ....\"\n   <em>\n    Streitweiser\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523958\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/371/#p377\">\n    219 Conn. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20A.2d%20498\">\n    593 A.2d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Specifically, that public policy dictates that \"every insured is entitled to recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured motorist [responsible for the insured's injury] had maintained a policy of liability insurance.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gormbard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zurich Ins.

In another case in which we discussed the public policy behind uninsured motorist coverage, however, we were \"unpersuaded that legislative inaction invariably warrants recognition as a reliable indicator of legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Streitweiser\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523958\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/371/#p377\">\n    219 Conn. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20A.2d%20498\">\n    593 A.2d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Particularly in a case where, as here, the divergent relationships between state and federal statutes, regulations, and public policies are complex and nuanced, we decline to assume tacit acceptance by the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Taking into account the Graves Amendment, the uninsured and underinsured motorist statutes, related state regulations, and underlying public policy, we therefore conclude that rental car companies may not be deemed self-insurers as to the negligence of their lessees. Accordingly, Enterprise was not self-insured as to the present risk, and the application of the underinsured motorist exclusions in the plaintiffs' policies would contravene the public policy articulated in\n   \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) (A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court therefore improperly granted the defendant's motions for summary judgment on the ground that Enterprise's vehicle was excluded from underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to the plaintiffs' policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to deny the defendant's motions for summary judgment and for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     Orkney\n    </em>\n    interpreted \u00a7 38a-334-6 of the 1999 revision of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which excluded only \"uninsured motor vehicle[s]\" owned by self-insurers. In response to a claim in that case that the regulation did not permit the exclusion of underinsured motor vehicles, this court stated that \"the statutes and regulations applicable to uninsured motorist coverage also apply to underinsured motorist coverage.... [T]herefore ... \u00a7 38a-334-6 (c) (2) (B) [of the 1999 revision of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies] authorizes the exclusion of vehicles owned by self-insurers from the scope of the underinsured motorist coverage provided by an automobile liability insurance policy.\" (Citations omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Orkney\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Hanover Ins.

Subsequently, \u00a7 38a-334-6 of the 1999 revision of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies was amended in 2000 to refer to \"uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle[s],\" which is the current language of the regulation. 62 Conn.

The plaintiffs' brief states that the settlement was with Huffman and Wasilesky for the total limits of Wasilesky's policy: $20,000 per person and $40,000 per occurrence. The plaintiffs' amended complaints allege that they settled with only Huffman's insurer for the full amount of his coverage. Meanwhile, the trial court's memorandum of decision appears to indicate that the plaintiffs received the full amount of coverage from Wasilesky's policy. Nothing about the terms of this settlement affects our disposition of these appeals.

Enterprise would be a self-insurer when there is a claim of direct liability-as opposed to vicarious liability-brought against it. For example, in cases of \"negligence or criminal wrongdoing,\" self-insurance still applies to rental car companies because those claims are exempt from the Graves Amendment.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030106\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (2) (2012).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The defendant asserts that by reaching this conclusion we are usurping the legislature's authority to either amend or repeal our statutory framework in light of the Graves Amendment, or the commissioner's authority to determine who may be a self-insurer under the state regulations.

Rather, we are appropriately undertaking the judicial responsibility of\n    <em>\n     vindicating\n    </em>\n    our legislature's public policy, articulated in state statute, to which both a regulation and a contract must give way when they are in conflict with that statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
