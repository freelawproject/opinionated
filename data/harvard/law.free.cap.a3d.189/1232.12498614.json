The defendant appeals, as well, from the court's denial of his motion to reargue. We affirm the judgment of the trial court as to the defendant's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion of the issues on appeal. By complaint dated August 14, 2015, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant to foreclose a mortgage on residential property located at 6 Wild Rose Court in\n   Bloomfield. The loan indebtedness and related mortgage arose in conjunction with a loan to the defendant from the plaintiff's predecessor in interest, New Century Mortgage Corporation. In response, by pleading dated September 14, 2015, the defendant filed an answer, numerous special defenses and a six count counterclaim contesting, inter alia, the plaintiff's standing to bring this action and alleging that the mortgage lien and underlying debt in question had been discharged in bankruptcy. Thereafter, on April 6, 2016, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment as to liability on its complaint and the counterclaim asserted by the defendant. On January 6, 2017, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, on March 3, 2017, the court denied the defendant's motion to reargue. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the pendency of this appeal, the trial court, on prompting from this court, articulated its reasons for granting the motion for summary judgment. On April\n   27, 2017, the court stated that it had granted the motion for summary judgment as to liability on the plaintiff's complaint and that the eight special defenses and the six count counterclaim filed by the defendant were legally insufficient to the extent they could be comprehended. The court stated, as well, that the special defenses and counterclaim did not satisfy the transaction test requiring that they relate to the making, validity or enforcement of the note or mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Also, while this appeal was pending, this court dismissed the portion of the defendant's appeal regarding the trial court's granting of the motion for summary judgment as to liability on the complaint on the ground that the court's order in this regard is not a final judgment.

The following additional information is pertinent to this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The record reflects that the defendant filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    et seq., in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut on May 5, 2016, and that he received a discharge in bankruptcy under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n    </extracted-citation>\n    on August 31, 2016. He claims this occurrence served to relieve him not only of the obligation reflected in the note, but also as a result of the bankruptcy discharge, the plaintiff no longer has a lien on his property. He is incorrect. Apparently, the defendant has the mistaken belief that because he did not list the plaintiff therein as a secured creditor in his bankruptcy petition but, rather, claimed, in his filing, that the debt alleged by the plaintiff was unsecured, he is not only discharged from the underlying obligation but that the plaintiff's security interest in the subject property is no longer valid. In making this assertion, the defendant, however, highlights a misunderstanding of bankruptcy law; he also ignores the clear statement made by his assigned bankruptcy trustee in papers filed in conjunction with his bankruptcy proceedings that secured obligations are not subject to discharge in the chapter 7 filing. As part of its order of discharge, the Bankruptcy Court noted that \"a creditor with a lien may enforce a claim against the debtors' property subject to that lien unless the lien was avoided or eliminated.\" There is no evidence of either occurrence. In short, the defendant is under an incorrect apprehension of the legal effect of his discharge in bankruptcy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \"[I]n assessing the legal viability of counterclaims to a foreclosure action, the court should employ the transaction test set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 10-10, and ... although this test may require an assessment of whether the counterclaim in question relates to the making, validity or enforcement of the subject note and mortgage, there can be such a nexus even though the counterclaim may not directly attack the making, validity or enforcement of the mortgage and note which form the basis of the foreclosure complaint.\"\n    <em>\n     CitiMortgage, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Rey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%20595\">\n     150 Conn.
