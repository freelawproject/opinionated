Clark's negligence suit for injuries sustained on its property in Benton, Maine. Benton, LLC, argues that once Hammond Lumber Company, Clark's actual employer, secured workers' compensation for Clark's injuries and lost wages, section 104 of the Act immunized Hammond Lumber Company and Benton, LLC, from Clark's negligence action because these entities are functionally one and the same. Benton, LLC, reasons that an extension of our dual persona doctrine regarding the scope of the Act's immunity and exclusivity provisions provides it with immunity from Clark's suit as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.

At that time, he was the president of Hammond Lumber Company, a Maine corporation; he is currently that company's vice president. Benton, LLC, was formed, according to its annual reports, for the purpose of \"owning and operating real estate.\" Michael Hammond, the current president of Hammond Lumber Company, states in an affidavit that Benton, LLC, was formed by his company as one of the so-called \"Hammond Lumber LLCs,\" with a purpose \"to purchase at auction, using funds provided by Donald Hammond, and own the assets of a company that had gone out\n   of business called Benton Hardwood Lumber.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Hammond Lumber Company does not own the real estate on which its stores that were acquired after 1989 are located. Each of those parcels \"is owned by a distinct limited liability company\" (a Hammond Lumber LLC). Hammond Lumber Company directs all of the operations of the LLCs, and one of the Hammond shareholders owns each LLC. The LLCs, including Benton, LLC, have no independent business or employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In 2009, Hammond Lumber Company hired Clark as a yard worker. On February 12, 2015, Clark and his manager from the Hammond Lumber Company store in Fairfield visited the property owned by Benton, LLC, which contains buildings that Hammond Lumber Company maintained. Clark's manager identified the rooftops of the buildings from which Clark was to remove snow. The following day, Clark returned with a number of his coworkers and, while clearing snow, fell through a skylight on one of the buildings and sustained significant injuries. Clark filed a worker's compensation claim, and Hammond Lumber Company, through its insurance carrier, paid the claim in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] On May 8, 2017, Clark filed a complaint alleging three negligence claims against Benton, LLC, for its failure to (1) properly maintain the property; (2) provide premises reasonably safe for his work; and (3) warn him of dangerous conditions that Benton, LLC, knew or should have known existed. After it filed its answer, Benton, LLC, moved for summary judgment on all counts, asserting that, once Hammond Lumber Company secured compensation for Clark's injuries and lost wages, it was immune from the negligence suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Clark argued that summary judgment proceedings were premature pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 56(f), because Clark had conducted no substantive discovery to test the truth of the assertions of material facts by Benton, LLC. On August 15, 2017, Clark moved to amend his complaint by adding six negligence claims against Donald Hammond personally, as sole owner and member of Benton, LLC. On October 10, 2017, the court denied the motion for summary judgment, which rendered moot Clark's pending Rule 56(f) motion, and also denied Clark's motion to amend his complaint. Benton, LLC, filed this timely appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   M.R. App. P. 2B(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Benton, LLC, contends that the Act's definition of \"employer\" is ambiguous and does not resolve the issue of whether it may qualify for immunity as an employer pursuant to 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 104. 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 102(12) (2017). According to\n   Clark, the meaning of \"employer,\" as provided by the Act, is unambiguous and Benton, LLC, does not qualify because it has no employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 102(12) (2017). We interpret de novo a statutory definition \"by first examining its plain meaning,\" and \"[o]nly when ... a statute is ambiguous do we look beyond the plain language of the statue and the context of the whole statutory scheme to indicia of legislative intent....\"\n   <em>\n    Fuhrmann v.

We first turn to the issue of whether an entity with no employees may come within the Act's definition of \"employer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. The Maine Workers' Compensation Act's Definition of \"Employer\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Pursuant to 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 102(12), \"[t]he term 'employer' includes: Private employers; The State; Counties; Cities; Towns; Water districts and all other quasi-public corporations of a similar nature; Municipal school committees; and Design professionals.\" Supplementing that illustrative definition is the term's plain meaning: \"one who controls and directs a worker under an express or implied contract of hire and who pays the worker's salary or wages.\"\n   <em>\n    Employer\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). The plain language of the Act's definition of \"employer,\" taken alone, would lead to a conclusion that an entity cannot be an \"employer\" if it does not have even a single employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 10] The same conclusion is apparent when considering Clark's perspective of whether an employment relationship existed between himself and Benton, LLC. The Act, in relevant part, broadly defines an \"employee\" as \"every person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.\" 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 102(11)(A) (2017). There is no dispute that Clark was not in the service of Benton, LLC, except by Hammond Lumber Company's express directive, nor did he have \"any contract of hire\" with Benton, LLC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11700787\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/716/212/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, a plain reading of one of the Act's definitions leads to a conclusion that Clark was not an employee of Benton, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 11] We have held, however, that in certain cases the immunity afforded by section 104 might extend to a defendant landowner that is affiliated with an employer. Our inquiry in those cases has centered upon whether the landowner's \"duties are totally separate from [the employer entity's] duties as employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Peavey v.

In those cases, our focus was on the nature of the duties that the employer and its affiliates owed to the plaintiff, not whether the affiliated entity that sought immunity had any employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peavey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7356819\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/637/449/#p451\">\n    637 A.2d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, in\n   <em>\n    LaBelle\n   </em>\n   the scope of the immunity of a landlord, who was also an officer of the employer, turned upon the separate nature of his duty to the plaintiff as a landlord, not upon whether the landlord's business had any employees.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7376150\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/593/653/#p655\">\n    593 A.2d at 654-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 12] As noted by the trial court and Benton, LLC, we have not had occasion to decide this precise issue concerning the scope of the Act's immunity with regard to employers and related entities such as Benton, LLC. We now hold that a\n   property-owning entity is not afforded immunity by the Act by the simple facts that one of its officers is also an officer in the entity that employs the injured person, the employer has secured compensation according to the Act for the injured person, and the property-owning entity allows the employer to use its premises for its business purposes.
