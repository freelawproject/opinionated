We ruled that the money paid to plaintiff as the\n   negotiated \"low\" figure in accordance with the agreement was subject to the statutory lien, even though a jury had rendered a \"no cause\" verdict in favor of the physician and absolved him of liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561444\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/400/572/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561444\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/400/572/#p577\">\n    at 575-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561444\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/400/572/#p577\">\n    948 A.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Similarly, in the present case, despite a \"no cause\" decision, an injured plaintiff recovered the \"low\" amount under a high/low agreement he entered into with defendants who provided medical treatment to him after a work-related accident. Relying upon\n   <em>\n    Pool\n   </em>\n   , his employer's workers' compensation carrier seeks to enforce its lien for compensation benefits it paid to plaintiff. Plaintiff argues that N.J.A.C. 11:1-7.3(a)(1), a regulation adopted by the Department of Banking and Insurance exempting certain payments made under a high/low agreement from physician reporting requirements, alters the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Pool\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff claims the regulation renders the compensation lien unenforceable in this setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we reject plaintiff's novel argument. We concur with the trial court that the regulation does not affect the validity and enforceability of the carrier's Section 40 lien, and that the lien applies to the proceeds collected by plaintiff from the medical malpractice defendants. We also reject plaintiff's alternative request that we repudiate our decision in\n   <em>\n    Pool\n   </em>\n   . However, we remand this matter to the trial court for the limited purpose of reconsidering a disputed portion of the overall lien amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The relevant facts and procedural history are essentially undisputed. Plaintiff Paolo Marano was a police officer employed by the Union Township Police Department. On July 12, 2010, he sustained injuries to his back in a work-related incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff sought treatment from an orthopedic surgeon, Clifford J. Schob, M.D., at Comprehensive Orthopedics, PA (\"Comprehensive\"). According to plaintiff's unproven allegations in the medical malpractice case, Dr. Schob did not properly diagnose his condition and negligently failed to advise him to visit the emergency room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff underwent extensive medical and rehabilitative treatment for his injuries. Because the injuries were work-related, plaintiff received workers' compensation benefits from respondent PMA Companies (\"PMA\"), the third-party administrator for Union Township. The amount of compensation benefits paid by PMA from August 1, 2013 through March 29, 2016 totaled $51,779.81. That total included\n   $5,403.07, which are characterized as \"case management\" and non-treatment charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2012, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Law Division, alleging medical negligence on the part of defendants Dr. Schob and Comprehensive. After defendants filed an answer denying liability, the parties entered into a high/low agreement. In connection with their agreement, the parties elected to have the medical malpractice claims resolved through binding arbitration. They agreed that, following the arbitrator's decision, plaintiff would receive from defendants at least $250,000 (the \"low\") and no greater than $750,000 (the \"high\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties arbitrated the medical malpractice case before a retired judge over two days in January 2016. In a letter decision, the arbitrator found no cause of action and dismissed the claims against defendants. Pursuant to the high/low agreement, defendants (or their insurers) paid the low figure, i.e., $250,000, in resolution of the claims. Out of that sum, $88,000 was disbursed to plaintiff; $57,148.33 was paid to plaintiff's counsel as reimbursement for expenses; and $62,851.67 was paid to plaintiff's counsel as an attorney's fee. In addition, by agreement of the parties, $42,000 was kept in trust, with plaintiff's acknowledgment that the funds would not be disbursed until the issues regarding PMA's workers' compensation lien were resolved. According to PMA, the amount of its lien is approximately two-thirds of $51,779.81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff asserted that the workers' compensation lien had been extinguished as a result of the \"no cause\" outcome of the arbitration. PMA disagreed, asserting the $250,000 that defendants paid to plaintiff constituted an improper \"double recovery\" unless the lien was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In November 2016, PMA moved before the Division of Workers' Compensation to enforce the Section 40 lien. Several weeks later, plaintiff filed an order to show cause and a verified complaint in the Law Division, seeking a declaration that the payment made to him pursuant to the high/low agreement was not subject to PMA's lien. Although PMA was not a defendant named in the verified complaint, it became aware of plaintiff's application and filed opposition to the order to show cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In January 2017, a hearing scheduled in the workers' compensation court on PMA's motion in that forum was adjourned. A few days later, Judge L. Grace Spencer, heard oral argument on plaintiff's order to show cause and PMA's opposition. Defendants in the medical malpractice case, having paid their stipulated sum under the high/low agreement, did not participate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 6, 2017, Judge Spencer denied plaintiff's application, issuing a detailed written statement of reasons. The judge noted that a key purpose of the lien statute, N.J.S.A. 34:15-40(b), is to prevent double recovery by injured workers. Citing our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Pool\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561444\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/400/572/#p577\">\n    400 N.J.

The judge instead found that PMA's lien must be satisfied. The judge also ruled that the workers' compensation court should make the determination of which fees were\n   associated with medical expenses and whether they were lienable under Section 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's present appeal followed. He argues that, as a matter of law, the changes in the physician reporting regulation require the payment that he received as the \"low\" figure under the high/low agreement to be exempted from PMA's lien. In the alternative, plaintiff respectfully contends that\n   <em>\n    Pool\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided and should be reconsidered by this panel. Lastly, plaintiff asserts that, if we do find the lien to be enforceable, the matter should be remanded to Law Division to reduce the lien amount by a disputed portion of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   PMA counters that we should affirm the trial court's decision and reasoning, which are legally sound. As a separate jurisdictional point, it contends that the question of the enforceability of the lien should have been decided by the compensation court, rather than by the Law Division. PMA also disputes whether any reduction of the lien is warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Generally, under the workers' compensation statutory scheme, when a third party is liable to an employee or his dependents for an injury or death, the employee or his dependents can take action against the third party.

The high/low agreement exclusion was proposed because \"[w]here there is a finding or verdict of\n   <em>\n    no liability\n   </em>\n   on the part of the practitioner, the reporting of payments made in accordance with a 'high/low agreement' ... could be\n   <em>\n    misleading\n   </em>\n   , in that it would indicate that the practitioner had committed malpractice when, in fact, no finding had been made in a legal proceeding to that effect.\" 41 N.J.R. 1650(a) (emphasis added). However, claims payments are still reported to the Department, which monitors the medical malpractice liability insurance market, because no identifying information is included.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561444\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/400/572/#p577\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Neither the rule proposal nor its adoption in the\n   <em>\n    New Jersey Register\n   </em>\n   mention any impact of the regulation upon the ability of an employer or insurer to enforce a workers' compensation lien. 41 N.J.R. 1650(a); 41 N.J.R. 3302(a). In fact, the proposal explicitly\n   noted the amendment would \"have little or no economic impact on insurers.\" 41 N.J.R. 1650(a). Further, typical settlements outside of a high/low context, whether a defendant's\n   liability has been admitted or not, would continue to trigger the reporting requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that certain public policies underlying the adoption of the revised regulation are thwarted by allowing payments of the \"low\" amount under a high/low agreement to be subject to Section 40 liens. Plaintiff asserts a main reason the regulation was adopted was to incentivize doctors sued for malpractice and their insurers to enter into high/low agreements. Such agreements enable doctors to be free from reporting requirements where no liability on their part is found but the plaintiff will still receive the \"low\" stipulated sum to cover litigation expenses and perhaps a modest remainder. Plaintiff posits that fewer high/low agreements will be negotiated if the result in this case is affirmed, because future plaintiffs will have to demand higher \"low\" figures to take into account lien obligations. In essence, plaintiff wants a lien-free \"low.\" We are unpersuaded by these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In adopting the regulatory change, the Department was manifestly concerned about not misleading the public about the nature of a \"low\" payment paid on behalf of a physician under a high/low agreement after a \"no-cause\" at trial or arbitration. That concern has no relationship to a compensation carrier's rights under Section 40 to impose a lien on the recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, even if we were to accept plaintiff's premise that fewer high/low agreements will be negotiated if the \"low\" award is deemed subject to a Section 40 lien, that premise does not negate the strong public policies underlying Section 40, which we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Pool\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561444\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/400/572/#p577\">\n    400 N.J.

The ability of the employer or insurer to apply a Section 40 lien on recovery does not depend on whether the settlement involves the alleged tortfeasor admitting liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As we have already noted, and continue to stress here, the rationale for the statutory right to a compensation lien is centered upon the public policy preventing double recovery.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373714\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/142/590/#p597\">\n    142 N.J. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373714,373725\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/667/670/\">\n    667 A.2d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
