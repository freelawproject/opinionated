On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in finding that\n   (1) he was operating a motor vehicle; (2) he refused to submit to chemical testing; and (3) the police had probable cause to arrest him for operating under the influence in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On May 14, 2016, the plaintiff was arrested and charged with operating under the influence of liquor or drugs in violation of \u00a7 14-227a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff submitted to a Breathalyzer test, but refused a urine test. As a result of this refusal, and in accordance with \u00a7 14-227b, the plaintiff's motor vehicle operator's license was suspended by the Department of Motor Vehicles (department) for forty-five days, effective June 13, 2016, and he was required to install and maintain an ignition interlock device in his vehicle for one year thereafter.\n   Subsequently, the plaintiff requested, and was granted, an administrative hearing to contest the license suspension. The administrative hearing was held on June 8, 2016, before a department hearing officer, acting on behalf of the commissioner. The hearing officer rendered a decision the same day as the hearing, ordering the suspension of the plaintiff's motor vehicle operator's license or operating privilege for forty-five days and the installation of an ignition interlock device for one year thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 17, 2016, the plaintiff filed an appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, challenging the findings of the hearing officer that (1) there was probable cause to arrest him for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both; (2) he refused to submit to a chemical testing or analysis; and (3) he was operating the motor vehicle. A one day trial took place before the court on December 1, 2016. On March 7, 2017, the court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal and rendered judgment in favor of the commissioner. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the record, the briefs submitted by the parties, and applicable law, we find no error in the trial court's determination.

The plaintiff, Nicholas Adams, appeals from the decision of the defendant Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (commissioner) suspending his driver's license for forty-five days and requiring him to install and maintain an ignition interlock device for one year for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The plaintiff asserts that the hearing officer violated his right to due process, that the record lacks substantial evidence that he was operating a motor vehicle, that there was no probable cause for his arrest, and that there is insufficient evidence to support the finding that he refused a urine test. Most of these claims were not asserted in the hearing and therefore are not properly before the court. Even if they had been properly preserved, the plaintiff's claims are not supported by the record. The plaintiff's appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At about 4:44 a.m. on May 14, 2016, the Stonington police were dispatched to investigate a report that a motor vehicle had struck a telephone pole and then left the scene. Officer Ryan Armstrong immediately responded and began checking the area. He came upon two vehicles on Pawcatuck Avenue. One was a disabled vehicle with significant front end damage consistent with hitting a telephone pole. The other was operated by a witness who had followed the first vehicle after the accident occurred. Armstrong approached the vehicle with front end damage. The plaintiff was standing outside it. Armstrong asked whether he needed medical assistance, and he stated that he did not. When Armstrong asked what had happened, the plaintiff stated that he struck a traffic cone in the roadway when he turned from Mechanic Street onto Clark Street. He denied having hit the telephone pole on Mechanic Street even after Armstrong remarked that a traffic cone would not cause the damage to his vehicle that was evident. Armstrong asked the plaintiff why he had fled the accident scene, and he replied that he had attempted to stop but his brakes had malfunctioned. Armstrong observed that the location of the accident was about a half mile from the location where the plaintiff's car was found with several stretches of uphill grades between the two locations. Armstrong asked the plaintiff when the accident occurred. He replied that it happened at approximately 4:45 a.m. Supp. Return of Record\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ROR), A-44, narrative, pp. 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Armstrong observed that the plaintiff appeared very drowsy, with droopy eyelids. His movements were very slow and he spoke in a low, raspy voice. Armstrong\n   told the plaintiff that he was going to conduct field sobriety tests, and the plaintiff \"immediately volunteered\" to take a Breathalyzer test. The plaintiff denied having used alcohol or drugs of any kind. ROR, A-44, narrative, p. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Armstrong administered three standardized field sobriety tests. In administering the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, Armstrong noted that the pupils of the plaintiff's eyes were constricted, which Armstrong recognized as a sign of narcotic use. After the plaintiff failed all three sobriety tests, Armstrong placed him under arrest\n   and transported him to the police station. ROR, A-44, narrative, pp. 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before leaving the scene, Armstrong spoke with the witness, who said she was sitting in her residence when she heard a loud crash and the power went out. She looked outside her window and saw the plaintiff's vehicle traveling down Pawcatuck Avenue. She followed his vehicle. When it stopped and she made contact with the plaintiff, he asked her not to notify the police. ROR, A-44, narrative, p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the police station, the plaintiff was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and offered the opportunity to contact an attorney, which he declined. He denied alcohol or drug use and elected to submit to a breath test. The first sample, taken at 5:50 a.m., showed a 0.000 percent blood alcohol content. Armstrong then asked the plaintiff to provide a urine sample. The plaintiff said he wanted to speak with an attorney. After several failed attempts to reach an attorney, he spoke with a family member and then elected to refuse to provide a urine sample. ROR, A-44, narrative, p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the breath test, the plaintiff stated that he was having difficulty breathing and complained of chest\n   pains. An ambulance responded to the booking room, examined the plaintiff, and suggested that he be transported to the hospital for further evaluation. He refused transport to the hospital. ROR, A-44, narrative, p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff was charged with operating under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a and with other motor vehicle violations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491402\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/1004/#p54\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The Department of Motor Vehicles (department) thereafter notified the plaintiff that his license would be suspended for forty-five days, and he would be required to install and maintain an ignition interlock device in his vehicle. ROR, Item 1. The plaintiff requested an administrative hearing, which was held on June 8, 2016. The plaintiff appeared with counsel. At the hearing, the A-44 form, with attached reports, was introduced as an exhibit without objection. ROR, transcript, p. 2. The plaintiff's counsel commented that the copy of the A-44 he had received before the hearing had not been notarized, but he acknowledged that the copy introduced into evidence was notarized. ROR, transcript, pp. 3-4. He argued to the hearing officer that \"they have not proven operation; number one. And number two, they can't prove the time of operation as to whether it was if in two hours or not.\" ROR, transcript, p. 4. He argued that his client had been disoriented by the collision and that his client was cooperating with the police. Despite evidence that the plaintiff had refused transport to a hospital, his attorney asserted that the plaintiff had to go to the hospital and commented that there were no hospital records of a \"drug tox.\" ROR, transcript, pp. 4-5. The plaintiff then testified that when he was at the police station, he was not able to reach his lawyer by telephone and did not recall speaking to any family member. ROR, transcript, p. 8. The hearing then concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The hearing officer subsequently found that the police had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for a\n   violation specified in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b, the plaintiff was placed under arrest, he refused to submit to a test, and he was operating a motor vehicle. In a subordinate finding, the hearing officer found that \"[t]he police report supports an affirmative finding on all four issues of fact.\" ROR, p. 3.

The plaintiff said that he had been traveling south on Mechanic Street, then turned onto Clark Street and struck a traffic cone in the roadway. He denied having hit a telephone pole on Mechanic Street even though a traffic cone could not have caused the damage to his vehicle. When asked why he did not stop when he had the accident, he said that he attempted to stop but his brakes malfunctioned.

In support of this argument, the plaintiff claims that Armstrong did not suspect the plaintiff of alcohol use because the report does not mention an odor of alcohol or other typical symptoms of alcohol intoxication, such as slurred speech, confusion, or balancing issues. He argues that Armstrong suspected narcotics use but used field sobriety tests designed solely to test alcohol use. He further argues that there is no evidence that Armstrong was trained in administering the field sobriety tests or administered them properly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff made only one of these arguments to the hearing officer, and then only in an incoherent form.

It reasoned as follows: \"A driver operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of a drug is one whose mental, physical or nervous processes have become so affected that he lacked to an appreciable degree the ability to function properly in the operation of his vehicle.... Typical indicia of the inability to function as a driver because of the intoxicating effect of drugs or alcohol include whether a defendant smells of the drug, has slurred speech, fumbles in retrieving paperwork, has glassy and bloodshot eyes, admits that he has, while driving, been using drugs or fails sobriety tests.... Most importantly, the main indicia of intoxication relates to the ability to operate the vehicle without committing traffic violations.\" (Citations omitted.) Id., at 528-29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20A.2d%20706\">\n    901 A.2d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Dalzell\n   </em>\n   , the court observed that the defendant \"used his signals correctly and observed all posted signs, speed limits, traffic control signals and markings.... To arrive at the conclusion that probable cause existed, one must ignore the fact that, except for the seat belt violation, the defendant operated his motor vehicle in a manner consistent with that of an ordinary, careful and prudent driver over a considerable distance on multiple city roads.\" Id., at 529-30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20A.2d%20706\">\n    901 A.2d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The same cannot be said for the plaintiff here. He clearly had not been able to operate his vehicle in a manner consistent with that of an ordinary, careful and prudent driver. Although he denied striking the telephone pole, he had clearly struck something substantial, sustaining major front-end damage to his car, and then left the scene of his accident. Moreover, his eyes were bloodshot and his pupils constricted, not at noon on a sunny day, but before five o'clock in the morning. He failed all three field sobriety tests. He lost his balance while trying to walk, stopped repeatedly to steady himself, was uneasy on his feet, and his legs were shaking. This substantial circumstantial evidence supported the\n   hearing officer's finding that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for a violation of \u00a7 14-227a, as required for a license suspension under \u00a7 14-227b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nor is there any merit to the plaintiff's claim that there was an insufficient temporal nexus between intoxication and operation. The police received the report of a vehicle crashing into a telephone pole at approximately 4:44 a.m. and Armstrong responded to the dispatch \"immediately.\" ROR, narrative, p. 1. Armstrong located the plaintiff beside his stopped, damaged car, and the plaintiff told Armstrong that his accident had occurred at approximately 4:45 a.m. ROR, narrative, p. 2. Armstrong interviewed the plaintiff, conducted the field tests, and arrested the plaintiff by 5:14 a.m. ROR, narrative, p. 3. The evidence clearly supports a temporal nexus between the operation and the intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiff argues that there is no substantial evidence that he refused to submit to the second form of chemical\n   testing. His argument is based on three claims: first, that the refusal is inadequately described in the police report; second, that the plaintiff's refusal was not properly witnessed; and third, that there was no reasonable basis for requiring a urine test after the plaintiff passed the breath test. None of these claims were brought to the attention of the hearing officer and therefore are not properly before the court.

In\n   <em>\n    Bialowas\n   </em>\n   , the police report stated that the accused \"was explained all necessary procedures but failed to give a sufficient breath sample on three separate occasions ...

In this case, however, internal evidence in the A-44 form and attached reports indicate that all relevant events, including the refusal, occurred in the early morning hours of May 14, 2016, but that Armstrong, the arresting officer, did not complete the police report until May 19, 2016. The attached report is, by regulation, incorporated into the A-44 form if, as is the case here, it is sworn to\n   by the arresting officer. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 14-227b-10 (b) (\"Additional statements or materials necessary to explain any item of information in the report may be attached to the report. Such attachment[s] shall be considered a part of the report having the approval of the commissioner, as provided in subsection [c] of section 14-227b of the Connecticut General Statutes, if sworn to under penalty of false statement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In this case, both the A-44 and the attached reports all consistently report the events of the investigation, arrest, breath\n   test, and refusal as occurring as one continuous sequence of events on the same day, May 14, from the initial report of the accident at around 4:44 a.m. to the testing between 5:50 a.m. and 7:07 a.m. Except for the blank next to the word \"refusal,\" which states the date as 5/19/2016, all the dates in the A-44, on the breath test strip attached to the A-44, and the police report refer to the events as occurring on May 14, 2016. The report itself, however, was completed on May 19, 2016, and Armstrong's oath, both on the A-44 and on the narrative police report, was taken on May 19, 2016, by a Sergeant Marley. Section J of the A-44 form, captioned \"Chemical Alcohol Test Refusal,\" was signed by Ryan Rathgaber, badge number 13. Although the plaintiff argues that there is no evidence that Rathgaber was present on the morning of May 14, Rathgaber endorsed the form under the statement: \"The operator named above refused to submit to such test or analysis when requested to do so. The refusal occurred in my presence and my endorsement appears below.\" As required by \u00a7 14-227b (c), Armstrong, as the arresting officer, subsequently subscribed and swore to the report of the chemical alcohol test or refusal under penalty of false statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A reasonable inference, from the evidence as a whole, is that the plaintiff refused the urine test on May 14,\n   the morning of his arrest, rather than May 19 as stated on the form. On May 14, the date of the arrest, Armstrong was working the midnight to 8 a.m. shift. ROR, narrative report, p. 1. The narrative portion of his report attests that the breath test was administered at 5:50 a.m. and that he then requested a urine sample. At that point, the plaintiff indicated that he wanted to speak to an attorney and made several attempts to reach one. When he could not reach one, he spoke with a family member and then \"elected to refuse a urine sample.\" The narrative, though not explicit as to the time of refusal, makes it clear that it occurred on the same day as the arrest and breath test. After the breath test, moreover, the plaintiff indicated that he was having chest pains and difficulty breathing, at which point an ambulance was called. The plaintiff refused to go to the hospital and was subsequently released on a $600 nonsurety bond. It is reasonable to infer that by the time the plaintiff was evaluated by ambulance personnel and the processing of his arrest and bond was completed, Armstrong's shift was nearly over and he was unable to complete the arrest report until a few days later, May 19. Based on the consistent references to May 14 as the date of the events in question and the narrative documenting an uninterrupted sequence of events, it is further reasonable to infer that the single reference to \"5/19/16\" on the A-44 line documenting the refusal is a simple error that occurred when Armstrong completed the form on May 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The totality of the evidence, including the narrative report, provides reliable, probative and substantial evidence that the plaintiff refused to submit to a urine test after passing a breath test. The plaintiff has not borne his burden of proving that the hearing officer acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of her discretion in finding sufficient evidence of refusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The plaintiff's final argument is that there was no reasonable cause to change the testing method. This claim was not raised below, is not preserved for review, and if reviewed, lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Section 14-227b (k) states: \"The provisions of this section shall apply with the\n   same effect to the refusal by any person to submit to an additional chemical test as provided in subdivision (5) of subsection (b) of section 14-227a.\" Section 14-227a (b) (5) provides in relevant part that evidence of the amount of alcohol or drug in a defendant's blood or urine, as shown by a chemical analysis, is admissible if \"an additional chemical test of the same type was performed at least ten minutes after the initial test was performed or, if requested by the police officer for reasonable cause, an additional chemical test of a different type was performed to detect the presence of a drug or drugs other than or in addition to alcohol ....\" The plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Saba\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. CV-97-64786-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20142434\">\n    1998 WL 142434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (March 17, 1998) (\n   <em>\n    Klaczak, J.\n   </em>\n   ) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20433\">\n    21 Conn.

The court agrees that\n   <em>\n    Saba\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Georgino\n   </em>\n   are instructive, but they do not help the plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Saba\n   </em>\n   , the evidence supporting a request for a urine test after the plaintiff passed a breath test was that \"the plaintiff was not operating his vehicle while in full control of his faculties. He was operating without headlights at 2 a.m. and entered a parking area through a marked exit lane. He did not satisfactorily perform field sobriety tests. There was marijuana residue in the\n   vehicle and he admitted being in the company earlier of people who were smoking marijuana. The police officer was not required to accept his statement that the plaintiff had not smoked any himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Saba\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20433\">\n    21 Conn. L. Rptr. at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on that evidence, the court found that the request for the urine test was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Georgino\n   </em>\n   , the evidence supporting a request for a urine test after the plaintiff passed a breath test was that \"the plaintiff was virtually out of control at the time he was arrested. He had just driven his vehicle into a stationary object. He had urinated on himself. He was unable to deal with the task of handing over his license and registration papers ... much less perform the coordination tests administered by the police officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Georgino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CV-97-0570325. Based on that evidence, the court concluded that \"[w]hen the breath test, which measures only alcohol in the blood, showed a level below intoxication, the police officer had a reasonable basis for requiring a different type of test, one that might detect the presence of some other drug to account for the plaintiff's extreme symptoms.\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The plaintiff here claims that such reasonable cause was absent in his case. To the contrary, many of the same facts were present. He had just crashed his car into a stationary object, resulting in substantial front end damage to his car. He left the scene of the accident even though substantial property damage had occurred. He insisted that he had hit a traffic cone even though a traffic cone could not have caused such damage to his car. His eyes were drowsy, droopy-lidded and redrimmed. His pupils were constricted, which, to the officer, suggested use of narcotics. His movements were very slow. He failed all three field sobriety tests. In attempting the walk and turn and one-leg stand tests,\n   he could not maintain his balance or follow directions, and he was very uneasy on his feet, with his legs shaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the officer had no reason to request a breath test in the first place if he suspected only narcotic\n   use. The plaintiff, however, \"immediately volunteered to take a Breathalyzer test\" before his arrest. ROR, narrative, p. 2. After his arrest, at the police station, the plaintiff initially declined the officer's offer to contact an attorney and \"almost enthusiastically elected to submit to a breath test.\" The fact that the plaintiff did not smell of alcohol does not mean that it was unreasonable, in the first instance, to start with the breath test. The officer's decision to request a urine test, when the breath test did not indicate any alcohol in the plaintiff's system, was entirely reasonable based on the plaintiff's failure to control his vehicle, his flight from the scene of his accident, his failure of the field sobriety tests, and his apparent inability to understand or explain how he had damaged his car so substantially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court has carefully considered each of the plaintiff's arguments in light of the evidence in the entire record. The hearing officer's decision is supported by substantial reliable and probative evidence. The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b is commonly referred to as the implied consent statute.\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782240\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/134/668/#p674\">\n     134 Conn.
