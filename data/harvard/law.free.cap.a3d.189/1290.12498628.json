Conlan, in a consolidated action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having considered the parties' briefs on appeal and the Superior Court record, the Court has concluded that the appeal must be dismissed, without prejudice, for the appellant's failure to comply with Supreme Court Rule 42 when filing an appeal from an interlocutory order. The Superior Court's order on appeal did not resolve the action against the State defendants-James Welch and Thomas Carroll-and was not certified as a final judgment under Superior Court Civil Rule 54b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the absence of the Rule 54(b) certification, the appeal is interlocutory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the appeal is DISMISSED without notice,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , under Supreme Court Rule 29(c). The mandate shall issue forthwith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-11\">\n    By order dated October 14, 2013, the Superior Court consolidated C.A. No. 07C-01-202 and C.A.
