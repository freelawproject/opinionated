The appellant has not responded to the notice to show cause within the required ten-day period and has not paid the filing fee or filed a motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   . Dismissal of the appeal is therefore deemed to be unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, under Supreme Court Rules 3(b)(2) and 29(b), that this appeal is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
