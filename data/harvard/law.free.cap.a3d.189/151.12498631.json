The defendant premised his arguments on his understanding that when the court vacated his conviction of burglary in the first degree, his conviction of home invasion became the predicate offense for his sentence for felony murder. In 2011, when the defendant committed the offenses, the felony murder statute listed burglary, but not home invasion, as a predicate offense for felony murder. General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 53a-54c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argued that, therefore, basing his sentence for felony murder on his home invasion conviction violated the ex post facto provision of the constitution of the United States and his due process rights under the state and federal constitutions. On April 27, 2017, the state filed an opposition to the defendant's\n   motion to correct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that the defendant's sentence for felony murder was not illegal because that conviction and sentence rested on his vacated conviction of burglary in the first degree, not on his home invasion conviction. The court held a hearing on May 4, 2017, and, agreeing with the state's reasoning, denied the defendant's motion to correct. This appeal followed. Additional procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims, in essence, that the court erroneously denied his motion to correct by finding that his sentence for felony murder had been based on the predicate offense of burglary, which the court had vacated so as to avoid double jeopardy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the state argues that \"[t]he vacatur of the\n   burglary verdict does not erase the fact that the jury found the defendant guilty of burglary and consequently of felony murder,\" and that thus, \"the court's sentence on the [f]elony [m]urder count was valid and the trial court properly denied [the defendant's\n   m]otion to [c]orrect an [i]llegal [s]entence.\" We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review and relevant law. \"We review the [trial] court's denial of [a] defendant's motion to correct [an illegal sentence] under the abuse of discretion standard of review....

Proof of this element will depend on your deliberations pertaining to the fifth count on which I have already instructed you. If you find the defendant guilty of burglary in the fifth count, then this element of felony murder will be proven. If you find the defendant either not guilty on the fifth count or guilty of the lesser included offense of criminal trespass, then this element has not been proven and you must find the defendant not guilty on this count.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of felony murder based on the predicate offense of burglary, as clearly delineated in the long form information and the court's jury instructions. Although the court later vacated the defendant's burglary conviction on double jeopardy grounds, he was not restored, as he argues in his brief to this court, to his pretrial status, a presumption of innocence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20242\">\n    308 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   260 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201084\">\n    61 A.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (vacatur does not alter verdict of guilty actually rendered). Because the court could have reinstated the defendant's burglary conviction, had it later reversed the defendant's conviction of home invasion \"for reasons not related to the viability of the vacated conviction\";\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   , supra, 263 ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20741\">\n    317 Conn. at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20490\">\n    120 A.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; it follows that the\n   court could rely on the vacated burglary conviction when sentencing the defendant for felony murder. To convict the defendant of felony murder in this case, the state needed only to \"prove all the elements of [burglary] and then prove that the [death was] in the course of and in furtherance of that felony, or that the [death was] caused in flight from the commission of that felony.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484831\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1108/#p269\">\n    165 Conn.

That the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charges of burglary in the first degree and felony murder demonstrates that the state met that burden.

First, the defendant claims that his conviction and subsequent sentence for felony murder violated the ex post facto provisions of the constitution of the United States; see U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3 ; U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1 ; because home invasion was not a predicate offense for felony murder in 2011, when he committed the offenses. Second, the defendant claims, in essence, that the court violated his due process rights under the state and federal constitutions by depriving him of notice that his conviction of home invasion could serve as the predicate offense for his felony murder sentence. Because we hold that the court properly relied on the defendant's vacated burglary conviction, and not on his home invasion conviction, as the predicate offense for felony murder, we need not address these two claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Additionally, the defendant seemingly claims that the court improperly denied his motion for default. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Specifically, the defendant argues that the state failed to file a timely objection to his motion to correct, in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 66-2. Practice Book \u00a7 66-2, however, applies to appellate motions practice. The Practice Book sections that govern procedure in criminal matters do not contain any time requirements with respect to objections to motions to correct. See, e.g., Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 (correction of illegal sentence). Accordingly, this claim fails.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    We note that courts of other jurisdictions have explicitly held that \"it is not necessary ... to charge a defendant separately with the underlying felony in order for a felony-murder instruction to obtain.\" See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Stephens\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Borg,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179561\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/932/#p935\">\n     59 F.3d 932\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 935 (9th Cir. 1995) (applying California law).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
