N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b). When defendant James T. Dougherty was arrested and charged with violating N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b), he had one prior DWI conviction, one prior refusal conviction, and his license was suspended for the refusal. He contends 2C:40-26(b) requires convictions of the same two predicate violations, either two convictions for driving while intoxicated, or two convictions for refusal, not one of each. Based on the plain language of the statute, we conclude the two predicate violations may consist of one prior DWI and one prior refusal conviction. Hence, we affirm the denial of defendant's motion to\n   dismiss the indictment, his subsequent conviction, and vacate the Law Division judge's stay of his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was convicted on August 19, 2015, of DWI, and on November 9, 2015, of refusal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 19, 2015, during the seven-month refusal suspension,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   police stopped defendant while he was operating a motor vehicle. A grand jury indicted him for driving while suspended, and after the judge denied his motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea.

Statement to S. 2939\n   </em>\n   (Nov. 23, 2009) ). The phrase \"certain drunk driving offenses\" is not limited to one category of offense. It necessarily refers to more than DWI. Otherwise it would have said the intent of the law was to create \"criminal penalties for persons whose [drivers'] licenses are suspended for DWI and who, while under suspension for that offense, unlawfully operate a motor vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Additionally, the\n   <em>\n    Sponsor's Statement to S. 2939\n   </em>\n   (June 15, 2009) explained that N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) made it a fourth-degree crime for \"a person who is convicted of a second or subsequent driving while intoxicated or refusal offense\" to operate a\n   motor vehicle during a period of license suspension \"for that second offense.\" After the specific mention of DWI and refusal, the language states: \"that second offense[,]\" effectively referring to both types of offenses interchangeably as possibilities. The legislative intent\n   is therefore clear-the word \"either\" is imported into the use of \"or\" in this statute. Since the statute is not ambiguous, and the pertinent language does not lend itself to a different reasonable interpretation, the rule of lenity does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is noteworthy that the statute, unlike most fourth-degree crimes, imposes a mandatory 180-day jail sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That speaks to the legislative purpose of addressing the problem of drunk driving by imposing significant sanctions, tailored to maximize the deterrent impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We affirm defendant's conviction and vacate the stay of the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The refusal arrest took place on February 4, 2009.
