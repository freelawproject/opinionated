Prior to joining Employer, Claimant worked as a volunteer firefighter for other fire departments since 1974. In 2006, Claimant's family physician diagnosed Claimant with stomach cancer. Following his diagnosis, Claimant underwent surgery and radiation therapy to treat his illness. After being unable to work for approximately six weeks, Claimant returned to work for Employer as a fire police officer and no longer assumed the duties of a firefighter. Claimant later chose to retire, with his last day of employment being October 29, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 10, 2014, Claimant filed a claim petition, alleging that he sustained stomach cancer due to exposure to carcinogens during his tenure as a volunteer firefighter for Employer. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 1a-5a.) In so doing, Claimant sought payment of medical bills and full disability benefits from April 1 to June 1, 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Employer opposed Claimant's petition, and a WCJ scheduled a hearing. In support of his claim petition, Claimant testified via deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Claimant testified that during his tenure as a firefighter, he was exposed to smoke and diesel fuel emissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175a-84a.) After being diagnosed with stomach cancer, Claimant transferred to the fire police position, as he \"didn't want to risk going into anymore [sic] smoke ... as a firefighter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 203a.) Claimant testified that, as early as 2006 or 2007, he suspected there might be a connection between his firefighting duties and his stomach cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 241a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Claimant testified that sometime after July 2011, he read an article discussing Pennsylvania's passage of a law regarding cancer in firefighters and how it may affect their rights under the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 226a.) After reading this article, Claimant again suspected a connection between his service as a firefighter and his cancer diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, Claimant sought the services of an attorney to discuss his workers' compensation rights, and Claimant entered\n   into a fee agreement with counsel on August 5, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claimant further testified that on September 16, 2014, a doctor confirmed Claimant's beliefs regarding the relationship between Claimant's cancer and his service as a firefighter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194a.) This was the first time Claimant received any indication from a doctor that his service as a firefighter caused his cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, Claimant filed his claim petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By decision and order dated August 31, 2015, the WCJ granted Claimant's claim petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58a.) Employer appealed to the Board. By opinion and order dated July 20, 2016, the Board opined that the WCJ erred in applying an inapplicable presumption to Claimant's claim and remanded the matter to the WCJ to render a determination without applying the presumption. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On remand, the WCJ again granted Claimant's claim petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74a.) In so doing, the WCJ made the following pertinent conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6.

Whether an employee has provided timely notice is a mixed question of law and fact. The courts had indicated that the 120-day notice period does not begin to run until an employee \"knows or by the exercise of reasonable diligence, has reason to know of the injury and its possible relationship to [his] employment.\" Reasonable diligence has been defined as a reasonable effort to discover the cause of an injury under the facts and circumstances present in the case.

This [WCJ] had previously concluded, and the [Board] affirmed this conclusion, that Claimant provided timely notice in the instant dispute. Specifically,\n   <em>\n    although Claimant knew of a possibility that his cancer may have a link to his firefighting activities as evidenced by his acknowledgement he changed jobs because of a fear of recurrence or his acknowledgement that he had read an article about the passage of Act 46, it was not until he received a copy of the report prepared by [a doctor] dated September 16, 2014 that he knew that there was the causal link between his cancer and the firefighting activity and as such the 120[-]day notice period did not begin to run until September 16, 2014.\n   </em>\n   The Claim Petition, which Employer contends was the first notice it received of this claim, was filed on November 10, 2014, well within the 120-day notice period, but after the applicable 21-day notice set forth in [S]ection 311 of the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80a-81a (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Employer appealed this decision to the Board, alleging that some of the WCJ's factual findings were unsupported by substantial evidence and that the WCJ made multiple errors of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85a-86a.) Among Employer's challenges, it argued that the WCJ erred in concluding that Claimant provided sufficient notice to Employer of his cancer within 120 days, as required by Section 311 of the Act. By opinion and order dated July 6, 2017, the Board affirmed the WCJ's decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90a.) Regarding Employer's argument that Claimant failed to provide timely notice, the Board reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Employer] also argues that the WCJ erred in finding that Claimant provided timely notice of his alleged cancer within 120 days as required by Section 311 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 631. We addressed this argument in our prior Opinion in this matter. We noted that the WCJ found that the notice period did not begin to run until Claimant received a copy of [a doctor's] report on September 16, 2014, informing him of the causal link between his cancer and firefighting.\n   <em>\n    We noted that in occupational disease matters, it is generally recognized that the notice period does not begin to run until the claimant is advised by a physician that he has an occupational disease and that it is related to his work.\n   </em>\n   We noted Claimant's testimony that although he felt that there might be a connection between his cancer and firefighting, this suspicion was not confirmed until he received a letter from his attorney and a report from [a doctor] in September 2014. Before receiving this information, he had never been informed by any doctor that his cancer was related to his exposures as a firefighter. [The doctor's] report was dated September 16, 2014, and Claimant filed his Claim Petition on November 7, 2014, well within the 120-day time period proscribed [sic] by Section 311.

On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employer argues that the Board erred in concluding that Claimant provided adequate notice of his cancer. Specifically, Employer argues that the Board erred by failing to analyze whether Claimant exercised reasonable diligence to discover the origins of his cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Notice of a work-related injury is a prerequisite to receiving workers' compensation benefits, and the claimant bears the burden of showing that proper notice was given.\n   <em>\n    Gentex Corp. v.

In its opinion, the Board noted that \"the notice period does not begin to run until the claimant is advised by a physician that he has an occupational disease and that it is related to his work.\" (R.R. at 100a.)

Eventually, Sell was diagnosed and hospitalized for emphysema. Sell never discussed the cause of her emphysema with her treating physicians during her hospitalization. Following her hospitalization, Sell did not return to work, but she began looking \"for a physician with knowledge of the chemicals and dust in her work environment,\" whom she did not find until almost nine months after she left work. That physician informed Sell that she could return to work if she exercised caution with regard to her exposure to formaldehyde, and Sell then informed her employer of this limitation and how formaldehyde had affected her health.\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124695,11105471\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/771/1246/\">\n    771 A.2d at 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
