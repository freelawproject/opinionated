Freeburg (Commissioner Freeburg), and Commissioner Matthew Quesenberry (Commissioner Quesenberry) (collectively, County Appellants),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of the 59th\n   Judicial District, Elk County Branch (trial court). Elk County Prothonotary Susanne Schneider (Schneider) instituted this action, seeking a writ of mandamus following the removal of her husband from her healthcare coverage. The trial court granted Schneider the requested mandamus relief and ordered County Appellants to reinstate Schneider's spousal coverage benefit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court also denied County Appellants' motion for post-trial relief. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Elk County (County) residents elected Schneider to her position as Prothonotary in 2011 (term commencing January 2012) and reelected her in 2015 (term commencing January 2016). During Schneider's first term, the County healthcare plan covered Schneider's husband and the spouses of other County employees. On August 11, 2015, the Board of Commissioners amended its healthcare plan to limit spousal coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the new limitation, if an employee's spouse has access to an employer-sponsored healthcare plan, \"the spouse shall be required to obtain coverage from that employer and shall not be eligible for coverage from Elk County.\" (Original Record (O.R.), Item No. 10, Ex. D, at 17.) The limitation on spousal coverage was set to become effective immediately before Schneider's second term began.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to spouses without access to employer-sponsored healthcare, coverage would continue for the spouses of County employees who were members of a union.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The spouses of fourteen County employees, including Schneider's husband, were removed from coverage as a result of the new limitation on spousal coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Schneider filed a complaint on December 31, 2015, alleging that the removal of her husband from her healthcare coverage constituted a violation of Section 1556 of The County Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a violation of what is\n   commonly referred to as the Salary and Emoluments Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and unconstitutional discrimination in violation of her rights to equal protection under the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 5a-7a, \u00b6\u00b6 8-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 22, 2016, County Appellants filed an answer with new matter. County Appellants averred that Schneider's husband has no claim under the Salary and Emoluments Clause because he is not a county officer. County Appellants then averred that Schneider's husband is not a \"dependent\" and, therefore, is not entitled to protection under Section 1556 of The County Code. Finally, County Appellants averred that there was no discrimination because the spousal coverage limitation under the County's new healthcare plan applied to Schneider in the exact same manner it applied to County employees generally. Schneider denied the averments in County Appellants' new matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 15, 2016, the trial court conducted a bench trial. Rather than provide testimony, the parties filed written stipulations with the trial court. In addition to the facts reflected above, the parties stipulated to the following pertinent facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   14. On August 11, 2015, Defendants [ (County Appellants) ] amended the County health care plan to remove from eligibility for coverage the spouses of employees who have an employer-sponsored group health care plan, effective January 1, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   15. As of January 2016, Plaintiff's [ (Schneider) ] spouse was eligible to participate in a group health care plan provided by his employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   16. As a result of Defendants' action to amend the County health care plan, beginning in January of 2016 Plaintiff's spouse was ineligible for coverage under the County health care plan, and had to pay for his own healthcare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (R.R. at 25a, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16 (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Regarding those affected by the amended healthcare plan, the stipulations continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   20. Defendant Janis Kemmer is an elected Commissioner of Elk County. Her husband has been, and continues to remain, on Elk County's health insurance plan. He is a retired farmer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   21. Peter Weidenboerner is the elected Register/ Recorder of Elk County. His wife has been, and continues to remain, on Elk County's health insurance plan. She is not employed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   22. Peggy Schneider is the elected Treasurer of Elk County. Her husband has been, and continues to remain, on Elk County's health insurance plan. He is retired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   23. Defendant Matthew Quesenberry is an elected County Commissioner, who entered office on January 4, 2016. Prior to that date he was a full-time employee of the County. His wife is employed and has health insurance coverage through her employer. She was removed from coverage on the County health care plan in January of 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   24. Defendant Daniel Freeburg is an elected County Commissioner who is serving his third term. His wife is employed and has health insurance coverage through her employer. She did not participate in the County plan prior to 2016 and is not a participant now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (R.R. at 26a, \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The amended healthcare plan, attached to the stipulations, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The County of Elk provides coverage for all eligible full-time employees following their one-month orientation period, followed by a 90-day waiting period, in accord with the Affordable Care Act of 2014.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   If a position is changed from part-time to full-time, the employee occupying that position will be eligible for coverage the first full month following the change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   If an employee's spouse has an employer-sponsored group health care plan, the spouse shall be required to obtain coverage from that employer and shall not be eligible for coverage from Elk County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (O.R., Item No. 10, Ex. D at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 23, 2016, the trial court filed an order and opinion, granting Schneider mandamus relief and ordering County Appellants to reinstate Schneider's spousal coverage. The trial court rejected County Appellants' argument that Schneider's husband was not a \"dependent\" under Section 1556 of The County Code. The trial court reasoned that County Appellants treated Schneider's husband as a dependent prior to the amendment to the County healthcare plan. The trial court then determined that the removal of Schneider's husband from coverage violated Section 1556. Citing\n   <em>\n    DeGeorge v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8984691\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/48/\">\n    892 A.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth.),\n   <em>\n    appeal denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20Pa.%20785\">\n    588 Pa. 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=906%20A.2d%20544\">\n    906 A.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), the trial court concluded that \"where the [C]ounty provides healthcare to the spouses of employees such plan must be offered generally to employees of the county.\" (R.R. at 107a (emphasis and quotation marks omitted).) Finally, the trial court briefly discussed Schneider's constitutional arguments, but it declined to reach a conclusion on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 29, 2016, County Appellants filed a motion for post-trial relief, contending that the trial court misapplied Section 1556 of The County Code. Thereafter, Schneider filed a response, arguing that the trial court correctly applied Section 1556. On July 10, 2017, the trial court denied County Appellants' motion for post-trial relief. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   County Appellants argue that the trial court erred in its interpretation of Section 1556 of The County Code. Specifically, County Appellants argue that Section 1556 of The County Code provides that elected officers of the County are eligible to participate in benefit plans that are \"\n   <em>\n    offered generally to employees of the county\n   </em>\n   ,\" and it does not mandate that elected officers receive a benefit that is not generally available to County employees. (Emphasis added.) County Appellants maintain that the change in spousal coverage applies to Schneider in the same manner that it applies to all other County elected officers and non-union County employees. Moreover, County Appellants assert that the change in spousal coverage does not violate the Salary and Emoluments Clause, because the County announced the change and the change took effect prior to the start of Schneider's second term. Finally, County Appellants assert that because the limitation on spousal coverage applies indiscriminately to officers and non-union employees, there has been no violation of equal protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In response, Schneider argues that the trial court correctly concluded that the spousal coverage limitation violates Section 1556 of The County Code, because Section 1556 provides, in part, that \"county officers\n   <em>\n    and their dependents\n   </em>\n   shall be eligible for inclusion\" in health insurance plans, and, here, some spouses of County employees and County officers receive spousal coverage while others do not. Schneider also argues that County Appellants violated the Salary and Emoluments Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution by implementing this change after she entered the race for her second term as Prothonotary. Schneider further argues that this result also evinces unlawful discrimination under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Finally, Schneider argues that the trial court correctly ordered mandamus relief and the reinstatement of her husband's coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When interpreting a statute, this Court is guided by the Statutory Construction\n   Act of 1972, 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 - 1991, which provides that \"[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of all statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\" 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \"The clearest indication of legislative intent is generally the plain language of a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). Only \"[w]hen the words of the statute are not explicit\" may this Court resort to statutory construction. 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(c). \"A statute is ambiguous or unclear if its language is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations.\"\n   <em>\n    Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Prot.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7863349\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/676/711/#p715\">\n    676 A.2d 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715 (Pa.

Moreover, \"[e]very statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\" 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). It is presumed \"[t]hat the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be effective and certain.\" 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1922(2). Thus, no provision of a statute shall be \"reduced to mere surplusage.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"91572,9286972\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/842/389/\">\n    842 A.2d at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like in\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   , no part-time county employees in\n   <em>\n    Pirillo\n   </em>\n   received fringe benefits and both the county auditors and the jury commissioners worked for the county part-time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7305606\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/74/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7305606\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/74/366/\">\n    at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, this Court determined that\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   (as opposed to\n   <em>\n    DeGeorge\n   </em>\n   ) was applicable and that under\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   the county did not violate Section 1556 of The County Code by terminating fringe benefits for its part-time county officers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7305606\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/74/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Initially, we reiterate, as we did in\n   <em>\n    DeGeorge\n   </em>\n   , that Section 1556 of The County Code groups county commissioners with other county officers, and it addresses both in relation to benefits provided to other county employees. Thus, the principal aim of Section 1556 is to limit county officers from providing benefits to themselves but not to other county employees. \"[A]s long as those benefits are offered generally to county employees, they can be offered to [c]ounty officers.\"\n   <em>\n    DeGeorge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8984691\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/48/\">\n    892 A.2d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commissioners, therefore, are limited in the benefit that they themselves can receive by the benefits provided to county employees generally. County commissioners cannot receive greater benefits than the remainder of county employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition to the principal concern of different benefits for officers than other county employees,\n   <em>\n    DeGeorge\n   </em>\n   and its progeny addressed disputes\n   <em>\n    among\n   </em>\n   county officers. Within that group (county officers), we have held that Section 1556 of The County Code prohibits county commissioners from providing certain benefits to themselves and certain officers while excluding other similarly-situated officers. In other words, our caselaw interpreting Section 1556 requires a two-step analysis. First, the benefit package provided to county employees generally informs the benefits that officers may receive-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it provides the ceiling for the eligibility of officer benefits. Second, the benefit package provided to county commissioners and certain county officers must be available to all other similarly-situated county officers. There is no contention by either party in this case that County Appellants provided themselves with benefits beyond the benefits provided to County employees generally. Thus, we move to the second step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, we cannot say that County Appellants violated Section 1556 of The County Code where they provided the same amended healthcare plan to all qualifying full-time County employees and, pertinent to this case, all full-time officers. Section 1556 refers to the \"health ... insurance plan[ ] ... offered generally to\n   employes of\" a county.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 1556 of The County Code. The parties' joint stipulations provide that County Appellants amended the healthcare plan \"to remove from coverage the spouses of employees who have employer-sponsored\" healthcare, (R.R. at 25a, \u00b6 14), and Schneider is no different than any other County officer subject to that limitation. Crucially, while there is a limitation within the plan itself, all of the County officers receive the same healthcare plan from the County. That the amendment of the healthcare plan\n   <em>\n    results\n   </em>\n   in the loss of Schneider's spousal coverage does not negate Schneider's\n   <em>\n    eligibility\n   </em>\n   to the same plan as the other officers. This is further evinced by Commissioner Quesenberry, an officer in another position with Elk County, also losing spousal coverage following the amendment. If either Schneider's spouse or Commissioner Quesenberry's spouse did not have access to an employer-sponsored healthcare plan, they would be covered under the amended County plan because the County provided the same plan to Commissioner Quesenberry and Schneider that it provided to the other similarly-situated employees. As the same healthcare plan is available to all similarly-situated Elk County employees, the limitation of spousal coverage does not result in discrimination proscribed by Section 1556.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The trial court erred in determining that County Appellants violated Section 1556 of The County Code when it amended its County healthcare plan.

The Association contends that mandating that particular benefits remain the same during an entire four-year term eliminates a county's bargaining capacity as it relates to healthcare. The Association maintains that a county would have no leverage to negotiate the cost of benefits, leaving them at the mercy of health insurance companies. The Association also expressed concerns that limitations would not be restricted to a single four-year term, due to staggered terms. Finally, the Association expressed concerns that the interplay between the Salary and Emoluments Clause and Section 1556 of The County Code could, theoretically, limit a county's ability to change county employees' benefits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
