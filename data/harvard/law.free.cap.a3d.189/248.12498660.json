Walker, J.\n   </em>\n   ) determining Citizens' M.R. Civ. P. 80B petition for review to be moot and granting judgment in favor of the Town on Citizens' complaint for a declaratory judgment. Citizens contends that the court erred when it declared that the Brunswick Charter does not authorize a voter initiative to overrule a Town Council decision to sell a piece of residential property owned by the municipality. We affirm the court's determination that the Rule 80B petition is moot, vacate the declaratory judgment as moot, and remand for dismissal of the complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The following facts are not in dispute. The Town of Brunswick acquired waterfront property at 946 Mere Point\n   Road in a tax delinquency foreclosure in 2011. On September 19, 2016, the Town Council voted to sell the property. The marketing of the property proceeded, and the sale was completed on June 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] One month after the Council voted to sell the property, five Brunswick residents obtained petitions from the Town Clerk to begin initiative proceedings to enact an ordinance-focused on the specific property at issue-that would require the Town to retain the parcel for use as a public park and for access for shellfish harvesters. On January 27, 2017, petition forms containing the requisite number of signatures were returned to the clerk, who referred them to the Council to determine whether to set a date for a public hearing on the proposed ordinance. At its next meeting, the Town Council rejected a motion to put the proposed ordinance out to a vote and accepted a motion to take no further action on the petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 4] On February 21, 2017, Citizens filed a Rule 80B petition for review of the Council's decision to take no action on the initiative petition and a complaint for declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 80B ; 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 5954 (2017). Citizens sought a declaration that the Town Charter permits voters to enact, by initiative, an ordinance that would have the effect of overturning the Council's decision to sell the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brunswick, Me. Charter \u00a7 1105. The parties submitted an agreed-to statement of fact, and both parties filed briefs with the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The Superior Court (Cumberland County,\n   <em>\n    L. Walker, J.\n   </em>\n   ) issued a judgment on August 7, 2017-almost two months after the property had been sold. On the Rule 80B petition, the court concluded that the Town had acted outside the bounds of its discretion in declining to hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance. It determined, however, that the issue had been rendered moot by the sale of property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The court then granted judgment in favor of the Town on the central issue, however, entering a declaratory judgment that the voters could not utilize the initiative provision in the Town Charter to override the Council vote to sell the property. Citizens timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2B(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 7] \"Courts can only decide cases before them that involve justiciable controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewiston Daily Sun v. Sch. Admin. Dist.

No declaration by the court could create any legal impediment to the sale of the property that had been completed in June. Thus, no relief that the court could have granted would have any \"practical effect\" on Citizens' rights or interests with respect to the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halfway House, Inc. v. City of Portland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7874676\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/670/1377/#p1380\">\n    670 A.2d 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1380 (Me. 1996) (dismissing as moot an appeal from the denial of a conditional use permit where the intervening sale of property rendered any relief meaningless).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Citizens argues nonetheless that its complaint for a declaration of the law fits within the exception to our mootness jurisprudence permitting review of \"questions of great public concern.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting v.

When we address the exception for matters of \"great public concern,\" we ask \"whether the question is public or private, how much court officials need an authoritative determination for future rulings, and how likely the question is to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804719\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/136/714/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 10] The central question presented by Citizens is whether the Brunswick Charter authorizes voters to create-by initiative-an ordinance that would have the effect of overturning a Council vote to sell property. This question is \"public\" in nature. It deals with the rights of Brunswick residents and the authority of the Council. However, the authoritative value of any ruling is minimal. The interpretation of the Brunswick Charter may have little bearing on other town charters, and Citizens has presented no evidence that this specific question will recur in a similar fashion such that our guidance is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804719\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/136/714/\">\n    2016 ME 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804719\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/136/714/\">\n    136 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ten Voters of the City of Biddeford v.

The exception for cases of great public concern does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 11] In sum, given the timing of the court's judgment here, no declaration by the Superior Court could provide Citizens with any meaningful relief once the property that was the subject of this litigation was lawfully sold, and no exception to our mootness jurisprudence applies. The court correctly determined the Rule 80B petition to be moot and should have done the same regarding the declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Judgment determining Rule 80B petition to be moot affirmed.

Charter \u00a7\u00a7 1101, 1105 (2017).
