If so, we must determine whether disgorgement of defendant's salaries is the appropriate remedy for the illegal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude, upon review of the record and applicable principles of law, that the appointment was ultra vires because the mayor lacked the authority to place defendant in the position. As defendant was aware that serving in the position was a violation of state and local law, he did not act in good faith in remaining in the position and collecting a salary. Therefore, we are satisfied that the equitable remedy of disgorgement is appropriate under these circumstances. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2012, the mayor of the City\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appointed defendant to the position of Acting Business Administrator. The City's ordinances permitted defendant to hold the position for a term not to exceed ninety days; the appointment did not require the advice and consent of City Council. At the end of defendant's ninety-day term, the mayor appointed him to the full-time position of Business Administrator, which did require the advice and consent of City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The municipal government of the City is organized as a \"Mayor-Council Plan D\" form of government under the Faulkner Act, N.J.S.A. 40:69A-1 to -210. This Act, in conjunction with City ordinances, requires persons appointed to the position of a department director, such as the Business Administrator, receive the advice and consent of City Council. On October 2, 2012, plaintiff, City Council of the City of Orange Township (plaintiff or City Council), voted against confirmation of defendant to the position. The following day, the mayor appointed defendant as Deputy Business Administrator, setting a yearly salary of $105,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   City Council objected to the appointment. A letter to the mayor on October 16, 2012 memorialized City Council's objections and informed him defendant's term as Acting Business Administrator had expired and the Council had not confirmed him as Business Administrator. The mayor had no authority to appoint a deputy; only the department head had that authority. Nevertheless, defendant continued in the position, signing official documents as the Business Administrator and collecting a salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2013, plaintiff presented an Order to Show Cause and verified complaint against the mayor\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and defendant, seeking to\n   enjoin defendant from serving as Deputy Business Administrator. A\n   March 8, 2013 order required defendant and the mayor to appear and show cause why the court should not issue a preliminary injunction. Defendant filed an answer and third-party complaint against five City Council members in their individual and official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After oral argument, the court issued an order on April 18, 2013, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. [Defendant] shall not perform any of the functions of Business Administrator or Acting Business Administrator after May 30, 2013, unless appointed to those positions through the advice and consent of City Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. On or before the date of May 30, 2013, the City of Orange Township shall appoint a Business Administrator or Acting Business Administrator to head the Department of Administration as required by Statute and Ordinance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. The City shall be required to comply with ... N.J.S.A. 40:69A-43.1 and 43.2 in the appointment of any Deputy Director and any such appointment shall be made by the Director of the Department and the salary of that Deputy must be approved by the City Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. The Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint filed by [d]efendant ... shall be dismissed in its entirety without prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a result of this order, defendant subsequently left the position of Deputy Business Administrator and the mayor appointed him Chief of Staff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant and the mayor filed motions for reconsideration, which were granted by a different judge than had considered the Order to Show Cause. On February 28, 2014, in an oral decision, the second judge found it improper for his predecessor to have issued injunctive relief without hearing testimony. He therefore vacated paragraphs one and two of the April 2013 order, and amended paragraph four to reinstate one count of the third-party complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the ruling, plaintiff's counsel queried: \"Judge, just so that I'm clear and I get this, ... is it the [c]ourt's intention by vacating [c]ounts 1, 2 and 4 that Mr. Edwards can now serve as\n   the deputy business administrator because ... that was the thrust of the initial complaint.\" The judge responded: \"The effect of the order vacating [the prior] order does just that.\n   <em>\n    The factual effect of it, you know, remains to be executed\n   </em>\n   . All I did was vacate the order based upon the reasons I stated.\" (Emphasis added). Following the issuance of this order, defendant re-assumed the position of Deputy Business Administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Trial\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was scheduled for January 4, 2016 before Judge Christine A. Farrington. Defendant resigned from the position of Deputy Business Administrator on December 31, 2015. As a result, he contended the matter was moot and requested a dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Testimony at trial from a current councilwoman corroborated City Council's rejection of the appointment of defendant as Business Administrator and that a City ordinance required the mayor to remove acting persons after ninety days if the Council did not approve them. The councilwoman also advised the appointment of\n   defendant as Deputy Business Administrator was contrary to the municipal ordinance. Only the head of a department could appoint a deputy director. The mayor had no authority to appoint a Deputy Business Administrator. That was the province of the Business Administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The councilwoman further stated that even when defendant briefly left the position pursuant to court order and assumed the job of Chief of Staff, he continued to perform duties of the Business Administrator. Finally, the councilwoman confirmed City Council did not approve defendant's salary, which exceeded the salary of other deputies by $25,000 to $30,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's second witness, the municipal clerk, testified that the position of Deputy Business Administrator had never been lawfully created. A position of Assistant Business Administrator was created in 1985 but repealed that same year. Therefore, the positions of both Deputy and Assistant Business Administrator were unlawful after that time. She further advised the City had never enacted an ordinance creating a Chief of Staff, and it did not approve the salary of defendant in that post.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant also testified. In addition to his Bachelor of Arts degree, he holds a dual Masters degree in finance and business management from Columbia University. He was currently pursuing his MBA from New Jersey Institute of Technology and was a Ph.D. candidate at Seton Hall University. Defendant had served as a New Jersey state legislator and on numerous boards in both New York and New Jersey. Defendant advised as a college professor for more than twenty years, he was familiar with municipal government because he taught courses in government and public administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant's testimony conflicted on whether he ever read the pertinent statutes and municipal ordinances regarding his position. At times, defendant testified he did not read the applicable ordinances and statutes, at other times, he thought the statutes, codes, and court orders were subject to differing interpretations. He was adamant the mayor appointed him to the position, thus rendering defendant blameless for any wrongdoing, and claimed ignorance of the unlawfulness of his position. He also denied knowledge of his removal from the position by court order or that the Deputy Business Administrator position was unauthorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a comprehensive, well-reasoned opinion, Judge Farrington determined defendant's appointment to the position of Deputy Business Administrator was ultra vires in the primary sense as the mayor had no authority to appoint a Deputy Business Administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   She stated the actions of defendant and the mayor were purposeful and designed to circumvent City Council's decision to deny confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Judge Farrington found both the councilwoman and municipal clerk knowledgeable and credible. In contrast, the judge described defendant as \"argumentative, combative and evasive.\" She noted his \"impressive education credentials\" and his background of serving as a state legislator and college professor conflicted with his numerous declarations that he did not understand questions posed, was ignorant of the City ordinances and applicable statutes, and had a lack of knowledge and recall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Judge Farrington further concluded defendant was a de facto officer and he had not rendered his services in good faith as either the Deputy Business Administrator or Chief of Staff. Reiterating that defendant\n   was not credible, the judge found, in light of his extensive experience working in government and advanced degrees in public administration, \"[h]is attempts to present himself as an innocent party and cast blame for the appointments on the [m]ayor are unconvincing and disingenuous.... [H]e knew or had the ability to know the requirements of state and local law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The judge concluded disgorgement of defendant's salary was the appropriate remedy for his deliberate and knowing actions. Because defendant intentionally violated the statutes and City ordinances, she rejected defendant's contention that he was entitled to his salary under a quantum meruit theory. The court ordered remuneration for all salary defendant received serving in the unauthorized position of Deputy Business Administrator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Final determinations made by the trial court sitting in a non-jury case are subject to a limited and well-established scope of review.\"\n   <em>\n    D'Agostino v.

As there was no authority for defendant to serve in the deputy position, the mayor's appointment of a deputy was an illegal act-an act that was ultra vires in the primary sense and, therefore, void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We find defendant's argument that he accepted the position of Deputy Business Administrator in good faith and with the \"reasonable understanding\" that the mayor had the authority to appoint him to the post disingenuous. Defendant is a highly educated man who had served in the state legislature and taught college courses in municipal government and public administration. He acknowledged having reviewed the Faulkner Act, N.J.S.A. 40:69A-1 to - 210,\n   and the City ordinances that pertained to his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant also knew of City Council's objection to him serving in the deputy position. If there was any doubt, it was certainly alleviated when he was named as a defendant along with the mayor in plaintiff's application for injunctive relief and Order to\n   Show Cause. He was in court during the Order to Show Cause ruling and was directed in the April 2013 order to step down from the deputy position as his appointment was in violation of section 4-24(A)(4) of the City ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following the April 2013 order, defendant was removed from the deputy job and appointed as Chief of Staff, evidencing an awareness by him and the mayor of the illegality of his appointment. Although certain portions of the April order were vacated in a subsequent reconsideration, the provision ordering the City to comply with the statute's regulations concerning the appointment of a deputy director remained in effect. That provision directed any appointment of a deputy director be made by the director of the department and the salary for that position be approved by City Council. Nevertheless, in February 2014, in contravention of this order, defendant resumed the position of Deputy Business Administrator. Any claim of ignorance of the applicable laws is defeated by the ample divergent evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The record is bereft of any facts to support defendant's contention that plaintiff ratified his actions at any point. The filing of a lawsuit to enjoin his continued employment is more than sufficient to defeat that argument. His position that plaintiff's passage of a budget affirmed his salary and ratified his actions is also without merit.
