On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) improperly denied the defendant's motion in limine to exclude or limit the scope of the testimony of the state's expert witness on firearm and toolmark identification, and (2) abused its discretion by granting the state's motion for uncharged misconduct related to a shooting that occurred approximately eight months after the events of this case. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which a jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The defendant and Jose Rivera\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were members of\n   the Money Green Bedrock (Bedrock) street gang in Hartford. The victim was a member of The Avenue, another Hartford street gang. Bedrock and The Avenue are rival gangs, and the defendant and Rivera viewed members of The Avenue as \"the enemy.\" Prior to the events giving rise to this case, there were two incidents between the rival gangs involving the defendant and the victim. The first incident involved the victim firing shots at the defendant and another Bedrock member. The second incident, which occurred approximately one week prior to the events of this case, involved\n   the victim spotting the defendant and Rivera on The Avenue's territory and subsequently taking a picture of the defendant's vehicle leaving the area. Following the second incident, the defendant stated to Rivera that the victim \"had to go,\" which Rivera understood to mean that the victim \"had to get killed for what he did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the early morning hours of June 18, 2007, the defendant called Rivera and stated that he wanted to find members of The Avenue and test out a .223 caliber assault rifle. Rivera understood this to mean that, \"[b]asically, he wanted to go look [for] and kill some-body.\" The defendant picked up Rivera and drove to a parking lot located behind Bedford Street where there was an abandoned vehicle in which the defendant and Rivera stored guns and drugs. The defendant then put on latex gloves, removed a .223 caliber assault rifle from the trunk of the abandoned vehicle, and loaded the rifle. The defendant and Rivera then got back into the vehicle that they were driving; Rivera drove the vehicle and the defendant sat in the backseat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rivera drove the vehicle around areas that he and the defendant knew were frequented by members of The Avenue. While Rivera was driving on Enfield Street, he informed the defendant that he saw the victim standing on the sidewalk having a conversation with a woman. The defendant instructed Rivera to go around the block, and Rivera complied. As Rivera turned back onto Enfield Street, he lowered the back window and began to slow down. As the vehicle approached the victim and the woman, the defendant hung out the back window and began shooting at the victim. The victim attempted to run away but made it only three steps before he fell to the ground. The defendant continued to fire at the victim while he was on the ground. He fired at least ten to fifteen shots at the victim, who died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2008, the police recovered a .223 Kel-Tec assault rifle in an unrelated investigation. In 2011, Rivera gave a statement to the police in which he confessed to his involvement in the victim's murder and implicated the defendant. Rivera also identified the .223 Kel-Tec assault rifle that the police had recovered in 2008 as the weapon that the defendant used to shoot the victim. In 2014, the defendant was charged, in a long form information, with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a(a), conspiracy to commit murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a(a) and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48(a), and criminal use of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-216(a). A trial on these charges commenced in September, 2014, and ended in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. A second trial commenced in March, 2015, in which the defendant was charged only with one count of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a(a). The jury found the defendant guilty, and the court sentenced him to a total effective sentence of\n   sixty years of imprisonment. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant's first claim on appeal is that the court abused its discretion by denying his motion in limine in which he sought to exclude or limit the scope of the testimony of James Stephenson, the state's expert firearm and toolmark examiner. The defendant raises the following arguments in support of this claim: (1) recent studies have established that the methodology underlying firearm and toolmark identification is not sufficiently reliable; (2) the court improperly denied his request for a hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72601\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/57/\">\n    241 Conn. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20739\">\n    698 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11526881,11527011,11527046,11526795,11526930,11527155,11526835,11526966,11527099\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1058/\">\n    523 U.S. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20S.%20Ct.%201384\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20645\">\n    140 L.Ed. 2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), to determine the reliability of firearm and toolmark identification; (3) the court improperly allowed Stephenson to\n   opine that various cartridge casings recovered from the crime scene were fired from a particular firearm; and (4) the court improperly denied his motion to limit the scope of Stephenson's testimony.

Prior to Stephenson's testimony, the defendant filed a motion in limine in which he requested a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether the methodology underlying firearm and toolmark identification was reliable. In the alternative, the defendant sought to limit Stephenson's testimony so that he could not state his conclusions to a particular degree of certainty but, instead, would have been required to state that his conclusions were \"merely more likely than not ... correct.\" In support of his request for a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing, the defendant relied on multiple studies that called into question the scientific validity of firearm and toolmark identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant also relied upon\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Glynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863399\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/578/567/\">\n    578 F.Supp.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2008), to support his alternative argument that the scope of Stephenson's testimony should be limited to opining that his conclusions were \"more likely than not\" correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following argument on the motion, the court denied the defendant's motion in limine and request for a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing, relying on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Legnani\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057247\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/109/399/#p418\">\n    109 Conn.

The court reasoned that firearm and toolmark evidence is \"forensic science [that] has been well established, and we have a case, [\n   <em>\n    Legnani\n   </em>\n   ] ... which stands for the proposition that this is not a new science.

In fact, twelve of the fifteen cartridge casings recovered from the Enfield Street shooting were \"positively matched\" to the .223 Kel-Tec assault rifle that Rivera had identified as the firearm that the defendant used to shoot the victim. Although the three remaining cartridge casings were the same size and weight as a .223 caliber shell casing and\n   contained similar toolmarks, there was not sufficient detail for a positive identification to the particular firearm in evidence. The\n   examiner determined that the three remaining cartridge casings produced inconclusive results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Stephenson also testified regarding the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners (association) and its theory of identification. The association's theory of identification is generally accepted in the science of firearm and toolmark identification, and the Connecticut Forensic Science Laboratory follows the guidelines from this theory. Stephenson conceded, however, that recent studies and reports have critiqued the science of firearm and toolmark identification. Stephenson testified regarding the NAS Report and the Ballistic Imaging studies; see footnote 2 of this opinion; and explained that he viewed some, but not all, of the critiques in those studies as valid. Defense counsel also highlighted the ways in which firearm and toolmark identification does not follow precisely the scientific method-i.e., by not protecting against confirmation bias-and that the association's theory of identification is not a completely objective theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by denying his motion in limine and request for a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing. The defendant argues that the NAS Report and the Ballistic Imaging studies establish that the methodology underlying firearm and toolmark identification is not reliable, and as a result, the court should have precluded Stephenson from opining that particular cartridge casings positively matched the firearm in evidence. In the alternative, the defendant argues that the court should have limited Stephenson's testimony so that he could opine only that his conclusions were \"more likely than not ... correct.\" The state argues that the court properly relied upon\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Legnani\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057247\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/109/399/#p418\">\n    109 Conn.

Prior to the start of the second trial, the state filed a motion in which it sought to introduce uncharged misconduct evidence related to a shooting on Baltimore Street that had occurred eight months after the shooting of the victim. The state argued that the uncharged misconduct evidence was admissible to establish identity and means. The defendant opposed this motion, arguing that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative because the evidence showed only \"that this gun was used on a separate occasion potentially by [the defendant] to shoot at another person that he's not charged with [shooting] in this case .... It's the very sort of thing that yields the prejudice/probative ... calculus ... in the prohibition against propensity evidence .... [W]e think the state has everything it needs to prove the manner and means of the homicide as charged, [and] that to introduce another shooting, the gun charged in this case, is prejudicial, and in mar of the propensity of evidence rule.\" The court granted the state's motion for uncharged misconduct on the basis of its interpretation of the rules of evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and concluded that evidence of the Baltimore Street shooting fell within the identity and means exceptions of \u00a7 4-5(c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At trial, Deborah Parker, the target of the Baltimore Street shooting, testified that at approximately 2:30 a.m., on February 16, 2008, she and Daryl Spence returned to their residence on Baltimore Street in Hartford, where they resided with their two sons. As Parker and Spence prepared to exit their vehicle, Parker noticed two men walking in the street. As the men approached, one man fired a handgun in Parker's direction. The other man then\n   raised a rifle and began firing it in Parker's direction. Parker took cover underneath a vehicle and Spence ran away to hide elsewhere. Parker saw the faces of both shooters, which were made visible due to the streetlight. She also noticed that the man with the rifle was wearing white or light colored gloves. Neither Parker nor Spence was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Later that morning, Parker's sons were looking online through pictures of a concert that they had attended the night before. While Parker was passing by, she saw on the computer screen a photograph of two men, whom she recognized as the men who had shot at her just hours before. She identified the defendant as the man who had shot the rifle in her direction. Parker testified that she called the detective who was assigned to investigate the shooting to report the identity of the shooters. Because the detective never got back to her, however, she \"left the whole situation alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In August, 2011, Parker met with a cold case detective in Hartford to review photographs related to the Baltimore Street shooting. During this meeting, Parker identified the defendant's picture in a photographic array and circled it to indicate that he was involved in the shooting. In a separate photographic array, Parker identified the second shooter as an individual named Ezekiel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Stephenson testified regarding the cartridge casings that were recovered from the Baltimore Street shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There were twenty-two cartridge casings recovered, seventeen of which were positively matched to the .223 Kel-Tec assault rifle that Rivera identified as the firearm the defendant had used in the Enfield Street shooting. See part I of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the court's conclusion that the uncharged misconduct evidence was relevant to establish identity and means. Accordingly, the only question we must resolve with respect to this claim is whether the court abused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the uncharged misconduct evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. The defendant argues that the evidence is more prejudicial than probative because \"Parker's identification of the defendant was exceedingly unreliable,\" that the similarities between the charged and uncharged conduct render admission of the uncharged misconduct overly prejudicial, and that the uncharged misconduct evidence painted the defendant as a \"deranged gun-man.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[A]s a general rule, evidence of prior misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which the defendant is accused .... Such evidence cannot be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior .... On the other hand, evidence of crimes so connected with the principal crime by circumstance, motive, design, or innate peculiarity, that the commission of the collateral crime tends directly to prove the commission of the principal crime, is admissible. The rules of policy have no application whatever to evidence of any crime which directly tends to prove that the accused is guilty of the specific offense for which he is on trial .... We have developed a two part test to determine the admissibility of such evidence.

In addition, the court cited \"numerous other [decisions from] federal and state courts that have rejected challenges, founded on undue prejudice, to the use of uncharged misconduct evidence in cases wherein the charged offenses were committed using the same gun that the defendant had utilized in [the uncharged] prior shootings.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%201005\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, the severity of the charged conduct outweighed the severity of the uncharged conduct.

These limiting instructions provided, inter alia, that the uncharged misconduct evidence was being admitted \"solely to show or establish [the] identity of the person who committed the crimes alleged in this information, and the availability of the means to commit those crimes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the uncharged misconduct\n   evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Although the facts of the uncharged misconduct involved the defendant attempting to shoot Parker and Spence, they were much less severe than those of the charged conduct and, therefore, admission of the uncharged misconduct evidence cannot be said to have unduly aroused the jury's emotions. Nor can we say that admission of the uncharged misconduct evidence created a distracting side issue, as the evidence admitted linked the rifle and the perpetrator of the uncharged shooting to the murder at issue in this case. Additionally, the presentation of evidence related to the Baltimore Street shooting did not take up an inordinate amount of time, as the presentation of the uncharged misconduct evidence comprised at most one and one-half days of a six day trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the defendant was not unfairly surprised by the admission of this evidence, as it was admitted in the defendant's first trial and the state filed a pretrial motion for the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence.

As the defendant pointed out before the trial court and in his briefs to this court, recent studies and cases have questioned the scientific validity of firearm and toolmark identification. We are familiar with the findings and conclusions of the NAS Report and the Ballistic Imaging studies, which explain the limitations that exist in the science of firearm and toolmark identification; see footnote 2 of this opinion; as well as the holding of\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Glynn\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863399\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/578/567/\">\n     578 F.Supp.2d at 567\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which limited the scope of the testimony regarding firearm and toolmark identification in that case.
