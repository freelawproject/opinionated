Gadarowski (fact finder), and in rendering judgment in accordance with\n   his recommendations. More specifically, the defendant claims that the court improperly: (1) concluded that the plaintiff's cause of action sounds in contract, rather than indemnification, and, therefore, applied the incorrect statute of limitations; (2) concluded that the statute of frauds, General Statutes \u00a7 52-550, was inapplicable to this case; and (3) accepted the finding that the town of Glastonbury (town) had imposed real estate taxes on the easement area. We dismiss the defendant's original appeal and, with respect to his amended appeal, we disagree with each of the defendant's claims and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In his findings of fact and recommended award of damages, the fact finder set forth the following relevant background: \"A long trek would best describe the trip undertaken to develop a large shopping center in Glastonbury ... by the defendant. The center is to utilize approximately 13.5 acres of land. The process for the new center began in the 1980s when [the] defendant began to acquire properties and easements. In the 1990s a number of lawsuits concerning various issues related to the area to be developed were filed both in Connecticut and federal courts by [the] defendant. Finally, an agreement was reached in February, 1999, called the 'global settlement' by the parties. The actual settlement document was signed on February 5, 1999, by various parties but was not submitted as evidence at the hearing. Based upon other correspondence and the documents prepared, signed, and recorded, the settlement, in general, provided for a ground lease from [the] plaintiff to [the] defendant for a parcel of land in the\n   area to be developed; an easement ... from [the] plaintiff to [the] defendant that would allow access from ... Main [Street] over [the] plaintiff's property to [the] defendant's development;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   payment of $100,000 by [the]\n   defendant ... and the filing of withdrawals by [the] defendant of four ... state lawsuits, a federal district court action, and an appeal to the [United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit].\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties also drafted an escrow process letter, dated February 9, 1999, signed by the plaintiff's attorney and by the defendant, which listed all documents necessary to consummate the global settlement agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter indicated that the defendant would be submitting an application to the town's Plan and Zoning Commission (commission) for modification of an existing\n   application involving the plaintiff's tenant, Valvoline, and giving the commission information on the easement, and it provided that if this application was not approved by the commission at its February 16, 1999 meeting, then the entire global settlement agreement was null and void, and all documents, including the easement agreement, would be destroyed and would not be binding on any party. The letter further provided that if the commission approved the application at its February 16, 1999 meeting, then all of the documents would become \"immediately legally binding and effective upon the parties ... [and] the mortgage, easement agreement and subordination agreement\" would be recorded. The fact finder found that the defendant and his attorney reviewed all of the documents, including the easement.\n   Upon receiving the easement, the defendant submitted the modified application to the commission, and the commission approved the modified application at its February 16, 1999 meeting. Thereafter, the recordable documents were filed, funds were disbursed, and the settlement became final in accordance with the parties' agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Regarding the taxes due to the town for the land over which the defendant had obtained the easement from the plaintiff, the defendant, in a letter dated February 6, 2000, wrote to the plaintiff: \"I agree that Randazzo is not responsible for any of the taxes. Since Valvoline and I share the easement, we each should be responsible for [half] its assessment where the easement is in common. Since Valvoline gains no benefit, I would be happy to pay the portion in full. I would also pay for any assessment of the sign easement area.\" When the defendant failed to reimburse the plaintiff for the taxes paid, the plaintiff refused to provide requested documentation to the defendant in connection with some\n   financing he was seeking. The plaintiff demanded $4439.76 from the defendant to cover taxes for the grand list years of 1998-2001 assessed against the easement area. The defendant made the payment and sent a letter, dated May 3, 2001, to the plaintiff providing in relevant part: \"\n   <em>\n    I honestly believe that I have already paid all taxes that are my responsibility under the documents\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, this payment is made under protest and, inter alia, I reserve the right to contest the amount or validity of the imposition by appropriate proceedings .... I offered to assume the payment of taxes for the easement area solely in exchange for good relations between the parties. Given our history, I wish only to deal with the town in regard to property taxes.\" (Emphasis in original.) The town assessor at that time, Leon Jendrzejczyk, was asked by the plaintiff to calculate the taxes on the land underlying the easement separately, and he agreed to do so, showing his method of calculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff, thereafter, utilized this method of calculation and sent yearly billings to the defendant seeking reimbursement of the amount due for taxes each year for the easement area. The defendant, however, did not pay these amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2010, the plaintiff commenced this breach of contract action against the defendant. In her revised complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to comply with the parties' agreement that he would reimburse her for the real estate taxes assessed on that portion of the plaintiff's land encumbered by the easement. The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the grand list years 2002 through 2010. The court referred the case to the fact finder, who recommended that\n   judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $15,529.45 plus \"statutory interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with this recommendation, and the defendant appealed. The plaintiff\n   then filed a motion for clarification regarding the applicable rate of interest awarded and the date on which interest began to accrue. The trial court referred the motion to the fact finder, who clarified that the plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest under General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a at a rate of 10 percent per annum from the date each payment accrued to the date judgment was rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, thereafter, rendered judgment in accordance with this clarification, and the defendant amended his appeal to include the new judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional facts will be included as necessary.\n   On appeal, the defendant challenges the factual conclusions reached by the fact finder, as well as the legal conclusions reached by the trial court. Our standard of review, therefore, is as follows. \"Attorney fact finders are empowered to hear and decide issues of fact on contract actions pending in the Superior Court .... On appeal, [o]ur function ... is not to examine the record to see if the trier of fact could have reached a contrary conclusion.... Rather, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous.... This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court's decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Finally, we note that, because the attorney [fact finder] does not have the\n   powers of a court and is simply a fact finder, [a]ny legal conclusions reached by an attorney [fact finder] have no conclusive effect.... The reviewing court is the effective arbiter of the law and the legal opinions of [a fact finder], like those of the parties, though they may be helpful, carry no weight not justified by their soundness as viewed by the court\n   that renders judgment.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Walpole Woodworkers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733560\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/126/94/#p98\">\n    126 Conn.

With this standard of review in mind, we now consider the defendant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant claims that the court erred when it concluded that the plaintiff's cause of action sounds in contract, rather than indemnification, and that the court, therefore, applied the incorrect statute of limitations. The defendant argues that the court should have applied the three year statute of limitations set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-598a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   concerning actions for indemnification, rather than the six year statute of limitations set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-576 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   concerning actions on simple or implied contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The determination of which statute of limitations applies to a given action is a question of law over which our review is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaccaro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shell Beach Condo., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487873\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1123/#p29\">\n    169 Conn.

In his supplemental decision, the fact finder stated that \"it is clear that upon the facts, including that the plaintiff has not sought ... indemnification by either judgment or settlement ... \u00a7 52-598a would not apply to this situation. This, instead, is a claim under a contractual obligation and is governed by the six (6) year limit under the terms of ... \u00a7 52-576 (a).\" The defendant objected to this finding, and the trial court overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the defendant first contends that there is no enforceable contract between the parties. This claim is without merit. The fact finder specifically found that there was a global agreement between the parties that involved many documents, including the easement agreement. He further found that the defendant and his attorney reviewed these documents, including the easement agreement. Furthermore, the fact finder found that there was no evidence that the defendant\n   had disputed the wording of the easement, had sought the return of the $100,000 that he had paid for the easement, or ever offered to return the easement to the plaintiff. The fact finder also specifically credited the testimony of the defendant that the easement was of great value to him. The defendant challenges none of these findings on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Furthermore, the defendant does not contest the validity of the easement agreement. Rather, his claim, although not developed, appears to include the contention that because he did not sign the easement before it was recorded on the land records, he cannot be held to the terms of the global agreement on a contract theory. For over 100 years, however, the law has been to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Elting\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clinton Mills Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"782571\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/36/296/#p299\">\n    36 Conn. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299 (1869), the plaintiff's predecessor in title, Amasa L.

In this case, the defendant, by accepting the easement, became contractually bound by its terms, including the payment of taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Alternatively, the defendant argues that, even if there is an enforceable contract, \"the language in the agreement demonstrates that it is an indemnification.\" Accordingly, he argues, \"the Superior Court ought to have found that the statute of limitations applicable is three (3) year[s] as [the parties'] contract language states that it is an indemnification agreement.\" The plaintiff argues that \"the plaintiff is not seeking indemnification for losses it has incurred pursuant to either a judgment or settlement in a third party action. Rather,\n   the plaintiff is seeking its right to indemnification or reimbursement in accordance with its easement agreement with the defendant. Thus ... \u00a7 52-576 (a) is the correct statute of limitations ....\" We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our Supreme Court addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Amoco Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Auto &amp; Electric Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653087\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/142/\">\n    262 Conn. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=810%20A.2d%20259\">\n    810 A.2d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).

The fact finder found\n   that the plaintiff sent the defendant yearly bills for the amount of taxes related to the easement portion of her property, but he refused to pay. The reimbursement sought by the plaintiff in this case is not for damages for which the plaintiff was found liable to a third party; rather, this reimbursement is for money that the plaintiff and the defendant agreed would be an ongoing obligation of the defendant as set forth in the easement deed itself. The plaintiff is not seeking indemnity from the defendant for a third party tort action for which the plaintiff owed damages as a result of a judgment or a settlement. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-598a. The plaintiff is seeking to enforce an ongoing financial obligation for which the defendant had contracted when he accepted the deeded easement.

The defendant contends, in relevant part, that because he did not sign the easement, it does not comply with the statute of frauds, and, therefore, the provision in the easement requiring him to pay the taxes is not binding on him. He also argues that there was no evidence of part performance that would support a finding that he agreed to the payment of taxes, and that there is nothing to support an application of equitable estoppel. The plaintiff argues that, \"in light of the settlement agreement [that the defendant] signed, in which he acknowledged the easement would be binding on him, his argument is without merit.\" The plaintiff\n   further argues that \"it is settled law that if a grantee accepts a deed of conveyance, he is bound by its covenants even though the grantee did not sign the document.\" Furthermore, the plaintiff argues, \"equitable estoppel removed the easement agreement from the operation of the statute of frauds.\" We conclude that a grantee is bound by the provisions in a deed of conveyance once he\n   accepts the conveyance. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly determined that the statute of frauds did not bar the plaintiff's cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Whether the statute of frauds applies in any given case involves an issue of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law, and therefore appellate review of the issue is plenary.

A contract of this character is obviously not within the object of the statute. That statute was intended to do away with the temptation to commit fraud and perjury in attempting to make one party answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another. In cases of this character no such temptation can by possibility exist, for the case is as much beyond the reach of fraud as it would be if the contract was formally executed by the defendant. Furthermore, all the cases hold that the contract stated in a deed poll is binding between the parties. The statute of frauds makes void all contracts within its provisions; hence, contracts stated in deed polls cannot be within the statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747194\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/42/244/#p250\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 254 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Elting\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clinton Mills Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"782571\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/36/296/#p299\">\n    36 Conn. at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding it was \"unquestionable\" that there had been valid and binding contract between defendants and grantor because defendants had accepted deeded easement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the present case, the defendant reviewed the easement, rendered payment for the easement, and signed an escrow process letter that provided that the easement would be binding on the parties if the commission approved the revised application, which the defendant himself submitted; the defendant does not question that\n   the commission approved the revised application.

Any tax imposed upon the easement area arises out of Valvoline's [the other user of the easement] use of the easement area for its driveways and [the] plaintiff's remaining property rights in the servient estate. The defendant has already [borne] his burden for taxes by paying the increased assessment of the lands ... serviced by the easement. To allocate additional tax burden on [the] defendant for lands in the easement area would result in double taxation.... That is why long held Connecticut law holds easements are not taxable.\" The defendant also argues that the fact finder \"has ignored the fact that the easement area is shared by other tenant(s) of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff reserved the easement area for future use to [herself] not inconsistent with the grant of the easement.\" We conclude that the defendant's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts ....

The defendant relies principally on\n   <em>\n    Breezy Knoll Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960413\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/766/\">\n    286 Conn. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%20215\">\n    946 A.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), and General Statutes \u00a7 12-64 (a) for the proposition that \"[a]s easements are incapable of existence separate and apart from the particular land, they are not assessed separately for the real estate taxation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree that easements generally cannot be assessed and taxed separately; this case, however, does not involve a tax imposed by a town on an easement. The issue in this case is whether the defendant has breached his agreement with the plaintiff by failing to reimburse the plaintiff for a portion of the property tax on the plaintiff's property. We are aware of nothing in the law that prohibits the dominant and servient owners of an easement from entering into a contract setting forth responsibility for the property taxes on the land upon which the easement lies, and the defendant has not provided a citation to any authority that would support such a prohibition. The fact finder resolved the parties' dispute over this issue by finding that the town had taxed the plaintiff's property and had not separately taxed the easement. Consequently, the defendant, pursuant to the parties' agreement, was obligated to reimburse\n   the plaintiff for the taxes on the land under the easement. This finding was supported by ample evidence.\n   In particular, the testimony of Nicole Lintereur, the town assessor, provided a sufficient factual basis for the fact finder to conclude that the town did not value and tax the easement separately from the remainder of the plaintiff's land. There also was considerable testimony from Lintereur that supports the finding that the town assessed taxes on\n   <em>\n    the plaintiff's property\n   </em>\n   , upon a portion of which the defendant holds an easement. Specifically, Lintereur testified that the plaintiff's property was .79 acres, and that the town billed the plaintiff directly for taxes on that property. She testified that the easement runs through the .79 acres of land, and it measures .32 acres in size. When asked whether that .32 acres of land is assessed by the town\n   <em>\n    to the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   , Lintereur affirmed that it is assessed to the plaintiff. When specifically asked if the town ever assessed the defendant for taxes on the easement area, Lintereur said no. Lintereur also responded affirmatively when asked whether the plaintiff is \"assessed for the .79 acres, which includes the easement area ....\" Additionally, when asked, \"[w]hen an easement is recorded on the land records, how do you deal with that from an assessment standpoint; do you tax the easement?\" Lintereur responded, \"[n]o .... It's not its own separate parcel.\" Accordingly, the finding that the town imposed taxes on the plaintiff's property, including the portion over which the defendant held an easement, and did not separately tax the defendant for the easement, is supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We find similarly unpersuasive the defendant's argument that he was taxed directly by the town for the increase in value of his property by virtue of having the easement, and, therefore, any payment to the plaintiff for her taxes for that area amounts to double taxation. The facts of this case demonstrate that the defendant contracted to reimburse the plaintiff for the taxes assessed on the portion of the plaintiff's property over\n   which the defendant held the easement. This was a voluntary agreement that the defendant made with the plaintiff and was not a tax assessed to the defendant by the town. Accordingly, it does not amount to double taxation but, rather, is part of a contractual agreement between two private parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As to the defendant's claim that Valvoline should share in the tax reimbursement to the plaintiff for the easement area because it also makes use of the easement, we are not persuaded. The defendant voluntarily assumed the responsibility to reimburse the plaintiff for the taxes assessed. He agreed to be bound by the provisions in the easement, one of which included the obligation to reimburse the plaintiff for the taxes paid on that portion of her property. There is nothing in the agreement that imposes an obligation on Valvoline. Accordingly, the contention that Valvoline should be held responsible for a portion of the burden that the defendant voluntarily assumed is without merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendant's original appeal is dismissed; the judgment is affirmed with respect to the defendant's amended appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The complaint in this matter very clearly sets forth that this case is brought by Mary Randazzo in her capacity as trustee for A &amp; F Foods. The summons, however, erroneously lists the plaintiff only as Mary Randazzo. The case caption in the Superior Court followed the summons. Because there is no question that Randazzo is acting only in her capacity as trustee, we conclude that this merely is a scrivener's error.
