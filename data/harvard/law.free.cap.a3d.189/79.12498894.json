The commission had denied the plaintiff's motion to dismiss an employment discrimination complaint brought by a former female employee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   who claims that the plaintiff unlawfully terminated her employment on the basis of her sex, marital status and pregnancy, in violation of state and federal employment discrimination laws. The plaintiff appealed from that decision to the Superior Court, claiming that court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's interlocutory appeal because General Statutes \u00a7 52-571b (d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which bars the state from burdening any religious\n   belief, immunizes religious institutions, such as the plaintiff, from employment discrimination actions, and, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to appeal from that decision under the immunity exception to the general prohibition against such interlocutory appeals. The trial court disagreed, concluding that \u00a7 52-571b (d) is not an immunity provision, and, as a consequence, the commission's denial of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss is not an immediately appealable order. The trial court therefore granted the commission's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's administrative appeal. On appeal to this court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff raises the\n   same jurisdictional claim that it asserted in the trial court. We agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the trial court, and, therefore, we affirm its judgment dismissing the plaintiff's appeal.\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff is a religious school located in the town of Windsor. On April 19, 2011, a former female employee filed a complaint with the commission, alleging that the plaintiff had terminated her employment on the basis of her sex, marital status and pregnancy, in violation of the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-60 (a) (1) and (7), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. (2012). The plaintiff subsequently moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was immune from employment discrimination actions under the ministerial exception to employment discrimination laws, which is grounded in the first amendment to the United States constitution and \"requires secular institutions to defer to the decisions of religious institutions in their employment relations with their religious employees\" because \"administrative and judicial intervention in religious employment relationships would violate the constitutional prohibition against civil entanglement in ecclesiastic disputes.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dayner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Archdiocese of Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776243\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/759/#p777\">\n    301 Conn. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%201192\">\n    23 A.3d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The commission denied the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the complaint, and the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court.

The trial court agreed that\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   was controlling of the plaintiff's appeal and granted the commission's motion to dismiss for lack of a final judgment.\n   Upon returning to the commission, the plaintiff filed a second motion to dismiss, this time asserting that religious institutions are immune from employment discrimination complaints under \u00a7 52-571b (d) and that, as a consequence, the commission lacked jurisdiction over the former employee's complaint. The commission disagreed and denied the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the complaint, and the plaintiff again appealed to the Superior Court. The commission once again moved to dismiss the plaintiff's appeal, claiming that \u00a7 52-571b (d) is not an immunity statute and, therefore, that the commission's denial of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the employment discrimination complaint was not an immediately appealable interlocutory order under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court agreed with the commission and granted its motion to dismiss the plaintiff's appeal.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   reasoned, rather, that \"the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of [United States Supreme Court] precedents,\n   is to hold the [compelling governmental interest] test inapplicable to such challenges.... To make an individual's obligation to obey ... a law contingent [on] the law's coincidence with his religious beliefs, except [when] the [s]tate's interest is compelling-permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, to become a law unto himself ... contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/\">\n    Id., at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court further explained that, following\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the legislature enacted \u00a7 52-571b to ensure greater protection for\n   the free exercise of religion under state law than is provided under the federal constitution in the aftermath of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   . To that end, the court explained that \"subsections (a) and (b) [of \u00a7 52-571b provide] that, even in the case of a rule of general applicability, the compelling state interest test applies before the state can burden the exercise of religion. Subsection (c) essentially provides that, unless the state can meet the compelling state interest test, a person may assert a violation of his or her exercise of religion in a 'claim or defense' against the state.\" The trial court further explained, however, that subsection (d) of \u00a7 52-571b, which provides that \"[n]othing in this section shall be construed to authorize the state or any political subdivision of the state to burden any religious belief,\" was merely intended to clarify that the compelling governmental interest test applied to governmental burdens on the free exercise of religion was not intended to apply to governmental burdens on religious beliefs such that, \"in theory, even a compelling state interest such as the prevention of discrimination in employment cannot overcome [a religious institution's] reliance on the ministerial exception [as an affirmative defense to an employment discrimination action brought by one of its ministers or clergy].\"\n   The trial court therefore concluded that \u00a7 52-571b (d), as evidenced by its plain and unambiguous terms, operates as a rule of construction rather than a grant of immunity-the effect of which was to retain \"the ministerial exception [as] an affirmative defense, as provided by\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   , but one ... not subject to offset by a compelling governmental interest.\" In reaching its conclusion, the trial court emphasized that statutes purporting to confer immunity from suit must be strictly construed. In this regard, the court observed that there was nothing in the language of subsection (d) that reasonably could be construed as conferring immunity on the plaintiff. On the contrary, the court explained, \"[t]he language of [subsection] (d) stands in stark contrast to the [language of] many other statutes in the same title ... that do confer statutory immunity. This language usually takes the form of 'shall not be liable,' 'no action may be brought,' or 'shall be immune from civil liability.' \" Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to make a colorable claim of immunity under \u00a7 52-571b (d), and, as a result, the commission's denial of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the employment discrimination complaint was not an immediately appealable order. On appeal to this court from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its appeal, the plaintiff renews its claim that \u00a7 52-571b (d) confers on religious institutions immunity from employment discrimination actions. We reject the plaintiff's claim for the reasons set forth by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"As a threshold matter, we address our standard of review.

Most significantly, there is simply nothing in the language of \u00a7 52-571b (d) to indicate that it serves as a grant of immunity from suit. Indeed, as the trial court observed, the language of subsection (d) is typical of internal rules of construction appearing throughout the General Statutes and title 52. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-146t (j) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-190b ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-225d (g) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-225\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (e) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-292 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-557q.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That subsection (d) was intended to operate as a rule of construction rather than a grant of immunity is further evidenced by the dissimilarity between its language and the language of statutes that do confer immunity. As the trial court\n   observed, a cursory review of title 52 makes clear that when the legislature intends to confer immunity from liability or from suit, it does so in distinctive and unmistakable terms, such as \"shall not be liable,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"no action may be brought,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"shall be\n   immune from civil liability,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   or by using other similar language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under well established rules of statutory construction, we must assume that, if the legislature had intended to confer immunity under \u00a7 52-571b (d), it would have done so in the same explicit manner that it has granted immunity in other statutes.

In that case, the Appellate Court rejected a claim by a Roman Catholic priest that \u00a7 52-571b was intended to overrule the ministerial exception and subject the employment decisions of religious institutions\n   to the compelling governmental interest test.

The issue before the Appellate Court in\n   <em>\n    Rweyemamu\n   </em>\n   , rather, was whether such claims are subject to the compelling governmental interest test set forth in subsection (b) of the statute. See id., at 665,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%20319\">\n    911 A.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In concluding that they are not, the Appellate Court noted that the legislative history made clear that the purpose underlying the statute was to reverse the effects of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   by restoring the strict scrutiny test for governmental burdens on religious practices.

The court further noted, however, that, \"[i]n protecting the religious practices of individuals, the legislature made the distinction between the 'exercise of religion,' which it protected with the strict scrutiny test found in [subsection] ... (b) of \u00a7 52-571b, and 'religious beliefs,' which [it] prevented from being burdened by subsection (d).\" Id., at 662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%20319\">\n    911 A.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then explained that, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 52-571b, federal law had long treated governmental burdens on religious practices and religious beliefs differently, applying strict scrutiny to the former while completely forbidding the latter. See id., at 663-64,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%20319\">\n    911 A.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also explained that, prior to the enactment of the statute, the United States Supreme Court had consistently treated the employment decisions of religious institutions as a form of religious belief. See id., at 662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%20319\">\n    911 A.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court concluded that, because the legislature is assumed to know the status of the law when it enacts legislation, the legislature clearly had intended, by exempting religious beliefs from the purview of \u00a7 52-571b, to maintain the legal distinction between religious practices and religious beliefs that always had existed and continued to\n   exist after the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   . See id., at 664,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%20319\">\n    911 A.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   The plaintiff argues, however, that, because \u00a7 52-571b provides greater protection for religious beliefs than for religious practices, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the legislature intended for \u00a7 52-571b (d) to operate as a jurisdictional bar to employment discrimination actions. This is so, the plaintiff maintains, because only a jurisdictional bar could provide more protection than strict scrutiny review. As we have explained, however, the text of the statute belies the intention that the plaintiff would have us attribute to the legislature, a conclusion that is reinforced by the language of the numerous statutes that do confer immunity. Nor is there any indication in the legislative history that the legislature contemplated that \u00a7 52-571b (d) would operate as a jurisdictional bar. As the Appellate Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Rweyemamu\n   </em>\n   , although the legislative history reveals \"that the legislature was, in general, mindful of the impact that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   might have had on employment discrimination laws,\" its primary focus \"[was on] protecting individual religious practices through [the application of] the strict scrutiny test.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 661-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%20319\">\n    911 A.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We note, moreover, that it was not until more than fifteen years after the passage of the statute that this court, in\n   <em>\n    Dayner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Archdiocese of Hartford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776243\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/759/#p777\">\n    301 Conn. at 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%201192\">\n    23 A.3d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , recognized the ministerial exception as a jurisdictional bar to employment discrimination actions. As we previously noted, however; see\n   footnote 4 of this opinion; that decision was short-lived in light of\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   , which followed soon thereafter. Thus, to the extent the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 52-571b was intended to codify the ministerial exception, even if this were true, there is still no reason to conclude that the legislature intended the exception to operate as a jurisdictional bar rather than as an affirmative defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The employee was also named as a defendant in the plaintiff's administrative appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 52-571b, which is modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb through 2000bb-4 (2012), provides: \"(a) The state or any political subdivision of the state shall not burden a person's exercise of religion under section 3 of article first of the Constitution of the state even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \"(b) The state or any political subdivision of the state may burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest, and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \"(c) A person whose exercise of religion has been burdened in violation of the provisions of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against the state or any political subdivision of the state.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \"(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the state or any political subdivision of the state to burden any religious belief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \"(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect, interpret or in any way address that portion of article seventh of the Constitution of the state that prohibits any law giving a preference to any religious society or denomination in the state.

All we're talking about here is that in fact when the [s]tate tries to limit activities, such as candles in a church, receiving wine at Holy Communion, wearing a yarmulke in court, in order to restrict that activity, which is otherwise religiously allowed ... there must be a compelling [s]tate reason in order to do it.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The commission claims that we lack appellate jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's appeal from the trial court's judgment for the same reason that the trial court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal: the commission's order was interlocutory and not final for purposes of appeal. The commission, however, confuses the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, which, in the present case, is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, with the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court, which is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 4-184. The trial court's dismissal of the plaintiff's administrative appeal was not interlocutory, whereas the commission's ruling declining to dismiss the complaint was interlocutory. Thus, the trial court's dismissal was final and therefore appealable.
