The case arose when plaintiff Denni Slack fell approximately ten feet while spaclding sheetrock on the cathedral ceiling of a house defendants Thomas and Margaret Whelan were building. The appeal requires us to decide whether a property owner who assumes administrative control over a home construction project owes a duty to an employee of one of the individual contractors hired to complete the project to assure his safety by complying with regulations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> promulgated under the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act, 29 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 651 to 678 (OSHA). Plaintiff contends that defendants owed a legal duty to assure him a safe worksite, and that the violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>OSHA regulations affords him a tort remedy. The motion judge disagreed and granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs personal injury negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We conclude the judge properly granted defendants\u2019 summary judgment dismissing the complaint, <em>see Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), and affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The pertinent facts are not complicated or contested. Defendants owned a small, undeveloped lot in Warren County and contracted with Trident Builders, Inc. (Trident) to act as their \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d in building a house on the lot. Trident agreed to build the house for $80,000, which included labor and materials, but not landscaping or a septic system. When Trident failed to perform, defendants, who had no training or experience in home construction, took over the project. Using the plans prepared by an architect, they obtained the building permits and financing required for the construction; hired and paid the various contractors to build the house; and assumed the numerous administrative responsibilities required to coordinate the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">On October 10,1997, plaintiff arrived at the house to spackle the sheetrock that another Quality employee had just installed. He was part of a two-man spackling team. Plaintiff had been working for Quality for approximately one year before the accident. According to plaintiffs deposition testimony, he had been spackling for about an hour, using the ladders and scaffolding provided by Quality for the work, when he realized he could not reach the uppermost part of the cathedral ceiling. Consequently, he \u201cclimbed into the rafters\u201d and, using a board that had been placed there by another Quality employee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> began to spackle the ceiling. After about forty-five minutes of working in the rafters, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>heard the board beneath him break, and he fell approximately ten feet to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Although his \u201cboss\u201d was on the construction site from the beginning of the work day, plaintiff apparently did not ask him what to do when the scaffolding proved inadequate to reach the highest point of the cathedral ceiling. Defendants were not present at the time of the accident and did not learn of it until a few weeks'later.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Defendants did not have a contractual arrangement with Quality or any other contractor requiring defendants to oversee either the performance of their work, or OSHA compliance, and defendants did not provide such oversight or in any way supervise the actual work of the individual contractors they hired. With the exception of Mr. Whalen, who did the plumbing work and installed the septic system at the house, defendants did not participate in the construction. In addition, defendants were not present at the construction site during the workday. At night, however, their son Patrick, who had no experience in home construction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> went to the house to inspect the daily progress of the work. Mrs. Whalen, and her fifteen year old son Vincent, also attended the site at night to \u201cclean up\u201d any debris left by the contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">As to the spackling work performed by plaintiff, defendants provided no equipment or assistance of any kind to plaintiff and, in fact, were not even present during the spackling of the ceiling. Indeed, they were completely unaware of the fact that Quality had placed a board in the rafters or that plaintiff was using it as a platform from which to spackle the ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, as previously noted, the motion judge granted defendants summary judgment. The judge essentially concluded that defendants owed no duty to protect plaintiff from the risk of harm presented by his climbing into the rafters and using the board left there by another Quality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>employee to finish the spaekling of the ceiling. The judge also impliedly concluded that even if such a duty existed, there were no facts in the record to support the claim that defendants had breached that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Determining the scope of tort liability is the responsibility of the courts, and \u201c[t]he actual imposition of a duty of care and the formulation of standards defining such a duty derive from considerations of public policy and fairness.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 439, 625 A.2d 1110 (1993). In <em>Hopkins, </em>the Court reminded us that it \u201chas carefully refrained from treating questions of duty in a conclusory fashion, recognizing that \u2018[wjhether a duty exists is ultimately a question of fairness.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). Recently, in <em>Alloway v. Bradlees, Inc., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>221, 230, 723 A.2d 960 (1999), a construction site accident case, the Court repeated that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In <em>Alloway, </em>the Court explained that general negligence principles govern the determination of whether a legal duty should be imposed on a contractor for injuries sustained by another contractor\u2019s employee. <em>Ibid. </em>In reaching that conclusion, it recited several factors, relying on <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>stating that although \u201cthe foreseeability of the risk of injury\u201d is the major consideration for imposing a tort duty, additional factors should be considered, such as \u201c \u2018the relationship of the parties, the nature of the attendant risk, the opportunity and ability to exercise care, and the public interest in the proposed solution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alloway, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 723 A.2d 960 (quoting <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 439, 625 A.2d 1110). Before a duty will be imposed, the Court indicated that these factors must be identified, weighed and balanced. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court further indicated that \u201cthe analysis leading to the imposition of a duty of reasonable care is \u2018both fact specific and principled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 439, 625 A.2d 1110).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In <em>Alloway, </em>the Court imposed a duty on a subcontractor for injuries sustained by an employee of a different subcontractor. In doing so, the Court re-emphasized the principle that the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to impose a duty of care is ultimately one of fairness and policy. <em>Alloway, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 723 A.2d 960; <em>see also Carvalho v. Toll Bros. &amp; Developers, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>565, 573, 675 A.2d 209 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">These were the facts of <em>Alloway </em>that persuaded the Court to conclude it was fair to impose a duty. A paving contractor was contractually responsible for constructing a special exterior ramp for loading purposes on a construction site for a new Shop Rite Supermarket. The paving contractor had engaged an excavating contractor to deliver paving materials using the excavating contractor\u2019s truck and driver. The principal of the excavating contractor, who was also a foreman for the paving contractor, undertook to supervise the paving crews because he had direct knowledge of the work requirements. <em>Alloway, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 226, 233, 723 A.2d 960. The plaintiff was the truck driver for the excavating contractor. The day before the plaintiff was to deliver crushed stone to the site, she noticed a mechanical problem with the dump truck she was operating. <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 723 A.2d 960. After relaying the problem to both her supervisor and the paving contractor foreman, the foreman notified her that a defect had been found and would be repaired by the next day. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 723 A.2d 960. Plaintiff was unaware that the defect had not been repaired, and as a result, she was seriously injured while attempting to use the truck. <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 723 A.2d 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Based on the foregoing facts, the Court determined that the risk of injury was \u201cclearly foreseeable\u201d because the paving contractor \u201cknew that the truck was defective, and had attempted to correct the defect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 723 A.2d 960. The Court also noted the \u201csubstantial and close relationship\u201d between the paving contractor and the excavating contractor. <em>Ibid. </em>That relationship, the Court observed, \u201ccreated both the opportunity and capacity\u201d on the part of the paving contractor \u201cto exercise authority and control over the equipment\u201d of the excavating contractor if safety concerns were implicated. <em>Id. </em>at 233, 723 A.2d 960. Since the paving contractor had actually \u201cundertaken remedial measures\u201d to correct the defect in the truck prior to the accident, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>concluded that \u201cfairness and policy\u201d impelled the imposition of a duty of reasonable care on the paving contractor to assure the safety of the excavation contractor\u2019s employee at the worksite. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">A similar result was obtained in <em>Carvalho, supra, </em>another construction site accident case. There, the Township of West Windsor retained an engineering firm (the engineer) to prepare plans for and supervise the progress of a sewer service construction project. During the construction, a trench in which an excavation subcontractor\u2019s employee was working collapsed and the employee was killed. <em>Carvalho, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 569, 675 A.2d 209. The employee\u2019s widow sued the engineer, among others, alleging that the engineer had breached its duty to maintain safe conditions at the worksite. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 675 A.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Applying general negligence principles, the <em>Carvalho </em>Court concluded that the engineer owed plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid the risk of harm that resulted in the worker\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 675 A.2d 209. The Court recognized and discussed the factors previously noted, observing that the engineer was contractually required to be at the site everyday to monitor the progress of the work. <em>Id. </em>at 577-78, 675 A.2d 209. In addition, the Court pointed out that the contract between the township and the general contractor for the project gave the engineer the authority to stop the work at any time, <em>id. </em>at 576, 675 A.2d 209, remarking that the engineer\u2019s supervisory responsibility \u201cnecessarily entailed the observation of existing conditions and the actual performance of the work undertaken by the workers at the site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 675 A.2d 209. The Court further adverted to the fact that the engineer was aware that similar trenches had collapsed in other areas of the construction site several times due to unstable trench conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 675 A.2d 209. The Court determined that the engineer\u2019s responsibilities for ensuring compliance with the plans and rate of work progress created an \u201coverlap of work-progress considerations and work-safety con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>cerns\u201d justifying imposition of a duty of care to prevent the risk of harm. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 675 A.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The present case presents a very different factual scenario. Defendants had no contractual agreement with Quality, or any other contractor on the project, to supervise the work or provide safety oversight. Further, defendants were not present during the actual work day, nor were they required to be on site. Neither did defendants participate in, nor interfere with, the means or method of the spackling work being performed by plaintiff. For instance, the scaffolding equipment was furnished by Quality, and not defendants. In addition, defendants were completely unaware of the methods plaintiff was utilizing to spackle the ceiling, and knew nothing of the risk of harm plaintiff himself created by climbing into the rafters and standing on the board. Indeed, defendants were unaware that Quality had left the wooden boards in the ceiling rafters. Hence, the risk of harm was not sufficiently foreseeable to justify imposing a duty of reasonable care on defendants. <em>Carvalho, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 573, 675 A.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Unlike <em>Carvalho, </em>defendants had no opportunity or capacity to exercise control over the manner or means by which plaintiff chose to perform the spackling work. To the contrary, the control of plaintiffs work fell squarely within Quality\u2019s expertise, knowledge, and experience as a professional dry wall company. On these facts, defendants could reasonably assume that Quality was sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable to assure plaintiffs safety in performing the spackling work.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Given the nature of the risk, the lack of foreseeability of that risk, and the relationship between plaintiff and defendants, which in no way implicated worker-safety concerns or suggested that defendants had the capacity to control plaintiffs performance, we conclude, as a matter of \u201cfairness and policy,\u201d that defendants had no legal duty to exercise reasonable care for plaintiffs safety at the worksite.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Plaintiffs reliance on our holding in <em>Meder v. Resorts Intern. Hotel, Inc., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>470, 475-76, 573 A.2d 922 (App.Div. 1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>608, 583 A.2d 310 (1990), is unavailing. There, we held that violations of OSHA regulations by a property owner who has assumed the responsibilities of a general contractor can support a tort claim against the property owner regardless of whether the property owner had assumed control over the direction of the manner in which the delegated tasks were carried out. <em>Id. </em>at 477, 573 A.2d 922. However, this court decided <em>Meder </em>before the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Alloway. </em>A careful reading of <em>Alloway </em>makes it clear that the Court rejected Meder\u2019s attempt to impose a duty of care on an owner/contractor based solely on a finding that OSHA regulations had been violated. Quoting our decision in <em>Kane v. Hartz Mountain Indus., Inc., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 143, 650 A.2d 808 (App.Div.1994), aff<em>'d o.b., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>141, 669 A.2d 816 (1996), the Court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">[T]he paramount consideration of a worker\u2019s safety is more clearly placed in focus by a more comprehensive rule which makes the primary contractor and each tier of subcontractor responsible for the safety of the workers under them on general negligence principles. This appears preferable to limiting liability to a specific finding of a violation of a regulation, which in some instances may be obscure, vague or difficult to comprehend or apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\"><em>[Alloway, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 235, 723 A.2d 960.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The Court further observed that \u201cin the area of workplace safety, the common law provides ample remedial relief that is flexible and adaptive of changing circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 723 A.2d 960. Accordingly, the Court concluded that although \u201cOSHA regulations are pertinent in determining the nature and extent of any duty of care,\u201d their violation \u201cwithout more does not constitute the basis for an independent or direct tort remedy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Stated another way, such violation, in and of itself, does not create a tort duty. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Since plaintiff failed to present proof to satisfy any of the factors required by <em>Alloway </em>for determining the existence of a duty, the mere fact that OSHA regulations may have been violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>at the worksite is not sufficient to create a legal duty on defendants to have avoided the risk of injury to plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In sum, applying general negligence principles, we hold that no tort duty can be imposed for injuries sustained on a construction site by a contractor\u2019s employee solely because violations of OSHA regulations have occurred. Even if defendants could be viewed as \u201cgeneral contractors\u201d for the project, because the risk of injury to plaintiff was not objectively foreseeable by defendants, and because no relationship implicating safety concerns existed between plaintiff and defendants, \u201cfairness and policy\u201d preclude imposing a tort duty on defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Lastly, and for essentially the same reasons, we reject plaintiffs contention that defendants had a legal duty to retain an experienced \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d who would have been responsible for safety oversight on the project. Even if defendants had replaced Trident with another \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d to coordinate the construction project, such hiring would not automatically give rise to a tort duty on the part of that contractor to safeguard plaintiff from the risk of harm present in this case. As we stated previously, that determination would require a \u201cfact specific and principled\u201d analysis of all the <em>Alloway </em>factors, applying general negligence principles. <em>Alloway, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 723 A.2d 960. We repeat what we recently observed in <em>Costantino v. Ventriglia, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 446, 735 A.2d 1180 (App.Div.1999): categories and labels do not create legal duties; they arise only as the result of fairness and policy. <em>See also Hopkins, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 625 A.2d 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\"> The appendix does not contain a copy of any specific OSHA regulations; however, plaintiff\u2019s brief lists numerous regulations which he alleges defendants violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> At oral argument on the summary judgment motion, plaintiffs attorney represented that \u201cWe don\u2019t have the board but I believe it to be Quality Dry Wall\u2019s, but I can't say for certain.\u201d Plaintiff's attorney later affirmatively represented that the board was placed on the rafters by one of Quality's workers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> Patrick had been engaged in farm-based excavation projects but had no home construction experience.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
