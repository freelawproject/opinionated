Plaintiffs most serious injury was carpal tunnel syndrome in her right wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Plaintiff subsequently brought this personal injury action against various parties including Monarch. The other parties were dismissed, and the case went to trial solely against Monarch. A jury found both parties negligent, attributing thirty percent fault to plaintiff, and awarded plaintiff $50,000 for her injuries. The court molded the jury verdict and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff for $35,000 plus prejudgment interest. The trial court denied plaintiffs motion for a new trial on damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On appeal, plaintiff does not challenge the jury\u2019s liability verdict. Plaintiffs only arguments are that the trial court erred by instructing the jury with respect to her duty to mitigate damages by undergoing surgical treatment and that the jury\u2019s damages verdict was against the weight of the credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The obligation of the plaintiff in a personal injury action to obtain surgical treatment to minimize his or her damages is governed by well-established principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">[A| person injured by another\u2019s wrong is obliged to exercise ordinary care to seek medical or surgical treatment so as to effect a cure and minimize damages. Failure or refusal to do so bars recovery for consequences which could have been averted by the exercise of such care. However, in this state the injured person is regarded as having the right to avoid \u201cif he chooses, peril to life, however slight, and undue risks to health, and anguish that goes beyond the bounds of reason.\u201d And a refusal to accept an operation is not unreasonable and \u201ctherefore unjustifiable in the legal sense, unless it is free from danger to life and health and extraordinary suffering, and, according to the best medical or surgical opinion, offers a reasonable prospect of restoration or relief from the disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\"><em>[Budden v. Goldstein, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 350, 128 A.2d 730 (App.Div.1957) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Robinson v. Jackson, </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>476, 478, 184 A. 811 (E. &amp; A.1936)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-10\"><em>Accord Cannon v. New Jersey Bell Tel., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 313, 530 A.2d 345 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>54, 532 A.2d 1119 (1987); <em>see also Lorenc v.

Shipley, Annotation, <em>Duty of Injured Person to Submit to Surgery to Minimize Tort Damages, </em>62 A.L.R.3d 9, 17 (1975); Fowler V. Harper, et al., <em>The Law of Torts, </em>(2d ed.1986) \u00a7 25.4 at 515-16; <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 918(1) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>There was no evidence presented at trial that the surgical procedure for carpal tunnel syndrome would involve an \u201cundue risk[ ] to health\u201d or even a slight \u201cperil to life.\u201d There also was no evidence that the surgery would involve \u201cextraordinary suffering.\u201d Consequently, the only question is whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the surgery would offer \u201ca reasonable prospect of restoration or relief from the disability.\u201d <em>Budden, supra, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 350, 128 A.2d 730. If such a finding could be made, defendant was entitled to a jury instruction concerning plaintiffs duty to mitigate damages by undergoing surgical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Plaintiffs own medical expert, Dr. Richard P. Caponetti, testified that he had performed numerous surgical procedures to relieve carpal tunnel syndrome and that this surgery has \u201ca good track record.\u201d Dr. Caponetti also testified that plaintiffs treating physician had recommended that she have surgery, and that he agreed \u201c[plaintiff] was in need of surgery for a carpal tunnel.\u201d This testimony would have supported a jury finding that a person in plaintiffs position exercising ordinary and reasonable care for her own health and comfort would have agreed to undergo the surgical procedure for carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Plaintiff relies upon Dr. Caponetti\u2019s further testimony that the surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome does not have a \u201cguaranteed\u201d successful outcome and that \u201csome [patients] might even get worse following the surgery.\u201d However, the same comment could be made about any surgical procedure because, as the court observed in <em>Cline v. United States, </em>270 <em>F.Supp. </em>247, 251 (S.D.Fla.1967), \u201c[t]here is ... some element of doubt and risk attendant upon each surgical operation.\u201d Consequently, if a trial court\u2019s obligation to instruct the jury concerning the plaintiffs duty to mitigate damages by undergoing surgery were contingent upon a medical expert\u2019s opinion that a surgical procedure was guaranteed to be successful, there never would be a case in which such an instruction would be appropriate. However, unless a surgical procedure poses a \u201cperil to life,\u201d \u201cundue risk[ ] to health,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>or \u201canguish that goes beyond the bounds of reason,\u201d a mitigation instruction is appropriate if evidence is presented that surgery \u201coffers a reasonable prospect of restoration or relief from the disability.\u201d <em>Budden, supra, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 350, 128 A.2d 730. Dr. Caponetti\u2019s testimony provided an adequate foundation for the jury to make such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In view of our conclusion that the trial court properly submitted to the jury the issue of plaintiffs duty to mitigate her damages by undergoing surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, we are also satisfied that the $50,000 jury verdict in plaintiffs favor was not against the weight of the evidence and did not represent a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
