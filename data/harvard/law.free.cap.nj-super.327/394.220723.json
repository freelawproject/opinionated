Coppola, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 690 A.2d 1059 (App.Div.1997), and its applicability where a defendant suggests that his objectively assaultive conduct was not intended to cause injury but was intended to protect a plaintiff from potential harm. We conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists which precludes a determination, as a matter of law, that defendant Thomas Beeby is not entitled to coverage under his homeowner\u2019s policy with plaintiff Cumberland Mutual Fire Insurance Co. (Cumberland). We hold that where a factual inquiry is necessary to determine coverage, that issue should be resolved in a plenary proceeding prior to resolution of the underlying tort action. We remand this matter to the Law Division for a plenary hearing to resolve the factual dispute and determine whether such coverage is excluded under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The issue we have identified arises in the following factual and procedural context. Nancy Styer (Styer) and defendant were involved in a long-standing relationship. They lived together since 1993 and parented a child. Defendant is a detective with the Lower Township Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>On January 28, 1994, Styer, defendant and a friend, Danette Hickman (Hickman), went out socially for \u201chappy hour\u201d at a bar in Wildwood. After a few hours they proceeded to a bar in North Cape May, the Red Bull, arriving there at about 10 p.m. At about 11 p.m. Styer and defendant had a verbal disagreement over Styer\u2019s smoking. Styer then left the Red Bull without indicating where she was going. When Styer did not return, defendant became concerned and, with Hickman, went to look for her. Defendant later estimated that Styer had consumed between ten and eleven beers and one or two shots of \u201cRed Devil.\u201d Defendant acknowledged that he drank eight or nine beers during the course of the evening but denied feeling the effects of the alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Defendant and Hickman first looked for Styer in the Red Bull parking lot. They proceeded to canvass the area and finally drove to the home of their mutual friends, Joe and Margaret Vitelli, thinking she may have gone there. When they arrived at the Vitelli\u2019s, Margaret Vitelli (Margaret) informed defendant that Styer was at the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts on Town Bank Road and Bayshore Road. Margaret wanted to pick up Styer. Defendant insisted that he pick her up.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Defendant and Hickman then drove to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts where they saw Styer standing near a phone booth. As defendant walked to Styer, he told her to get into the car; she refused and started walking toward the street. Defendant claims that when Styer attempted to cross Town Bank Road and Bayshore Road, he reached out to grab her: \u201cI wound up grabbing her hair, and I thought I grabbed part of the back of her coat ... I thought I only initially grabbed [her hair] till I was able to pick her up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">As defendant grabbed Styer and tried to pick her up and put her in the car, she struggled to get free. As she did, she struck her knee causing her injury. Defendant asserts that he did not intend to harm her, but because of her \u201ccondition,\u201d he was concerned about her crossing a roadway. He simply wanted them to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>After defendant put Styer in the passenger seat of the car, Styer left the ear and started to run through the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts parking lot with Hickman. The two ran to the back of a parking lot where they jumped over a four-foot fence. Defendant saw Margaret pull into the parking lot, and he proceeded to go home. Defendant claims that when he left the area, he did not know that Styer had suffered any injury. Defendant and Styer appeared in Middle Township Municipal Court on the Wednesday following the incident. Although the record is unclear as to the nature of the charge and whether a domestic violence complaint was filed, the matter was ultimately dismissed without an adjudication on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">On January 16, 1996, Styer filed a two-count complaint in the Law Division against defendant for personal injuries she sustained as a result of the incident that occurred on January 28, 1994 (the tort action). In the first count, she alleged assault, battery, false arrest and false imprisonment; in the second count, she alleged that defendant\u2019s negligence caused her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">When the claim was filed against defendant, he maintained a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy with Cumberland. The policy provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">4. ENDANGERMENT OR HARM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\"><em>We </em>do not cover <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage, </em>whether or not expected or intended by the <em>insured, </em>which is a consequence of an <em>insured\u2019s </em>wilful harm or knowing endangerment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">On April 17, 1996, Cumberland filed a separate declaratory judgment action against defendant and Styer seeking a declaration that Cumberland had no duty to defend and indemnify defendant under his homeowner\u2019s policy for the acts complained of in Styer\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Defendant moved for summary judgment against Cumberland seeking to require Cumberland to defend him in the underlying tort action. Cumberland filed a cross-motion for summary judgment seeking an adjudication that it had no duty to defend under the policy. The motion judge ordered Cumberland to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u201csubject to reservation and full right to reserve a judgment in the amount of its defense costs if the jury determines no coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Cumberland moved before us for leave to appeal. We granted leave to appeal and summarily reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">The motion for leave to appeal is granted and the order of April 4, 1997 is summarily reversed. <em>R. </em>2:8-3(b); <em>R. </em>2:11-2. We direct that the Law Division judge conduct a trial of the issue of insurance coverage prior to the trial on the issue of liability and damages. After a determination is made whether or not the Cumberland Mutual policy provides coverage for the claim by Nancy Styer against Thomas Beeby, the trial of the tort claim may then proceed. <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 391, 267 A.2d 7 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Cumberland renewed its motion for summary judgment in the Law Division, and the motion judge, relying on our decision in <em>Merrimack, </em>granted Cumberland\u2019s motion. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">[M]y feeling is and my reading of the <em>\u00a1Merrimack </em>case is such as to warrant I believe the granting of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff in this case and say that there is no coverage and therefore no duty to defend by virtue of the nature of the relationship, the parties involved, and the acts which are precluded by the legislature and the Domestic Violence Acts as well as the cases that I have cited and in particular the <em>Merrimack </em>ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">... while there is a distinction attempted to be made between the <em>Merrimack </em>case and the present case by virtue of the allegations of the complaint, that\u2019s not so. The fourth count of the complaint in the <em>Merrimack </em>case alleged in the alternative that defendant negligently physically and emotionally abused Joanne Coppola throughout the course of the parties\u2019 marriage, so there was a negligence claim in that Coppola case as well and that\u2019s what the Court was directing itself to in its analysis which ... I think it\u2019s fully applicable here although it\u2019s not a spousal abuse kind of thing because there\u2019s no marriage, but all the other indications or indicia of a marriage were there and I just don\u2019t see any way around it. I further say that I believe that ultimately ... the charge to the jury would include much of what I\u2019ve just said. The jury would decide not only whether ... this is the kind of case that is so reprehensible. I think ... I would have asked them whether or not the act itself, the fact that it is a violation of domestic violence might be ... by them to be reprehensible such that they would not have to go through the analysis of objective/subjeetive kind of thing, but I don\u2019t know if I would have done that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">On appeal, defendant asserts that the trial judge: a) violated our mandate ordering a \u201ctrial on the issue of insurance coverage\u201d by granting Cumberland\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment; b) violated the doctrine of \u201cthe law of the case\u201d; and c) erred in relying on our decision in <em>Merrimack </em>as dispositive of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>issues here. Because we determine that the facts preclude application of <em>Merrimack </em>and that a plenary hearing is required to determine the disputed questions of fact, we need not address the first two issues. We limit our analysis to the application of <em>Merrimack, </em>and the procedure on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We first identify certain basic principles which apply to the common circumstance of a plaintiff pleading both an intentional act of assault and thereafter pleading a negligent act both causing the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">An insurer has a duty to defend its insured \u201c \u2018when the complaint states a claim constituting a risk insured against.\u2019 \u201d <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 173, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992) (quoting <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 77, 100 A.2d 198 (App.Div.1953), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>573, 105 A.2d 677 (1954)). \u2018Whether an insurer has a duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations in the complaint with the language of the policy. When the two correspond, the duty to defend arises, irrespective of the claim\u2019s actual merit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the policy afforded coverage for <em>\u201cbodily injury ... </em>which occurs during the policy term and is caused by an <em>occurrence </em>covered here.\u201d An occurrence is defined in the policy as \u201can accident which results ... in <em>bodily injury.\u201d </em>However, the policy excludes from coverage <em>\u201cpodily injury ... </em>whether or not expected or intended by the <em>insured, </em>which is a consequence of an <em>insured\u2019s </em>wilful harm or knowing endangerment.\u201d As we have noted, plaintiff has pled two distinct causes of action, one is covered by the policy and the other is excluded. In its argument, Cumberland asserts that the policy excludes coverage regardless of the insured\u2019s intent claiming that it is not necessary to delve into subjective intent because the exclusionary language, on its face, clearly and specifically takes the expectation and intention of the insured out of the calculus. Cumberland argues that, objectively, defendant\u2019s intentional conduct of pulling hair and pulling, dragging or carrying Styer constitutes \u201cwilful harm\u201d or \u201cknowing endangerment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The trial judge concluded that our opinion in <em>Merrimack </em>controlled and excluded coverage, rendering any factual inquiry into the nature and quality of defendant\u2019s acts unnecessary. In <em>Merrimack, </em>we specifically addressed the issue as to \u201cwhether a defendant husband\u2019s subjective intent with respect to the consequences of his alleged abusive behavior toward his wife [was] relevant in determining if coverage exist[ed] under his homeowner\u2019s policy that exclude[d] indemnity for injuries expected or intended.\u201d <em>Merrimack, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 221, 690 A.2d 1059. The wife alleged at the divorce trial \u201ca litany of physical and emotionally abusive behavior\u201d continuing for a period of twenty-five years and necessitating at least two restraining orders, the last order being entered in 1990, which granted in-house restraints and forbid harassing and violent activities between defendant husband and his wife. Defendant admitted that the conduct described by his wife amounted to domestic abuse. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">It is clear from the recitation of the proofs offered by Jo Ann in the divorce trial that she was asserting acts of intentional misconduct, as opposed to negligence, as grounds for her <em>Tevis [v. Tevis, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>422, 400 A.2d 1189 (1979) ] claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">We found that \u201cspousal abuse is so reprehensible that both public policy and logic require a presumption that the actor intended injury.\u201d <em>Merrimack, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 229, 690 A.2d 1059; <em>cf. Miller v. McClure, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 569, 742 A.2d 564 (App.Div.1998) (concluding that allegations of workplace sexual harassment were so egregious and reprehensible as to preclude coverage under the policy), <em>aff'd o.b. </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>575, 745 A.2d 1162 (1999). In finding that insurance coverage for intentional acts of domestic violence was not available to defendant, \u201cwe eonclude[d] that spousal abuse in any form is \u2018so inherently injurious, that it can never be an accident,\u2019 and therefore, \u2018[a]s a matter of public policy and logic ... the better rule warrants application of the objective approach,\u2019 to the end that the intent to injure is presumed from the performance of the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 690 A.2d 1059 (quoting <em>Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 607 A.2d 1255).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>Merrimack </em>is distinguishable from the case before us. The record is devoid of any prior history of domestic violence or abuse \u2014 a critical finding in <em>Merrimack. </em>There is no record of any prior restraining orders, and Styer\u2019s claims arose as a result of an isolated incident premised, according to defendant, on his asserted concern for her safety that occurred during the course of one evening. This is markedly different from the sustained evidence of spousal abuse that was before the court in <em>Merrimack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Notwithstanding the significant policy considerations underlying <em>Merrimack, </em>consideration from which we suggest no retreat, the basic principles of summary judgment still apply. Included among these principles is the requirement that the defender of the motion is entitled to all favorable inferences. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Among the favorable inferences in this case is that defendant\u2019s action was protective rather than assaultive. Thus, before a motion judge applies <em>Merrimack </em>and precludes consideration of intent, the judge must make the threshold determination of whether defendant\u2019s conduct falls within the realm of conduct warranting application of such a policy. Considering all inferences in favor of defendant, defendant\u2019s actions, however misguided, were focused on preventing Styer from walking into the middle of the street. A trier of fact could conclude that defendant was acting to protect Styer and did not intentionally assault her, but in his protective zeal, negligently caused the injury giving rise to the cause of action. In other words, a trier of fact could find that defendant\u2019s \u201cintentional\u201d touching of Styer did not rise to the level of an assault and act of domestic violence. We need not express our views as to whether defendant will convince a trier of fact of the bona fides of his theory, only that, on the facts presented here, he have the opportunity to do so. Resolution of this issue will decide the issue of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We add an additional observation regarding the language used in the policy. A precise definition of \u201cwilful harm\u201d has proven to be elusive. <em>McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., </em>486 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>128, 133, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1677, 1681, 100 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>115, 123 (1988) (noting that \u201c[t]he word \u201cwilful\u201d is widely used in the law,\u201d but \u201chas not by any means been given a perfectly consistent interpretation\u201d). New Jersey courts have ascribed various meanings to the elements of this presumably simple phrase. <em>See, e.g., G.S. v. Department of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 178-79, 723 A.2d 612 (1999) (stating in the context of child neglect that \u201cwilful and wanton misconduct implies that a person has acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others\u201d); <em>Fielder v. Stonack, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>101, 124-26, 661 A.2d 231 (1995) (defining \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d in the context of a police pursuit as \u201cthe knowing failure to follow specific orders, \u2018knowing\u2019 that there is an order and wilfully failing to follow it, i.e., intentionally failing to obey an order\u201d); <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>533, 549-50, 461 A.2d 1145 (1983) (stating in the context of parental liability for wilful or wanton negligent supervision of children that \u201c[t]he standard is ... an accepted intermediary position between simple negligence and the intentional infliction of harm\u201d); <em>Executive Comm\u2019n on Ethical Standards v. Salmon, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 105-07, 684 A.2d 930 (App.Div.1996) (defining wilful in the context of ethics violations as \u201cintentional and deliberate, with knowledge of its wrongfulness, and not merely negligent, heedless, or unintentional\u201d). However, we need not explore the limits of defining \u201cwilful harm or knowing endangerment\u201d because the narrow issue presented here is whether defendant\u2019s conduct, once judicially reviewed, rises to the level of being an act of domestic violence. We hold that whatever definition of wilful harm or knowing endangerment is applied, if there is a finding of domestic violence, the holding of <em>Merrimack </em>and the exclusionary provision of the policy will be satisfied. To find otherwise would reinstate the concept of intent in a domestic violence context, a position that we have previously rejected in both <em>Merrimack </em>and <em>Tevis v. Tevis, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 382 A.2d 697 (App.Div.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>422, 400 A.2d 1189 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We finally address the issue of the procedure to be followed on remand. We previously ordered that a trial be conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ed on the issue of insurance coverage prior to the trial on the issue of liability and damages. The motion judge again granted summary judgment. Since we have found that there is an issue of fact, the matter shall be resolved through a plenary hearing with a trier of fact adjudicating the true nature of defendant\u2019s actions and whether he is entitled to coverage. After that determination is made, the tort action may then proceed to final resolution. This procedure will eliminate the anomaly of a potential abuser being covered for acts which amount to spousal abuse. As we observed in <em>Merrimack:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">Clearly, coverage for spousal abuse, in any form, would encourage those who are disposed to commit such reprehensible acts to inflict injury upon their spouses with impunity, knowing that their insurance companies will indemnify them for the money damages recovered by their spouses if only they can convince some jury that they did not intend or expect bodily harm to flow from their conduct. Therefore, we conclude that spousal abuse in any form is \u201cso inherently injurious, that it can never be an accident,\u201d and therefore, \u201c[a]s a matter of public policy and logic ... the better rule warrants application of the objective approach,\u201d to the end that the intent to injure is presumed from the performance of the act. <em>Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 185, 607 A.2d 1255 <em>(quoting Atlantic Employers, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 283, 571 A.2d 300).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\"><em>[Merrimack, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 230, 690 A.2d 1059.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Our decision does not retreat from this view but simply requires that the trier of fact, for coverage purposes, determine whether the acts complained of fall within the exclusion under the policy. That finding, in essence, requires a determination of whether defendant committed an act of domestic violence, a determination which will test the quality of his acts as well as the intended result. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 690 A.2d 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">We reverse the judgment in favor of Cumberland and remand for a plenary hearing consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
