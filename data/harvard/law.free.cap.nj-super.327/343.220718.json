Lines (Mitsui) and MOL Intermodal, Inc. (Intermodal) appeal from an order granting defendant Consolidated Rail Corporation\u2019s (Conrail) cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing their action for damages incurred following a derailment of a Conrail train, and denying their motion for summary judgment. The damages sought consist of the cost of hiring surveyors to inspect and survey the damaged cargo in the amount of $42,382. Conrail paid for the cargo losses but refused to pay for the survey expenses, claiming that plaintiffs should have used Conrail\u2019s inspection team to conduct the surveys and that liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>for such expenses is excluded under a limitation on damages provision in the parties\u2019 shipping contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The contract was governed by Conrail\u2019s Exempt Trailvan Rules Circular CR No. 1 (Circular No. 1) which sets forth Conrail\u2019s liability for damage to cargo, and contains procedures for processing claims. Paragraph 8.7 of Circular No. 1, entitled \u201cSpecial or Consequential Damages,\u201d contains a provision limiting Conrail\u2019s liability for damages, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">In no event shall Conrail be liable for any special, consequential, indirect or punitive damages, interest or attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Conrail contended survey expenses are included within this limitation on damages provision. Plaintiffs countered that survey expenses are \u201cincidental\u201d damages which are different from \u201cconsequential\u201d damages and not excluded by the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">In granting Conrail\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the judge, in a brief eonclusory oral decision, determined that the limitation on damages contained in paragraph 8.7 included survey expenses \u201cby [its] literal reading\u201d and also that such expenses were not recoverable because Conrail had made inspectors and surveyors available to plaintiffs as set forth in the Guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The principal issue on this appeal is whether survey expenses are \u201cspecial, consequential, [or] indirect\u201d damages or \u201cincidental\u201d damages. If they are \u201cincidental\u201d damages, then Conrail is liable to reimburse plaintiffs for the survey expenses they incurred because that term was not included in Conrail\u2019s limitation of damages provision; if not, then plaintiffs cannot recover these costs from Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">By the clear implication of their arguments, both parties believe the limitation on damages provision in paragraph 8.7 is clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>unambiguous. Plaintiffs contend that survey expenses constitute \u201cincidental\u201d damages as a matter of law because \u201cincidental damages\u201d are damages directly associated with their obligation to mitigate their cargo losses. Conrail argues that survey expenses are \u201cspecial,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d or \u201cconsequential\u201d damages, because they are the \u201cnatural and proximate consequence[s] of the [cargo] loss,\u201d or because they do \u201cnot follow immediately\u201d after the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We resolve the issue by applying general contract principles. Both plaintiffs and defendant agree that the contract requires the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to govern the interpretation of the disputed provision. Under Pennsylvania law, \u201c \u2018[t]he task of interpreting ... contracts] is generally performed by a court rather than by a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Madison Constr. Co. v. Harleysville Mutual Ins. Co., </em>557 <em>Pa. </em>595, 735 A.2d 100, 106 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u201cWhen courts interpret a contractual agreement, their duty is to \u2018ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glen-Gery Corp. v. Warfel Constr. Co., </em>734 A.2d 926, 929 (Pa.Super.1999) (quoting <em>Standard Venetian Blind Co. v. American Empire Ins. Co., </em>503 <em>Pa. </em>300, 469 A.2d 563, 566 (1983)). The intent of the parties is to \u201cbe ascertained from the document itself when its terms are clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Hutchison v. Sunbeam Coal Corp., </em>513 <em>Pa. </em>192, 519 A.2d 385, 390 (1986) (citing <em>Steuart v. McChesney, </em>498 <em>Pa. </em>45, 444 A.2d 659, 661 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Comments to the <em>Restatement of Contracts </em>defines \u201cincidental losses\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">Incidental losses include costs incurred in a reasonable effort ... to avoid loss, as where a party pays brokerage fees in arranging or attempting to arrange a substitute transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\"><em>[Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 347 comment c (1981) (the Restatement).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Pennsylvania\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) defines \u201cincidental damages\u201d similarly as \u201cexpenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>and custody of goods rightfully rejected....\u201d 13 <em>Pa.C.S.A. </em>\u00a7 2715(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Comment c to \u00a7 347 of the <em>Restatement </em>defines \u201cconsequential\u201d losses to include \u201cinjury to property resulting from defective performance.\u201d It also defines \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cconsequential\u201d damages as \u201c[t]he damages recoverable for loss that results other than in the ordinary course of events____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 351 comment b.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The U.C.C. defines \u201cconsequential\u201d damages as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APU\">(1) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and (2) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">[13 <em>Pa.C.S.A. </em>\u00a7 2715(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">In addition, under Pennsylvania law, consequential damages are frequently associated with damages in the form of lost profits. <em>See e.g., AM/PM Franchise Assoc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>526 <em>Pa. </em>110, 584 A.2d 915, 920 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">We have carefully considered these definitions, the record, and the arguments advanced by the parties, in the light of the applicable law, and agree with plaintiffs that survey expenses are \u201cincidental\u201d damages arising from the derailment of the Conrail train, and not \u201cconsequential, special [or] indirect damages\u201d as limited in the parties\u2019 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">Basically, survey expenses are \u201cinspection\u201d expenses. <em>See </em>13 <em>Pa.C.S.A. </em>\u00a7 2715(a)(1). This type of expense flows directly from the ordinary course of events following a train derailment involving serious cargo loss. Survey expenses are substantially equivalent to the cover costs incurred by a buyer rejecting defective goods because they are expenses incurred in an attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>mitigate damages. They do not properly fit within the definition of \u201cconsequential\u201d or \u201cspecial\u201d damages because they are not damages which result \u201cother than in the ordinary course of events.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 351 comment b.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Indeed, it has been recognized that survey fees are \u201cnecessary expenses <em>incidental </em>to the [cargo] loss [sustained].\u201d <em>GTS Industries S.A. v. S/S Havtjeld, </em>887 <em>F.Supp. </em>531, 538 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (emphasis added), <em>aff'd, </em>68 <em>F.3d </em>1531 (2d Cir.1995). They are fees incurred to determine the quantum of damage or to render expert assistance in restoration or salvage. <em>Santiago v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>366 <em>F.Supp. </em>1309, 1317 (D.P.R.1973) (citing <em>Continental Distrib. Co. v. Reading Co., </em>168 F.2d 967 (3d Cir.1948)). Similar expenses which are considered \u201cincidental\u201d to a cargo loss include transportation, warehousing, and the like. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In sum, Circular No. 1, the controlling agreement between the parties, and in particular paragraph 8.7, limits Conrail\u2019s liability for \u201cconsequential, special, [or] indirect\u201d damages. That provision does not expressly reference \u201cincidental\u201d damages. Since survey costs are \u201cincidental\u201d damages, a term not expressly included in the provision, liability therefor is not limited under the provision. If Conrail, a sophisticated business entity, wanted to limit its liability for \u201cincidental\u201d damages, it should have included that term in the list of damages it sought to circumscribe. <em>See e.g., New York State Electric &amp; Gas Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>387 <em>Pa.Super. </em>537, 564 A.2d 919 (1989). It failed to do so and, accordingly, Conrail is liable for reimbursing plaintiffs for that loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We reject as without merit Conrail\u2019s claim that the course of dealing between the parties demonstrates that survey expenses were limited by paragraph 8.7 or that plaintiffs were required to utilize Conrail\u2019s inspection team. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The summary judgment in favor of Conrail is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\"> \u201cA Guide to Damage Prevention Services and Claims Procedures\u201d (the Guide) indicates that Conrail provides freight inspection services and that upon prompt notification of any loss an inspector will be dispatched. That Guide is not part of the shipping contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-16\"> While the matter before us is not controlled by the U.C.C., the code represents a considered examination of general law with respect to contracts and can be instructive in understanding the meaning of the contested terms. <em>See Loos &amp; Dilworth </em>v. <em>Quaker State Oil Refining Corp., </em>347 <em>Pa.Super. </em>477, 500 A.2d 1155, 1160 (1985) (applying principles of U.C.C. by analogy to franchise contract).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
