Sts. <em>c. </em>147, and dated October 6,1866. By said agreement it appeared that the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of arbitration was a contract made by the plaintiffs with the defendants to manufacture certain machinery, and the transactions of the parties under and relating to the same, and that it was agreed that the arbitrators should determine \u201c whether or not there has been any breach of this contract, and, if so, what damages, if any, have been caused the Paper Company thereby.\u201d In their award it was certified that they found <em>\u201c </em>that there was a breach of the contract, but that the Paper Company are not thereby entitled to damages, for reasons which were made apparent to the arbitrators.\u201d The defendants objected to the acceptance of this award: 1. \u201c because the agreement for submission was without a proper United States internal revenue stamp until after the award was rendered and entered in court, when the proper United States internal revenue stamp was affixed to it by the proper officer, according to law; \u201d by which omission or delay the defendants contended that the award made under such agreement was invalid; and, <em>2. </em>because the arbitrators found that there was a breach of the contract, but awarded no damages therefor. These objections were overruled by <em>Rock</em>well.| J., who allowed the award, whereupon the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-4\"><em>W.
