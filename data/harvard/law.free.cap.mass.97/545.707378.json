The defendant then testified that there was no glass or sash in the door, and had not been any therein since he had owned it, which was more than six years. On cross-examination the district attorney asked him whether there was not a.sash with glass in the partition near the door. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the question as opening new matter and incompetent. This objection being overruled, the defendant answered that there was such a sash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-10\">The jury found a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-11\"><em>J. Brown, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsZ\">The St. of 1866, <em>c. </em>260, cannot abridge the defendant\u2019s rights under the constitution, which are, not only that he shall not be compelled to furnish evidence against himself, but also that he may produce all proofs that may be favorable to him. Declaration of Rights, art. 12. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>offered himself as a witness on a distinct fact material to the issue, and on no other. The judge permitted him to be asked on cross-examination as to a separate fact; and he was thereby compelled, against his objection, to furnish evidence against himself. The rule in cross-examination in civil cases ought not to apply here. And the question which he was compelled to answer was open to the objection of introducing new matter not relied on when the government rested its case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-5\"><em>C. Allen, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AOU\">was not called upon.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b556-6\">Bigelow, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVm4\">The statute which allows a defendant in a criminal case, at his own request and not otherwise, to testify in bis own behalf, (St. 1866, <em>c. </em>260,) expressly provides that \u201c he shall be deemed a competent witness; \u201d that is, competent not for a special purpose, or to give evidence only which shall operate in his own favor, but competent to testify to any facts relevant and material to the issue. Like all other witnesses, he is to tell the truth and the whole truth concerning any matter proper to be inquired about. If he offers himself as a witness, he waives his constitutional privilege of refusing to furnish evidence against himself, and may be interrogated as a general witness in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The objection founded on the course of the examination of the defendant at the trial is untenable. The order of the introduction of evidence and the time when questions relating to new matters may be put are within the discretion of the presiding judge, to the exercise of which no exception lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
