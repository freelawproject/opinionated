North American Prize Concert. To be drawn at The Rink, Chicago, Illinois.

It purports to entitle the holder to whatever prize shall be drawn by its corresponding number in a scheme called a \u201c prize concert.\u201d The prizes consist of \u201c gifts in greenbacks\u201d and gifts in other kinds of property. One half of all the tickets represent blanks, as \u201c every other ticket draws a prize.\u201d This clearly constitutes a lottery. In the first count the ticket, and in the second count the lottery, is alleged to be <em>\u201c </em>false and fictitious.\u201d The demurrer and plea of guilty admit the truth of this allegation. No objection was taken at the trial, and none is now open to the defendant, except the general one of insufficiency of the <em>indictment; </em>and no particular defect is pointed out. We think the allegations are sufficient, and that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
