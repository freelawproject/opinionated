The case was reserved by <em>Gray, </em>J., upon the following report, for determination by the full court whether the evidence introduced and offered would warrant a decree of di- ' vorce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\">\u201c At the bearing it appeared that the parties were married on October 13,1855; that on April 5, 1860, the respondent deserted the libellant and continued such desertion ever since ; that the libellant on April 25, 1864, married another woman, and occupied the same house and bed with her for a few days, at the end of which they separated, and have not since occupied the same bed; and that the respondent, both before and after the second marriage of the libellant, committed the crime of adultery. The libellant testified that he believed at the time of the second marriage that he had a right to marry again, by reason of his first wife\u2019s having deserted him ; that he never had carnal connection with the second wife; and that they ceased to occupy the same bed immediately <em>on his </em>discovering, a few days after the second marriage, that be had no lawful right to contract it. The libellant also offered the testimony of the second wife, and of a physician, to show that he did not and could not have carnal connection with her.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-9\"><em>H J.

She proves in defence, that before the lapse of the five years, namely, on the 25th of April, 1864, the libellant married another woman, and occupied the same house and bed with her for several days. This is sufficient evidence to prove adultery on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">1. He replies to this evidence, that his adultery is no defence, because her offence is of a different character; and he contends that she cannot recriminate his <em>delictum </em>unless it is an offence of the same kind, and not of a different character. Some authorities are cited to sustain this point. But the offence of each of them was of such a character as would by our statutes entitle the other party, if not in fault, to a divorce from the bonds of matrimony. In that respect, the offences were alike. The court had occasion to consider the validity of such a defence in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>4 Allen, 39. It was there held that where a wife has deserted a husband for a period of five years, so that he would be entitled to a divorce against her on that ground, she cannot maintain a libel against him on the ground of his adultery after the lapse of the five years; but she may maintain it if be has committed adultery within the five years and before her offence is complete. This doctrine stands on the obviously just ground stated in <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>1 Swab. &amp; Trist 107, where it is said that \u201ca party guilty of a breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>marriage vow should not have the assistance of the court to enforce any marital right.\u201d At the time when the libellant committed his offence, a <em>locus penitentice </em>remained to the wife, and she might have returned to him. His offence justified her in never returning.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><em>2. </em>He further replies to this defence by offering his own testimony that, though he married another woman, he did it under a mistake as to his legal rights, and, though he occupied the same bed with her for a few nights, he did not commit adultery. His mistake of the law cannot avail him ; and we do not think he has a right to require the court to enter into an investigation of such particulars of his conduct as he proposes. At best, it would be an exposure of himself and his proceedings which decency and good morals would require the court to suppress as far as possible; and we do not think he has a right to inflict it upon anybody for the sake of enabling him to obtain a divorce from his wife. <em>Libel dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
