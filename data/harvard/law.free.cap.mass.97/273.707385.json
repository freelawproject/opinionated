Full instructions, to which no exception was taken, were given to the jury as to the care required of the plaintiff under all the circumstances, including his knowledge of the defect; and, a verdict being returned for the plaintiff, the defendants filed a motion for a new trial, for the alleged reason, among others, that the verdict was manifestly against the weight of evidence; which motion was overruled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The defendants then requested to be permitted to seek a determination by this court of the question \u201c whether the fact that the plaintiff had knowledge of the existence of the defect before the accident happened, conclusively shows that he was wanting in due care; \u201d which was the ground on which the motion for the new trial was pressed. The plaintiff, however, objected that no question was open for adjudication by this court. But the judge reported the case for determination of the -point stated, certifying in his report, that \u201c if, as matter of law, the defendants\u2019 position in this respect is right, they are entitled to a new trial, unless their not asking for such specific instruction to the jury, and their not excepting to the instructions as given, is a waiver of their right.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-5\">P. <em>E.
