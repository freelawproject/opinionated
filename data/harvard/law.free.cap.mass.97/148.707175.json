Sts. <em>e. </em>129, \u00a7 62, filed by a defendant during vacation, and continuing on file until the next term of the court wherein the action is pending, takes effect on the first day of that term, and is to be entered of record as of that day; and if the plaintiff, having notice of the offer, does not elect to accept it, but proceeds to trial and recovers judgment for a less sum, exclusive of interest from the date when the offer took effect, than the sum offered, he is entitled to his costs only to that date, including travel and term fee for that term, and the defendant is entitled to costs thereafter.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AET\">Contract. In the superior court, on October 30,1865, being in vacation after said October term of that court, the defendants filed their written consent to be defaulted, and offer of judgment n favor of the plaintiff \u201cto the amount of one hundred and Twenty dollars, with costs to be taxed.\u201d The plaintiff did not elect to accept this offer, and on the trial of the action at October term 1866 he recovered ninety-four dollars and seventy-five cents, damages. On the taxation of costs, the clerk allowed costs to the plaintiff to the time of judgment, and disallowed a claim of the defendants for costs from the date of filing their offer; and the defendants appealed to the court, which overruled the decision of the clerk, and allowed to the plaintiff costs \u201c from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the beginning of the action to the offer of judgment,\u201d and allowed to the defendants costs thereafter; and thereupon the plaintiff appealed to this court.

Sts. <em>c. </em>129, \u00a7 62, requires the defendant to \u201c offer in court.\u201d This requirement is something more than and different from the \u201c consent in writing \u201d also required. Filing a paper in vacation is not an <em>\u201c </em>offer in court.\u201d The statute says, \u201c The court shall render judgment accordingly.\u201d At the time of filing the paper, there was no court in session to render judgment, and a judgment at the next term would not have been <em>\u201c </em>accordingly.\u201d The statute contemplates an offer of which the plaintiff can immediately avail himself. The words, <em>\u201c </em>the court,\u201d in the last sentence of \u00a7 62, contemplate a term in session at which decrees may be passed, and their meaning is the same in all parts of the section.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-6\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVF\">It is true that the statute by its terms requires that an offer of judgment and consent to be defaulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>should be made in court. Gen. Sts. c. 129, \u00a7 62. Such offer filed in vacation would not be a compliance with this provision. The plaintiff could not then avail himself of it to obtain a judgment, if he should elect to accept it. But when the offer is filed in vacation and continues on file till the next term, it then becomes operative, and should be entered of record as of the first day of that term. The plaintiff can then, if he sees fit, accept the offer and have judgment accordingly. If he fails to do so in conformity to the provisions of the statute, he will be liable to costs from that time, in the event that he does not recover a greater sum than that offered, exclusive of interest. Gen. Sts. c. 129, \u00a7 63. It is not alleged in the present case that the plaintiff did not receive due notice of the filing of the offer of judgment. We are therefore of opinion that the offer is to be taken as having been made \u201c in court\u201d on the first day of the term next after it was filed in the clerk\u2019s office, and that the plaintiff is entitled to his costs for travel and term fees for the previous terms and for that term, and that the defendant is entitled to costs for the subsequent terms during which the action remained in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\n<em>Taxation ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
