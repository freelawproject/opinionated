At the trial in the superior court, Crotty\u2019s widow was permitted to testify, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to conversations with the defendant before Crotty\u2019s .death, but not to conversations with her husband; and also that it was her husband\u2019s practice to carry the note in his pocket.

See <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Booth, 2 </em>Allen, 559. The testimony of Mrs. Crotty in this case, that her husband was in the habit of carrying the note in suit in his pocket, does not come within the statute prohibition, and was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The testimony of the defendant was properly excluded, by the plain words of the statute, because the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was the other party to the cause of action in issue and on trial.
