Carrier.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b534-6\">The fact that the magistrate who took the affidavit and made the certificate to authorize the arrest of a person on an execution, under the Gen. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 5, was the attorney of record of the judgment creditor, does not render the officer liable in damages for making the arrest, if it was not disclosed by the precept nor actually known by him. An execution to enforce a decree for alimony is not for \u201c debt or damages,\u201d in the sense of the Gen. Sts. o. 124, \u00a7 5.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">Tort ; against Ingalls, as a deputy sheriff for Bristol, for an alleged illegal arrest of the plaintiff; and against Carrier, as keeper of the county jail, for alleged illegal imprisonment of the plaintiff therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-8\">The cases were tried together, in the superior court, befoio Fose, J,, and the counsel for the plaintiff stated in his opening, that he expected to prove that in proceedings for divorce commenced in this court by Mary Jane Chase, the plaintiff\u2019s wife, a divorce was granted to the libellant, and that at April term 1865 a decree in her favor, for alimony, for the sum of eleven hundred dollars, was entered against the plaintiff, and an execution to enforce this decree was issued and delivered to Ingalls for service; that Ingalls arrested the plaintiff upon this execution, and committed him to the county jail, and Carrier received him into the jail upon this commitment and imprisoned him there; and that at the time of this arrest and imprisonment there was an affidavit of arrest annexed to the execution, which had been subscribed and sworn to by Mrs. Chase before a justice of the peace who was her attorney of record in the proceedings for divorce. And the counsel for the plaintiff stated that he should contend, upon proof of these facts, that as matter of law an affidavit so taken and subscribed did not authorize any arrest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the plaintiff; and that his arrest and imprisonment were therefore illegal and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">A copy of the execution was introduced in evidence, which recited that, \u201c Whereas Mary Jane Chase \u201d had \u201c recovered judgment against Albert Chase\u201d \u201cfor the sum of eleven hundred dollars damage,\u201d and an additional sum as costs of suit, therefore the officer was commanded \u201c of the goods, chattels, or lands of the said j udgment debtor \u201d to \u201c cause to be paid and satisfied unto the said judgment creditor at the value thereof in money, the aforesaid sums,\u201d and for want of such goods, &amp;c., <em>\u201c </em>to take the body of the said Albert Chase, and him commit unto our jail,\u201d \u201c and him detain in custody within our said jail until,\u201d &amp;c. The affidavit of Mary Jane Chase annexed to the execution was in the form usual under the Gen. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 5, <em>c\u00bf. </em>1, she styling herself therein \u201cplaintiff and judgment creditor,\u201d and making oath before Thomas M. Stetson, justice of the peace, \u201c that the debtor has property not exempt from being taken on execution which he does not intend to apply to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim;\u201d and the justice certified that he was \u201c satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe the charges therein contained.\u201d And the return of the officer set forth that \u201c by virtue of this execution and by order of the judgment creditor within named,\u201d he arrested the body of Albert Chase, \u201c the within named judgment debtor,\u201d and carried him before the judge of probate for Bristol, and afterwards committed him to the county jail, \u201c the said judgment debtor not desiring to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors, and not desiring to enter into recognizance with surety, in conformity with the statutes in that behalf.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">The judge asked the counsel if he expected to prove that the fact, that the magistrate before whom the affidavit was taken was the attorney of record of Mrs. Chase in the proceedings for divorce, was known to the defendants, or either of them, at the time of the arrest and commitment of the plaintiff; and the counsel replied that he could not say what knowledge the defendants had of this fact, and did not think it material whether they knew it or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>It being conceded that the facts were as stated by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his opening, upon the suggestion of the judge the defendants were called as witnesses; and Ingalls testified that he received the execution from one Cobb, a deputy sheriff, and that, when he received it, there was no affidavit of arrest thereon; that he sent it to Thomas M. Stetson, esquire, and afterwards received it back with the affidavit annexed, and then made the arrest; that he had no knowledge before or at the time of the arrest, that Mr. Stetson was the attorney of record in the divorce proceedings; and that he knew nothing about that matter: and Carrier testified that he had no communication with Mr. Stetson as to the imprisonment, and knew nothing of the case whatever till the plaintiff was brought to the jail, and did not know that Mr. Stetson was the attorney of record in the divorce proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">The plaintiff offering no evidence to qualify or control the testimony of the defendants, the judge ruled that the action could not be maintained, under which ruling verdicts were returned for the defendants; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-6\"><em>L. </em>Lapham, for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AllT\">cited <em>Pearce </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>13 Mass. 324, 339, 340; <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>2 Gray, 120, 124; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLane, </em>4 Gray, 427; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 45; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albro, </em>1 Gray, 48, 49.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-7\"><em>T.

The officer may justify by pleading his process regular upon its face, and cannot look further, for, if he should, it would put a stop to the execution of legal process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>2 Cush. 581. <em>Folger </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>5 Cush. 266. <em>Whipple </em>v.

The process issued by special order of this court to enforce a decree for alimony is not affected by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>124, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6. These sections being in derogation of common law rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>end remedies, no affidavit was necessary in the case at bar, unless their terms necessarily include it. The privilege of taking the poor debtors\u2019 oath is secured to a person \u201c arrested on execution in any case.\u201d Ib. \u00a7 9. An arrest thus easily terminated by one who can honestly take the oath does not always need preliminary safeguards, and such therefore are required only on executions issued for debt or damages in civil actions, not including actions of tort. Ib. \u00a7 5. There may well be this difference in stringency of remedy between a case of alimony, in which the duty and ability of the husband to support the wife have been investigated and determined by the highest tribunal before the issue of process, and the case of a debtor, whose liability is plain matter of contract, but of whose ability to pay nothing is determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">3. The prayer for alimony is not an action. 3 Bl. Com. 94. It has no jury trial. Civil actions are tiled by jury, unless such trial is waived by the parties. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>129, \u00a7 66. A civil action commences by writ; lb. <em>c. </em>123, \u00a7 9 ; and may be brought even if neither party lives in the state; lb. \u00a7 1; and, if a personal action, may, with certain exceptions, be commenced by trustee process; lb. <em>c. </em>142, \u00a7 1 ; and it will hardly be contended that, if the prayer for alimony is a civil action, it is either a real or mixed action, or one of the forms of personal action excepted from the operation of the provision last quoted Further, a civil action is a proceeding which passes to a judgment on which a writ of error may lie. Ib. <em>c. </em>129, \u00a7 42. In all civil actions interrogatories may be filed; lb. \u00a7 46 <em>et </em>seq.; and it is apparent that the expression \u201c civil action \u201d is thus used in a common law sense, for by the St. of 1862, c. 40, the same provisions as to interrogatories are extended to suits in equity. Nor does the statute of limitations apply to proceedings for alimony. When the most comprehensive word to express forms of legal proceeding is desired, the Gen. Sts. use the word suit. Gen. Sts. c. 121, \u00a7 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-6\">4. Alimony is based on neither debt nor damages. 2 Bish. Mar and Div. (4th ed.) \u00a7 488. <em>Lyon </em>v. Lyon, 21 Conn. 185. It is a support allowed out of the husband\u2019s estate; Gen. Sts. c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>107, \u00a7 43; and depends on no principle of indebtedness, nor on his merit or demerit, but on the amount of his means and those of the party in whose favor it is decreed. The practice of parliament was always to require the husband to provide for the discarded and guilty wife. 2 Bish. Mar. and Div. \u00a7 377. And in several states the law requires this. Ib. \u00a7 379. The duty to maintain is not based on contract. <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>2 B. Monroe, 142. See also <em>De Blaquiere </em>v. <em>De Blaquiere, </em>3 Hagg. Eccl. 322; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>7 Iowa, 46; 2 Bish. Mar. and Div. \u00a7\u00a7 435, 476 ; <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Burr, 7 Hill, </em>207. Alimony does not survive the husband\u2019s death, nor go to the wife\u2019s administrator; <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>6 Har. &amp; Johns. 288 ; 2 Bish. Mar. and Div. \u00a7 436; and cannot be ordered for the wife\u2019s life. Ib. \u00a7 428. Even if an action is maintainable on a decree for alimony, which seems doubtful since <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>4 Cush. 518, that would only indicate the effect <em>in futwo </em>of a decree, and not show that the decree was based on debt or damages. <em>Van Buskirk </em>v. <em>Mulock, </em>3 Harrison, (N. J.) 193, 194. Orders of court for alimony may be enforced, as in equity, by process for contempt. The court may order alimony secured. Even after a decree for annual alimony is recorded, the court may alter it on petition. Gen. Sts. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 45,47. Perhaps, after an award of alimony <em>in </em>solido, the court might make a further allowance, as a probate judge does sometimes to a widow. Ib. \u00a7 48. Costs are created in a way analogous to alimony; <em>Ib. c. </em>156, \u00a7 16 ; but were never deemed debt or damages. A poor debtor formerly could obtain discharge from debts but not from costs. Even now no affidavit is necessary to justify an arrest for costs. Ib. c. 124, \u00a7 6. Taxes also are not within the provisions of the laws abolishing imprisonment for debt. <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>5 Gray, 530. The execution for alimony is not the execution of the common law, but derives its authority specially from the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7 45. When the decree in this case ordered an execution to be issued against Mr. Chase, it was as if the decree itself set forth in detail what was to be done to him if he should refuse to obey its mandate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-5\"><em>G. Marston, </em>for the defendant Carrier.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADl\">The execution, upon which the plaintiff was arrested and committed, was regular in form, and bore the affidavit and certificate of a magistrate as provided by the Gen. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 5. <em>Prim\u00e9 </em>facie, it is a complete defence to the officers acting in accordance with its directions. The defect relied on by the plaintiff to deprive them of its protection is the fact, now admitted, that the magistrate who made the certificate was the attorney of record of the party in whose favor the execution issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">It is settled law that an officer is protected by his precept, if the court or magistrate had authority such as the precept assumes. It is not his duty to inquire into the particular facts of the case, if the general power appear and the process be regular. He cannot be affected by any irregularity occurring prior to the issue of his precept, nor by the existence of any fact which deprives the court or magistrate of jurisdiction in that particular case, provided the defect be not disclosed by the precept itself, nor known to the officer. Even if the defect be one which renders the precept void in its operation between the parties, or for the transfer of property, yet it will not subject the officer to liability as a trespasser. See <em>Sandford </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>13 Mass. 286, and cases cited to this point by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The cases relied upon by the plaintiff do not support any doctrine inconsistent with this. The decision in <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>13 Mass. 324, 344, is put expressly upon the ground that the want of authority in the magistrate appeared from the warrant itself. In <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 45, the want of jurisdiction arose from the very character of the \u25a0 proceeding, which the warrant disclosed. In <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>2 Gray, 120, the officer was held liable because his warrant did not show affirmatively an apparent jurisdiction, there being none in fact, and the burden being upon him to establish his justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Where the proceeding is, in its nature, one in which the magistrate nos no right to exercise the authority under which the officer assumes to act, he is held responsible although acting in good faith; because in such case the want of authority is disclosed upon the face of the precept. But where the want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>authority arises from some fact that is personal to the magistrate, or peculiar to the proceedings in the particular case, the precept cannot disclose it, and the'officer is not to be held liable without actual knowledge of the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The plaintiff offered no evidence to show that the defendants had actual knowledge that the certifying magistrate was disqualified ; not deeming it to be .material whether they knew it or not; and the testimony of the defendant Ingalls, as reported, would not warrant the jury in finding such knowledge. He is not entitled now to have a jury to determine that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Upon another ground we think the verdict must stand. The arrest was in accordance with the authority and directions of the precept. It is a proper mode of serving an execution, unless the statute (Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>124, \u00a7 5) restricts the right. The restriction applies to executions issued for debt or damages in a civil action, except in actions of tort.\u201d Perhaps the term \u201c civil action \u201d might be held to embrace suits for divorce. But the restriction clearly does not extend to all cases that might be termed \u201c civil actions.\u201d It is limited to such only as are for the recovery of <em>\u201c </em>debt or damages.\u201d This limitation, and the exception of \u201c actions of tort,\u201d which follows, indicate that the restriction is not general, and was not intended to apply to such warrants of the court as may issue to enforce its decrees in special proceedings like this of libel for divorce. The allowance of alimony, or the award to the wife of her own or a part of the husband\u2019s estate upon granting a divorce, is not a debt nor damages, in the sense of the statute. No affidavit and certificate of a magistrate were necessary; and therefore the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
