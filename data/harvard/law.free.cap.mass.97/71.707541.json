Sts. <em>c. </em>149. At the trial in the superior court the complainant introduced evidence tending to show that he was the owner of two contiguous lots of land situated on a small brook in Greenfield ; that the respondent erected in 1851, and had since then maintained, across the brook, a milldam which flowed back the water upon those lots of land in times of freshet or high water; and that such flowing had injured the land. There was further testimony tending to show that the land on both sides of the brook was \u201con about the same level,\u201d and that one Nims owned a lot of land on the other side and opposite the complainant\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">The complainant called Nims as a witness, who testified that within three years before the date of this complaint, his land had been flowed by the respondent\u2019s dam. The complainant then proposed to show by the witness, upon the question of damages for the flowing under this complaint, how much the respondent paid to Nims as damages for flowing Nims\u2019s land; but <em>Morton, </em>J., ruled that the evidence was inadmissible, to which ruling the complainant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-7\"><em>C.

How much the complainant\u2019s land had been injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>was the question upon trial. The circumstances in the other case may have been very dissimilar, and the amount of damages paid to the other land-owner may have been greater or less than adequate compensation to him. The point has been already adjudged in <em>Tyler </em>v. Mather, 9 Gray, 183. And in the opinion of the court, it does not fall within the analogy of those cases Which permit the value of adjacent and similarly situated parcels of land, as indicated by the prices for which they have sold, to be shown where the question on trial is the value of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
