These receipts she offered in evidence. There was no proof of their execution other than the defendant\u2019s testimony; and she was unable to read. The judge ruled that they were not admissible; the jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-5\"><em>M. J. </em>McCafferty, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-6\"><em>C. </em>Allen, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACn\">The defendant\u2019s first proposition might be quite material if coupled with evidence to show that the time was subsequent to the larceny, and that the stolen money must have been in her possession then, if she did steal it. But, if the second proposition were in any possible view material, the receipts were incompetent. They were, at best, mere statements, not under oath, of the persons who signed them. Those persons should have been called as witnesses.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-7\">Hoar, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">1. The evidence rejected was not in any respect material to the defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">2. If the fact of payment had been material, that fact was admitted in evidence. The receipts were merely the written acknowledgments of a third party, and, not being in themselves proof of the fact against the Commonwealth, added no weight to the testimony admitted. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
