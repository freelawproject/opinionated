At the trial-in the superior court, before <em>Brigham, </em>J., certain witnesses testified, for the government, to seeing a large number of sales of ale and whiskey at the defendant\u2019s place of business. The defendant himself testified that he sold no liquors there but \u201c nectar and mineral water,\u201d and called witnesses, who testified that they had frequented the place, and had seen him sell these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>beverages, but no others, and that these resembled ale and whiskey. The defendant then proposed to show, by these witnesses, that, on several occasions, in his place of business, they had heard persons call for intoxicating drinks, and that these calls were invariably refused; but the judge excluded this testimony as incompetent. The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-5\"><em>A. F. L.

Proof that a man has violated the law in particular instances cannot be rebutted by proof that he did not violate it in other instances when he had the opportunity and was tempted to do so. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
