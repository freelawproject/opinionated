He is not present in person, nor can he be heard by attorney. A hearing would avail nothing. If a new trial should be ordered, he is not here to answer further; if the exceptions are overruled, a sentence cannot be pronounced and executed upon him. The attorney general has a right to ask that he should be present \u2022to receive the judgment of the court. 1 Chit. Crim. Law, 663. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Cardwell, </em>17 Q.
