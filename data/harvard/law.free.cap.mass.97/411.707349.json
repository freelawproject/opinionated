Josselyn.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b421-5\">An averment in a complaint that the defendant hoed \u201c in his field \u201d on the Lord\u2019s day i\u00ab sufficiently supported by evidence that on the Lord\u2019s day he hoed \u201c in a field in a part of his garden.\"</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b421-6\">The fact that crops in a field are suffering from want of hoeing does not make the hoeing ' of them on the Lord\u2019s day a work of necessity or charity; and on the trial in the superior court of a complaint for doing such work on the Lord\u2019s day, the question whether it was work morally fit and proper then to be done is not one necessary to be submitted to the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">Complaint under the Gen. Sts. c. 84, \u00a7 1, for doing work not of necessity or charity on the Lord\u2019s day. The work specified as done by the defendant was \u201c hoeing in his field.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">At the trial in the superior court, before <em>Vose, </em>J., the only witness for the government testified that about eight o\u2019clock on the morning of Sunday, June 24,1866, he saw the defendant \u201c hoeing for about an hour in a field back of the defendant\u2019s house; that it was a part of the defendant\u2019s garden near the defendant\u2019s house.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-9\">The defendant contended \u201cthat a charge of hoeing in his field was not supported by proof of hoeing in his garden, it appearing that there was a field of the defendant adjoining; \u201d but the judge overruled this objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-10\">The defendant, who was a shoemaker, testified that he worked as such in cooperation with others who would be obliged to remain idle unless his subdivision of the work was promptly performed whenever it was ready for him; that on the two days preceding the Sunday in question he had not worked at his trade, but had given the greater part of the time to cultivating his crops at home, and had been engaged in that labor by moonlight on Saturday evening; that when he left off work on that evening \u201c a few hills remained unfinished and in very bad condition and suffering for want of hoeing; \u201d and that he was expecting to go to work with his gang at shoemaking on Monday morning. But it appeared also by his testimony that he did not go to work with the gang on Monday; and his evidence was in some respects \u201d controverted by the government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The defendant contended that if it was morally fit and proper that the hoeing complained of should be done on the Lord\u2019s day, it was a work of necessity and charity, which the defendant might lawfully do, and that the moral fitness and propriety of the defendant\u2019s act was a question for the jury; and asked the judge so to rule. But the judge refused the requested ruling and instructed the jury \u201c that if they should be satisfied that the defendant performed the labor on the Sunday in question, as alleged, he was liable to the penalty of the statute, although he might have been unable to complete the cultivation of his crops during the other six days of the week in consequence of having been occupied at his trade or other engagements or employments.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-6\"><em>P. Simmons, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A--\">to the point that the question of the moral fitness and propriety of the work should have been submitted to the jury, cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>9 Allen, 276; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>Ib. 118.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-7\"><em>C. Allen, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b422-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A8Y\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions cannot be sustained. The complaint charged him with working on the Lord\u2019s day by hoeing in his field; and the evidence for the Commonwealth was that he was hoeing in a field, in a part of his garden. There is no variance. Whether a garden is always a field or not, it may be in a field; and this was. The complaint was sufficient, and there was nothing to show any necessity for the defendant\u2019s labor on that day. <em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
