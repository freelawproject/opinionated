The warrant issued thereon was addressed to the constable of the Commonwealth or either of his deputies, the sheriff of our county of Franklin or either of his deputies, or any constable of the town of Wendell in said county,\u201d described the tenement to be searched as \u201c a certain building \u25a0 situated in said Wendell at Wendell Depot (so called) kept in a store by William Putnam,\u201d and described the liquors intended to bo seized in the same manner as they were described in the complaint, and directed the officer to \u201c make due return of this warrant.\u201d It was in fact returned at Greenfield before the trial justice who issued it, by Sylvester N. Whitney, who subscribed himself in his return as \u201c deputy state constable,\u201d and certified that \u201c by virtue of the within precept \u201d he had searched \u201c the within described premises \u201d and seized therein \u201c the liquors described in the within warrant, with the vessels in which they are contained, to wit: about one hundred and twenty-five gallons of whiskey in five barrels, one jug and two bottles; about forty-nine gallons of gin in one barrel, one keg, two demijohns, one jug and two bottles; about fifty-seven gallons of ram in two barrels, three lugs, one keg and two bottles; about twelve gallons of wine in one barrel.\u201d At the trial in the superior court, Putnam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>appeared as claimant, and moved that the complaint be dismissed, alleging the following reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Asq\">1. Because no trial justice has any jurisdiction of such cases; 2, because the officer who served and returned the warrant had no authority by law to serve the same or search for and seize any property; 3, because the descriptions of liquors to be searched for and seized are not particular, and the quantities in the complaint do not at all correspond with the quantities seized on the warrant; 4, because the complaint avers that certain liquors were deposited in a building kept as a store by Putnam, while the warrant avers that certain liquors were deposited in a building kept in a store by Putnam; 5, because it does not appear in any part of the record that the complainants have been summoned to appear as witnesses; 6, because there is no direction in the warrant to the officer to make a return before the same or some other justice of the peace, or police court in the place where the liquor is alleged to be deposited or kept, and the return of the officer is not made to any such court or justice, but to the trial justice in Greenfield, where the liquors are not alleged to be kept or deposited. \u201e</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">This motion was overruled, and a judgment of forfeiture was entered, from which the claimant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-6\"><em>G. Sennott, </em>for the claimant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-7\"><em>C. </em>Allen, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcR\">1. The Gen. Sts. c. 86, \u00a7 42, provide that the complaint may be before \u201ca justice of the peace or police court,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>such justice shall issue a warrant of search.\u201d By Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>120, \u00a7 36, it is provided that \u201c when any criminal jurisdiction is given to justices of the peace it shall be construed to mean trial justices.\u201d The jurisdiction as to seizures of liquor is in the nature of criminal jurisdiction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>13 Allen, 54; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>14 Gray, 375. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>13 Allen, 561. 2. By St. 1865, c. 249, \u00a7 2, the <em>\u201c </em>constable of the Commonwealth \u201d and his deputies have all common law and statutory powers of constables, except service of civil process. By Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>86, \u00a7 42, this process might have been served by a constable. The phrases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201c state constable \u201d and \u201c deputy state constable \u201d are equivalent to \u201c constable of the Commonwealth \u201d and \u201c deputy constable of the Commonwealth,\u201d and are in common use therefor by legislators, state officers, judges, eminent counsel and other learned men. The act creating the office of the constable of the Commonwealth and authorizing the appointment of his deputies (St. 1865, c. 349) is entitled <em>\u201c </em>An act to establish a State Police.\u201d The word \u201c State \u201d is in common use for \u201c Commonwealth,\u201d and cannot be misunderstood. 3. The description of the liquors was sufficient. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>13 Allen, 53, 58. <em>Downing </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>8 Gray, 539. 4. The variation in description of the place is immaterial. The warrant sufficiently identifies the place to be searched as the same place mentioned in the complaint, and this is all that is necessary. 8 Gray, 540. 13 Allen, 53. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>6 Allen, 599. 5. It was not necessary to summon the complainants as witnesses. 6. The direction in the warrant was in the form enacted by Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>86, \u00a7 63, to \u201c make due return \u201d thereof. The Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>86, \u00a7 43, provide that the officer shall return the warrant, with his doiqgs thereon, \u201c to the same or some other justice or police court in the place where such liquor is alleged to be kept or deposited.\u201d The officer did make return of the warrant to the same trial justice who issued it. If the warrant is returned before a police court, it should be before a police court in the place where the liquor was kept; but if there is no police court in that place, then it may properly be returned before a trial justice. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>130, \u00a7\u00a7 36, 37.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b76-5\">Chapman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXg\">No arguments or authorities are presented on behalf of the claimant, and on looking into the alleged grounds of his motion to dismiss the complaint, we cannot see that any of them are tenable. Some of them are met by the decisions referred to in the brief of the attorney general, and by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, ante, </em>63, and others by the plain provisions of the statutes. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
