It set forth that the defendant, at Greenfield, on March 1, 1866, \u201c then and there being a clerk of the First National Bank of Greenfield, a corporation then and there duly and legally established, located, organized and existing in said Greenfield under and by virtue of the laws of the United States,\u201d \u201c did, whilst he, the said Lucius H.

To this special plea in bar the attorney for the Commonwealth filed a demurrer, which the judge sustained, whereupon the defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">The attorney for the Commonwealth offered as evidence of the organization of the \u201c First National Bank of Greenfield \u201d as a corporation under the laws of the United States, a certificate signed by the comptroller of the currency of the United States, and sealed with his seal of office, under date of July <em>2, </em>1864, setting forth that \u201c whereas, by satisfactory evidence presented to the undersigned, it has been made to appear that the First National Bank of Greenfield, in the town of Greenfield, in the county of Franklin, and state of Massachusetts, has been duly organized under and according to the requirements of the act of congress, entitled an act to provide a national currency secured by a pledge of United States bonds, and to provide for the circulation and redemption thereof,\u2019 approved June 3, 1864, and has complied with all the provisions of said act required to be complied with before commencing the business of banking under said act;

St. 1864, c. 106, \u00a7 55, and falls within the exclusive cognizance of the federal courts. TJ. S. St. 1789, c. 20, \u00a7 11. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>8 Met. 313. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>12 Met. 387. 2. The former acquittal was well pleaded. The question is whether the evidence necessary to support the second indictment would have been sufficient to procure a legal conviction upon the first. Archb. Crim. Proc. (Waterman\u2019s ed.) 111, note. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>Thach. Crim. Cas. 202. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bubser, </em>14 Gray, 83. The second indictment contains all averments necessary to charge larceny at common law. The Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>161, \u00a7 39, divide the persons subject to the penalty into two classes, those who sustain a fiduciary relation to the bank, and those who do not. \u201c Fraudulent conversion,\u201d in the words of the statute, as applicable to those not \u201c intrusted with the custody,\u201d &amp;c., means larceny, for embezzlement applies only to those so intrusted. 3 Chit. Crim. Law, 921. 2 Bish. Crim: Law \u00a7 284. If it was intended to charge the defendant as bailee, the indictment should have set forth the relation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>9 Met. 138. Being \u201cin.the employment\u201d of a bank as a clerk does not import custody of property beyond the books necessary to his employment. 2 Bish. Crim. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 722, 730. The indictment alleges the bonds to be the property of Purple and Goddard; they retained the legal and constructive possession of them ; the bank had the actual possession as bailee; and the defendant, if guilty, is guilty of larceny for the conversion <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>4 Mass. 580. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>1 Pick. 375. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doane, 1 </em>Cush. 5.

Fraudulent intent is material to the offence, and is a question for the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>10 Gray, 202. The judge erred in giving the jury to understand that the defendant might be guilty although he intended to use the bonds only for a temporary purpose and restore them to the owner in the identical form and condition in which they were taken. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>10 Gray, 206.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-5\"><em>C. Allen, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2k\">1. The U. S. St. of 1864, c. 106, provides a punishment for embezzling funds of banking institutions, but none for embezzling funds of individuals deposited therein. The offence charged in this indictment is not punishable under any law of the United States. 2. On a plea of former acquittal the test is, can the second indictment be maintained by proof of fewer facts than the first ? If so, the former acquittal is no bar. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roby, </em>12 Pick. 496. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clair, </em>7 Allen, 525. For conviction on the former indictment for larceny it was necessary to prove that the bonds were not in the defendant\u2019s possession, and that he intended to deprive the owners of them permanently, neither of which needs to be proved to convict on this indictment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>9 Met. 138. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>9 Cush. 284. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>12 Allen, 181. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Gorbutt, </em>Dearsly &amp; Bell, 166. Therefore the defendant\u2019s plea in bar was rightly overruled. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>Car. &amp; Marshm. 328. 3. The charge in the second indictment is not larceny, but fraudulent conversion. To sustain this it is enough to show a temporary appropriation which is fraudulent. But even if a stricter degree of proof than this is necessary, ihe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>defendant, having pledged the bonds as collateral security, must be held to have licensed the pledgee under certain contingencies to make his possession absolute, and to have contemplated and intended that among the other natural consequences of his act. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Phetheon, </em>9 C. &amp; P. 552. <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Hackett, 2 </em>Allen, 141,142. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starr, 4 </em>Allen, 304. 3 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 14.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-4\">Foster, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">This indictment is founded on Gen. Sts. c. 161, \u00a7 39, within the provisions of which, we have no doubt, national banks, created under the laws of the \"United States, must be held to be included. The words \u201c incorporated bank \u201d are broad enough to embrace not only banks existing at the date of the passage of the act, but such as have been chartered since; and they are not limited to corporations created by the laws of Massachusetts, but likewise include such national banking corporations as are located within this Commonwealth, if the offence to be punished is here committed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">The further objection is made, that the courts of the United States are vested by the judiciary act of September 24, 1789, (U. S. St. 1789, <em>c. 20, \u00a7 11) with </em>exclusive cognizance <em>of </em>all crimes cognizable under the authority of the United States, except where it is otherwise provided by the acts of congress. But an examination of the statutes of the United States leads us to the conclusion that the offence charged in this indictment has not been made punishable by any act of congress. The enactments cited on behalf of the defendant punish the embezzlement of the property of national banks, but not of the property of individuals, deposited with and in the custody of such banks. U. S. St. 1863, c. 58, \u00a7 52. U. S. St. 1864, c. 106, <em>\u00a7 </em>55. As the federal courts have no criminal jurisdiction except that conferred by congress, no question can be made as to the constitutionality of state legislation punishing such frauds, until they have been made punishable by the federal laws. There is no view of the relative, or of the concurrent powers of the two governments, which affects the decision of the present case; for all courts and jurists agree that state sovereignty remains unabridged for the punishment of all crimes committed within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>limits of a state, except so far as they have been brought within the sphere of federal jurisdiction by the penal laws of the United States. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fuller, 8 Met. 313. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>12 Met. 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The objection that the First National Bank of Greenfield had not been duly organized as a corporation was not insisted upon at the argument, and, so far as we can judge from the evidence reported, appears to have no foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The defendant pleaded in bar a former acquittal, which plea was overruled upon the demurrer of the government, and the correctness of that decision is before us for revision. An inspec tian of the record in the former case shows that it was a simple common law indictment for larceny of the same bonds, the felonious and fraudulent conversion of which is charged in the case at bar. The present indictment follows the words of the statute upon which it is framed, which describe the whole offence. This is ordinarily sufficient, and is not now objected to as defective. It does not allege whether the defendant was intrusted with the possession of the abstracted property or not, and by the express language of the section this is immaterial. The guilt and punishment of an officer of a bank, or a person employed in it, who fraudulently converts to his own use the property of any person deposited in the bank, is made the same, whether he was or was not entrusted with the custody thereof. In either case such\u2019an act is \u201c to be deemed a larceny.\u201d But this language does not make the act indictable as a larceny if it were not so before. It is a statute offence, and must be charged as such. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>9 Met. 138. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>9 Cush. 384. Under the first indictment, the defendant might probably have been found guilty of a common law larceny, if he had not been intrusted with the possession of the. property. At all events, this may be assumed for the purposes of the present discussion. But proof that he was intrusted with the property would have defeated the first indictment. It does not appear whether the evidence at the trial of the present case showed that he was or was not intrusted with the custody of the property taken. If the ground on which a conviction was claimed was that of lar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ceny, and it appeared that the property abstracted was not intrusted to the custody of the defendant, the record of a former acquittal might perhaps have been introduced as conclusive evidence in his favor. But it was not offered in evidence. And it is impossible to sustain a plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>where, by a comparison of the two records, it appears that the two indictments are in point of law for distinct offences. 1 Stark. Crim. Pl. 322 <em>el seq. Commonwealth </em>v. Roby, 12 Pick. 496. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Clair, 7 Allen, 525. In the present case the plea does not answer the indictment, but only one aspect of the evidence by which it may have been supported. The allegations constituting the statute offence may all be sustained by facts not amounting to larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Consequently the plea is insufficient, because it does not appear that the defendant was by the former indictment put in jeopardy for the same offence. This would have been entirely apparent if the present indictment alleged that the defendant, being a person in the employment of the bank, <em>and being intrusted with certain </em>property, &amp;c., had fraudulently converted it to his own use. It then would have been manifest that a larceny was not charged and the former acquittal was no defence. Such may have been the reason for the previous acquittal and for the present conviction, in which case both verdicts are right! But if at the last trial the government proceeded on a state of facts amounting to mere larceny, and consequently covered by the first indictment, the defendant\u2019s only remedy was, as we have already stated, to introduce the former record in evidence. The peculiarity of the present case arises from the circumstance that the statute has been so framed that an indictment under it may be maintained upon either of two states of facts. We are satisfied that this provision was intentional, and designed by the legislature to prevent the escape of the guilty employee in a bank upon a doubt whether he ought to be convicted of larceny or embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">With reference to the fraudulent and felonious character of the acts proved, and their sufficiency to warrant a conviction we entertain io doubt. To take from their place of deposit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>bonds of a depositor, and send them out of the state to be used as collateral security for the defendant\u2019s own debt, was a fraudulent conversion. Intention to restore the bonds, and the agreement of the party who received them not to sell or dispose of them, cannot do away with the criminal nature of the transaction. A guilty intent is necessarily inferred from the voluntary commission of such an act, the inevitable effect of which is to deprive the true owner of bis property and appropriate it to the defendant\u2019s own use. Perhaps in a majority of cases the party who violates his trust in such a manner does not expect or intend that ultimate loss shall fall upon the person whose property he takes and misuses. But no hope or expectation of replacing the funds abstracted can be admitted as an excuse before the law. The forger who means to take up the forged paper, the thief who contemplates making eventual restitution, and the man who embezzles money or bonds with the design of restoring them, all fall under like condemnation in courts of justice and wherever the rules of sound morality are respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
