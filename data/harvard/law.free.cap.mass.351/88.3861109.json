Welch <em>&amp; </em>Co., Inc. (Welch) was, in July, 1965, the successful general bidder for the construction of a housing project for the elderly in Beverly. Welch also submitted a subbid for the roofing, flashing and sheet metal work. The form for subbids prescribed by Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44G-, as amended through St. 1961, c. 604, \u00a7 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>included this statement: \u201cTo All General Bidders Except Those Hereinafter Expressly Excluded: ... 0. This sub-bid may be used by any general bidder, except . . ..\u201d Welch in its subbid inserted after the word \u201cexcept\u201d the words \u201call general bidders other than James J. Welch &amp; Co., Inc.\u201d The plaintiff had submitted a lower subbid and contends that, because of this insertion, Welch\u2019s subbid had to be rejected under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, as amended through St. 1968, c. 445, \u00a7 2. That section directs rejection of a subbid \u201con a form not completely filled in, or which is incomplete, conditional or obscure, or which contains any addition not called for.\u201d We disagree. Welch\u2019s meaning was plain. The subbid could be availed of in accordance with its terms. We are not concerned with whether under another provision of \u00a7 44H in its then form (\u201cEvery sub-bidder . . . shall be bound ... to every general bidder not expressly excluded therein from the use thereof\u201d) Welch, in order to prevent the use of his subbid by any other general bidder, would have had to name that bidder specifically.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Wayland Sch. Bldg. Comm. </em>v. <em>Cardarelli Constr. Co. Inc. </em>349 Mass. 766, is misplaced. That case holds that a general bid is not invalid because it makes use of a subbid containing a general exclusion similar to that used by Welch. The holding is based on the provision of \u00a7 44H that (in its then form) read: \u201cIf a general bidder not named in said list [of sub-bidders] as expressly precluded from doing so names as a sub-bidder ... a person included ... in said list . . ., neither the general bid . . . nor the general contract . . . shall be invalid or rejected because of the invalidity of such sub-bid.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">There is nothing in the contention that Welch was not qualified under \u00a7 44J to submit a subbid. The trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>found that \u201cthe awarding authority . . . conducted a reasonable inquiry ... as to whether . . . Welch customarily performed the sub-trade and was qualified to do the work required, and concluded that it was satisfied.\u201d He also found \u201cthat . . . Welch customarily performs the sub-trade and is qualified to do the work . . .. \u201d The finding is plainly implicit in the foregoing that the full statutory requirement had been met, and that the performance of the subtrade was customarily by the general bidder\u2019s \u201cown employees. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> The issue cannot arise under \u00a7\u00a7 44G and 44H, as amended by St. 1965, c. 836. Section 44G now expressly provides for the optional statement that the subbid \u201cmay only be used by the following general bidders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> For permissive substitution of subbidders after first selection of the general bidder, see G.
