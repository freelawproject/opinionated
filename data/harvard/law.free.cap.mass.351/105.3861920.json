The judge of the Superior Court sitting without, a jury made a finding for the defendant, and filed a \u201cmemorandum of law in connection with . . . [his] finding.\u201d The case, is here on exceptions to the \u201crulings and finding\u201d of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">The action was tried on a statement of agreed facts. In 1947 the committee established salary schedules differentiating between the teachers not having a bachelor\u2019s degree; those having a bachelor\u2019s degree, and those having a master\u2019s degree. In 1951 the committee voted to increase the salary of \u201cthose persons who.possess a doctorate de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>grec.\u201d Six plaintiffs have doctorate degrees from unaccredited institutions. Four of these six plaintiffs hold master\u2019s degrees from accredited colleges, and two have master\u2019s degrees from unaccredited schools. The other seven plaintiffs have master\u2019s degrees from unaccredited institutions. For at least three years prior to 1962, the plaintiffs had been included in the salary schedule for their highest degrees. On May 31, 1962, the committee voted to increase the salary schedule for teachers by $500 effective January 1, 1963, and by $400 effective January 1, 1964. The committee also adopted a recommendation \u2018\u2018 that the salary schedule pertaining to Master\u2019s and Doctorate Degrees shall apply only to those individuals who have obtained their Degrees from Colleges or Universities accredited by the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools or the 5 other accrediting institutions. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The plaintiffs contend that \u201cto apply the, vote of the Chelsea School Committee ... to those already having tenure on the salary schedules applicable to Masters and Doctors was to impair the obligations of contracts and was therefore invalid and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contracts, however, were subject to the power of the school committee to reduce salaries as part of a general salary revision affecting equally all teachers of the same salary grade. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Revere, </em>249 Mass. 525, 531. <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>278 Mass. 172. <em>Downey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Lowell, </em>305 Mass. 329. <em>Watt </em>v. <em>Chelmsford, </em>328 Mass. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Thus, the basic issue is whether the reclassification of the plaintiffs is in violation of G-. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43, which provides that \u201c [t]he salary of no teacher employed in any town . . . shall be reduced without his consent except by a general salary revision affecting equally all teachers of the same salary grade in the town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Salary is only one factor in determining whether specified teachers are <em>\u2018 </em>of the same salary grade. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>278 Mass. 172,177. Other factors include \u201ctenure of service\u201d <em>(Paquette </em>v. <em>Fall River, supra) </em>and position held <em>(McCartin </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Lowell, </em>322 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>624, 628). We note the language of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 40, which provides that \u2018 \u2018 [w] omen teachers employed in the same grades and doing the same type of work with <em>the same preparation and training </em>as men teachers shall be paid at the same rate as men teachers\u201d (emphasis supplied). We believe that \u201cpreparation and training\u201d are also factors in determining whether specified teachers are \u201cof the same salary grade.\u201d The school committee, it seems to us, acted reasonably in differentiating between persons with degrees from accredited and unaccredited institutions. There was no differentiation between those having \u201cthe same preparation and training.\u201d The result of the committee\u2019s action was a \u201cgeneral salary revision affecting equally all teachers of the same salary grade,\u201d i.e., all persons with advanced degrees from unaccredited institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Further, we are of opinion that the committee had authority to establish a new classification at an increased salary for persons with advanced degrees from accredited schools, since, in our view, such a classification bears a \u201crational relation to the furthering of the objects for which the board exists.\u201d <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>329 Mass. 314, 317. The persons remaining in the 'old classification would be the only ones in that salary grade, and, therefore, their salaries could be reduced because this would constitute a general salary revision affecting equally all teachers of the same salary grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
