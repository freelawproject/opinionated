Lynch. The probate judge entered a final decree ordering the funds distributed to Dorilda Shea, the widow of the testator\u2019s nephew James Shea. This is an appeal by Thomas P. Snow, Sr., and Charles E. Snow, Third, the children of the testator\u2019s niece, and by Mrs. Margaret McIntyre,, the testator\u2019s sister. The evidence is reported and the judge made a report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The sixth clause of the testator\u2019s will establishes a trust for the testator\u2019s wife. The seventh clause provides: \u201cUpon the death of my wife, Eleanor F. Lynch, the Trust estate is to be divided into six equal portions and paid over as follows: Four sixths to Margaret McIntyre . . . my sister, or in the event of her death said four sixths is to be divided equally among such of her children as are living. Two sixths are to be divided equally between the children of my sister, Ellen Shea, namely Mrs. Ellen Snow and James Shea, except that the share of James Shea is to be held upon the same trusts as are herein stated with reference to his sixth. The share of Mrs. Ellen Snow is to go to her absolutely. The share of James Shea is to be held in trust by Mrs. Ellen Snow<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the benefit of her brother, James aforesaid, the income thereof to be paid to him annually and upon his death the <em>principal to go to his heirs excepting those by his first marriage\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We herewith summarize pertinent portions of the judge\u2019s findings. \u201cAt the time of the execution of the will, . . . James E. Shea had been married to and divorced from his first wife, Annah G-oodwin, and had one living daughter, Anne Allison Preble Lee, the sole issue of his first marriage.\u201d The will was executed in 1947, and the testator died in 1950. The testator\u2019s widow died in 1957. On Jan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>nary 10,1959, James Shea married Dorilda Shea. He died intestate in 1964, survived by his widow and his daughter by his first marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Mrs. McIntyre contends that the term \u201cheirs\u201d in the seventh clause is \u201csynonymous with the term \u2018children\u2019 or \u2018issue\u2019 and the Snows contend that it means \u201cheirs of the blood within the lineage of . . . [the testator\u2019s] deceased sister Ellen Lynch Shea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018heirs\u2019 in its ordinary as well as technical signification denotes and it is to be construed as meaning those persons who take a person\u2019s real estate by inheritance after his death. <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>239 Mass. 439. The word \u2018heirs\u2019 also includes by force of statute a surviving husband or wife. <em>Yerxa </em>v. <em>Youngman, </em>241 Mass. 251. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 190, \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Merchants Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Church, </em>285 Mass. 217, 221. Nothing in the terms of this will leads us to interpret \u201cheirs\u201d in a different sense. The testator\u2019s niece received her share of the trust remainder outright; and if she died intestate, her assets would pass to her statutory heirs. Thus, the testator did not clearly indicate an intent that statutory heirs other than lineal relations should not share in his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The Snows also contend that \u201cin the proper application of Gr. L. c. 190, \u00a7 1, the widow of James is limited to one-third, and two-thirds goes to Charles and Thomas Snow, . . . pursuant to section 3 of said chapter, because of the existence of a child of James Shea, Anne Shea (Preble) Lee, . . . although such child is cut off under the will.\u201d They argue that \u201cif any kindred is disinherited, the rules determining who shall take operate solely within section 3. The spouse\u2019s share is neither augmented nor decreased by the disinheritance of any kindred under section 3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Section 1 provides, \u201cA surviving husband or wife shall ... be entitled to the following share . . . not disposed of by will.....If the deceased leaves issue, the survivor shall take one third.\u201d Section 2 provides for distribution of personal property as \u201cprescribed for the descent of real property.\u201d Section 3 provides for the descent of the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>property of an intestate, \u201csubject ... to the rights of the husband or wife,\u201d (1) \u201cIn equal shares to his children . . .\u201d and (5) \u201cIf he leaves no issue and no father or mother, to his brothers and sisters and to the issue of any deceased brother or sister by right of representation.\u201d Under the terms of the statute, the heirs of James Shea are his widow and his daughter by his first marriage. See <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>254 Mass. 347, 349-350. His nephews are not statutory heirs, since they take only \u201c [i]f he leaves no issue.\u201d The express exclusion of his heirs by his first marriage left the widow as the sole heir. Since she takes by the will and not by intestacy, she is not limited to the share she would have taken on intestacy. See <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>254 Mass. 347, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the judge was correct in determining that Dorilda Shea is the sole heir of James Shea excepting his heirs by his first marriage. Costs and expenses of appeal are to be in the discretion of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> Mrs. Snow died in 1959.
