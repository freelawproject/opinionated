Chelmsford\u2019s fire chief and its selectmen are not parties. It alleges that principally because of differing reports made by an assistant chemist attached to the Department of Public Safety (the department), Frontier is uncertain with respect to its rights and duties under G. L. c. 148, \u00a7\u00a7 9,10, and 13, and the regulations thereunder. The bill seeks a declaration that Frontier\u2019s business is subject neither to those sections of e. 148 nor to regulations made under \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Frontier\u2019s bill was dismissed on the grounds that (a) it had not seasonably taken an appeal under c. 148, \u00a7 31; (b) a declaratory decree would not settle the controversy between Frontier on the one hand and Chelmsford\u2019s fire chief and board of selectmen on the other; and (c) the materials \u201ckept and manufactured by . . . [Frontier] on its premises are articles referred to and subject to regulations . . . promulgated under\u201d G. L. c. 148, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10. The evidence is reported. The trial judge justifiably found the following facts among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Frontier \u201cwas engaged principally in the manufacture of dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine . . . [DNPT], and the mixing of that material with silica to form a chemical blowing agent called Isopor.\u201d On April 5,1961, a fire occurred on Frontier\u2019s premises in Chelmsford. It was investigated by Dr. Hankard, an assistant chemist employed by the department. On June 6, 1961, and on September 20,1961, he filed separate official reports on the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">In the earlier report he concluded that the fire preceded an explosion, which was \u201cdue to the extremely rapid evolu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>tian of a large volume of gas from approximately nine tons of Isopor as the result of fire exposure,\u201d and that the spontaneous ignition of floor sweepings contaminated with DNPT was a possible cause of the fire. He identified DNPT as a Class B explosive under the regulations of the department governing explosives, but stated that Isopor was not to be classified as an \u201cexplosive or \u2018flammable solid\u2019 \u201d and was not subject to the regulations of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In his second report, Dr. Hankard retracted his previous classification of DNPT and found it to have \u201cnegligible explosive properties under test conditions.\u201d He stated, however, that DNPT \u201cand Isopor are highly flammable materials which will ignite and generate gases to a dangerous extent when acted upon by acids and acidic salts and open flames or sparks.\u201d He therefore classified them as hazardous substances subject to regulation under c. 148, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">It is apparent from the findings of the trial judge that the local authorities have advised Frontier that it must comply with the licensing requirements of c. 148 if it is to resume its manufacturing business. Frontier denies that it is subject to such regulation but states its doubt and the possibility that continuing the business may render it liable to the penal provisions of c. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">1. Frontier may maintain this bill for declaratory relief. <em>Madden </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>333 Mass. 734, 736-737. See <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 470-471. There was no definitive action, at any specific time, by the department, Dr. Hankard, or others in connection with either report, nor was there specific official communication to Frontier of any report or action of Dr. Hankard or others. We assume that, at least with the consent of the Fire Marshal, Frontier could have taken some type of appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Fire Marshal from each report within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ten days after that report was filed, if it had learned of the report officially. The effect and intended application, however, of the two somewhat conflicting reports remained, and still remain, ambiguous and uncertain. No official departmental action on the basis of either report has been shown to have been taken or proposed. No amendment of regulations under G. L. c. 148, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10, has been issued or suggested. We think that no event occurred sufficient to require appeal action within ten days thereafter, or, in the absence of an appeal, to preclude later declaratory relief. Cf. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Burlington, </em>347 Mass. 320, 326. We think that the uncertainties (a) caused by the reports and their effect upon Frontier\u2019s business and (b) concerning the action appropriate for Frontier to take in the circumstances were sufficient to justify declaratory relief on a basis analogous to that underlying the <em>Madden </em>case. See <em>Metropolitan Dist. Police Relief Assn. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>347 Mass. 686, 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">2. The trial judge incorrectly concluded that the department\u2019s present regulations under c. 148, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10, govern DNPT and Isopor. As highly flammable substances, if Dr. Hankard\u2019s appraisal of them is correct, these materials might have been subjected to regulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no evidence which would have made these substances subject to regulation as \u201cflammable solids\u201d under Fire Prevention Regulation 13, nor was there any evidence to justify their classification under Fire Prevention Regulation 12 in Class A (dangerous explosives) or in Class C (minimum hazards). Even if they might have been listed in Class B as flammable hazards, they were not so listed by regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>specifically, and the evidence (including Dr. Hankard\u2019s reports) did not justify finding them to be other unnamed substances \u201chighly susceptible to detonation.\u201d The language of the regulations was not apt to include them. Upon an appropriate showing of the qualities of DNPT and Isopor, the regulation may be appropriately amended (see fn. 2) to cover them.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">3. General Laws c. 148, \u00a7 10A, requires a permit from the head of the fire department of a town where made necessary \u201cby rules and regulations\u201d of the board. General Laws c. 148, \u00a7 13,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also requires a land use license from the local licensing authority (in this case the selectmen) for the use of a building where certain articles designated in c. 148, \u00a7 9, are being kept, stored, manufactured or sold. If the department\u2019s regulations are amended to include DNPT and Isopor as Class B hazards, it, of course, would become necessary for Frontier to obtain a permit from the fire chief under \u00a7 10A. On the other hand, if the regulations remain as they are the license from the selectmen required under \u00a7 13 would suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We view c. 148 as designed to provide licensing by fire prevention authorities of substantial use of materials deemed by the department to be highly flammable. As the regulations now read, no license under \u00a7 10A is required. Any relief which we grant should afford an opportunity to the department to amend its regulations appropriately to include DNPT and Isopor, so that any protection of the public deemed necessary by the appropriate fire prevention officials may be required by them rather than leaving the matter uncertain or for decision by the courts or by selectmen, who cannot purport to be experts in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">4. The final decree is reversed. A new final decree is to be entered declaring, in a manner consistent with this opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ion, (a) that DNPT and Isopor are not Class B explosives within the present department regulations; (b) that, if the regulations are amended within sixty days after receipt of the rescript in the Superior Court to include these substances as Class B explosives, and a copy of the amended regulations is promptly transmitted to Frontier with a ruling by the appropriate department official that the regulations apply to Frontier, then Frontier will be bound to apply for a permit under \u00a7 10A, before resuming operation, unless it obtains a reversal of the ruling by a seasonable appeal under \u00a7 31; and (c) that, in the absence of an effective regulation within such sixty day period, Frontier may resume operations but only if it obtains a license under \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">This is the opinion of a majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> General Laws e. 148, \u00a7 31, provides for appeals within ten days to the Fire Marshal by \u201cfa]ny person aggrieved by any act, rule, order or decision\u201d of any person, with one exception not here relevant, acting under c. 148.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> Chapter 148, \u00a7 9, provides: \u201cThe . . .

Unlike \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10 and 10A of c. 148, \u00a7 13 does not refer to any regulation adopted by the board, but solely to articles mentioned in \u00a7 9 of the chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
