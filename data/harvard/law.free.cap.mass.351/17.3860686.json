Duane Company, Inc. (Duane), whose business is the demolition of buildings, is the lessee of five acres of a forty-seven acre tract owned by the defendant Nelson. The plaintiff board, under G-. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A, seeks to enjoin Duane from using, and Nelson from permitting the use of, the leased land in Holbrook as a dumping ground. The master to whom the case was referred concluded that the defendants were using the site as a dumping ground in violation of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants appeal from a decree granting the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The master found the following: Since June 17, 1964, Duane has daily deposited on the site twenty-five to thirty-five loads of debris, each load consisting of five to seven tons. Although the debris was made up chiefly of lumber from demolished buildings, it. included large quantities of brick, plaster, wire lath, pipe, and, occasionally, refrigerators, tires and ashes. The site was never assigned as a dumping ground by the board of health. The town\u2019s fire chief, acting under G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 13, as amended by St. 1964, c. 303,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at Nelson\u2019s request- on Duane\u2019s behalf, granted per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>mission, if weather conditions were suitable, to burn the debris in the open air for two days at a time. Fire control measures were imposed as a condition to the permission. Unburned materials were removed when the fires were extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The defendants contend that (1) demolition debris is not \u201cgarbage, rubbish or other refuse\u201d.as specified by Gr. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A, and therefore the site is not a dumping ground requiring an assignment as such by the board under \u00a7 150A; (2) Gr. L. c. 48, \u00a7 13, as amended, relating to open air fires, governs exclusively the burning of demolition debris, and the requirements of the statute have been met; and (3) the plaintiff\u2019s bill is barred by loches.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">(1) Whether with or without noncombustibles, the deposited debris was \u201crubbish- or other refuse\u201d under any definition of either word, <em>Mile Road Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 379, 382-383, and therefore the use of the site for the deposit of the named materials made it a dumping ground within Gr. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A. As such it could not lawfully be established or maintained unless assigned by the board of health. (2) General Laws c. 48, \u00a7 13, as amended, does not remove, demolition dumps from the provisions of G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 150A. It forbids outdoor burning anywhere, including at an assigned dump, without permission of the fire chief. It provides that, when the burning of demolition material is to be done anywhere, additional safeguards may be imposed by the fire chief under G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 13. Permission to burn under the latter statute does not dispense with the requirement of G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 150A, that the site be assigned as a dumping ground by the board of health. (3) The defence of loches is not available to the defendants where the proceeding is brought by an authorized public agency to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>317 Mass. 185, 187. See <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Capitol Motor Transp. Co.
