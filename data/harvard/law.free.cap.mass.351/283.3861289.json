The plaintiff prayed for relief (1) on common law equitable principles, (2) under the provisions of G-. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A (which deals with injunctive relief in certain cases of trademark infringement or unfair competition), and (3) under the provisions of C. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9 (see footnote No. 1). The evidence was agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The plaintiff has been conducting business under its name since 1851. On August 15, 1963, the defendant filed its articles of organization with the Secretary of the Commonwealth (the Secretary). That same day the Commissioner of Insurance (the Commissioner) considered objections to the defendant\u2019s choice of name (made by the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company) and approved the defendant\u2019s name. The plaintiff never assented in any way to the assumption of the name by the defendant and, on September 12, 1963, filed with the Secretary a protest regarding the name, sending a carbon copy to the Commissioner. On September 18, 1963, the Director of the Corporation Division of the office of the Secretary asserted that the Secretary\u2019s office had no jurisdiction to act on the protest and suggested instead a hearing with the Commissioner. On September 23, 1963, the Commissioner offered to entertain the protest and hold a hearing. The plaintiff, on October 2, 1963, sent a letter to the Commissioner denying that he had authority to consider the protest or hold the hearing \u201cbut expressed its gratitude for the opportunity offered for a hearing and its hope that such a hearing might resolve the matter.\u201d The hearing before the Commissioner was held on October 30, 1963. At that and all sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>sequent times, the plaintiff \u201cdenied that either consideration of its protest by the Commissioner or the granting of a hearing by him was required by any provision of the General Laws of the Commonwealth or that 'G. L. c. 30A [the State Administrative Procedure Act] applied to the hearing. \u2019\u2019 In his decision the Commissioner found the defendant\u2019s name to be \u201cproper\u201d and reaffirmed his prior approval. The plaintiff did not seek judicial review of the decision. On February 11, 1964, the plaintiff brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The defendant in an answer and counterclaim alleged that the plaintiff in appearing before the Commissioner had elected to seek administrative relief and in failing to seek judicial review of the resulting administrative decision had thus lost its right to attack collaterally on any grounds the defendant\u2019s use of the name. In a memorandum of law, order for decree, and interlocutory decree the trial judge ruled that the Commissioner was the proper party to hear and pass upon the plaintiff\u2019s protest of the defendant\u2019s name, and that the hearing \u201cwas an adjudicatory proceeding within the confines of Chapter 30A, Sect. 1 (1).\u201d He ruled further that the plaintiff had failed to seek a timely review and that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedy applied, resulting in a lack of jurisdiction in the Superior Court to entertain the plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief under G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff might be entitled to independent relief based on unfair competition and general equitable principles and that the plaintiff might seek relief on those grounds. The case was reported to us by the trial judge on the interlocutory decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">1. The requirements regarding the assumption of a name by a new corporation are set out in G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>(a) The first question which we consider involves the identity of the authorities which are to be charged with passing upon a name proposed by an applicant insurance company for itself. General Laws c. 155, \u00a7 9, conveys broad power to the Secretary regarding approval of corporate names. It is argued by the defendant that, since the proviso of that section which requires prior written approval by the Commissioner of a name of a corporation \u201cformed for the purpose of acting as an insurance agent, insurance broker, or adjuster of fire losses\u201d fails to specifically include \u201cinsurance' companies,\u201d they are thereby excluded from the control of the Secretary with regard to approval of their names. But, as the plaintiff points out, when the amendment to G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9 (St. 1963, c. 59),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>acted the names of insurance companies were already subject to the Commissioner\u2019s prior written approval under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49, as it then read and now reads. *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Corporations doing the business of agents, brokers and adjusters were not formed under G-. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49, and the effect of the proviso added to c. 155, \u00a7 9, was simply to establish the requirement of approval of their names by both the Commissioner and the Secretary, as was already required for insurance companies. It is our view that but for this additional review by the Commissioner the procedures for the approval of a corporate name are the same for all types of insurance companies as for any other corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 49, dealing with the formation of insurance companies, wholly incorporates the provisions of c. 155, \u00a7 9, \u201cexcept as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.\u201d Chapter 175, \u00a7 49, reaffirms establishment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>c. 155, \u00a7 9, of the requirement of approval of the insurance companies\u2019 names by the Secretary. The trial judge interpreted \u201cthe interplay\u201d of these two statutes as follows: \u201cIt would appear . . . that the legislature intended that insurance companies are \u2018to be removed from the category of other corporations specifically as far as control of the name is concerned. \u2019 An interpretation other than that which substitutes the Commissioner for the Secretary throughout the provisions of Sect. 9 . . . would result in a most unusual division of authority.\u201d We cannot agree with this construction of the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The express legislative language necessary to permit such a construction is absent from G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49. <em>Elmer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>304 Mass. 194, 197. See <em>Rizzuto </em>v. <em>Onset Cafe, Inc. </em>330 Mass. 595, 597-598. That the Legislature has provided in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49, for the approval of the Commissioner as one of the requirements in the formation of an insurance company should not be construed as an ouster of the Secretary from his function of approving corporate names under c. 155, \u00a7 9. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 49, indeed itself lends strength to this interpretation. The net effect is thus to require, in the case of the names of insurance companies, written approval of the Commissioner prior to, and as well as, the approval of the Secretary. That the Secretary retains statutory control of the proceedings is further indicated in the provision of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49, which calls upon the Commissioner to execute a certificate of his findings on articles of organization submitted to him and to attach it to those articles prior to their filing with the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">(b) The second question confronting us relates to the identity of the official charged with holding a hearing upon the protest of a name approved by both the Secretary and the Commissioner. Under G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9, there is a detailed procedure available for the challenging of an approved name. The hearing there described is to be before the Secretary and \u201cwithin thirty days of the date when the certificate or articles of organization of <em>any </em>corporation are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>filed ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Our interpretation that Gr. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49, does not remove insurance companies from the requirements of Gr. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9, is consistent with this phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The defendant does not deny that it is the province of the Secretary to hold this type of hearing for all other corporations. The issue involved in a hearing on an insurance company name will not be appreciably different from that for any other corporation. It will not require a skill peculiar to the Commissioner or lacldng in the Secretary. We, therefore, see no practical reason to strain toward acceptance of the interpretation proposed by the defendant and adopted by the trial judge. Procedures are established for the hearing before the Secretary in the second paragraph of Gr. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9. It is unreasonable to assume that, with this provision at hand as a model, our Legislature would have wholly failed to make some careful and similar provision in Gr. L. c. 175 regarding the procedures for a hearing to be held before the Commissioner if, as the judge stated, the Legislature had in fact \u201cintended that insurance companies . . . \u2018. . . be removed from the category of other corporations specifically as far as control of the name is concerned. \u2019 \u201d See <em>Elmer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>304 Mass. 194, 197. No \u201cunusual division of authority\u201d results from this interpretation. General Laws c. 155, \u00a7 9, intends that the Secretary have the responsibility for the conduct of all hearings involving corporate names.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">(c) Thus the Secretary was in error in stating that he had no jurisdiction to hear the protest of the plaintiff. The hearing before the Commissioner was a nullity and the decision is void. Since that is so, the plaintiff lost no rights in failing, under G. L. c. 30A, to seek judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. We therefore do not consider the question of failure by the plaintiff to exhaust its administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">2. Under G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9, the Superior Court is explicitly given jurisdiction to enjoin a corporation \u201cfrom doing business under a name assumed in violation of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>provision of this section, although articles of organization . . . may have been approved and filed and a certificate of incorporation issued.\u201d This jurisdiction exists in the instant case. We are not presently concerned with the effect on that jurisdiction of a challenge to the approval of a name, a hearing before the Secretary, a failure to seek judicial review of his adverse decision, and then a subsequent proceeding in equity under Gr. L. e. 155, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor do we pass on whether, in the instance of a hearing and timely petition for review to the Superior Court, the proceeding in the Superior Court would be de nova. See <em>First Natl. Stores </em>v. <em>First Natl. Liquor Co. </em>316 Mass. 538, 539; <em>Union Oyster House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hi Ho Oyster House, Inc. </em>316 Mass. 543, 544; <em>Monroe Stationers &amp; Printers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Munroe Stationers, Inc. </em>332 Mass. 278, 279. We hold only that in this instance the plaintiff may properly proceed under Gr. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9, to challenge in a de nova proceeding the Commissioner\u2019s and the Secretary\u2019s approvals of the defendant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">3. The trial judge ruled that the plaintiff might proceed to be heard upon those prayers for relief based upon general equitable principles and G-. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">(a) The considerations involved in an application of Gr. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9, are not identical with those involved in an application of Gr. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A. The Secretary, under c. 155, \u00a7 9, considers only the abstract likelihood or possibility of one name being mistaken for another because of literal similarity, and a court acting under the same statute can do no more. Under Gr. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A, however, whether or not the names in the abstract appear so similar or likely to be mistaken one for the other as to warrant an injunction under Gr. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9, the court may still proceed to determine whether the location or the manner of the use of the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>name may result in \u201cinjury to business reputation or . . . dilution of the distinctive quality of a trade name\u201d and grant an injunction. The proceedings under GL L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A, are more broadly based than those under GL L. c. 155, \u00a7 9. See <em>First Natl. Stores </em>v. <em>First Natl. Liquor Co. </em>316 Mass. 538, 541, 542. See also <em>Union Oyster House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hi Ho Oyster House, Inc. </em>316 Mass. 543, 547; <em>Healer </em>v. <em>Bloomberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 476, 477-478; <em>Jays Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay-Originals Inc. </em>321 Mass. 737, 738, 740; <em>Monroe Stationers &amp; Printers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Munroe Stationers, Inc. </em>332 Mass. 278, 281-282; <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Food Fair, Inc. </em>177 F. 2d 177, 185 (1st Cir.). We hold that the plaintiff may proceed under both c. 155, \u00a7 9, and c. 110, \u00a7 7A.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">(b) We now consider whether, in addition to the above two statutory remedies, the plaintiff still has a common law remedy under general equitable principles. We hold that it does. Chapter 110, \u00a7 7A (St. 1947, c. 307), is not the exclusive prescription of remedies for unfair competition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cases which have dealt with this section have not determined that it preempts the field of unfair competition. They have indicated rather that the section has widened and clarified one area of unfair competition and is to an extent a supplement to common law rights. <em>Healer </em>v. <em>Bloomberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 476, 477-478. <em>Jays Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay-Originals Inc. </em>321 Mass. 737, 742. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>National Merchandizing Corp. </em>335 Mass. 658, 665-666. <em>Great Scott Food Mkt. Inc. </em>v. <em>Sunderland Wonder, Inc. </em>348 Mass. 320, 323. Certain other cases need not be read as indicating that c. 110, \u00a7 7A, designates exclusive successors to all of the equitable grounds for relief against unfair competition. <em>Skil Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>337 Mass. 485, 488-491. <em>Esquire, Inc. </em>v. <em>Esquire Slipper Mfg. Co. Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>139 F. Supp. 228, 232-233 (D. Mass.). See <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Food Fair, Inc. </em>177 F. 2d 177,185 (1st Cir.); <em>Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby </em>v. <em>Libby, 103 </em>F. Supp. 968, 970 (D. Mass.).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">. It is true, as was noted in <em>Skill Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>337 Mass. 485, 489, that the legislative history sheds little light upon the purpose of c. 110, \u00a7 7A. It is our view, however, that it is a statutory declaration and clarification of a portion of the extant common law of unfair competition but that it does not preclude the court\u2019s granting of consistent common law remedies to a plaintiff who seeks them.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">4. The interlocutory decree is therefore to be modified so as to permit the plaintiff\u2019s suit under Gr. L. c. 155, \u00a7 9, to proceed, and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> General Laws c. 155, \u00a7 9 (as amended through St. 1964, e. 484, \u00a7 1), reads: \u201cA corporation organized under the general laws may assume any name which, in the judgment of the secretary, indicates that it is a corporation; but it shall not assume the name or trade name of another corporation established under the laws of the commonwealth, or of a corporation, firm, association or person carrying on business in the commonwealth, at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>of incorporation or change of name of the corporation assuming any such name or within three years prior thereto, or assume a name so similar thereto or a name which is under reservation for another or proposed corporation under the laws of the commonwealth as to be likely to be mistaken for it, except with the written consent of the said existing corporation, firm or association or of such person previously filed with the secretary; provided, however, that the name of any corporation formed for the purpose of acting as an insurance agent, insurance broker, or adjuster of fire losses shall be subject to the prior written approval of the commissioner of insurance. The supreme judicial or superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity, upon the application of any person interested or affected, to enjoin such corporation from doing business under a name assumed in violation of any provision of this section, although articles of organization or articles of amendment may have been approved and filed and a certificate of incorporation issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">' \u2018 If within thirty days of the date when the certificate or articles of organization of any corporation are filed in the office of the state secretary any corporation or person in whose name a corporate name is under reservation, or any other corporation established under the laws of the commonwealth, or a corporation, firm, association or person carrying on business in the commonwealth at the time when such certificate or articles are so filed, or within three years prior thereto, shall protest in writing to the secretary that the name under reservation, or the name assumed by the corporation the certificate or articles of organization of which have been so filed is the same as the name or trade name of the party protesting or so similar thereto as to be likely to be mistaken for it, the secretary shall, as soon as reasonably may be, hear the-party protesting and the corporation which assumed the name, giving written notice of the hearing to each. If after the hearing the secretary shall be of the opinion that the assuming of the name violates any provision of this section he shall record a statement withdrawing his approval of said certificate or articles in so far as it or they relate to the name assumed by the corporation, such withdrawal to take effect sixty days from the date of recording. After the expiration of said period of sixty days the corporation shall have- no right to use the name assumed and may be enjoined from doing business under such name by the supreme judicial or superior court upon application of the attorney general or any person interested or affected.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\"> Chapter 59 reads: \u2018 \u2018 The first paragraph of section 9 of chapter 155 of the General Laws, as appearing in section 9 of chapter 750 of the acts of 1962, is hereby amended by inserting after the word 'secretary, in line 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the words: \u2014 ; provided, however, that the name of any corporation formed for the purpose of acting as an insurance agent, insurance broker, or adjuster of fire' losses shall be subject to the prior written approval of the commissioner of insurance. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 49 (as amended through St. 1963, e. 848, \u00a7 7), reads: \u201cThe company shall be formed in the manner described in and be subject to section nine of chapter one hundred and fifty-five, and sections six, eight to twelve, inclusive, and fourteen of chapter one hundred and fifty-six, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u201cThe name of the corporation shall be subject to approval by the commissioner and shall contain the word \u2018insurance\u2019 or \u2018assurance\u2019 or, if organized on the mutual plan, the words \u2018mutual insurance\u2019 or \u2018mutual assurance\u2019 or, if organized under the fifteenth clause of section forty-seven, the word \u2018 reinsurance \u2019, and, if organized under the sixteenth clause of said section forty-seven or under the sixth and sixteenth clauses thereof, the word \u2018life\u2019 or if organized under the eighteenth clause of said section forty-seven the words \u2018 variable annuity. \u2019. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u201cThe president, secretary and a majority of the directors shall execute and make oath to the articles of organization specified in section ten of said chapter one hundred and fifty-six, which shall, with the records and by-laws of the company, be submitted to the commissioner instead of to the commissioner of corporations and taxation, and he shall have the powers and perform the duties relative thereto specified in section eleven of said chapter one hundred and fifty-six; provided, that the commissioner shall not approve the articles of organization of a company formed to transact business under any of the clauses of section forty-seven until he is satisfied, by such examination as he may make and such evidence as he may require, that the incorporators are of good repute and intend in good faith to operate the company.
