The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both indictments. The defendant was sentenced to serve concurrent terms of from seven to ten years on the manslaughter indictment and from two and one-half to three years on the other indictment. He has appealed under the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. The case is here on a summary of the record, a transcript of the evidence, and assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The material evidence consisted of testimony of one Cap-pellano, a person present during the events which led to the indictments, one Connolly, a police sergeant, one Gravel, a ballistician, and a statement which the defendant had made to the police. Cappellano testified that on the evening of October 10, 1964, he was present together with the defendant, Dennis Mahoney (the deceased), and one O\u2019Toole, in an abandoned house in South Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">He first stated that he could not remember whether the defendant was drinking but later in response to the following question, \u201cYou want to leave it that you are the only one that was drinking?\u201d he answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d While all were present in the kitchen he heard a gunshot, turned around and saw the deceased fall to the floor. The defendant was bending over the deceased but Cappellano didn\u2019t \u201cremember seeing anything in . . . [the defendant\u2019s] hand.\u201d The deceased was bleeding, and a cab was called to take him to a hospital. He died as a result of the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Connolly testified that sometime after the shooting he went to Cappellano\u2019s residence where he had Cappellano empty all the trash barrels. A gun in a paper bag was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>found in one of the barrels. The gun was turned over to the ballistician who testified that the bullet which was found in the head of the deceased was fired from that gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The statement of the defendant, which was made to the police four days after the shooting, was read to the jury by one Stapleton, a stenographer. In this statement the defendant said that he found a gun in the cellar of the house, knew it was loaded, and did not remove the bullets. He kept the gun in his hand and carried it upstairs to the kitchen. He said that while in the Idtchen \u201cI had the gun and went to turn around. I was going to pull the trigger and shoot it in the wall, and the kid stepped in front of it, and that is all I remember. He fell, and I yelled, and I said, \u2018I shot him,\u2019 and he fell. He stepped right in front of it. It was accidental. I got down and felt his heart, and the next thing we called a cab and took him to the hospital. \u2019 \u2019 He said that everyone had been drinking and when asked what his condition was that night \u201cas far as sobriety\u201d said, \u2018 \u2018 Pretty well gone. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">1. Assignments 2, 9, and 10 relate to the admission in evidence of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police and the denial of his motions to suppress that evidence. The defendant argues that the statement was obtained during a police custodial interrogation without the benefit of counsel being present, and thus he was denied his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">During the defendant\u2019s interrogation the following colloquy took place. Q. \u201cI am going to ask you some questions concerning the shooting of one Dennis Mahoney sometime Saturday night, October 10th. You don\u2019t have to answer any of my questions. You understand that?\u201d A. \u201cI will answer them.\u201d Q. \u201cDo you understand that the questions I ask you and the answers you give me will be testified to in Court in the event you become a defendant. Do you understand that?\u201d A. \u201cYes.\u201d Q. \u201cAnd in all probability you will become a defendant in this case. You also are entitled to have an attorney here if you wish. Do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>you understand that?\u201d A. \u201cYes.\u201d Q. \u201cDo you want to have an attorney here?\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d Q. \u201cNow that you have been informed of your rights, do you still desire to answer my questions?\u201d A. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">If the standards in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 473, were applicable to this case we would be compelled to reverse the judgment. \u201cIn order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent of his rights under this system . . ., it is necessary to warn him not only that he has the right to consult with an attorney, <em>but also that if he is indigent a laivyer will be appointed to represent him. </em>Without this additional warning, the admonition of the right to consult with counsel <em>would often be understood as meaning only that he can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The warning given to the defendant fell short of these requirements. The defendant\u2019s statement that he did not have a lawyer cannot be taken as an effective waiver of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U. S. 719, 721, the court held that the <em>Miranda </em>case \u2018 \u2018 applies only to cases in which the trial began after . . . [June 13, 1966].\u201d The trial of the instant case began on January 26, 1966, and thus the rules of <em>Miranda </em>are not required, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, to be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">According to the <em>Johnson </em>case this defendant had no Federal constitutional right to receive the additional instruction from the police that he was entitled to have a lawyer appointed if he could not afford to hire one. Whether to apply the <em>Miranda </em>rule retroactively as a matter of Federal constitutional law was not left to the discretion of the States; but it was left to the discretion of the States to decide whether a State\u2019s own law required adoption of <em>Miranda </em>type rules and to what extent such rules should apply. The court in the <em>Johnson </em>case, <em>supra, </em>733, said, \u201cOf course, States are still entirely free to effectuate under their own law stricter standards than those we have laid down and to apply those standards in a broader range of cases than is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>required by this decision.\u201d We are not inclined to do so, nor is there any law in this Commonwealth which requires us to do so. Other State courts have done likewise. <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>State, </em>280 Ala. 16, 25. <em>Parson </em>v. <em>State, </em>8 Storey [Del.] , <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>35 Ill. 2d 311, 319. <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>4 Mich. App. 604, 606-610. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cade, </em>268 N. C. 438, 441. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheeks, </em>423 Pa. 67, 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">It may be argued that we have heretofore applied newly announced principles of Federal constitutional law to cases before us in regular course for decision even though the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States creating those principles had been handed down subsequent to the trials of such cases (e.g. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>343 Mass. 703, 706-707; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>348 Mass. 7, 11; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guerro, </em>349 Mass. 277, 280-281; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerrigan, </em>349 Mass. 295, 298) and that we should continue to do so. But the decisions in those cases were based on the assumption that the Federal Constitution required at least such limited retroactivity. In <em>Dirring, petitioner, </em>344 Mass. 522, 523, which involved a petition for habeas corpus and which was decided before the case of <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, Warden, </em>381 U. S. 618, we said, \u201cRetrospective effect of the <em>Mapp </em>rule is enshrouded in doubt. We do not puzzle as to something which must be, for us, inscrutable.\u201d We held that \u201cno issue as to illegally seized evidence was brought here by an appropriate appellate procedure . . . following the trial of the indictments, \u2019 \u2019 and hence that it was unnecessary to decide the retrospective effect of the <em>Mapp </em>rule. The <em>Linhletter </em>case validated the result in that case by holding that the <em>Mapp </em>case applied only to cases in which the conviction had not become final before the decision of the <em>Mapp </em>case. But the opinions in the <em>Linhletter </em>case, <em>supra, </em>629, and the <em>Johnson </em>case made clear that the Supreme Court of the United States has reserved the general power to decide whether a rule should be given general or limited retrospective effect. Thus, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>is no inherently significant difference between a case before us on collateral attack and one before us in regular course for decision which dictates whether a new Federal rule should be applied retroactively. The fact that the defendant\u2019s convictions in the instant case had not become final on the date of the decision of the <em>Miranda </em>case is irrelevant in the light of the <em>Johnson </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spofford, supra, </em>707, an appeal \u201cbefore us in regular course for decision\u201d will be decided <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> \u2018 </em>on the law as it presently stands. \u2019 \u2019 The law, both Federal and State, as it presently stands, does not confer the benefits of the <em>Miranda </em>case on this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The requirement that a statement made to the police be voluntary has not been altered by the <em>Johnson </em>case, <em>supra, </em>730. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>384 U. S. 737, 740. The judge, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto abate, dismiss and/or [sic] quash,\u201d found that the defendant\u2019s statement was made voluntarily. Evidence of the voluntariness of the statement was taken on voir dire and the judge again ruled that the statement was made voluntarily. The jury also heard evidence of the voluntariness of the statement and were properly instructed by the judge to disregard the statement if they found it was not voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The defendant also argues that his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution were violated because \u201che was illegally arrested and illegally detained in custody before being brought to a Court. . . . His statements were the fruits of the illegal arrest.\u201d The circumstances leading to the defendant\u2019s arrest were as follows. On October 13, 1964, the police spoke to Cappellano and O\u2019Toole who were present at the shooting. Each of them said that the defendant shot the victim. A police teletype went out for the arrest of the defendant for murder. On October 14, one O\u2019Brien telephoned the police stating that the defendant wanted to give himself up, whereupon the police went to a prearranged intersection and made the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">On these facts it is clear that the police had reasonable cause to believe that the defendant had committed a felony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The questioning of the defendant was incident to a valid arrest and the introduction of his statement at the trial did not violate his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>344 Mass. 524, 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">2. Assignment 13. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the manslaughter indictment was properly denied. There was ample evidence from which the jury could have found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was wanton or reckless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, </em>345 Mass. 627, 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The motion for directed verdict on the indictment for unlawful possession of a firearm, under Q-. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, as amended, was also properly denied. Although temporary possession during the actual shooting would not be sufficient under the statute, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, supra, </em>there was evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant carried the gun in the house before the shooting and kept possession of it after the shooting, at least long enough to dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">3. Assignments 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 relate to the alleged prejudicial effect of certain pre-trial publicity. After the defendant had been indicted he filed motions to suppress \u201cthe introduction in evidence of any statement . . . made to [the] police after his arrest . . . because the said arrest was made in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights . . . [under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution].\u201d After a hearing, a judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for specifications relating to the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress. He filed \u201cFindings and Order Re: Commonwealth\u2019s Motion for Specifications.\u201d The defendant asserts in his brief that \u201c [t]hese were received . . . with an avalanche of publicity in all media of communication. It was reported in direct quotes that the District Attorney publicly praised the decision and that he was going to send the decision all over the country. . . . \"Whether it was intentional or not, this was tampering with potential jurors, the readers and listeners and viewers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Suffolk County.\u201d This sweeping characterization is, at the very least, an extravagant exaggeration.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The so called \u201cavalanche of publicity in all media of communication\u201d consisted of articles in several newspapers in which the judge\u2019s decision was reported.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s name and nature of the charge against him were mentioned in the newspaper articles only by way of background.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is true, as we said in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>349 Mass. 786, 788, that \u201cprejudicial trial publicity generated or disseminated outside the court room [is an] . . . evil of growing magnitude [and] has been deplored in decisions of ours and of the Supreme Court of the United States. See, for example, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geagan, </em>339 Mass. 487, 501; <em>Sandrelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>342 Mass. 129,138; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crehan, </em>345 Mass. 609; <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, Warden, </em>366 U. S. 717; <em>Rideau </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U. S. 723.\u201d To this list should be added <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U. S. 532, and <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>384 U. S. 333. It seems clear to us that the concern of the press in the instant case was not with the guilt or innocence of the defendant, nor with the circumstances of the alleged crime, but rather with a novel ruling of law reflecting a community concern over recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. The most liberal reading of <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>384 U. S. 333, cited by the defendant, does not support his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of a denial of dne process as a result of pre-trial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"pAIQ\">In accordance with the foregoing there was no error in the denial of the motion to \u201cabate, dismiss and/or [sic] quash the indictments\u201d; refusing to admit four clippings<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as exhibits at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress certain evidence; denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas of not guilty, in order to consider his motion to \u201cabate, dismiss and/or [sic] quash the indictments \u2019 \u2019; the manner in which the judge questioned the jury about whether they had \u201cread anything in any newspapers relating to this ease, or . . . [had] heard any radio broadcast or heard or seen any television broadcast relating to this case\u201d; the refusal of the judge to question the jury specifically on whether they had seen any of the publicity given to the decision granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for specifications <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ladetto, </em>349 Mass. 237, 245); the refusal of the judge to allow the defendant\u2019s challenge to all the jurors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geagan, </em>339 Mass. 487, 499, 500, 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">4. Assignments 14 and 15. During his closing argument the defendant\u2019s counsel commented on the failure of the Commonwealth to call Lieutenant Sherry, the police officer whose interrogation of the defendant had been introduced in evidence. Upon the objection of the Commonwealth the judge said, <em>\" </em>[Y] ou cannot comment on the failure of the Commonwealth to call a witness who was equally available to you and was in Court.\u201d The defendant excepted to that ruling and moved for a mistrial. He argues that he \u2018 \u2018 can fairly comment in his argument on the failure of the Commonwealth, which has the burden of proof, to produce a witness who can testify on the subject of the in-custody cross-examination of the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>311 Mass. 213, 222, we said, \u201cIt is frequently held that where a witness is equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>available to either party no inference can be drawn against either for not calling him. . . . But there is no hard and fast rule to that effect. Whether an inference can be drawn from the failure to call witnesses necessarily depends, as with inferences generally, upon the posture of the particular case and the state of the evidence.\u201d There is no indication that Lieutenant Sherry would have given testimony that would be detrimental to the Commonwealth\u2019s case or helpful to the defendant. The judge did not err in ruling that no inference could be drawn from the failure of the Commonwealth to call him.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">There is no merit in the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s remark \u201cwas unfair comment on the defendant\u2019s availing himself of his constitutional right to rest on the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d The judge adequately instructed the jury on this point.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">5. Assignments 6,11, and 12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At various times during the trial there were heated exchanges between the prosecution and defence lawyers. The only relevant argument made by the defendant here is that these exchanges may have \u201cincite[d] jury and judge to convict the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In so far as the jury may have heard any of these remarks, the judge promptly instructed the jury to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">6. Assignments 16, 17, and 18 relate to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. The defendant requested the judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>distinguish between momentary and temporary possession; to state that \u201cthe harm resulting is not to be a factor in their determination but rather the conduct that caused the harm\u201d; and \u201cto consider . . . the relationship of the dead man to the parties.\u201d \u201c [I]t has been held that a person who handles a dangerous weapon in such a manner as to make the killing or physical injury of another a natural and probable result of such conduct can be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, although he did not contemplate such a result. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>157 Mass. 551, 552-553.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bouvier, </em>316 Mass. 489, 494-495. The judge\u2019s instruction adequately covered the law of manslaughter and unlawful carrying of a firearm <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and it was not necessary for him to instruct the jury as requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> 222 Atl. 2d 326, 333-334.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> The focus of the publicity was on the closing parts of the decision in which he said, \u201cThere is a growing feeling that the pendulum of the law has swung in favor of the defendant. Lest it swing too far, it might be well to pause and reflect from time to time concerning the rights of the public. It is difficult to disagree with the statement of. Justice Frankfurter who said, \u2018As good a test as .any of a civilized society is the treatment accorded those accused of crime.\u2019 But this thesis could well constitute \u2018mocking rhetoric\u2019 unless the law with equal zeal protects the public as well.\u201d The articles also referred to the \u201cunprecedented\u201d nature of the decision and to the concern of the judge that a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d on the part of the defendant might be invited if the court did not have \u201cdiscretionary power to permit the prosecution to inquire preliminarily by way of a motion for specifications .as to the basis of the allegation of unlawful conduct on the part of law enforcement officers. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> In a typical example the article in one newspaper, on the front page, stated that \u201c[the judge\u2019s] comments were in a written reply to cross-motions by defense counsel and prosecution concerning suppression of certain evidence in a Suffolk County manslaughter case.\u201d On page 26 the newspaper article continued, \u201c [The counsel for the defendant,] charged with fatally shooting . . .

The Defendant in a criminal ease cannot be compelled to testify at his trial. He may testify if he elects, but, if he doesn\u2019t choose to, he may not testify; and, if he exercises that right not to testify, as this Defendant did, no inference unfavorable to the Defendant can be drawn by the jury by reason of his failure to testify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b551-11\"> Assignment 12 relates to the qualifications of a ballistieian who was permitted to answer a question to which the defendant excepted.
