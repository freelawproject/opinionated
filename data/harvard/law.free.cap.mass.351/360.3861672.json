[a hole] one-half to one inch wide, four to five inches long, and one-half to one inch deep, with a piece of metal protruding along the length of said hole \u2019 <em>\u2019; </em>also that the \u2018 \u2018hole\u201d had been there for at least three weeks. The defendant\u2019s starter, its porter, and its station repairman testified that they examined the stairway immediately or shortly after the alleged accident \u201cand that there was no hole or other defect in the stairway.\u201d Confirmatory testimony was given by the defendant\u2019s maintenance man. The judge took a view.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The judge granted the defendant\u2019s request 1, that \u201cOn all the evidence the plaintiff has not sustained the burden of proof of showing a defect on the stairs at the point where she fell and there must be a finding for the Defendant.\u201d There is nothing in the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the granting of this request. Consistent with his action on this request, the judge ruled, on the plaintiff\u2019s request 5, that there was evidence that the defendant was negligent and, on the plaintiff\u2019s request 1, that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding for the plaintiff, but he noted that such a finding was \u201cnot required on facts found. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The judge, however, acted inconsistently on at least one other request. He denied the plaintiff\u2019s request 4: \u201c There is evidence that the alleged defect as described by the plaintiff as having caused her fall had been in existence for an unreasonable length of time.\u201d He granted the defendant\u2019s request 2: \u201cThe so-called \u2018hole\u2019 described by the plaintiff does not constitute a legal defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The duty of the judge to show beyond doubt that he is resolving the case on factual issues, if such is his intention, has been reiterated. See, for example, <em>Liberatore </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>315 Mass. 538, 542. Failure in specification and clarity unnecessarily imposes a burden on this court, and extends the date when final judgment may be entered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s intent in request 4 was, we assume, to ask for the ruling that on the evidence three weeks could have been found to be an unreasonable time to allow the existence of a hole such as had been described. Such a ruling should have been given. It was necessarily involved in the ruling that there was evidence of negligence. The wording of request 4 was such, however, that, given without a qualifying notation, it could have b\u00e9en understood to import the finding that the defect existed at the time of the fall. \u201c [W]here a request assumes a disputed fact, instead of stating it hypothetically, the party presenting the request goes beyond his right to a ruling of law, and asks also an implied finding of fact which the judge is not required to make. ... A judge is not bound in a trial without jury to correct or perfect a request, but may deal with it as presented.\u201d <em>Liberatore </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>315 Mass. 538, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We think, however, that the defendant\u2019s request 2, though not in terms hypothetical, can reasonably be construed only as a ruling that such a hole as described could not be found to be an actionable defect. It was error to give this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The basis for the trial judge\u2019s finding for the defendant does not reasonably appear from his rulings. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>315 Mass. 54, 57. Compare <em>Brodeur </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>315 Mass. 527, 530, where the judge had made a \u201cpainstaking analysis of the facts\u201d with \u201cspecial numbered findings on points deemed important.\u201d The judge did nothing of that kind in this case. We cannot be sure that the basis for granting the defendant\u2019s request 1 (\u201cthe plaintiff has not sustained the burden of proof of showing a defect on the stairs\u201d) did not lie in the granting of the defendant\u2019s request 2, notwithstanding the well understood difference between a \u201cdefect\u201d and a \u201clegal defect.\u201d- Compare <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>315 Mass. 54, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> This case was entered on February 6, 1956.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
