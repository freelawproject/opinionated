There was evidence that the petitioner was seventy-six years old and in 1914 he had come to the United States from Poland. In 1928 he went with Anna Kuss to a lawyer of \u201cPolish extraction\u201d to \u201cmake the agreement\u201d concerning the premises in question and the petitioner spoke to the lawyer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Polish. He told the lawyer that he was buying the property \u201cso that'it would be him and her.\u2019\u2019 The property was purchased by a deed dated June 19, 1928, for the sum of $15,200. Sixty-two hundred dollars was paid in cash, of which sum the petitioner paid $4,600 (which he withdrew from his account in a savings bank) and Anna Kuss paid $1,600. \u201c[T]hey both assumed a mortgage for $9,000 to make the $15,200. The petitioner testified that \u201c [t]here was talk and understanding that if he [the petitioner] died she [Anna Kuss] would get the property.\u201d After the purchase Anna lived in a tenement on the property with her mother. The petitioner also lived there. He managed the property, and paid for repairs, taxes, insurance and other costs of maintenance out of his own funds. Anna died in December, 1961. John Reder, a nephew of both the petitioner and Anna Kuss, testified that shortly before she died, Anna Kuss told him that she said to the petitioner, \u201cAfter I am gone, the house is yours,\u201d and \u201cYou will have both houses when I am gone and you will have the social security to take care of yourself.\u201d Various relatives of Anna Kuss offered testimony which was inconsistent with the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u25a0 The judge found that the petitioner \u201cwas certain in his own mind that having both names on the deed was all that was sufficient to insure having the property pass to him if Anna Kuss died, and that she believed the same thing.\u201d The judge further found that \u201cthere was a mutual mistake, made by non-English speaking, uneducated immigrants, who, in many respects, acted like a married couple, and both of them expected to become sole owner of the property if the other died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The respondents contend that the findings of the judge are incorrect, and that \u201cthere is not an iota of evidence that Anna Kuss thought she was entering into any agreement other than that set out in the deed.\u201d We are of opinion that the evidence supports the findings of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The respondents also contend that \u201cthe lower Court was in error as a matter of law in admitting extrinsic evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>to vary, alter and contradict the terms of a complete and integrated written instrument, thus violating the parol-evi-dence rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In <em>Goode </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>153 Mass. 585, 587, Mr. Justice Holmes said, \u201c [I]t is settled, at least in equity, that this particular kind of paroi evidence, that is to say, evidence of mutual mistake as to the meaning of the words used, is admissible \u2019 \u2019 to show \u201cthat neither party has purported or been understood to express assent to the conveyance as it stands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201c [T]he reformation of instruments that fail to express the agreement and intention of the parties\u201d is \u201ca familiar branch of equity jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>297 Mass. 509, 512. <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>[A] mistake in the legal effect of a description in a deed, or in the use of technical language, may be relieved against, upon proper proof.\u201d <em>Canedy </em>v. <em>Marcy, </em>13 Gray, 373, 377. <em>Stockbridge Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Hudson Iron Co. </em>107 Mass. 290, 319. <em>Holdsworth </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>143 Mass. 369, 375. <em>Goode </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>153 Mass. 585, 587. <em>Franz </em>v. <em>Franz, </em>308 Mass. 262, 266.
