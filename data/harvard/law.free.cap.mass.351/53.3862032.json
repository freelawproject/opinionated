The plaintiff Michael P. Brauer is the seven year old son of the plaintiff Marie Brauer. Michael and his mother have resided together in Boston since Michael\u2019s birth in 1957. The defendant publishes the Boston Globe, a newspaper widely circulated in Boston and throughout the Commonwealth. Sometime in November of 1962, the defendant sent a reporter and a photographer to interview the plaintiffs at their home \u201crelative to the unfortunate financial circumstances in which they found themselves with . . . Christmas . . . approaching.\u201d The interview was to be used in the defendant\u2019s \u201cGlobe Santa\u201d articles, \u201can annual series appearing in the . . . [Globe] for several years prior to 1962, and in subsequent years to the present, designed to raise money and gifts for needy children and their families.\u201d Marie \u201cconsented to . . . [the] interview . . . provided that their actual names and addresses were not used.\u201d The defendant\u2019s representative then photographed Michael \u201cin a posed position . . . permission being granted by . . . [his] mother with the understanding that the photograph was to be used only in connection with the said . . . series.\u201d A few weeks later an entire page of photographs, including the one taken of Michael, appeared in the Globe. \u2018 \u2018 [N] eigh-bors of . . . [Marie] and her family were aware of the . . . interview and of the photograph being taken and were able to recognize . . . [its] subject . . . as being\u201d Michael. Subsequently, Marie\u2019s friends and relatives \u201cwere made aware\u201d that the photograph was of Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">On April 2, 1965 (more than two years later), the same photograph was published in the Globe, over a caption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>which read: \u201cHelp for the Mentally Retarded.\u201d It was \u201capparently used to illustrate an article . . . dealing with health and welfare legislation . . . [proposed] by the Governor of the Commonwealth . . ..\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations charge that this publication of the photograph was made falsely and maliciously, without authorization of either plaintiff, and \u201cin violation of the terms of the permission granted\u201d by Marie at the time it was taken; \u201cthat the defendant failed to exercise due diligence to determine whether or not the subject of the photograph . . . was mentally retarded and that . . . [this] failure . . . was reckless ; that the defendant knew, or ought to have known, that the inference to be drawn from the . . . use of the photograph and the accompanying article ... is that the subject of said photograph is mentally retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Affixed to the plaintiffs\u2019 declarations are photostatic copies of the print which appeared in the Globe on both occasions. The photograph is a side view of a six to nine year old boy sitting bent over on a stairway in apparent dejection. His face is turned and, with the exception of one ear and the partial outline of the back of his head, none of his features or facial characteristics is visible. It appears that these areas were purposely obliterated by the publisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Michael\u2019s declaration contains three counts. Count 1 alleges that the defendant\u2019s second publication of the picture was defamatory. \u201cA demurrer to a declaration for libel is not to be sustained unless the words cannot be reasonably understood in a defamatory sense, or, to express it in another way, unless they are incapable of a defamatory meaning. The test is whether, in the circumstances, the writing discredits the plaintiff in the minds of any considerable and respectable class of the community. A publication is defamatory when it tends to injure one\u2019s reputation in the community and to expose him to hatred, ridicule, and contempt, an imputation of crime or of bad character or an injury in one\u2019s office or business not being essential.\u201d <em>Muchnick </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>332 Mass. 304, 305-306, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and cases there cited. <em>Mabardi </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>347 Mass. 411, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The defendant does not contend that the false imputation that a person is mentally retarded does not fall within this definition of a defamatory statement. It does argue, however, that since Michael\u2019s identifying characteristics are obscured in the photograph, nothing defamatory was said of and concerning him. See <em>McCallum </em>v. <em>Lambie, </em>145 Mass. 234; <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>159 Mass. 293. Compare <em>Louka </em>v. <em>Park Entertainments, Inc. </em>294 Mass. 268, 271. Since for the purposes of these appeals the defendant is bound by the allegation that Michael is the person appearing in this photograph, we assume its real contention to be that the declaration is demurrable because no one who had not been otherwise informed of the facts relating to the photograph\u2019s first publication could determine that it depicts Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">This argument is unsound. There is no requirement in an action of libel \u201cthat the defamatory matter be communicated to a large or even substantial group of persons. It is enough that it is communicated to a single individual other than the one defamed.\u201d Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 577. See <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>140 Mass. 425, 426-427; <em>Rummey </em>v. <em>Worthley, </em>186 Mass. 144; <em>Bander </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>313 Mass. 337, 349; Prosser, Torts (3d ed.) \u00a7 108. And if the person is not referred to by name or in such manner as to be readily identifiable from the descriptive matter in the publication, extrinsic facts must be alleged and proved showing that a third person other than the person libeled understood it to refer to him. <em>Golden No. Airways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tanana Publishing Co. </em>218 F. 2d 612, 622 (9th Cir.), and cases cited. \u201cIt is enough that it is so understood even though he is so inaccurately described that it is extraordinary that the communication is correctly understood. \u2019 \u2019 Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 564, comment a. See 33 Am. Jur., Libel and Slander, \u00a7 89, p. 102. Michael\u2019s declaration alleges that \u201cfriends, relatives and former neighbors . . . recognized . . . the plaintiff\u201d in the photograph\u2019s second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>publication, and we cannot on demurrer say, particularly in light of the circumstances of the first publication, that they could not have done so. The demurrer to this count should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Michael\u2019s second count is predicated on the existence of an agreement between Marie and the defendant regarding the use to which the photograph might be put. Laying to one side the question whether a right of action could accrue to Michael under such an agreement, the declaration speaks only of an \u201cunderstanding that the photograph was to be used only in connection with the . . . G-lobe Santa series.\u201d The plaintiff cites no authority \u2014 and we are aware of none \u2014 standing for the proposition that an implied limitation in the terms of a consent to the use of a photograph will, without consideration, support an action of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Michael\u2019s third count is based upon an alleged invasion of his right of privacy. As yet, no case has determined that there exists in this Commonwealth a legally protected right of privacy. See <em>Themo </em>v. <em>New England Newspaper Publishing Co. </em>306 Mass. 54, 58; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>327 Mass. 275; <em>Frick </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>350 Mass. 259. However, while carefully preserving the question whether such a right exists, these decisions have set forth some of the boundaries within which the right, if recognized, would be actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The plaintiff has sought to bring his case within a group of decisions from other jurisdictions which are now generally recognized as holding that \u201c [pjublicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye\u201d is actionable as an invasion of his right of privacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These decisions have held that this right was invaded where the photograph of a taxicab driver was used to illustrate an article on the propensity of such drivers to cheat their customers <em>(Peay </em>v. <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>78 F. Supp. 305 [D. D. C.]); where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>a photograph of a child taken at the scene of an accident in which she was struck by a car was used to illustrate an article on the negligence of pedestrians entitled, \u201cThey Ask to be Killed\u201d <em>(Leverton </em>v. <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>192 F. 2d 974 [3d Cir.]); and where a photograph of some youths living in a slum area was published in connection with an article on juvenile delinquency <em>(Metzger </em>v. <em>Dell Publishing Co. </em>207 Misc. [N. Y.] 182). But for the fact that Michael is not identifiable from the photograph or from the accompanying articles, his case would be indistinguishable from those cited. It seems to us, however, that an invasion of privacy based on \u201cpublicity\u201d which casts the plaintiff \u201cin a false light in the public eye\u201d requires acts which are sufficient in themselves to familiarize the public with either the name, likeness, or other means of identifying the plaintiff. The declaration does allege, in this regard, that neighbors, friends, and family recognized the photograph as that taken of Michael and as that first appearing in the Globe Santa series. However, this recognition by a small group of intimates, familiar not only with the subject but with the circumstances under which the photograph was taken, falls short of the kind of publicity upon which an action for the invasion of privacy, if acknowledged to exist, would have to be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">For this same reason the demurrer to Marie\u2019s declaration, also based on an invasion of privacy, was rightly sustained. We might note, moreover, that our decision in <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>327 Mass. 275, 278, casts serious doubt upon the proposition that a cause of action may accrue to anyone other than the immediate victim of an invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The order sustaining the demurrer in the action brought by Marie is affirmed. In the action brought by the minor plaintiff the order sustaining the demurrer on the first count is reversed; on the second and third counts it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\"> See Prosser, Privacy, 48 Cal.
