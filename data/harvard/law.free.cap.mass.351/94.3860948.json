The petition avers that Nason was in-dieted for murder on September 12, 1962, and was committed to Bridgewater State Hospital (Bridgewater) under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 100.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to subsequent Superior Court orders Nason was transferred to Medfield Stat\u00e9 Hospital and later was again confined at Bridgewater. The petition asked for a writ ordering the Commissioner to make available to Nason proper care and treatment at Bridgewater \u201cincluding a psychiatric staff and [necessary] medical and therapeutic facilities \u2019 \u2019 or, if the Commissioner is unable to do so, to make proper care and treatment available to Nason by transferring him to another State hospital having a psychiatric staff and' medical and therapeutic facilities adequate to furnish Nason proper care and treatment and, if necessary, to provide at such other hospital maximum security facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The general allegations of the petition that Bridgewater is unable to furnish its patients the treatment required for them <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are supported by the inclusion in the petition of the testimony of several physicians taken in the course of proceedings in 1963 brought by Nason in respect of his transfer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Assuming as we must for purposes of the demurrer that the conditions at Bridgewater are as described in the petition, it cannot be said that the Commissioner is refusing to carry out the duties of. his office. What Nason asks is. that we order the Commissioner to increase the staff and the facilities at Bridgewater and to make them comparable to the staff and facilities at other State hospitals. Even if the means exist, whether, when, and how to do this involve the exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s judgment and discretion. \u201cIt is not the function of a writ of mandamus to require public officers to make a particular decision on a matter within their discretion, . . . and we have no right to substitute our judgment for that of the official upon whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the Legislature has imposed the duty of making a decision.\u201d <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health &amp; Charities of Lawrence, </em>310 Mass. 343, 344. \u201cHere the petition does not seek to compel performance . . of any particular specified official act or acts .... Bather it seeks to have this court institute \u00e1 general investigation of . . . past official conduct ... to order . . . generally in the future . . . [full performance of] duties .... It is not the function of any court to exercise [such] inquisitorial powers . . . over . . . [administrators]. That is the function of another, branch of the government.\u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Dacey, </em>329 Mass. 598, 600-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">For all that is alleged, the Commissioner was doing in 1963 and is now doing, with competence and good judgment, all that is possible' within the funds available and the staff that can be obtained to work at Bridgewater. Even were the inference justified that, having only limited funds and staff, the Commissioner had decided to do more for persons confined in other hospitals (and hence not separately classifiable for the security confinement available at Bridge-water), we could not in these proceedings substitute our judgment for his on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">This case is not like a failure to provide a \u201chouse of correction,\u201d rather than a jail, for confinement of \u201clunatics and mad persons\u201d as shown in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Justices of the Court of Sessions for the County of Hampden, </em>2 Pick. 414, 417. Nor is it like <em>Nickols </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Middlesex County, </em>341 Mass. 13, 27, where it appeared that action of. the county commissioners was in violation of the trusts upon which Walden Pond was held and the command of the writ was \u201cto refrain from further violation . . . and to take action, in orderly course, within the limits of appropriations available from time to time, by replanting, landscaping, and erosion prevention work to reduce the damage already caused . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Wh.eth.er Nason should be transferred by administrative decision and whether security should be increased in parts of other hospitals are likewise for the judgment of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>It would not be ground for an order in mandamus that Nason, or other inmates may, as he argues, be suffering unconstitutional discrimination. There are proceedings, other than mandamus, available to anyone confined, to test the legality and constitutionality of the confinement. See G. L. e. 248; <em>Dowdell, petitioner, </em>169 Mass. 387; <em>Gentile, petitioner, </em>339 Mass. 319; <em>Golden, petitioner, 341 </em>Mass. 672; <em>Maki </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Mass. Correctional Inst. Bridgewater, </em>349 Mass. 519. In such proceedings the constitutionality of great differences in treatment might require judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The alleged inadequacies of care at Bridgewater, assuming they now exist, give ground for most serious concern<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but not for relief in mandamus. We need not decide whether the writ would lie on a showing that, notwithstanding adequate funds and staff, there had been a long continued absence of any of the accepted equipment and procedures for treating the mentally ill. This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\n<em>Order sustaining dermirrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\"> \u201cIf a person under complaint or indictment for any crime . . . is . . . found by the court to be mentally ill or in such mental condition that his commitment to a state hospital is necessary for his proper care or observation pending a determination as to any mental illness, the court may commit him to a state hospital or to the Bridgewater state hospital under such limitations, subject to the provisions of section one hundred and five, as it may order,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\"> <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 That Bridgewater . . . is so understaffed in proportion to its inmate population as not to be able to furnish its patients, including the petitioner, the treatment required so that they may have the opportunity to recover from the various mental illnesses from which they suffer; that Bridgewater . . . does not have the same medical and therapeutic facilities with which all other state hospitals under the jurisdiction of the Department of Mental Health are equipped; that the staff-patient ratio at Bridgewater . . . falls markedly below the standard of all other state hospitals under the jurisdiction of the Department of Mental Health, and that the petitioner, while expressly disclaiming any intention to reflect upon the conscientiousness of the members of the medical and related staffs at . . . Bridgewater ... is unable to receive any treatment for the illness from which he suffers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\"> This testimony showed that in 1963 Bridgewater was \u201cmarkedly understaffed.\u201d It did not then have the six physicians allocated as its \u201cquota in the budget,\u201d but in addition to the director of clinical psychiatry had only two other physicians, neither of whom was able to give psychotherapy. The director\u2019s time was largely taken with court appearances, administrative work, and three staff meetings a week. Most of the State\u2019s mental hospitals were undermanned; even with a staff of six Bridgewater would have been at a marginal level. At that time Bridgewater did not give treatment unless \u201cit\u2019s an emergency.\u201d An effort was made to give treatment as much as possible. Nason was not receiving treatment. Medication had been prescribed and he had refused it. Nason would in the opinion of the physicians benefit from electric shock treatment or insulin therapy which was not provided. At the close of a hearing on December 13, 1963, the judge in the Superior Coqrt said, \u201cOn Dr. Allen\u2019s testimony, Bridgewater isn\u2019t fit for anybody.\u201d The assistant district attorney representing the Commonwealth said, \u201cI agree with you, Tour Honor. It\u2019s a deplorable condition. I believe it should be remedied. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b134-13\"> The respondent\u2019s brief recognizes that the petitioner \u2018' upon being committed to Bridgewater State Hospital, is entitled to care, observation and treatment\u201d and that <em>\u201c </em>[t]his is implicit in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 100 and \u00a7 105.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
