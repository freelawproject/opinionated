At a time on April 6,1964, when his duties involved preparation of the dining car in the yard for service to patrons, he was observed smoldng in an adjacent coach. As a consequence of an altercation with a \u2018\u2018superior employee,\u201d he left the train and went home. Charges were preferred and Strong was discharged on April 24, 1964, after a hearing on April 15, in accordance with an applicable labor agreement between Strong\u2019s union and the railroad. The discharge was upheld upon appeal under the appropriate procedures within the railroad. Strong did not pursue additional administrative remedies available to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Railway Labor Act, 45 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-153 (1964), especially \u00a7 153 (h)-(j). Eventually Strong was replaced by a Negro on the roster of dining car attendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">On June 25, 1964, Strong filed a complaint with the commission (see Gr. L. c. 6, \u00a7 56, as appearing in St. 1963, c. 719, \u00a7 1, and Gr. L. c. 151B) alleging, among other things, \u201cI believe I have received unequal treatment by the . . . [r] ail-road, solely because of my color.\u201d The commission, after a two day hearing, recorded in over 280 pages of stenographic transcript, by unanimous decision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>complaint. It found in outline certain of the facts stated above concerning the discharge and the labor dispute proceedings. In addition, it found only, \u201c6. Of the forty-five persons on the . . . waiters\u2019 roster at the time of . . . [the] altercation, forty-four were Negro. ... 7. The fact that . . . [Strong] is Negro was not a factor in any of the actions ... of the [r] ailroad or any of its employees in its dealings with\u201d Strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Strong then, by a petition filed in the Superior Court, sought judicial review of the commission\u2019s order in accordance with G. L. c. 30A, and c. 151B, \u00a7 6 (as amended through St. 1957, c. 426, \u00a7 5). By final decree the commission\u2019s decision was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The commission appropriately should have made more complete findings of subsidiary facts. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a711 (8), is clearly applicable to the commission, which also is required by c. 151B, \u00a7 5, to \u201cstate its findings of fact.\u201d It would serve no useful purpose, however, to recommit the case to the commission for further subsidiary findings. Cf. e.g. <em>Herson\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 402,407-408; <em>Wannacomet Water Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>346 Mass. 453, 470-471, and cases cited. Examination of the transcript of the hearing before the commission reveals that the commission\u2019s decision was plainly warranted by the diffuse evidence, which provided no substantial basis for any finding of discrimination against Strong based upon color.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\"> In the administrative proceedings within the railroad, one letter to the railroad\u2019s vice-president of operations from Strong\u2019s union representative made a general charge of racial discrimination. This, however, was unsupported by allegation of any specific facts tending to show such discrimination. The vice-president of operations dismissed one charge which involved the question whether Strong or a white supervisor was to be believed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\"> The decision was accompanied by a separate concurring opinion by the commission\u2019s chairman, who (although he discussed certain matters not relevant to Strong\u2019s complaint) correctly stated that the decision did not deal with the correctness of the disposition of \u201cthe labor dispute\u201d but only with \u201cthe issue of the alleged violation under c. 151B.\u201d See G. L. e. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, as respectively amended through St. 1963, e. 197, \u00a7 2, and e. 613, \u00a7 2. The commission, of course, was properly concerned only with whether there had been an \u201cunlawful . . . practice,\u201d based on discrimination because of color, under c. 151B, \u00a7 4, par. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
