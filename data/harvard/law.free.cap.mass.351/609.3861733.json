The decree directed Employers\u2019 Liability Insurance Com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>pony (Employers\u2019) to pay $5,000 to Peters in partial satisfaction of a judgment for $23,516.96 recovered by him against Saulinier. The case is before us upon a report of material facts and of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Peters was injured in an accident on April 11,1959, while a guest passenger in an automobile owned by Mrs. Susan Malaney and operated by Saulinier with Mrs. Malaney\u2019s implied consent. Mrs. Malaney \u201ccould not operate motor vehicles but left . . . use and other details of the . . . vehicle to her husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Employers\u2019 issued a liability policy insuring Mrs. Malaney, among other things, for any payments to guest passengers receiving bodily injuries<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a result of the operation of her automobile with her express or implied consent. Malaney, her husband, had lent the automobile to Saulinier.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Following the accident, Saulinier went to Malaney\u2019s house and left a garage claim check for the automobile. Malaney took the demolished automobile from the garage \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sold it for junk. \u2019 \u2019 Malaney also went to an insurance agency office and filled out what he believed to be an accident report. Later a letter was received from Employers\u2019 that it would represent the Malaneys. Since the accident Malaney had seen Saulinier only once, about 1962, \u201cgoing by [in] the street. \u2019 \u2019 Peters saw Saulinier once four or five months after the accident in court in connection with a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The first formal notice of Peters\u2019 claim against Saulinier and Mrs. Malaney was received by Employers\u2019 about June 23, 1959. This was a letter from Peters\u2019 attorney. No notice was sent by Mrs. Malaney to Employers\u2019 \u201cat any time,\u201d but on September 4, 1959, an investigator for Employers \u2019 saw Mrs. Malaney and obtained from her a supplementary report of the accident<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a \u201cnon-waiver agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ment\u201d under which Mrs. Malaney agreed, in effect, that Employers \u2019, by investigating the accident, was not waiving any rights to disclaim coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Investigators attempted to get in touch with Saulinier and were unsuccessful in doing so until January 17, 1960. Saulinier never gave any notice to Employers\u2019 or communicated with it except when an investigator in January, 1960, finally got in touch with him. On March 16, 1960, Employers\u2019 by letter addressed to 20 Landers Street, Somer-ville, notified Saulinier that it had received an accident report and would investigate it \u201cwithout prejudice to our rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">On April 4,1960, Peters started suit against Mrs. Malaney and Saulinier. Employers\u2019 trial attorneys sent to Sauli-nier a certified mail letter dated January 9, 1963, stating that the case had been \u201ctentatively assigned for trial on January 14, 1963,\u201d and that if Employers\u2019 could not \u201cobtain . . . [his] presence in [c]curt the insurance company . . . [would] refuse to pay any verdict awarded against\u201d him. This letter was addressed to the same Somerville address and was returned by the postal authorities marked \u201caddressee unknown.\u201d On January 10, 1963, an Employers\u2019 investigator talked to Saulinier\u2019s father and mother who gave written statements in substance that Saulinier, \u201c23 years of age and one of twelve children had married in 1961 and moved out of the State and that his whereabouts were unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The case was reached for trial on January 28, 1963. On that day, Employers\u2019 attorney who had previously appeared for Mrs. Malaney and for Saulinier filed, before the trial commenced, a withdrawal of his appearance for Saulinier. By letter dated February 4, 1963, the clerk\u2019s office returned the withdrawal slip marked \u201ccancelled\u201d with a reference to Rule 121 of the Superior Court (1954).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>withdrawal slip is stamped \u201c1963 Jan. 28 Filed in Court. Attest: \"Win. P. Johnston, Assistant Clerk (Hudson, J.).\u201d At the trial of the present suit, Employers\u2019 attorney said to the trial judge, \u201cI did not file the military affidavit because, not knowing where Saulinier was and not knowing anything about his activities, I personally was unable to state on oath that in fact he was not in military service. I had no information ... on which [of] my own knowledge, I could make the affidavit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">An Employers\u2019 attorney tried the case jury-waived. There was (a) a finding in favor of Mrs. Malaney, and (b) a finding for Peters against Saulinier.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">1. The clauses of the insurance policy requiring prompt notice and cooperation were binding upon Saulinier as well as upon Mrs. Malaney. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>330 Mass. 476, 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">2. Saulinier\u2019s failure to give notice of the accident to Employers\u2019 until an investigator found him on January 17, 1960, nine months after the accident, was a violation of the notice provision of the policy. <em>Depot Cafe Inc. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co. </em>321 Mass. 220, 224-225. <em>Brackman </em>v. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>349 Mass. 767, 768. Employers\u2019, of course, did get some earlier notice of the accident through Malaney. Because of our holding with respect to Saulinier\u2019s violation of the cooperation clause, we need not decide whether this notice was for Saulinier\u2019s benefit as well as for the benefit of Mrs. Malaney.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">3. Saulinier\u2019s \u201cdisappearance . . . without notifying the insurer of his new address or furnishing some method by which he could be reached, constitute [d] a lack of cooperation and justifie [d] the insurer in disclaiming liability after it ha[d] failed by reasonable methods to secure the attendance of the insured as a witness at the trial.\u201d <em>Polito </em>v. <em>Galluzzo, </em>337 Mass. 360, 363-364. Cf. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Atlantic Natl. Ins. Co. </em>350 Mass. 181, 182-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">4. An insurer, of course, \u201ccannot be relieved of liability because of an alleged breach of a cooperation clause by the insured in a situation where . . . [the insurer] has not it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>self exercised diligence and good faith. \u2019 \u2019 See <em>Imperiali </em>v. <em>Pica, </em>338 Mass. 494, 498-499. We think that Employers\u2019 (a) by seeking out Saulinier on January 17, 1960, despite his prior failure to give it notice or assistance, and (b) by writing to him on January 9, 1963, and trying to find him at his last known address on January 10, 1963, had exercised due diligence. It then discovered from Saulinier\u2019s parents that even they did not know, or were unwilling to reveal, where their son then was. There is no basis for finding that Employers \u2019 did not act in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">An insurer is not bound to keep in touch with each insured while waiting for a case to be reached on a trial list. It is for the named insured and other insureds who have benefited from the policy\u2019s protection to keep themselves reasonably accessible after an accident in which they have participated. See <em>Polito </em>v. <em>Galluzzo, </em>337 Mass. 360, 362-365. See also <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Lewis, ante, </em>386, 390. Saulinier himself had made it impossible for Employers\u2019 by the utmost diligence to reach him. There is no showing by Peters (who had the burden of establishing Saulinier\u2019s compliance with the policy, see <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Orient Ins. Co. </em>278 Mass. 596, 598-599) that Employers\u2019 or its attorneys could have taken any action in the eighteen days between January 10 and 28, 1963, or earlier, which would have enabled them to reach Saulinier.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Peters\u2019 rights, of course, are derivative from Saulinier, and Employers\u2019 is free to assert any defence against Peters which it could have raised against a claim by Saulinier. See the <em>Polito </em>case, 337 Mass. 360, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">5. It has not been shown that Buie 121 of the Superior Court made ineffective the withdrawal of his appearance for Saulinier which Employers\u2019 attorney purported to make on January 28,1963. The clerk\u2019s indorsement of the appearance withdrawal slip as \u201c [fjiled in [c] curt . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>(Hudson, J.) \u201d imported the trial judge\u2019s approval of the withdrawal. Such approval, if in fact given, under the rule (fn. 3) would seem to have relieved Employers\u2019 attorney from filing a certificate that his client was not in the armed forces. The purported cancellation of the filing stamp was not shown to have been authorized by the trial judge or to have been more than a routine, and perhaps misguided, effort by the cleric to obtain a certificate for the court files. Even if we were to assume that the cancellation had been authorized by the trial judge (or that the filing stamp did not import the granting of leave under Buie 121 to withdraw the appearance), Saulinier himself, by his failure to keep his parents informed of his address, was alone responsible for the inability of Employers\u2019 attorney to make the certificate ordinarily called for by Buie 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Saulinier knew of Employers\u2019 reservation of rights because of its letter to him of March 16, 1960. He is not shown in any way to have been harmed or to have relied to his detriment on any conduct of Employers\u2019 or its counsel. See <em>Lunt </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>261 Mass. 469, 473; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>297 Mass. 341, 343-345; <em>Restighini </em>v. <em>Hanagan, </em>302 Mass. 151, 153-155. Cf. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>344 Mass. 223, 226-229. Peters, of course, had the burden of proof of any waiver by Employers\u2019. See the <em>Bose </em>case at p. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Saulinier\u2019s conduct at all times since the accident, so far as the record shows, indicates a casual and completely indifferent attitude concerning (a) reducing to \u201cjunk\u201d a borrowed automobile, (b) serious injuries to his guest Peters, and (e) the protection of the legitimate interests of the insurer in connection with the liability policy by which, if Saulinier had cooperated fairly, he would have been protected. The record affords no basis for holding Employers \u2019 estopped to disclaim liability, or that there has been a waiver of its right to disclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">6. The final decree is reversed. A new final decree is to be entered dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\"> Saulinier appears to have been an \u201cinsured\u2019 \u2019 under the policy, par. Ill (a), because his \u201cactual use of the . . . vehicle . . . [was] . . . with . . . [Mrs. Malaney\u2019s] permission\u201d or that of her husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\"> In this report, Mrs. Malaney said that the accident had not been \u201creported before\u201d because she \u201c [fjelt there was no need for it.\u201d Otherwise she merely gave April 11, 1959, as the date when she first became aware of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> Rule 121 reads in part: \u201cNo attorney who has appeared for a personal defendant shall withdraw his appearance, leaving his client unrepresented, except upon his filing a certificate setting forth facts showing that his client is not in the armed forces of the United States, or upon leave granted by the court. \u2019 <em>\u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\"> Indeed, in the present proceeding commenced on July 9, 1963, service upon Saulinier was obtained, as the original Superior Court papers show, only by leaving a copy of a second subpoena \u201cat the last and usual place of abode of . . . Saulinier, 20 Landers [S]treet, in Somerville. <em>\u2019 \u2019 </em>There was no proof that he was actually living there or that it remained Ms domicil.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
