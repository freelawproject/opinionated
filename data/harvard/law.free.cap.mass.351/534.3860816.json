One of the bullets entered her right arm and seven entered her abdomen. The defendant was charged with the offence in two indictments, one for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and the other for assault with intent to murder. The jury found him guilty under both indictments. The defendant\u2019s exceptions raise ques-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tians relating to the admission in evidence of certain testimony of two police officers, and to the denial of his motions for directed verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">There was evidence of the following: The shooting occurred in an apartment in Bevere where Carla and the defendant had been living together since August, 1964. The apartment was rented in the name of John Shea, a name which the defendant sometimes used. Carla testified that she had been drinking with the defendant in a Boston barroom early in the evening of March 30, but had left the defendant about 9 p.m. She said she returned home around midnight, was alone in the apartment, and did not know who shot her. A police officer first learned of the shooting when a car driven by Mrs. Joan Boy, who lived in the apartment next to the defendant\u2019s, was seen speeding on the Bevere Beach Boulevard with the horn blowing. He gave chase and overtook the car. He discovered Carla Johnson lying unconscious on the floor of the back seat. An ambulance was called and Carla was taken to a hospital. Police officers went to the defendant\u2019s apartment and found a twenty-two calibre revolver containing eight discharged cartridges. There were bullet holes in the wall and sofa, a spent twenty-two calibre bullet on the floor, and a box of twenty-two calibre cartridges in a drawer. The officers also found a mop which was later determined to have human blood on it. The defendant entered the apartment at about 4 a.m. wearing a white \u201cT-shirt\u201d and dark trousers, and was subsequently taken to the Bevere police station for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">OfficeroParvin and Lieutenant Hurley testified to the defendant\u2019s entrance into the apartment and his subsequent interrogation. The defendant contends that certain portions of each policeman\u2019s testimony were not admissible in evidence, and that the Commonwealth did not therefore produce sufficient evidence to warrant the guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">1. Lieutenant Hurley testified as follows: Several hours after the shooting he interrogated the defendant, who, though not yet booked, was under technical arrest. Hurley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>first advised the defendant of his rights to remain silent and to \u201ccontact counsel,\u201d which the defendant said he understood. Hurley then brought Mrs. Boy into the room.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Boy said she was a neighbor of the defendant, and the defendant confirmed this fact. In the course of questioning by Hurley, in the defendant\u2019s presence, Mrs. Boy said that she had been at a barroom early that morning when the defendant came in and \u201cpulled . . . [her] off the . . . [bar] stool and out the door.\u201d She said they drove back to the apartment in Severe which Carla Johnson and the defendant had been sharing and that Carla was outside lying on the ground. The defendant \u201cpicked her up and put her in the back seat of . . . [Mrs. Boy\u2019s] car. . . . He said, 'Get her to the hospital. I just shot her.\u2019 \u201d After eliciting these statements from Mrs. Boy, Hurley turned to the defendant and asked him, \u201cHave you anything to say now?\u201d A. \u2018'I got nothing to say. I told you where I was except thanks for the coffee. ...\u201d Q. \u201cDid you hear what she had to say?\u201d A. \u201cYup, I listened.\u201d Q. \u201cIs she lying?\u201d A. \u201cAs far as I know she is.\u201d Q. \u201cWhy would she lie?\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I ain\u2019t saying no more. You\u2019re already convinced I done it so lock me up and get it over with.\u201d Q. \u201cWhy would Mrs. Boy tell us a story like this if it were not true?\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Q. \u201cIf you tell the truth for a change it will be better in the long run for you.\u201d A. \u201cMaybe Carla will tell you.\u201d Q. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Carla will talk?\u201d A. \u201cI know she won\u2019t.\u201d Q. \u201cWho else could have shot her?\u201d A. \u201cMaybe a boyfriend. She has lots of them.\u201d Q. ' \u2018You are the only boyfriend we know of.\u201d A. \u201cMay be.\u201d After a number of questions relative to the defendant\u2019s activities on the night of the shooting, Hurley asked, \u201cWhat would make a person shoot a girl like this?\u201d A. \u201cIf she dies it doesn\u2019t make any difference. I love the girl. No matter what I\u2019m going to jail so let\u2019s let the Court decide. I\u2019m sick to death that she\u2019s in the hospital but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>there is nothing I can do to change that now.\u201d Q. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you bail out now and get it off your chest?\u201d A. \u201cI can\u2019t bail out. But I never say anything to cops, and I don\u2019t want to say anything now. Let Carla tell you about it if she wants to. I\u2019m not going to say anything. If she dies I\u2019d just as soon go myself. I\u2019d rather be dead than live without her.\u201d Hurley, indicating blood stains on the defendant\u2019s trousers, asked, \u201c. . . How did you get the blood on your pants?\u201d A. \u201cI could have pricked my finger and, look here where I cut myself shaving. \u201d Q. \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>You wouldn\u2019t leave that amount of blood on your pants if you pricked your finger nor if you cut yourself shaving, would you?\u201d A. \u201cMaybe I have the same type blood as Carla so that wouldn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d Q. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was Carla\u2019s blood, you did.\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be wise, I don\u2019t want to say anything. I refuse to answer any more questions.\u201d The defendant excepted generally to the admission in evidence of each of Hurley\u2019s questions to each of Mrs. Boy\u2019s statements and the defendant\u2019s replies thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Hurley\u2019s testimony was admissible only if the defendant, having heard Mrs. Boy\u2019s accusatory statements, replied equivocally. The rule is that \u201cWhen a defendant while under arrest is charged with a crime by an accusation made in his presence, and makes an equivocal reply or one susceptible of being interpreted as an admission or one not likely to be made by an innocent man, the question or statement and the answer or comment are admissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304, 313. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamel, </em>264 Mass. 564, 569. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>279 Mass. 466, 468. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valcourt, </em>333 Mass. 706, 716. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>339 Mass. 713, 715-716. The answer is admitted as an admission and the accusatory statement is admitted to \u201cgive meaning and effect\u201d to the answer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>12 Met. 235, 237; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>220 Mass. 142, 145. There is no doubt that the defendant, having heard Mrs. Boy\u2019s accusatory statements, replied equivocally. Several of these remarks, particularly when considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the aggregate, could be fairly interpreted as an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The defendant contends, however, that each of the equivocal remarks was constitutionally inadmissible. His contention is based upon the recent decision in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, which held, at pp. 473-474, that \u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d But the contention cannot prevail. The case at bar was tried in June, 1965, and the <em>Miranda </em>case was not decided until June, 1966. In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U. S. 719, decided a week after the <em>Miranda </em>decision, it was held that the <em>Miranda </em>principles need not be applied to cases tried before that decision. It is, of course, within our power to give the <em>Miranda </em>case greater retrospectivity than the Supreme Court in the <em>Johnson </em>case has required, and we have been urged to do so here. But that question has been dealt with in three very recent decisions of this court and it has been decided that the <em>Miranda </em>principles are not to be applied to cases tried prior to that decision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrissey, ante, </em>505, 509-511. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCambridge, ante, </em>516, 520-521. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, ante, </em>522, 530-531.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The defendant also contends that the admission of Hurley\u2019s testimony relative to Mrs. Boy\u2019s accusatory statements abridged his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution to confront the witnesses against him. See <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400. We do not agree. Evidence of Mrs. Boy\u2019s statements was admissible to \u201cgive meaning and effect\u201d to the defendant\u2019s equivocal remarks. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>12 Met. 235, 237; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>220 Mass. 142,145. When introduced for this purpose, and not for the purpose of showing the truth of Mrs. Boy\u2019s statements, Hurley\u2019s testimony was not hearsay. See Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1361. Nor do we think that Mrs. Boy thereby became a witness against the defendant within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>234 Cal. App. 2d 662, 676-677. It follows that the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>sion of Hurley\u2019s testimony did not abridge the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">2. \u201cAn admission alone ... or in combination with circumstantial evidence . . . may be enough [to convict] if sufficiently persuasive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>339 Mass. 713, 716, and cases cited. Here the defendant made several equivocal remarks which, in view of Mrs. Roy\u2019s accusatory statements, could be considered as admissions of his guilt. In addition, there was the corroborating evidence that the defendant lived with Carla Johnson and had been drinking with her the evening of the shooting. A revolver and bullets were found in the apartment, as well as a mop with blood on it. The defendant returned to the apartment, dressed only in a \u201cT-shirt\u201d and trousers, several hours after the shooting. The defendant, indeed, does not contend that, if the equivocal replies were admissible as admissions, the evidence was insufficient. Since Hurley\u2019s testimony was admissible as evidence tending to show that the defendant shot Carla, the court rightly denied his motions for directed verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">3. Albert Parvin, a Revere police officer, testified as follows : At about 1:30 a.m. on March 31, 1965, he was sent to the apartment where Carla and the defendant lived. He was given the description of a man and told to wait for that man or anyone who should enter the apartment. About 4 a.m. the defendant entered. His appearance matched the description Parvin had been given. Parvin testified: \u201cI asked him who he was. He asked me what we were doing there. I told him his wife was in the hospital. To this, he made no response. No answer. . . . I asked him his name and he replied \u2018John Shea.\u2019 \u201d The defendant excepted generally to the admission of the portions of this testimony relating to Parvin\u2019s questions and the defendant\u2019s silence and eventual reply, \u201cJohn Shea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The defendant contends that Parvin\u2019s testimony was not admissible as an admission of guilt because (1) the statement \u201cyour wife is in the hospital\u201d did not require a reply, (2) he often used the name \u201cJohn Shea\u201d and so was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>attempting to conceal his identity, and (3) he was not properly warned of his rights. But we need not consider these contentions. Parvin\u2019s testimony appears to have been introduced principally to establish that the defendant entered the apartment not long after the shooting. The testimony was admissible to establish the identity of the person who entered the apartment. Since it was admissible in evidence on this ground, the defendant\u2019s general exceptions cannot prevail. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>257 Mass. 426, 428. <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Dabrowski, </em>295 Mass. 358. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>308 Mass. 481, 493. There is nothing in the bill of exceptions to indicate that the jury were instructed that they could consider this testimony as an admission by the defendant of his guilt. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>346 Mass. 9, 14-15. Nor, as pointed out above in the discussion of Hurley\u2019s testimony, did the sufficiency of evidence for guilty verdicts depend upon Parvin\u2019s testimony being construed as an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-5\"> Lieutenant Hurley testified that since March 31, 1965, he had been unable to locate Mrs. Boy; she did not testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
