L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 99-101, as amended. The judge, being of opinion that there were questions of law so important and doubtful as to require the decision of this court, reported the case, the defendant consenting. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">We summarize the report as follows: In 1962 Alamac Knitting Mills, Incorporated, (Alamac) was engaged in the manufacture of textiles in Springfield. Alamac, employing some 800 people, occupied a large mill under a lease of the entire premises from the owner. Early in 1962 it was suspected that employees were pilfering finished materials, and William Thai, Alamac\u2019s chief executive officer, sought to ascertain the persons involved and how they operated. He communicated with his security officer (an independent contractor), and it was decided to tap telephones in the mill. At a meeting arranged between Thai and the defendant to carry out this decision, Thai authorized the defendant to place a wire tap on four telephones located in different parts of the mill. Thai also authorized the defendant to place in a desk exclusively used by Thai one or two wire or tape recorders so that conversations on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>tapped phones could be recorded and monitored. The defendant completed the wiring and installation of equipment necessary for the telephone monitoring. Thereafter, Thai recorded and monitored conversations emanating from the tapped telephones. The four telephones involved were owned, installed, and serviced by the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company and were used by various employees for outside calls as well as intraplant communication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2018\u2018 Evidence was presented that employees involved did not consent to the monitoring of their telephone conversations. There was no evidence that any employee consented to such monitoring. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The jury were instructed that the word <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>device \u2019 \u2019 appearing in the last clause of Gr. L. c. 272, \u00a7 101, as amended through St. 1956, c. 48, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201creferred to an electronic recording device, or a wireless tap or a similar device not involving tapping of a wire to intercept telephone communications\u201d and that this clause did not apply to the .tapping of a telephone wire. \u201cThe jury . . . [were] further instructed that proof of the tapping of any wire shall be prima facie evidence of the crime of eavesdropping, (1) unless duly authorized by a court order issued in accordance with section 99 and (2) unless done with the consent of the owner or person in control of the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The questions reported are these: \u201c(1) Is it lawful to tap a wire to intercept telephone communications in a building when authorized by and done with the consent of the owner or persons in control of the building but without a court order issued in accordance with Gr. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99? (2) Does the language of Gr. L. c. 272, \u00a7 101, meet the standard of clarity and definiteness as to the defendant in this case to satisfy the requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slome, </em>321 Mass. 713?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>1. We are of opinion that the instructions of the judge were correct. Section 101 reads: \u201cProof of the installation in any building of any device or arrangement which may be used for the purpose of violating the provisions of section ninety-nine by listening to any spoken words or proof of the tapping of any wire, unless duly authorized and unless done with the consent of the owner or person in control of the building, shall be prima facie evidence of the commission of the crime of eavesdropping; but nothing contained in this section or sections ninety-nine and one hundred shall render it unlawful for any person to install and use such a device on premises under his exclusive control.\u201d Under this section prima facie evidence of eavesdropping is established by proof of either of two things: (1) the installation of any device or arrangement which may be used for the purpose of violating \u00a7 99 by listening to spoken words or (2) the tapping of any wire,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cunless duly authorized and unless done with the consent of the owner or person in control of the building.\u201d The evidence reveals that the defendant placed a wire tap on four telephones within Alamac\u2019s premises. Thus we are concerned only with the second situation. On that issue, as stated above, the jury were instructed that proof of the tapping of any wire was prima facie evidence of the crime of eavesdropping unless there were both court authorization and consent of the owner or person in control of the building. This instruc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tian was required by \u00a7 101, which puts the prima facie evidence provision into operation upon \u201cproof of the tapping of any wire, unless duly authorized and unless done with the consent of the owner or person in control of the building. \u2019 \u2019 It is to be noted that the requirements of court authority and consent of the owner or person in control are stated conjunctively. There was no evidence that any person obtained a court order authorizing the wire taps. There was evidence, however, that Thai exercised control of the knitting mill and consented to wire tapping by the defendant. But that was not enough. The prima facie effect of the evidence could be avoided only by proof also of court authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The defendant\u2019s position is that the words \u201cunless duly authorized\u201d in \u00a7 101 mean that authority to eavesdrop can be conferred either by a court order issued under \u00a7 99 or by permission of a person having exclusive control of the premises where the eavesdropping would take place. Thus, it is argued, since Thai\u2019s consent to wire tap had been obtained by the defendant he was \u201cduly authorized,\u201d and the judge\u2019s charge that there must also be court authorization was erroneous. This contention rests on the premise that the word \u201cdevice\u201d in the last clause of \u00a7 101 (\u201cbut nothing contained in this section or sections ninety-nine and one hundred shall render it unlawful for any person to install and use such a device on premises under his exclusive control\u201d) embraces the tapping of wires. Doubtless a wire tapping apparatus could be a \u201cdevice.\u201d But to ascertain the meaning of that word in this statute it is necessary to read \u00a7 99 (see fn. 4), and the earlier provisions of \u00a7 101. Under those provisions a distinction is made between electronic recording or similar devices on the one hand and the tapping of a wire to intercept telephone communications on the other. We are of opinion that this distinction is preserved in the last clause of \u00a7 101 and that the word \u2018 \u2018 device \u2019 \u2019 in that section does not comprehend the tapping of wires.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Moreover if, as the defendant contends, exclusive control of the premises were to confer due authorization to wire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>tap, then the relevant portion of \u00a7 101, as paraphrased, would read: . . or proof of the tapping of any wire, unless authorized by the person in exclusive control of the premises and unless done with the consent of the owner or person in control of the building . . ..\u201d The second condition (consent of the owner) would become redundant and meaningless under this construction, and we reject that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">2. The other question reported is whether the language of \u00a7 101 satisfies the \u2018' standard of clarity and definiteness\u201d set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slome, </em>321 Mass. 713. There it was said at page 715,' \u2018A statute creating a crime must be sufficiently definite in specifying the conduct that is commanded or inhibited so that a man of ordinary intelligence may be able to ascertain whether any act or omission of his, as the case may be, will come within the sweep of the statute.\u201d The eavesdropping statute is not a paragon of clarity. A careful reading of it is required to ascertain what may or may not be done. Still, we are of opinion that it was not \u201c \u2018. . . so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>325 Mass. 519, 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">3.
