L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, from a decision by the Department of Public Utilities under G. L. C..40A, \u00a7 10,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exempting land owned by the New York Central Railroad from the operation of the town of Framing-ham zoning by-law. The case was reserved and reported without decision by a single justice \u2018 \u2018 on the petition for appeal, the answers, and the record, including the transcript and exhibits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The railroad petitioned to exempt certain of its land from residential zoning in order to use it as a \u201cterminal freight yard\u201d where automobiles would be parked after being unloaded from railroad ears and prior to being loaded on carrier trucks for delivery to dealers in the area. The department denied the railroad\u2019s petition. On appeal, this court vacated the department\u2019s decision for failure to make adequate findings of fact and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>347 Mass. 586. On remand, the department held a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">There was evidence at the hearings that the locus is adjacent to industrially zoned land of the railroad used as a \u201cterminal freight yard.\u201d Residents in the neighborhood testified regarding the noise and' glare of lights from the use of the present facility. Witnesses for the town testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>fled that there is a serious traffic problem in Framingham, and that when long freight trains use the railroad crossings, \u201cthe traffic is backed up sometimes a mile.\u201d There was also testimony that the carrier trucks caused \u201can additional traffic tie-up. \u2019 \u2019 The proposed new facility would double the capacity of the railroad for handling automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The carrier trucks enter and leave the present facilities from Hollis Street; and although approximately 11,000 automobiles a day travel on Hollis Street, an average of less than sixty carrier trucks a day enter the street from the facility. The locus is not suitable for residential use, and the neighborhood in the residential zone has several nonconforming uses \u201csuch as two gasoline stations, a tavern or something of that classification, a tavern or bar-room, a laundry.\u201d The shipment of automobiles on railroad cars results in savings of $20 to $60 per automobile on the cost of transportation from the manufacturer, and reductions in this cost lead to lower automobile prices. This method also enables more rapid delivery of the automobiles to the customer. Passenger service could not continue to be maintained without the benefits derived by the railroad from profitable freight service. \u201cThere is not enough room in the land\u201d presently being used to handle the increasing volume of the railroad\u2019s business. The selection of any site other than the locus for expansion \u201cwould raise the cost to the railroad and to the eventual purchaser of the automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The town contends that the department\u2019s \u201cdecision was not accompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision, including determination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision.\u201d The town also asserts that \u201cthe ultimate finding that the use of the locus for a marshaling yard is reasonably necessary for the convenience and welfare of the public was not supported by subsidiary findings nor substantial evidence,\u201d and, thus, the decision of the department \u201cis arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>347 Mass. 586, 593, fn. 4, we said that the relevant issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cinclude (a) the extent of the usefulness of the proposed facility to shippers, manufacturers, motor vehicle distributors, and consumers; (b) the suitability of the locus for the proposed facility and for other uses . . .; (c) the probable effect of the facility upon the gross and net revenues of the railroad; upon the railroad\u2019s ability to continue to perform its'intrastate and interstate public functions . . .; (d) the effect of the facility upon highway congestion . . .; (e) the possibility that injury to abutting owners can be minimized by proper screening of the facility by trees and otherwise; and (f) the relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposal from the standpoint of the public welfare and convenience. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The department found (a) that there was a \u201csavings in costs\u201d of transportation of new automobiles; (b) that \u201c [t]he use of the locus . . . will not materially change the general character of the area\u201d; (c) that the facility provides profits to the railroad which enable it to continue \u201csome of its less remunerative but nevertheless necessary services\u201d; (d) that \u201cthe added traffic generated by the present or proposed use of the facility would not materially add to . . . [the traffic] problem\u201d; (e) that the use of the locus would not have \u201csignificant effect upon the surrounding \u00e1rea, nor will it add appreciably to the disturbances which may already exist\u201d; and (f) that \u201cthe use of the locus for a marshaling yard is reasonably necessary for the convenience and welfare of the public. \u2019 \u2019 The record shows that these findings are supported by substantial evidence. We are of opinion that they show adequate reasons for the department\u2019s decision and included a \u201cdetermination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The town also maintains that the department \u201cerred in failing to take into account the vital issue of zoning, and the effect . . . [the] exemption might have on the landowners in the area, the . . . [town] and the . . . Commonwealth. \u2019 \u2019 The town also claims that the <em>department\" </em>erred in ignoring the <em>rights </em>of the landowners in the area, including their right to rely upon the integrity of the Zoning By-Law.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The findings show that the department did consider the general character of the neighborhood. It also considered the effect of the proposed facility on the surrounding area and its effect on traffic in the town. It seems to us that the department did take into account the \u201cvital issue of zoning.\u201d In any event the zoning by-law was subject to an exemption under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">A final decree is to be entered affirming the decision of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-11\"> Section <em>10 </em>reads, <em>\u201c </em>[Ljand used or to be used <em>by </em>a public service corporation may be exempted from the operation of a zoning . . . by-law, if, upon petition of the corporation, the department of public utilities shall, after public notice and hearing, decide that the present or proposed situation of the . . . land . . ; is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
