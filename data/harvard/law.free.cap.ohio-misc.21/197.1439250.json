Such plea shall not be construed to import an admission of any fact at issue in the criminal charge in any subsequent action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">In each case, the judge of the respective municipal court found the defendant before him guilty; defendant McFarlane of \u201cbeing in possession of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d and defendant Underwood of \u201coperating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The defendants, in taking this appeal, argue that Section 2937.07, Revised Code, does not relieve the prosecution of the duty of presenting to the trial court evidence of the offense charged. They contend that absent at least some evidence to support the charge, the court must, under the statute, find the defendant \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">It is the premise of the prosecuting municipalities, the appellees herein, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">\u00ed\u00ed# # # rmeg 0f evidence and the degree or amount of proof necessary to find an accused guilty are waived when an accused pleads no contest. The prosecutor need only give an explanation of circumstances, after which the court may or may not find the defendant guilty * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The question thus presented is whether the prosecution must, under the \u201cno contest\u201d provisions of Section 2937.07, Revised Code, present at least some <em>evidence </em>as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the elements of the offense charged before a trial court can \u201cfrom an explanation of the circumstances\u201d find the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">It is clear to this court that the \u201cno contest\u201d plea provided by Ohio statute is not the legal equivalent of the <em>nolo contendere </em>plea found in Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 11 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cA defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of the court, <em>nolo contendere. </em>The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such plea or plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the Charge and the consequences of the plea * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The receiving of the <em>nolo contendere </em>plea authorized by Rule 11 is discretionary with the court, whereas the entering of the \u201cno contest\u201d plea authorized by Section 2937.07, Revised Code, is a statutory right of the defendant. The court is without discretion as to whether it should accept or reject the plea. It must accept it and proceed to examine the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">There is no question hut that Rule 11 equates the \u201cguilty\u201d plea with the plea of <em>nolo contendere. </em>Why else would the court, prior to accepting either plea, have to determine that the plea was \u201cmade voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.\u201d In this court\u2019s eyes, it is quite apparent that the case of <em>Von Moltke </em>v. <em>Gillies </em>(1948), 332 U. S. 708, which deals with the acceptance of a guilty plea by the court, and outlines constitutional safeguards owing to the defendant, is equally applicable to Rule 11 pleas of <em>nolo contendere.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">It is equally clear that under Section 2937.08, Revised Code, the plea of \u201cguilty\u201d is not to he equated with the plea of \u201cno contest.\u201d After the entering of the latter plea \u25a0the court must still \u201cmake finding of guilty or not guilty from the explanation of circumstances.\u201d See <em>Fairlawn </em>v. <em>Fuller </em>(1966), 8 Ohio Misc. 266 (Akron Municipal Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The meaning of the term \u201cexplanation of circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>stances,\u201d as it is used in the second paragraph of Section 2937.07, Revised Code, cannot be found from examining the present statute or its analogous predecessors. Therefore its meaning must be construed in the light of existing case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The precise issue posed in each of the instant cases is whether it is necessary for the prosecuting authority to present evidence of the offense charged to the court, where the defendant has entered a statutory plea of \u201cno contest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Of import in determining the answer to this question is the case of <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Haskins, Supt. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 36. The <em>Brookhart case </em>concerned itself with the common-law plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>which, in the form recited by the court, was nearly identical to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">After holding that the common-law plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>was a permissible plea in an Ohio felony proceeding, the court went on to discuss the rights of the accused with respect to such a plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cCertainly, if an accused has the right to plead guilty and thus relieve the state from presenting any proof of his guilt, he can agree that although he will not plead guilty he is willing to accept the verdict of the court <em>based on limited evidence on each of the essential elements of the crime * * 2 </em>Ohio St. 2d 36, 40. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">If such be the standard of the court in cases where the <em>nolo contendere </em>is tantamount to a plea of \u201cguilty,\u201d then certainly no lower a standard should be tolerated under the statutory \u201cno contest\u201d where the plea is not equated with a \u201cguilty\u201d plea and where the judge may make a finding of either \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Therefore it is this court\u2019s opinion that in order for a trial court to find a defendant \u201cguilty\u201d under the \u201cno contest\u201d provisions of Section 2937.07, Revised Code, the verdict must be based on at least limited admissible material and relevant evidenc on each of the essential elements of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Such a presentation of evidence, need npt be involved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and might consist of the sworn affidavit of a witness, or an investigating officer, or even of the defendant himself, which states facts (not legal conclusions) substantiating the presence of each of the crime\u2019s elements. Inasmuch as the defendant has agreed to accept as true the evidence presented, he would not be entitled to cross-examine the affiant, although he could present objections to the admission of the affidavit. All that need be shown is that the evidence, when used to explain the circumstances, supports a finding of \u201cguilty\u201d by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">This court can not subscribe to the theory advanced by the prosecutor in the <em>McF \u00e1rleme case </em>(see Transcript of Proceedings on Wednesday, July 24, 1968, page 11, last line, quoting from the Transcript):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">\u201c* * * that when he (attorney for the defendant) entered a <em>plea of no contest </em>which the court as it does in all of these cases, Your Honor, explained to the defendant <em>that a plea of no contest would result in a finding of guilty </em>and that there is to be a brief explanation by either the officer or the prosecutor of the facts in order to explain the circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In each case in the lower court the finding was based solely upon statements and representations made to the court by the prosecutors for the respective communities involved. The testimony given was strictly hearsay, and further, was unsworn. An unsworn police report may not be equated with courtroom testimony, or a sworn affidavit by a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Thus, it is this court\u2019s opinion that in the instant cases the verdict or finding of each of the municipal courts was not supported by the evidence presented, and was thus contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The verdict, or finding, in each case is hereby reversed, and each cause is remanded to the respective trial court involved, for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\n<em>Judgments reversed and causes remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
