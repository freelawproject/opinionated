We conclude the Act applies to defendant\u2019s reckless manslaughter conviction and does not violate the cruel and unusual punishment proscriptions of the state and federal constitutions in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">A Cumberland County Grand Jury indicted defendant on two counts of felony murder, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3a(3); one count of first-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1; one count of second-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2; and one count of third-degree conspiracy to commit burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2. Pursuant to a negotiated plea, defendant pled guilty to the amended offense of reckless manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11 \u2014 4b. The plea agreement allowed the prosecutor to argue for the applicability of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The trial court imposed a 10-year term of imprisonment. It also ruled the Act applicable and, consequently, imposed an 8$-year parole ineligibility term with a 3-year term of parole supervision upon release from jail. The court further imposed appropriate monetary penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">The facts elicited at the plea provided the predicate for the guilty plea. Defendant admitted that on November 7, 1997, he went to the home of Russell Hockenberry in the City of Bridgeton for the purpose of entering the house with intent to steal. Defendant believed Hockenberry was not home at the time. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>entry through a door, defendant was surprised by Hockenberry\u2019s presence. Defendant claimed Hockenberry, who was startled by defendant\u2019s presence, fell back, down a set of stairs, and was knocked unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Defendant admitted he proceeded down the stairs, apparently to confirm the victim was unconscious. At that time, defendant placed a pillow under the victim\u2019s head. He then left the house only to return about one-half hour later when he again found the victim still unconscious. He again left and made no effort to summon assistance for the victim. The victim died as a consequence of the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Defendant\u2019s presentence report contained information provided by a police report. In response to a report by local postal authorities that mail was accumulating at the victim\u2019s home, a Bridgeton police officer went to the home where he found the 70-year-old victim dead at the foot of the stairs. The victim died of a subdural hematoma caused by a fractured skull. The door of the house had been pried open with a screwdriver. Defendant\u2019s nephew told police he overheard defendant say on a telephone call he had pushed the victim down the stairs. Defendant denied pushing the victim. <em>See State v. Sainz, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>283, 293, 526 A.2d 1015 (1987) (\u201cWhen a trial court imposes a sentence based on defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the defendant\u2019s admissions or factual version need not be the sole source of information for the court\u2019s sentencing decision ... [and] the court may look to other evidence in the record when making such determinations----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The Act in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ard\">a. A court imposing a sentence of incarceration for a crime of the first or second degree shall fix a minimum term of 85% of the sentence during which the defendant shall not be eligible for parole if the crime is a violent crime as defined in subsection d. of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">c. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary and in addition to any other sentence imposed, a court imposing a minimum period of parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ineligibility of 85 percent of the sentence pursuant to this section shall also ... impose ... a three-year term of parole supervision if the defendant is being sentenced for a crime of the second degree____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">d. For the purposes of this section, \u201cviolent crime\u201d means any crime in which the actor causes death____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Defendant argues: (1) the Act\u2019s absence of a degree of culpability requires courts to insert \u201cknowingly\u201d as the degree of culpability required for application of the Act, and (2) the Act does not apply to second-degree reckless manslaughter because it is not a \u201cviolent crime\u201d within the Act\u2019s intendment. We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Defendant\u2019s first contention that we should insert the word \u201cknowingly\u201d before the words \u201ccauses death\u201d overlooks the distinction between statutes defining offenses and those establishing parole ineligibility standards. The New Jersey Criminal Code under <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:2-2, \u201cGeneral Requirements of Culpability,\u201d defines the various types of culpability that may be material elements of an offense. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2e(3), when \u201cno culpable mental state is expressly designated in a statute <em>defining an offense </em>\u201d'and \u201cthe proscribed conduct <em>necessarily involves </em>such culpable mental state,\u201d a statute defining a crime should construe \u201cknowingly\u201d as the culpability element. (Emphasis added.) Consequently, the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-2c(3), creating the need to impute the \u201cknowingly\u201d culpability standard, only applies to statutes defining offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">No reasonable or fair reading of the Code imputes \u201cknowingly\u201d as a standard to qualify the applicability of the Act. The Act does not prescribe elements of an offense. It imposes its enhanced parole ineligibility after determination of guilt and proof of the elements of the underlying crime. Simply put, the statute imposing standards for an enhanced parole ineligibility does not implicate the Code prescript to impute a culpability standard as an element of certain offenses. <em>See State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62, 68-69, 455 A.2d 1074 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The plain language of the Act similarly cripples defendant\u2019s contention that reckless manslaughter is not a violent crime within the Act\u2019s intendment. The premier principle guiding a court\u2019s search for legislative intent is the Act\u2019s plain language. <em>See State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 226, 445 A.2d 399 (1982). \u201cIf a statute is clear and unambiguous on its face and admits of only one interpretation, we need delve no deeper than the act\u2019s literal terms to divine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Here, the plain language admits only one interpretation \u2014 reckless manslaughter falls within its prescripts. The Act\u2019s language is susceptible to no other interpretation. The Act defines a violent crime as one in which the actor causes death. The word \u201ccause\u201d is conventionally defined as that which produces a result or consequence. <em>See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>214 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Applying that definition, it is undisputed defendant caused the victim\u2019s death. Even if we accept defendant\u2019s version of the event, which arguably is unconvincing given the evidence defendant was overheard admitting he pushed the victim down the steps, defendant\u2019s conduct caused the victim\u2019s death. In the best scenario from defendant\u2019s viewpoint, that defendant surprised or startled the victim, it was defendant\u2019s conduct that produced the victim\u2019s death. The language of the Act consequently admits no other interpretation except that it is applicable to a conviction for reckless manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Anticipating the applicability of the Act to his reckless manslaughter conviction, defendant argues the 85% parole ineligibility enhancement violates the state and federal constitutional proscriptions on cruel and unusual punishment. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">In <em>Des Marets, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 455 A.2d 1074, the Supreme Court considered a similar challenge to the Graves Act. There, defendant asserted the Graves Act violated the cruel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>unusual punishment provision of the state constitution, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The Court delineated the parameters for determining whether the punishment prescribed by a legislative enactment violated the constitutional proscription. The Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">In considering this claim, we inquire whether the nature of the criticized punishment shocks the general conscience and violates principles of fundamental fairness; whether comparison shows the punishment to be grossly disproportionate to the offense; and whether the punishment goes beyond what is necessary to accomplish any legitimate penal aim. The showing that must be made to sustain the claim is substantial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\"><em>[Des Marets, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 455 A.2d 1074 (citations omitted)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeN\">Noting the magnitude and severity of the problem of violent crime, the Court found the Graves Act sentence, as applied to the specific facts,, did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the New Jersey Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 82, 455 A.2d 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In <em>State v. Maldonado, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>536, 547, 645 A.2d 1165 (1994), the Court addressed the issue of whether the strict liability punishment imposed for a drug death conviction violated the cruel and unusual punishment proscriptions of both state and federal constitutions. There, the Court identified a three-part inquiry, one similar to that of <em>Des Marets, </em>to determine whether a punishment is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201cFirst, does the punishment for the crime conform with contemporary standards of decency? Second, is the punishment grossly disproportionate to the offense? Third, does the punishment go beyond what is necessary to accomplish any legitimate penological objective?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\"><em>[Maldonado, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>at 556-57, 645 A.2d 1165 (quoting <em>State v.. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 169, 524 A.2d 188 (1987)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">Assimilating the criteria of <em>Des Marets </em>and <em>Maldonado </em>to address the cruel and unusual claim defendant raises to the sentence imposed here, we need go no further than to note the magnitude and severity of the crime defendant committed to conclude the claim is unavailing. A criminal homicide is one of the most malodorous and violent offenses proscribed by our criminal laws. Viewed in the context of that truism, there is no justifiable basis for concluding any of the assimilated criteria are demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>strated, never mind substantially so. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, there is no rational basis for concluding the punishment imposed on defendant, as a consequence of the Act, is grossly disproportionate to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
