We affirm in part and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Simply stated, plaintiff, a paraplegic passenger on defendant/third-party-plaintiff United Airline\u2019s (United) round-trip flight from Newark, New Jersey to Japan, was injured when he fell or was dropped while being disembarked from the plane in Japan. At the time, third-party defendant JSS, a Japanese corporation, was providing wheelchair services to plaintiff pursuant to a written agreement with United. As far as the present record reveals, JSS has no direct contacts with New Jersey or any other state in the nation. Its wheelchair agreement, however, contains an indemnification clause for injuries caused by its negligence to United\u2019s passengers. That was, of course, the basis for the third-party complaint against JSS seeking indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\n<em>Subject-Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Subject-matter jurisdiction involves the threshold determination as to whether the court is legally authorized to decide the question presented. <em>Gilbert v. Gladden, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>275, 280-81, 432 A.2d 1351 (1981). It concerns the forum or venue in which such jurisdiction is established by statute or rule. Not infrequently, however, and often in commercial settings, a forum is voluntarily selected and agreed to by the parties. Such forum selection clauses are enforceable, provided there are no countervailing fraud, public policy, or serious inconvenience concerns. <em>Caspi v. Microsoft Network, L.L.C., </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 122, 732 A.2d 528 (App.Div.1999); <em>McNeill v. Zoref, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>213, 219, 687 A.2d 1052 (App.Div.1997); <em>Wilfred MacDonald, Inc. v. Cushman, Inc., </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 63-64, 606 A.2d 407 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>17, 611 A.2d 655 (1992). <em>Compare Kubis &amp; Perszyk </em>Assoc., <em>Inc. v.

Commerce &amp; Industry Insurance Co., </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 167, 686 A.2d 377 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Here, in its initial motion papers JSS argued that the New Jersey court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over United\u2019s indemnification claim based upon a negotiated forum clause under which Japan was the proper forum. Here are the pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At the time of the accident, two separate contracts, negotiated on the same day, governed the relationship between United and JSS. One, entitled \u201cConsigned Baggage Security Inspection Duty Commission Agreement,\u201d contained a clause that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">United Airlines and JSS agree that this Agreement shall be interpreted entirely according to Japanese law, and <em>all legal actions arising from this agreement shall be under the jurisdiction of the Osaka District Couti and the Osaka Summary Court</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">By contrast, the second agreement, entitled \u201cMemorandum\u201d and concerning solely wheelchair services, did not specify a particular resolution of disputes arising thereunder. It is this agreement that contained the critical indemnification clause at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The only reference in this agreement to the baggage agreement is in the provision that set forth charges and terms of payment and which provided for such payment to be in accordance with the payment provisions of the baggage agreement. There is nothing in either of the documents that required them to be construed as one contract or that incorporated the forum provisions of the baggage agreement into the wheelchair agreement. And, since no discovery has occurred, there is nothing in the record that would suggest that was the parties\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Where the terms of an agreement are clear, we ordinarily will not make a better contract for parties than they have voluntarily made for themselves, nor alter their contract for the benefit or detriment of either, particularly in a commercial, arms-length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>setting. <em>E.g., Chemical Bank of New Jersey Nat. Ass\u2019n v. Bailey, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>515, 527, 687 A.2d 316 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>28, 695 A.2d 671 (1997). In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial judge observed the existence of an express forum clause in the baggage agreement and commented: \u201c[b]ut I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t really be more specific dealing with [forum selection], if they were so concerned, to make that apply to a personal injury.\u201d The simple fact is that, for whatever reason, the wheelchair memorandum does not contain a forum selection clause. JSS cannot rely upon the one contained in the other, separate baggage agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">It may be that the wheelchair memorandum does not contain a forum selection clause because United and JSS understood that services to be provided under that agreement would involve the embarkment and disembarkment of passengers. As such, claims arising therefrom would be governed by the international treaty commonly known as the Warsaw Convention (Convention).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the signatory countries, the Convention establishes the exclusive remedy for damages arising from claims that fall within its substantive scope and establishes the forum for such claims. <em>El Al Israel Airlines v. Tseng, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>155,-, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>662, 672-73, 142 L.Ed.2d 576, 590-92 (1999). The United States and Japan are signatory countries. Moreover, the injury to plaintiff, occurring as it did during disembarkment, falls within the substantive scope of the treaty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>It is the forum clause of the Warsaw Convention, then, that United argues must be examined to determine whether the New Jersey court has subject-matter jurisdiction. In this respect, Article 28(1) of the Convention provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of his principal place of business, or where he has a place of business through which the contract has been made, or <em>before the court at the place of destination.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">[49 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 40105 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201c[Questions of procedure, [however] shall be governed by the law of the court to which the case is submitted.\u201d Article 28(2), <em>supra. </em>Since the final place of destination on plaintiffs round-trip ticket was Newark, New Jersey, United asserted, and the trial judge agreed, that the Convention reposed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Essex County court. <em>See Klos v. Polskie Linie Lotnicze, </em>133 F.3d 164, 167 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Butz v. British Airways, </em>421 <em>F.Supp. </em>127, 130 (E.D.Pa.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We pause at this point to note that, indeed, there are a number of cases construing the Convention\u2019s forum clause as creating four fora: 1) the air carrier\u2019s domicile; 2) the air carrier\u2019s principal place of business; 3) the air carrier\u2019s place of business through which the flight arrangements were made; or 4) the place of flight destination. <em>Klos v. Polskie Linie Lotnicze, </em>133 <em>F.3d </em>164, 167 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Potter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 881, 886 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Gasca v. Empresa de Transporte Aero del Peru, </em>992 <em>F.Supp. </em>1377, 1380 (S.D.Fla.1998). On the other hand, there are as well a number of cases which have viewed the Convention\u2019s forum provisions as \u201cnational in scope.\u201d That is to say, \u201cthey determine the nation in which a suit under the Warsaw Convention can be brought, and not the place within that nation in which jurisdiction and venue are appropriate.\u201d <em>Romero v. Argentinas, </em>834 <em>F.Supp. </em>673, 677 (D.N.J.1993). <em>See e.g., Smith v. Canadian Pac. Airways, Ltd., </em>452 F.2d 798, 800-01 (2d Cir.1971), <em>overruled on other grounds, Benjamins v. British European Airways, </em>572 F.2d 913, 915 (2d Cir.1978); <em>Donkor v. British Airways Corp., </em>62 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>963, 966 (E.D.N.Y.1999) (\u201c[u]nder the Warsaw Conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ticm, a court must have both \u2018treaty\u2019 and \u2018domestic\u2019 jurisdiction ... treaty jurisdiction is governed by Article 28 of the Convention which supports four fora in which suit may be brought ... Domestic jurisdiction refers to the rules of the forum\u2019s courts.\u201d). Under this analysis, we are not sure that Essex County would be the proper venue, but JSS\u2019s motion is addressed to the national forum, not the particular local forum. At the least, the destination of plaintiffs flight would establish subject-matter jurisdiction in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">JSS urges, however, that we must focus upon the particular dispute that draws it into the case, that is the particular claim underlying United\u2019s third-party complaint. That claim arises from JSS\u2019s contractual agreement to indemnify United for damages to United\u2019s passengers caused by its negligence. It is a contractual cause of action, notes JSS, distinct from plaintiffs personal injury claim and does not, therefore, fall within the substantive scope of the Convention. <em>Cf. McNeill v. Zoref supra, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 221-22, 687 A.2d 1052 (contracting parties\u2019 forum agreement cannot \u201cfunnel\u201d noncontracting parties into chosen forum). We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">To begin with, there is no question but that the underlying complaint is governed by the Convention. Procedural questions thereunder are to be decided by the law of the forum. Article 28(2). Under our court rules, if venue pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:3-2 properly exists for the main action, the fact that a third-party defendant may be entitled to a different venue does not dispossess the court of subject-matter jurisdiction, although a change of venue application may be considered under <em>R. </em>4:3-3(a). <em>Doyley v. Schroeter, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>120, 125, 465 A.2d 583 (Law Div.1983); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment <em>R. </em>4:3-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Moreover, JSS, in providing the wheelchair services for disembarking passengers, is subject to the substantive provisions of the Convention. It is clear that the provisions apply to not only the air carriers, but as well to \u201ceveryone associated with the enterprise of transporting passengers, including agents who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>engaged by the carrier to perform services in furtherance of carriage.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Allied Eastern States Maintenance Corp., </em>488 A.2d 1341, 1343 (D.C.App.1985). <em>See Reed v. Wiser, </em>555 <em>F. </em>2d 1079, 1083 (2d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>922, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>399, 54 L.Ed.2d 279 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>plaintiff was injured in the course of wheelchair services provided by defendant pursuant to a contract with the air carrier. Defining \u201ccarrier\u201d by the \u201cin furtherance of carriage\u201d test, the court concluded that defendant independent contractor was subject to the Convention. In doing so, it noted that a broad scope of the term \u201ccarrier\u201d would ensure that the rules governing international aviation remain uniform and that the liability limitations remain intact, regardless of whom a plaintiff may choose to name as a defendant in a particular ease. 488 A.2d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The Warsaw Convention provisions, then, have been construed to apply to various third-parties when they are acting \u201cin furtherance of carriage.\u201d <em>See Baker v. Lansdell Protective Agency, Inc., </em>590 <em>F.Supp. </em>165, 170 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (liability limitations in Warsaw Convention applied in action against agent performing security checks at airport); <em>Chutter v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, </em>132 <em>F.Supp. </em>611, 613 (S.D.N.Y.1955) (service company that provided the plane\u2019s entrance ramp was subject to the provisions of the Convention because its services were a part of the contract of transportation); <em>Lear v. New York Helicopter Corp., et al., </em>190 A.D.2d 7, 12, 597 N.Y.S.2d 411, 414 (1993) (companies that inspected, maintained and repaired air-carrier\u2019s helicopters were subject to the terms of the Convention); <em>Julius Young Jewelry Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, </em>67 A.D.2d 148, 149, 414 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>528, 529 (1979) (an inter-line baggage transfer company found to be subject to the provisions of the Convention because getting luggage to passenger\u2019s final destination was a service performed in furtherance of the contract of carriage); <em>Waxman v. C.I.S. Mexicana De Aviacion, </em>S.A <em>De C.V., </em>13 F.Supp.2d 508, 513-15 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (air carrier\u2019s cleaning subcontractor subject to provisions of Warsaw Convention). <em>Compare Alleyn v. Port Authority of New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>York, </em>58 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>15, 22-25 (E.D.N.Y.1999) (subcontractor performing terminal escalator maintenance services is not performing services related to air carriers\u2019 contract of carriage and, thus, not subject to provisions of the Warsaw Convention).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We recognize that plaintiff has not sued JSS directly. But we see no basis for concluding that United\u2019s claims for indemnification, arising from a covered accident, should not be properly a part of that action, subject to the Convention\u2019s provisions, including its forum provisions. <em>Magnus Electronics, Inc. v. Royal Bank of Canada, </em>611 <em>F.Supp. </em>436, 440 (N.D.Ill.1985) (rejecting the contention that the Warsaw Convention \u201cplainly [only] provides rights to, and imposes corresponding burdens upon, the [Convention] plaintiff\u2019 and rejecting, therefore, the contention that cross-claims for contribution and indemnification are not covered by the Warsaw Convention); <em>Data General Corp. v. Air Express International Co., </em>676 <em>F.Supp. </em>538, 540-41 (S.D.N.Y.1988); <em>Oriental Fire and General Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Citizens Nat. Bank of Decatur, </em>220 <em>Ill.App.2d </em>671, 163 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>98, 581 N.E.2d 49, 52-53 (1991); <em>L.B. Smith v. Circle Air, </em>128 Misc.2d 12, 488 N.Y.S.2d 547, 550 (NY.Sup.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We recognize that most of the cases that involve application of Convention provisions to cross-claims or third-party claims concern the application of the Convention\u2019s statute of limitations in the context of a claim for contribution from an air carrier where the main claim is covered by the Convention. But if cross-claims and third-party claims for contribution or indemnification are within the scope of the convention for the purposes of its statute of limitations, there is no reason why they would not also be subject to its forum provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">JSS, however, relies upon <em>Sabena Belgian World Airlines v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>773 <em>F.Supp. </em>1117 (N.D.Ill.1991), and <em>Mitchell, Shackleton &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Triangle Aviation Services, Inc., </em>704 <em>F.Supp. </em>524 (S.D.N.Y.1989). In both of these cases, the courts declined to apply the statute of limitations provisions of the Convention to claims for indemnification. <em>Mitchell </em>did so conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ing that the third-party defendant, a \u201cground handler,\u201d did not fall within the scope of \u201cair carrier\u201d or an agent thereof. The ground handler was considered a \u201cnon-carrier agent\u201d and thus not covered by the Convention. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>at 528. To the contrary, JSS, in its disembarking services, clearly is a \u201ccarrier agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As for <em>Sabena, </em>despite the fact that the Convention was found to apply to the underlying action, the court concluded that the policies of the Convention would not be served by applying the statute of limitations to the claim for indemnification. 773 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1120. Thus, the court held that the Convention provisions did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The cardinal purpose, however, of the Convention has been described as achieving \u201cuniformity of rules governing claims arising from international transportation.\u201d <em>Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>530, 551, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1489, 1502, 113 L.Ed.2d 569, 587-88 (1991). United\u2019s claim against JSS arises from an incident that involves international transportation and services provided by JSS in connection therewith. Surely the Convention\u2019s policy of uniformity would be served by application of the Convention\u2019s forum provisions so that United\u2019s related claims for indemnification can be heard in the same forum as will hear the underlying triggering damages claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\n<em>In Personam Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Because JSS filed its motion before filing an answer, no discovery has been conducted, jurisdictional or otherwise. The record as to in personam jurisdiction, therefore, consists of a certification by a JSS employee that asserts that JSS is a Japanese corporation which has \u201cno contacts whatsoever\u201d with either New Jersey or the United States, that the wheelchair agreement was negotiated in Japan and that JSS \u201cis in the business of conducting consignment baggage security inspections at airports in Japan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>What this listing of noncontacts omits, of course, is the fact that in providing wheelchair assistance to United\u2019s various passengers, JSS must have significant contacts with United States residents, including New Jersey. In this respect, it might reasonably be said that JSS must or should know that injuries it causes in its disembarkment services will be subject to the Convention provisions, including its forum clause. As such, it as well, then, might reasonably be said that JSS could anticipate being \u201chaled into\u201d one of the four Convention fora which obviously could include New Jersey as a place of destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The legal principles governing in personam jurisdiction are well established. We touch on them briefly. <em>R. </em>4:4 \u2014 4(b)(1), the \u201clong-arm jurisdiction\u201d rule, has been construed to allow New Jersey courts jurisdiction over non-residents to the outer limits permitted by due process<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. <em>Charles Gendler &amp; Co. v. Telecom Equip. Corp., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>460, 469, 508 A.2d 1127 (1986) <em>(citing Avdel Corp. v. Mecure, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>264, 268, 277 A.2d 207 (1971)); <em>Jacobs v. Walt Disney World, Co., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 452, 707 A.2d 477 (App.Div.1998). As we restated recently in <em>Blakey v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 199-201, 730 A.2d 854 (App.Div.1999), a finding of due process \u201crequires only that in order to subject a non-resident defendant to a judgment in personam, he must have certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 730 A.2d 854 (quoting <em>Lebel v. Everglades Marina, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>317, 322, 558 A.2d 1252 (1989)). Thus, the test for personal jurisdiction has two facets: minimum contacts and fair play and substantial justice. <em>Ibid. See Gendler, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 472, 508 A.2d 1127 <em>(citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>462, 476, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2174, 2184, 85 <em>L.Ed.M </em>528, 543 (1985)) (first step in a minimum contacts analysis is to determine whether the defendant has sufficient contacts with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>forum state, the second step is to evaluate those contacts in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice). Central to the consideration is whether the purposeful actions of the foreign defendant are such that the defendant should have anticipated being \u201chaled\u201d into the court asserting jurisdiction. <em>Romero v. Aerolineas Argentinas, supra, </em>834 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 680. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>286, 297, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>559, 567, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, 501 (1980); <em>Waste Management, Inc. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>106, 120-22, 649 A.2d 379 (1994), <em>cert. denied, sub nom. WMX Tech., Inc. v. Canadian Gen. Ins.

The concern is that a defendant not be \u201chaled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of \u201crandom,\u2019 \u2018fortuitous,\u2019 or \u2018attenuated\u2019 contacts.\u201d <em>Lebel v.

Advance Die Casting Inc., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 75, 678 A.2d 293 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>489, 696 A.2d 666 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">As we have described JSS\u2019 role in the disembarkment of United\u2019s international passengers, many of whom must come from New Jersey, it may be argued that JSS\u2019 specific contact with this New Jersey resident plaintiff, whose round-trip destination was New Jersey, would suffice for due process purposes. JSS has not asserted any particular unfairness in having to litigate the third-party complaint in New Jersey and, aside from some inconvenience, we can see none.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We, however, are somewhat reluctant to dispositively resolve the in personam jurisdiction issue here for two reasons. First, we have no cogent findings or conclusions by the motion judge on the in personam jurisdiction issue. In fact, as we read his oral decision, we are not entirely sure the issue of in personam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>jurisdiction, as opposed to subject-matter jurisdiction, was separately considered. Moreover, United points out that jurisdictional discovery has not been conducted. In this respect, it says in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">The crucial question is whether JSS \u201cwas aware or should have been aware\u201d that the services it provides affect New Jersey residents. JSS is an active participant in United\u2019s performance of its contracts of carriage and receives an economic benefit from international airline tickets sold within the State of New Jersey. In addition, JSS\u2019s corporation structure,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> its performance of similar services for other airlines, and the terms of any such contracts, as well as a host of other issues, all may support personal jurisdiction over JSS and are matters that United should be allowed to explore before a dismissal is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Although we are inclined to think there may be sufficient basis for in personam jurisdiction over JSS arising from its contact with plaintiff through its agreement with United, that conclusion may not be without question. We are convinced, therefore, that United should be permitted to engage in jurisdictional discovery before the issue is finally resolved. The trial judge should reconsider the issue after such discovery. <em>See Makopoulos v. Walt Disney World, Inc., </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 518-19, 535 A.2d 26 (App.Div.1987). Upon reconsideration, the judge should accompany his determination with findings of facts and conclusions of law sufficient for us to adequately review his determination in the event of further appeal. <em>R. </em>l:7-4(a); <em>Filippone v. Lee, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 306-07, 700 A.2d 384 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The denial of the motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is affirmed. The issue of in personam jurisdiction is remanded for discovery and reconsideration. We leave it to the trial judge to set an appropriate schedule for such discovery and reconsideration of the motion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\"> Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, 49 <em>Stat. </em>3000, 3014, T.S.
