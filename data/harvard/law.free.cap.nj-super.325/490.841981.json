The Borough of Point Pleasant Zoning Board of Adjustment (Board) denied the variance, concluding that the proposed nursing home use was \u201cpart of [Meridian\u2019s] systematic dismantling\u201d of acute-care services at the hospital \u201cto the greater detriment of the Point Pleasant community.\u201d The trial judge agreed with the Board, and upheld the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We reverse. Meridian\u2019s proposed plan to decommission the hospital\u2019s acute-care services is unrelated to and unaffected by its application for the special reasons variance. The plan was occasioned by a lack of need for acute care at the hospital and cost-saving considerations, and was subject to review by the State Department of Health &amp; Senior Services (DHSS) pursuant to the DHSS\u2019s Certificate of Need procedure. The Board\u2019s denial of the variance based on Meridian\u2019s plan was therefore arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Meridian, a nonprofit entity, owns and operates the Point Pleasant Hospital in the Borough of Point Pleasant, Ocean County. The facility is situate on 11.7 acres and located in the \u201chospital\u201d zone, which permits hospitals and various accessory uses, but specifically excludes nursing homes. The facility is surrounded by the Manasquan River and residential zones consisting of single-family, detached housing units on individual lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Point Pleasant Hospital is presently licensed by the DHSS as an acute-care facility. However, the hospital has been on the decline for a number of years. In 1990, it had approximately 330 licensed beds. In 1997, the number of licensed beds was reduced to 136. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>As of the time of the Board hearings, only fifty beds were staffed and in use. The third and fourth floors of the building have remained essentially vacant since 1996, when seventy-eight acute-care beds were \u201cdelicensed.\u201d Each of the two floors has roughly 12,000 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In 1997, Meridian entered into negotiations with Ocean Convalescent Center, a licensed nursing home operator. Meridian planned to lease the third and fourth floors of the hospital to Ocean Convalescent for use as a sixty-one bed nursing home. On February 14, 1997, Ocean Convalescent obtained approval from DHSS to transfer sixty-one nursing home beds from its Lakewood facility to the Point Pleasant Hospital facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Meridian applied to the Borough\u2019s zoning officer for an interpretation of the zoning ordinance to determine whether the nursing home was a permissible use. The zoning officer advised Meridian that it was not, and that it was necessary for Meridian to apply for a special reasons variance with the Board. Meridian thereafter made the application pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">During the Board hearing, Meridian\u2019s Associate Executive Director, John Rauner, testified that the proposed nursing home use did not require changes to the exterior of the hospital structure. Interior alterations were required to comply with state regulations; patient rooms would be renovated, and bathroom facilities and an eating area would be installed. A courtyard enclosed within the perimeter walls of the hospital would be converted to a recreational area. The patients would not have access to the streets or sidewalks, and no additional parking spaces would be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Rauner also stated that ancillary support, such as food service, engineering, maintenance, laundry, laboratory and x-ray services would be provided to the nursing home patients by the hospital. He testified that the nursing home would have no impact on the medical services provided by the hospital. When pressed by Board members and objectors as to the hospital\u2019s plan to decommission its acute-care facility, Rauner acknowledged that Meridian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>was studying a proposal to convert the hospital from an acute-care facility to an urgent-care facility. Rauner explained that such a conversion would require Meridian to obtain a Certificate of Need from the DHSS. Rauner and Meridian\u2019s counsel made clear that, whether or not the variance application was approved, Meridian intended to proceed with its plan to decommission its acute-care facility, including the emergency room, at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Andrew Shawn, Administrator of the Ocean Convalescent Center, testified that his present facility in Lakewood is a nonconforming wood-frame dwelling requiring a \u201cwaiver\u201d from the DHSS. The nursing home\u2019s move to Point Pleasant Hospital would comply with the DHSS\u2019s standards and permit the facility to serve Medicare patients. Meridian would install a \u201csophisticated\u201d security system to prevent unwarranted ingress to and egress from the facility by patients. He stated that the quality of life of the nursing home patients \u201cwould be greatly enhanced\u201d by the optimum space provided by the wide hallways and larger rooms at the hospital facility. Meridian estimated that the cost of renovations would approximate $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Daniel McSweeney, a licensed planner, testified on behalf of Meridian. Noting that a nursing home is an \u201cinherently beneficial use,\u201d McSweeney was of the view that reuse of the vacant third and fourth floors of the hospital would have a \u201cpositive impact on both the hospital and the borough.\u201d He testified that the growing aging population in Ocean County was a factor supporting the need for nursing homes. Further, he described the nursing home\u2019s shared physical and functional attributes with the hospital, as well as the available facilities such as elevators, delivery locations and existing means of ingress to and egress from the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">McSweeney added that, although nursing homes are permitted in a residential zone of the Borough, the zone was fully developed and it was not feasible to demolish existing structures for the purpose of constructing a nursing home facility. He also stated that the nursing home would have a negligible impact on sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>rounding properties, since no exterior renovations of the building would take place, no additional parking was necessary, and existing ingress to and egress from the site would not be changed. It was his view that there would be no impairment to the intent and purpose of the zoning plan and no adverse effect on the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Several members of the Point Pleasant community testified in opposition to the application, focusing on the detrimental effect to the community if the hospital\u2019s emergency room and acute-care services were phased out by Meridian. Board members asked Meridian\u2019s counsel whether Meridian would be willing to agree to a condition to the special reasons variance that the level of services at the hospital would not change. Meridian\u2019s attorney rejected the offer, reasoning that the nursing home application should be considered on its own merits without consideration of any plans by Meridian to decommission or convert the present acute-care facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The Board denied the application. Instead of focusing on the positive and negative criteria associated with the proposed nursing home use, the Board stressed Meridian\u2019s plan to phase out acute care at the hospital. In its resolution, the Board found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">the relief requested by applicant ... cannot be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the zone plan and Zoning Ordinance of the Borough of Point Pleasant, for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">1. That the conversion of hospital beds for nursing home beds is part of a systematic dismantling of hospital services at Point Pleasant Hospital to the greater detriment of the Point Pleasant community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">2. Every hospital bed that is replaced with a nursing home bed effectively downsizes or eliminates potential acute care beds to be utilized at that location in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">3. The hospital is a greater inherently beneficial use than the nursing home and utilization of the hospital zone for nursing home care works to eliminate the greater inherently beneficial use to the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">4. The hospital will not commit to, nor guarantee any level of services at the hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Meridian filed an action in lieu of prerogative writs challenging the validity of the hospital zone of the ordinance, arguing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ordinance arbitrarily excluded nursing homes from the zone. It also challenged the denial of its special reasons variance, claiming that the Board exceeded its powers in considering Meridian\u2019s potential plan to decommission acute care at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Addressing the denial of the variance first, the trial judge upheld the Board\u2019s decision. Applying the balancing test addressed in <em>Sica v. Board of Adjustment, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>152, 165, 603 A.2d 30 (1992), the judge found that the Board properly identified the \u201cpublic interest at stake\u201d to be the \u201cpotential elimination of a permitted beneficial hospital use.\u201d The judge observed that the \u201celimination of potential hospital beds in the future was a detriment to the public health, safety and welfare.\u201d The judge also cited Meridian\u2019s refusal to accept \u201creasonable conditions\u201d that the present acute-care facility be maintained if the variance was approved, reasoning that \u201cthis condition could have effectively reduced the detrimental [ejffeet of the granting of the variance by insuring that ... the integrity of the hospital zone would continue into the future.\u201d The trial judge also upheld the ordinance, concluding that the Borough had drawn a \u201creasonable distinction between hospitals and nursing homes,\u201d noting that nursing homes are permitted in other zones of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Since the Law Division judgment, Meridian applied for and received a- conditional Certificate of Need on October 9, 1998, to decommission all licensed acute-care services at the hospital and to transfer the services to Meridian\u2019s Brick Hospital situate in contiguous Brick Township. However, the Commissioner conditioned his approval upon Meridian maintaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">24-hour coverage at an urgent care facility located at the ... Point Pleasant site. The services provided at this site shall include, but not be limited to, laboratory, radiology, and EKG services. The site shall be staffed by physicians and support personnel trained and certified, as applicable, in emergency medicine. Specific services shall include, but not be limited to, care of fractured bones, sprains, first and second degree burns, head injuries without loss of consciousness, asthma and pulmonary episodes, gastrointestinal ailments, and any other care that does not require the use of a full service emergency room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The basic zoning principles implicated here are well-settled. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d authorizes a board of adjustment to grant a variance and permit a nonconforming use of zoned property \u201c[i]n particular cases for special reasons.... \u201d Before a board grants the variance, it must find that: (1) \u201cspecial reasons\u201d exist for the variance (the \u201cpositive\u201d criteria); and (2) the variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance (the \u201cnegative\u201d criteria). <em>Ibid.; Burbridge v. Governing Body, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>376, 384-85, 568 A.2d 527 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The term \u201cspecial reasons\u201d incorporates the purposes of zoning set forth in the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -136, including the goal of encouraging \u201cthe appropriate use or development of all lands ... in a manner which will promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2a; <em>see also Burbridge, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 386, 568 A.2d 527; <em>Kohl v. Mayor of Fair Lawn, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>268, 276 n. 3, 234 A.2d 385 (1967). Generally, the positive criteria test is satisfied if the applicant proves that the use promotes the general welfare because the proposed site is particularly suitable for the proposed use. <em>New Brunswick Cellular Tel. Co. v. Borough of South Plainfield Bd. of Adjustment, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 733 A.2d 442 (1999); <em>Smart SMR of N.Y., Inc. v. Borough of Fair Lawn Bd. of Adjustment, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>309, 323, 704 A.2d 1271 (1998). However, if the proposed use is inherently beneficial, an applicant\u2019s burden is lessened to a significant degree. \u201cAn inherently beneficial use presumptively satisfies the positive criteria.\u201d <em>Smart SMR of N.Y., Inc., supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 323, 704 A.2d 1271; <em>see also Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 526 A.2d 109 (1987) (listing eases involving inherently beneficial uses).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">There is little question in this case that the proposed nursing home is an inherently beneficial use. <em>See Mercurio v. DelVecchio, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 336-37, 666 A.2d 1368 (App.Div.) (expansion of existing nursing home promoted general welfare because a nurs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ing home is an inherently beneficial use), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>377, 676 A.2d 1092 (1996); <em>Urban Farms, Inc. v.

The Board in this ease concedes as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In a case where the proposal is not an inherently beneficial use, the negative criteria are satisfied if the variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and the applicant demonstrates through \u201can enhanced quality of proof ... that the variance sought is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the master plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Medici, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 526 A.2d 109. However, with an inherently beneficial use, the applicant need not meet <em>Medici\u2019s </em>enhanced quality of proof. <em>Smart SMR of N.Y., Inc., supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 323-24, 704 A.2d 1271; <em>Sica, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 160-61, 603 A.2d 30. Instead, a board must balance the positive and negative criteria to determine whether a variance should be granted. When striking that balance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">First, the board should identify the public interest at stake. Some uses are more compelling than others....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Second, the Board should identify the detrimental effect that will ensue from the grant of the variance____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">Third, in some situations, the local board may reduce the detrimental effect by imposing reasonable conditions on the use. If so, the weight accorded the adverse effect should be reduced by the anticipated effect of those restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">Fourth, the Board should then weigh the positive and negative criteria and determine whether, on balance, the grant of the variance would cause a substantial detriment to the public good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">[Sica, <em>supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 165-66, 603 A.2d 30 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">\u201cThis balancing, \u2018[w]hile properly making it more difficult for municipalities to exclude inherently beneficial uses, ... permits such exclusion when the negative impact of the use is significant. It also preserves the right of the municipality to impose appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ate conditions upon such uses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 603 A.2d 30 (quoting <em>Baptist Home v. Borough of Riverton, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 247, 492 A.2d 1100 (Law Div.1984)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The Board argues that the \u201cpublic interest at stake\u201d in this case is Meridian\u2019s proposed \u201csystematic dismantling\u201d of the hospital\u2019s acute-care facility. The Board\u2019s resolution is unambiguous on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">That the conversion of hospital beds for nursing home beds is part of a systematic dismantling of hospital services at Point Pleasant Hospital to the greater detriment of the Point Pleasant community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Fairly read, the Board\u2019s denial of Meridian\u2019s variance application was an attempt to compromise Meridian\u2019s statutory right to consolidate its health-care facility based on regional demand for services and cost-saving considerations. As such, the Board\u2019s denial of the variance application was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of its quasi-judicial powers. Preservation of the hospital\u2019s acute-care facility may indeed be Point Pleasant\u2019s goal. However, the Board exceeded its zoning powers by focusing on this public interest, rather than on the strict positive and negative considerations associated with the nursing home proposal itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Under <em>Sica, </em>\u201cthe public interest at stake\u201d refers to the qualitative worth of the proposed use in the context of how it will benefit the public. 127 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 603 A.2d 30 (noting that the benefits of some uses are so \u201ccompelling\u201d that the Legislature has removed such uses from the powers of local land-use boards; others may be sufficiently beneficial to satisfy the positive criteria, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and see examples cited therein). Thus, under <em>Sica, </em>the Board must decide whether the specific proposal, in this case the nursing home use, is sufficiently beneficial to outweigh the negative criteria. <em>Id. </em>at 165-66, 608 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Identifying the \u201cdetrimental effect that will ensue\u201d under the <em>Sica </em>balancing test, <em>id. </em>at 166, 603 A.2d 30, involves application of the negative criteria; that is, whether the variance \u201ccan be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d. The language \u201csubstantial detriment to the public good\u201d focuses on the proposed use\u2019s effect on the surrounding properties and \u201cwhether or not it will cause such damage to the character of the neighborhood as to constitute \u2018substantial detriment to the public good.\u2019\u201d <em>Medici, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 22 n. 12, 526 A.2d 109. The second prong requires the Board to decide whether the grant of the variance will \u201csubstantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance,\u201d that is, whether the proposed use is substantially consistent with the municipality\u2019s master plan and overall zoning scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 526 A.2d 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Board chose not to examine Meridian\u2019s application in the context of the above-described analysis under <em>Sica. </em>Instead, it presupposed that there was an interrelationship between the grant of the variance and Meridian\u2019s decommissioning of its acute-care facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The problem with the Board\u2019s findings is that the record fails to demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between the variance application and Meridian\u2019s decommissioning plan. Meridian\u2019s plan to convert to a nonacute health-care facility is based on a lack of demand for acute-care services at the hospital, as well as general market forces affecting health care on a regional and statewide basis. During the hearing, Meridian established, without contradiction, that 330 beds licensed in 1990 had been reduced to 136 by 1997, and, as of the time of the Board proceedings, only 50 beds were staffed and in use. The third and fourth floors of the north <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>wing, where the nursing home would be situated, had been empty for over eighteen months. Meridian\u2019s officials made it clear to the Board that any decommissioning plan would proceed whether or not the variance for the nursing home was approved. Thus, equating the introduction of nursing home beds into the hospital complex with the \u201csystematic dismantling\u201d of the acute-care facility is factually flawed. It is also legally flawed because the perceived negative impact from the loss of acute-care facilities results from consideration having nothing to do with zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The trial judge nevertheless concluded that the grant of the variance would frustrate the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance because the variance will \u201celiminate the potential for such space to be utilized for hospital purposes in the future.\u201d However, as noted, it is the absence of demand for acute care, not the application for a nursing home, that eliminated the use of beds for hospital purposes. Indeed, the judge himself observed at one point that \u201cthere\u2019s no reasonable probability based on the record that I\u2019ve seen so far that they\u2019re ever going to go back to using this as a full blown acute bed facility because there is no overriding public need for it.\u201d In short, nothing in the record even suggests that the nursing home will eliminate the potential for future use of the beds for acute care.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Meridian\u2019s decommissioning plan is subject to the strict scrutiny of the DHSS pursuant to the Health Care Facilities Planning Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-1 to -78, and its attendant regulations, <em>N.J.AC. </em>8:33. Meridian must meet the Certificate of Need requirements under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-8 and <em>N.J AC. </em>8:33-4.9, by satisfying the Commissioner that the plan may be implemented without an adverse financial impact on the delivery of health services in the region and state. The Commissioner must also consider the availability of nearby facilities to serve as alternate locations for in-patient acute care, <em>N.J.SA </em>26:2H-8(a), with the overall view of deciding whether the plan will contribute to the orderly development of adequate and effective health-care services.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Pursuant to this Certificate of Need procedure, it was the role of the DHSS, not a board of adjustment, to determine whether the phase-out of acute care at the hospital was acceptable and consistent with state law. That determination was to be made even if Meridian had not applied for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Nevertheless, the Board suggested that the grant of the variance to Meridian be conditioned upon Meridian agreeing to maintain the present level of services at the hospital. A zoning board \u201cmay reduce the detrimental effect [of a variance] by imposing reasonable conditions on the use.\u201d <em>Sica, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 166, 603 A.2d 30. However, a \u201ccondition\u201d to a variance is generally \u201cdevelopment-specific and [is] aimed at mitigating specific concerns arising in connection with the proposed project.\u201d William M. Cox, <em>New Jersey Zoning and Land Use Administration </em>\u00a7 28-4.1 (Gann, 1999). Such a condition \u201cmust be reasonably calculated to achieve some legitimate land use purpose.\u201d <em>Berninger v. Board of Adjustment, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 405, 603 A.2d 954 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>226, 603 A.2d 946 (1992); <em>see also </em>3 Rathkopf, <em>The Law of Zoning, </em>\u00a7 40.02 (4th ed.1987). Here, the proposed condition was not intended to carry out a legitimate land-use objective. Its purpose was to thwart Meridian\u2019s application to consolidate its health services, not to mitigate specific concerns about the proposed nursing home use.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Further, a zoning board cannot impose conditions on a special reasons variance that would intrude upon subject matters exclusively within the jurisdiction of a state agency. <em>Anfuso v. Seeley, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 368, 579 A.2d 817 (App.Div.1990); see <em>also Baptist Home, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 248, 492 A.2d 1100 (holding that \u201c[t]he rejection of a health care facility\u2019s variance application obviously interferes with State control over such facilities\u201d). Clearly, the proposed condition would have impinged upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the DHSS to determine whether the consolidation of Meridian\u2019s facility best served regional and statewide health-care needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Applying the <em>Sica </em>balancing test to the undisputed facts, we conclude that the Board\u2019s denial of Meridian\u2019s application was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. As stated, a nursing home is an inherently beneficial use. The \u201cpublic interest at stake\u201d is the introduction of a nursing home to the hospital facility to serve the needs of the region\u2019s aged and infirm as well as the Point Pleasant community. <em>See Urban Farms, Inc., supra, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 213, 431 A.2d 163 (holding that a land-use ordinance \u201cmust be regionally oriented in [its] provisions, prohibitions and concerns\u201d). The proposed nursing home shares \u201csignificant physical and functional attributes\u201d with the hospital use, even as converted to an urgent-care facility. <em>Jayber, Inc. v. Municipal Council, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 177-78, 569 A.2d 304 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>142, 584 A.2d 214 (1990). Meridian\u2019s Certificate of Need requires it to provide twenty-four hour diagnostic and nonacute care treatment by physicians and support personnel, including care of fractures, sprains, burns, head injuries, pulmonary episodes and gastrointestinal ailments. The nursing home itself will furnish food, shelter, nursing care, dietary and diagnostic services, recreational activity and supervision to a particularly vulnerable component of our society.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">On the record before us, there is also no legal or factual support for a finding that a \u201cdetrimental effect ... will ensue from the grant of the variance.\u201d <em>Sica, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 166, 603 A.2d 30. The footprint and outer structure of the hospital will remain unchanged; there will be no addition to the building or change in its facade. An enclosed courtyard will be converted to a recreational area. All ingress to and egress from the nursing home facility by patients and visitors will be through existing entrances and elevators. An alarm system and other devices will be employed to prevent unexpected access by patients to the outside area of the hospital facility. Traffic and parking needs will not be increased as a result of the nursing home use. No testimony was presented suggesting that the use will in any way affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>property values of the surrounding residential units. Notably, the Board made no findings concerning what negative impact would be suffered to the public or zoning scheme if the variance was granted. In short, weighing the positive and negative criteria, it cannot be said that the nursing home will \u201ccause a substantial detriment to the public good.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In view of our reversal of the denial of Meridian\u2019s special reasons variance application, we need not address Meridian\u2019s contention that the hospital zone designation in the Borough\u2019s ordinance is unconstitutional. <em>See Deal Gardens, Inc. v. Board of Trustees, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>492, 497-98, 226 A.2d 607 (1967) (holding that a court should generally \u201cdecline to adjudicate the attack upon the [zoning] ordinance until the owner has exhausted his remedy before the board of adjustment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in Meridian\u2019s favor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\">A 1997 amendment to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d codifies the <em>Sica </em>balancing test.
