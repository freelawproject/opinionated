During the fourteen months it owned Diesel, a 134-pound Rottweiler trained as an attack dog for prisoner control, the dog bit prison guards on five separate occasions. Despite Diesel\u2019s demonstrated propensity for unprovoked attacks on humans, LCP brought Diesel to New Jersey and gave him to defendant Guard Dogs Unlimited, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (\u201cGuard Dogs\u201d). LCP did not disclose Diesel\u2019s vicious disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Within a month, Diesel attacked and bit plaintiff Martin Abbott, an independent contractor working for Guard Dogs in New Jersey. And less than a month later, again in New Jersey, Diesel attacked and bit the principal of Guard Dogs, plaintiff Glen Curt Reynolds. Neither attack was provoked; both were savage, sudden and unexpected, and the plaintiffs suffered grievous personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The cases were tried together to a jury. The jury rejected a claim of fraud but found LCP liable to plaintiffs for the tort of negligent misrepresentation involving risk of physical harm. It also found Guard Dogs liable to Abbott under the dog-bite statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-16, and because Guard Dogs had negligently failed to discover and disclose to Abbott the dog\u2019s history. In Abbott\u2019s case, the jury assessed comparative fault at 85% for LCP and 15% for Guard Dogs. In Reynolds\u2019 case, the jury assessed comparative fault at 75% for LCP and 25% for Mr. Reynolds. The jury assessed Abbott\u2019s damages at $1,500,000, Mr. Reynolds\u2019 damages at $1,400,000, and Mrs. Reynolds\u2019 damages for her <em>per quod </em>claim at $250,000. Following an assortment of post-trial motions, which were all denied by the trial court, and a molding of the verdicts to reflect the comparisons of fault, judgment was entered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Defendant LCP appealed based on the following contentions: (1) it was entitled to a directed verdict because plaintiffs failed to prove the tort of negligent misrepresentation and because of the immunity allegedly provided by the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act of Pennsylvania (\u201cPSTCA\u201d); (2) it was entitled to application of the $500,000 damages-cap of the PSTCA; and (3) it was entitled to a new trial because the verdicts were excessive and because the trial court erred in the admission of certain evidence and in its charge on that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Defendant Guard Dogs also appealed. It contends that (1) Abbott was not entitled to recover because of his status as an independent contractor; (2) the trial court\u2019s charge on the independent contractor defense was erroneous; (3) the court erred in failing to charge assumption of the risk; (4) the liability verdict was against the weight of the evidence; and (5) the damage award was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Plaintiff Abbott filed a cross-appeal in which he argues (1) under the dog-bite statute he was entitled to a judgment permitting him to seek 100% of his damages from Guard Dogs; and (2) under the Offer of Judgment Rule, <em>R. </em>4:58, he was entitled to reimbursement from Guard Dogs for his attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">As a preliminary matter, we take note of our obligation \u201cto accept as true all evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict and to draw all reasonable inferences in its favor wherever reasonable minds could differ.\u201d <em>Harper-Lawrence, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Mfrs., Inc., </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 559, 619 A.2d 623 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>478, 634 A.2d 525 (1993) (citing <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5, 258 A.2d 706 (1969)). With that principle in mind, these are the facts bearing on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">LCP, a public entity of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a maximum security prison. In 1994 and 1995, its correction offi.cers used trained attack dogs to assist in controlling the prisoners. By early March 1994, the prison had obtained a 134r-pound Rottweiler named Diesel. The dog was assigned for training to Corrections Officer Kenneth Geib. By August, although the dog was still in training, Geib began to use him for prisoner control. Over the next nine months, Geib and Diesel participated in numerous situations involving prisoner violence. In each instance, the dog performed properly, but he was involved in five other incidents in which he bit corrections officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The first incident occurred a few days after Diesel arrived at the prison. During a training session, when Geib pulled on the dog\u2019s leash to stop him from barking at another dog, he turned and bit Geib on the finger. The second incident occurred in June 1994, when Diesel was being trained by another officer, Robert Barley. When Barley pulled on the leash to correct poor behavior, the dog jumped him, biting the clothing covering his chest and then his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The remaining incidents all involved Geib. On October 6, 1994, Diesel bit Geib on both arms during a training session. On April 20, 1995, Geib noticed that Diesel and another dog were \u201cbarking and going nuts on each other\u201d and he \u201ccalled him to come back in his run____\u201d Diesel jumped on him and \u201c[t]hen he came back up and he bit me in my left arm____\u201d The fifth incident occurred on April 28, 1995. Geib found Diesel facing another dog that was on the other side of a screen. When Geib reached down to pull Diesel away, the dog \u201cspun around and he did immediately bite me in my arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">After each bite, Geib submitted to his supervisor an \u201cUnusual Activity Report.\u201d After the last attack, Geib included within his report a recommendation to get rid of Diesel. He wrote: \u201cBased on my experience as handler, I feel there is an irreversible medical problem with K-9 Diesel and recommend K-9 Diesel be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>removed from the program.\u201d On the bottom of that form, Geib\u2019s supervising officer, Sergeant Alan Himmelsbach, wrote that he agreed with Geib and that \u201cK-9 Diesel is a Liability! Suggest K-9 Diesel Be Put Down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Guard Dogs, a New Jersey corporation, owned about fifty guard dogs which it rented to businesses to secure their premises at night. During the day, the dogs were either kept in kennels at various locations in New Jersey, or were maintained by Guard Dogs in kennels located on customers\u2019 premises. At night, the dogs were either brought to the customers\u2019 premises or, if kept there, were released for patrol. In the morning, the handlers returned the dogs to their kennels, fed them, and cleaned the premises. Guard Dogs also rented the second floor of a warehouse in Newark where it kept supplies and had a single kennel.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Reynolds, an experienced dog trainer, decided to employ Abbott in early 1994 as an independent contractor to assemble kennels, cover the tops of outdoor kennels with roofing, and to perform other odd jobs. Later in 1994, Reynolds trained Abbott to handle dogs. Soon Abbott became Reynolds\u2019 \u201cright-hand man.\u201d Confident in Abbott\u2019s abilities to run the company\u2019s daily operations, Reynolds moved to Maine but kept a residence in New Jersey. Although Reynolds maintained daily contact with Abbott and continued to supervise the business, Abbott took on the responsibility of supervising the other dog handlers and maintaining the kennels and dog houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In late April or within the first few days of May 1995, Sergeant Himmelsbach decided to offer Diesel to Guard Dogs. When he spoke to Reynolds by telephone, he said that the prison had a dog that needed to be placed and immediately referred Reynolds to Geib. According to Reynolds\u2019 testimony, Geib told him that Diesel had become increasingly aggressive toward other dogs and, as a result, was unsuitable for the prison. Geib added that the dog had been \u201cvery well trained. He had been through obedience and protection training as well as agility training\u201d and had been \u201ccertified.\u201d Reynolds asked for \u201ca rundown on what the problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>were and just any details that he thought would be important for us to know.\u201d He also asked if the dog had ever bitten anyone. Geib replied that on one occasion, when he was breaking up a dog fight, Diesel \u201cnipped\u201d him. Geib\u2019s testimony confirmed Reynolds\u2019 description of this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Shortly thereafter, at Reynolds\u2019 direction, Abbott arranged to meet Geib on May 6,1995, at Exit 6 of the New Jersey Turnpike, to take possession of Diesel. When they met, Geib told Abbott that the dog was tranquilized because he did not \u201ctravel well.\u201d He said the dog was friendly toward people. He emphasized the point by adding that sometimes the dog was shown to prison visitors, and that on one occasion the dog had approached a woman visitor and had leaned against her leg. Abbott admitted that Geib also told him of an incident in which he was nipped by the dog and showed him a small, stitched wound on his arm. According to Abbott, Geib explained that he received the bite while breaking up a dog fight. The dog was placed in a crate in Abbott\u2019s truck, and Geib concluded the transaction by handing Abbott a sealed manilla envelope containing Diesel\u2019s certificates and his veterinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Although Reynolds was unsure about when he looked at the contents of the manilla envelope, it was definitely after the attack on Abbott. The veterinarian\u2019s record revealed one of the earlier attacks by Diesel. Reynolds testified that had he known about the five attacks, he would not have accepted the dog. He also said that had he known that the dog had two attacks on people within eight days before the day of the transfer, he absolutely would not have accepted the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Abbott brought Diesel to the Newark warehouse and placed him in the kennel. In accordance with Reynolds\u2019 instructions, Abbott began to bond with Diesel in preparation for becoming his handler. During the first two weeks, that process involved feeding, watering, talking to, and just being around the dog. Later, he exercised the dog by walking him around the warehouse floor, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>on at least one occasion he took the dog with him for a ride in his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On the morning of May 31,1995, Abbott cleaned Diesel\u2019s kennel, fed and watered him, latched the kennel gate, and left to perform other duties. Around 3:00 p.m., Abbott returned to the warehouse to pick up some tools. As he started gathering the tools, he sensed that something was behind him. Turning, he saw Diesel standing outside his kennel. The dog rushed him, bit down on his arm, and would not let go. Abbott described the attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">I felt the teeth sink in my arm and I tried to ... pull my arm out of the dog\u2019s mouth, but he just kept biting down harder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">I tried to tighten the collar up enough to choke him. And that didn\u2019t work____ [I thought] I was going to die.... I got him to the edge of the building where I could stand him in the comer____ I was already covered with blood at that time. And I had a pair of high boots on and I could feel the blood squishing between my toes at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">So I got him stood up and I leaned against him. And at that time I tried to choke him again \u2019cause I had a better hold and it didn\u2019t bother him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">So I get to the point where I just looked down and I could just see the jaws going up and down on my arm____ And I could just feel him crunching on my bone....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-16\">I drove my fingers in his eye sockets ... [and] squeezed my fingers together in his head____ [H]is jaw had actually let go enough off my bone____ And then I ripped my arm out of his mouth and I still had a hold in his eye sockets. At that point I dragged him to the kennel and dragged him back inside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">Abbott then managed to get down to the loading dock, where he met a man who called for an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-20\">Reynolds learned of the attack and immediately returned to New Jersey. Although he testified that he had only taken Diesel on a trial basis, reserving the unexpressed option of returning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>dog to LCP, he never called the prison to arrange for the dog\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">He reinforced the kennel by putting a top on it, by adding or replacing the latch, and by placing a chain and padlock on the gate. During the next three weeks, he kept the dog in the kennel, providing food and water, and cleaning away the dog\u2019s droppings.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On June 24, 1995, Reynolds, having decided to bring Diesel to the ASPCA, entered the warehouse and approached the dog\u2019s kennel. This is his description of the ensuing attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">I opened the kennel door slightly, about an inch and a half, just enough to slide the kennel pole through the crack and gate. And ... he was well within reach of the kennel pole and I just reached in to put it around his neck. He wasn\u2019t growling or barking or, you know, or going crazy but he moved just enough to avoid the ... noose on the kennel pole and put his head down and he almost rammed the gate____ And he hit hard enough to ... push me backwards and force his way through the kennel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">As he did that, he ... slipped and went down. And when he came up, it was obvious that he had focused on me. And was in an aggressive approach. And he was ... coming up in my groin area. And started to attempt to bite me in the groin area. And so I used the kennel pole to deflect his attack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">I started to back up and I was trying to pull my gun. And he jumped and hit me in the chest and knocked me over backwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">[He] grabbed me in my biceps area and just basically swallowed my whole arm here. And he started to chew____ I yelled at him. I told him out. I told him ous. I gave him German commands. And it had absolutely no effect on him. He just continued to hold his grip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">I then started to talk to him. I tried, you know, soothe him a little bit so that, you know, I could maybe, you know, get him to calm down and so my tone changed and I was saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Diesel. It\u2019s okay.\u201d And then I could feel that he was chewing on my arm____ And I felt my ... arteries or muscle snap____ I knew I was in trouble. And I started to bleed all over the place. Blood was squirting in my face. It was all over the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-18\">And so I took my left hand and I shoved it into his eyes as far as I could____ [I]t didn\u2019t do any good at all so I took my fingers out of his eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-20\">And I rolled over on top of him and I grabbed him by the throat and I choked him until he passed out____ I remember grabbing him by the nose and opening his mouth so that I could get my arm out of his teeth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-23\">And I stood up and I was able to get my gun out. And I was trying to shoot him. I had my gun out and I was trying to squeeze the trigger____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>But I didn\u2019t have enough strength in my right hand to pull the trigger. And so he woke up and he bit me in the left leg. And he had a hold of my left leg. And he was trying to sink his teeth into the top. He had already gotten his teeth to tear the skin on the side of my leg....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">And so I looked over at my arm and I had tom skin and my muscles were hanging out and I was bleeding all over the place. And I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to hold my gun still enough to shoot him so I switched hands. And I shot him ... in the top of the back with my left hand. And he let go and he bit me in the right ankle again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">And I shot him a second time and he let go of my right ankle. And he started to run. And so I shot him again a third time when he was about 10 or 15 feet away from me....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Reynolds then followed the dog, found him at the entry door, sitting, but still alive. When another shot, this time to the dog\u2019s head, did not cause death, Reynolds got a kennel pole, put the noose around the dog\u2019s neck, and dragged him back to the kennel. He secured the kennel, made his way outside, and entered his truck. As he was trying to place a 911 call, his wife arrived. She went next door and called for help. When the ambulance did not arrive promptly, she drove her husband to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">LCP\u2019S LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">LCP was found liable for the tort of negligent misrepresentation involving risk of physical harm. It admitted at trial and concedes here that this tort is recognized as common law by Pennsylvania and New Jersey; however, on appeal it introduced the new contention that the tort was inapplicable because it owed plaintiffs no duty. In the alternative, it argues that even if it breached a common law duty, as a matter of choice-of-law or comity, we should apply the Pennsylvania Public Subdivision Tort Claims Act (\u201cPSTCA\u201d), 42 <em>Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8541 and 8542, which it claims provides immunity. We reject these contentions, and we also reject LCP\u2019s further argument that the PSTCA\u2019s $500,000 limitation on compensatory damages should be given recognition as a matter of comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>A. THE TORT OF NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">LCP claims that plaintiffs\u2019 negligence action fails because they did not establish a special relationship giving rise to a duty of care. The tort of negligent misrepresentation involving risk of physical harm is defined in <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 311 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">(1) One who negligently gives false information to another is subject to liability for physical harm caused by action taken by the other in reasonable reliance upon such information, where such harm results</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">(a) to the other, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">(b) to such third persons as the actor should expect to be put in peril by the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">action taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">(2) Such negligence may consist of failure to exercise reasonable care</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">(a) in ascertaining the accuracy of the information, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">(b) in the manner in which it is communicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">\u201cPennsylvania has long recognized the common law tort of negligent [misrepresentation,\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Ernst, </em>538 <em>Pa. </em>193, 647 A.2d 882, 891 (1994), and its intermediate appellate courts have specifically accepted section 311 as law. <em>Rice v. Bell Tel. Co., </em>362 <em>Pa.Super. </em>312, 524 A.2d 522, 524 (1987); <em>English v. Lehigh County Auth, </em>286 <em>Pa.Super. </em>312, 428 A.2d 1343, 1356-57 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">Although New Jersey has not yet considered section 311, we have recognized the tort of negligent misrepresentation in other contexts, <em>see, e.g., Carroll v. Cellco Partnership, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>488, 502, 713 A.2d 509 (App.Div.1998), <em>United Jersey Bank v. Kensey, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 553-54, 704 A.2d 38 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>402, 709 A.2d 795 (1998), and <em>Berry v. Playboy Enters., Inc., </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 529-32, 480 A.2d 941 (App.Div.1984), <em>certif. denied, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>231, 491 A.2d 720 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">In deciding whether section 311 should be applied to the gift of a vicious dog, we are guided by the general principles described in <em>Dunphy v. Gregor, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>99, 642 A.2d 372 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">The imposition of a duty is the conclusion of a rather complex analysis that considers the relationship of the parties, the nature of the risk \u2014 that is, its foreseeability and severity \u2014 and the impact the imposition of a duty would have on public policy. Ultimately, whether a duty exists is a matter of fairness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 108, 642 A.2d 372 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The Court also noted that it had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">recognized, in numerous settings, that traditional principles of tort liability can be adapted to address areas in which recognition of a cause of action and the imposition of a duty of care are both novel and controversial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 109, 642 A.2d 372 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Application of the traditional tort of negligent misrepresentation to the gift of a vicious dog is neither novel nor controversial. Apart from section 311\u2019s longstanding, though implicit, recognition of this cause of action, fairness and common sense dictate endorsement of the principle in this context. LCP knew of the dog\u2019s nature. The risk of attack was unquestionably foreseeable since the dog had already bitten its handlers on five occasions. Considering the dog\u2019s size, temperament, and training as an attack dog, there was a grave risk to plaintiffs of severe personal injury. Finally, imposition of the duties set forth in section 311 in this instance would enhance the public policy, recognized by our common law and dog-bite statute, of protecting the public from vicious dogs. <em>See DeRobertis v. Randazzo, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>144, 150-55, 462 A.2d 1260 (1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that section 311 expresses a common law doctrine applicable to any transfer of a vicious dog in this state. Under that section, the duty of care arises whenever the elements of the tort are proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">B. LCP\u2019S IMMUNITY CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Relying on the principles of comity and choice-of-law, LCP demands full immunity under the PSTCA or, at least, a reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>of plaintiffs\u2019 damage claims to the limits of liability established by the PSTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u201cComity is not a binding obligation on the forum state, but a courtesy voluntarily extended to another state for reasons of \u2018practice, convenience and expediency.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Philadelphia v. Austin, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>55, 64, 429 A.2d 568 (1981) (citation omitted).

The next section, 8542(a), provides that a local agency may be held liable if (1) the \u201cdamages would be recoverable under common law or a statute\u201d in an action against a nongovernmental person or entity; or (2) \u201c[t]he injury was caused by the negligent acts of the local agency or an employee thereof acting within the scope of his office or duties with respect to one of the categories listed in subsection (b).\u201d One of the categories of activity listed in section 8542(b) is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>(8) Care, custody or control of animals. \u2014 The care, custody or control of animals in the possession or control of a local agency, including but not limited to police dogs and horses.

This argument overlooks the nature of the tort of negligent misrepresentation involving risk of physical harm. Under this tort, LCP\u2019s conduct must be evaluated in relation to the time when the negligent misrepresentations were made. <em>Cf. Kelly v.

At that time, LCP was in possession of the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">LCP has provided no Pennsylvania authority suggesting immunity in these circumstances. On the other hand, a plain reading of the statute establishes LCP\u2019s exposure to liability. In short, transfer of an animal is an act relating to the custody or control of that animal. If misrepresentations have been made in that regard by public employees, acting within the scope of their employment, and those misrepresentations reasonably induce another to accept the transfer, there is no immunity when the misrepresentations are a proximate cause of injury caused by the animal. Thus, neither comity nor choice-of-law is implicated on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">LCP\u2019s alternative argument is that it should at least receive the benefit of the PSTCA\u2019s $500,000 limitation on damages. 42 <em>Pa.

THE ADMISSION OF THE OPINION EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">LCP argues that the trial court erred in permitting into evidence those portions of the Unusual Activity Reports which contained opinions of its officers. The specific references were to comments that the dog was a \u201cliability\u201d or had \u201cirreversible medical problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">These opinions were not admissible to prove the truth of the matters asserted. <em>Liptak v. Rite Aid, Inc., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 221-22, 673 A.2d 309 (App.Div.1996). But they were relevant to the fraud count. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>17, 26, 134 A.2d 761 (1957) (indicating that expressions of opinion given by one who has secured the confidence of the victim or holds himself out as having special knowledge of the matter may support a claim of fraud). Here, the officers indicated that the dog was friendly towards people, withholding the contrary views expressed in their reports. The opinions were also relevant to the negligent misrepresentation claim, since having those views was inconsistent with the decision to give the dog away instead of killing him, and with the nature of the officers\u2019 communications to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">When evidence is admissible for one purpose but is not admissible for another purpose, \u201cthe judge, <em>upon request, </em>shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and shall instruct the jury accordingly----\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>105 (emphasis added). Although the judge had indicated that he would give a limiting instruction, he did not. However, no limiting instruction was submitted by LCP and no objection was taken to the failure of the judge to give a limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The failure to give a limiting charge may be recognized as plain error only if it had the clear capacity of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Officer Geib explained to the jury that he had no basis for his comment that the dog had \u201cirreversible medical problems.\u201d And, indeed, it was quite apparent that Geib was not expressing a medical opinion and that, as he said, the comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>simply reflected his anger at having been bitten again. Himmelsbach was permitted to explain that he had used the word \u201cliability\u201d only to mean that the dog was of no use to the prison and could no longer be housed in.the kennels. But of overarching importance is the simple fact that the evidence of Diesel\u2019s viciousness was overwhelmingly established by the uncontested evidence that he had bitten his handlers on five separate occasions, two of which were only days before the transfer took place. In these circumstances, we cannot say that the introduction of the opinions without a limiting instruction had the clear capacity to produce an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">THE LIABILITY OF GUARD DOGS</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The jury found Guard Dogs liable to Abbott under the dog-bite statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-16,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and under the common law for negligence. Guard Dogs contends that it was entitled to a directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. because of Abbott\u2019s stipulated status as an independent contractor. We are called upon to determine the duty of a dog owner to an independent contractor who is bitten while carrying out his contractual obligation to care for the dog on the owner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Generally, a landowner must use reasonable care to protect independent contractors against \u201cknown or reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>discoverable dangers.\u201d <em>Kane v. Hartz Mountain Indus., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 140, 650 A.2d 808 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>141, 669 A.2d 816 (1996); <em>Accardi v. Enviro-Pak Sys. Co., </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 462, 722 A.2d 578 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>685, 731 A.2d 45 (1999). But that duty does not extend to protecting the independent contractor \u201cfrom the very hazard created by doing the contract work.\u201d <em>Sanna v. National Sponge Co., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>60, 67, 506 A.2d 1258 ( App.Div.1986). The landowner is not obliged to eliminate \u201coperational hazards which are obvious and visible to the invitee upon ordinary observation and which are part of or incidental to the very work the contractor was hired to perform.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Guard Dog argues that since Abbott had been hired as an independent contractor to care for and train the dog, and since any dog may bite, there should be no liability because the hazard of being bitten was an obvious operational risk of the contract. The problem with that syllogism is that it is based on a mistaken concept of the hazard presented by this dog. This case does not involve the ordinary risk that a dog may bite; it involves the hazard presented by a vicious dog whose nature has not been disclosed. In that context, the analysis becomes more complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In <em>Emmons v. Stevane, </em>77 <em>N.J.L. </em>570, 73 A. 544 (E. &amp; A1908), the Court considered the liability of a dog owner to an independent contractor who had agreed to board the dog and was bitten without warning when she placed her hand on the dog\u2019s head. The owner had told plaintiff the dog was gentle even though he knew the dog was vicious. The Court held plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from the owner because \u201cthe owner of an animal having vicious habits ... is bound to disclose them (if known to him) to a bailee. Such is the case when a person leaves his horse with a blacksmith to be shod.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 73 A. 544. The Court, however, also indicated an exception to that rule: proof that the \u201cbailee was chargeable with knowledge of [the animal\u2019s] true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>disposition\u201d would relieve the owner of liability. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 73 <em>A. </em>544.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Emmons, </em>decided under the common law doctrine of absolute liability, is not directly implicated here because there is no evidence that Guard Dogs knew or \u201chad reason to know of the dog\u2019s abnormally dangerous characteristics.\u201d <em>DeRobertis, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 153, 462 A.2d 1260. Guard Dogs, like Abbott, was misled by LCP. However, the case is significant because it rejects the notion that an independent contractor who agrees to care for a domestic animal assumes the risk of being attacked when the animal\u2019s vicious nature has been concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Since common law absolute liability is not involved here, we turn to plaintiffs cause of action under the dog-bite statute and the contention that primary assumption of the risk bars recovery. To establish liability under the statute, a plaintiff must prove that defendant was the dog owner, that he was bitten, and that the bite occurred while he was in a public place, or lawfully in a private place, including the property of the owner. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 462 A.2d 1260. The only defense previously recognized is that plaintiff unreasonably and voluntarily exposed himself to a known risk. <em>Pingara v. Rossi, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 505, 731 A.2d 523 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Guard Dogs recognizes the inapplicability of that defense, since Abbott was bitten while he was picking up tools a substantial distance from the kennel and was completely unaware of the grave risk presented by the dog\u2019s presence in the warehouse, but it contends that Abbott\u2019s independent contractor status bars recovery since he knew that any dog might bite.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The reliance of Guard Dogs on Abbott\u2019s status has some merit. In ordinary circumstances, when a dog is delivered for care to an independent contractor the owner is entitled to rely on the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk. <em>Cf. Del Tufo v. Township of Old Bridge, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>90, 112, 685 A.2d 1267 (1996). Thus, for example, in <em>Nelson v. Hall, </em>165 <em>Cal.App</em>.3d 709, 211 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Cal.Rptr. </em>668 (1985), the court held under its dog-bite statute that \u201ca dog owner who does no more than turn his or her dog over to a qualified veterinarian for medical treatment should not be held strictly liable when the dog bites [the] veterinarian____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673. The court explained that liability would not be imposed because the veterinarian is \u201caware of the risk that <em>any </em>dog, regardless of its previous nature, might bite while being treated, ... determines the method of treatment and handling of the dog ... and is in the best position to take necessary precautions____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But the court also said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">[I]f a dog owner purposefully or negligently conceals a particular known hazard from a veterinarian, he or she would not be relieved of liability, for this would expose the injured person to an unknown risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 673 n. 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The analysis of the <em>Nelson </em>court is sound. And since a veterinarian has all the characteristics of an independent contractor, <em>Nelson </em>should apply to other independent contractors, such as Abbott, who agree to care for a dog. But' under <em>Nelson, </em>Abbott\u2019s recovery would be barred because of the lack of evidence that the unusual hazard presented by Diesel was known to Guard Dogs. When a dog owner turns his dog over to an independent contractor who has agreed to care for the dog, the owner is not liable under the dog-bite statute when the dog bites the independent contractor unless the owner knew, or had reason to know, the dog was vicious and withheld that information. Similarly, under the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk, as described in <em>Emmons, supra, </em>it would appear that an owner would not be liable under the statute to an independent contractor who undertakes the care of a domestic animal with knowledge that it is particularly dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Guard Dogs, however, cannot avoid liability because the judgment was also based on common law negligence. Without objection, the judge charged that Abbott could prevail on proof that Guard Dogs was negligent in failing to ascertain the dog\u2019s propensity for violence and in providing an appropriate warning to Abbott. Although unstated during trial, the premise for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>charge was that Guard Dogs had a duty to its independent contractor to make a reasonable investigation of the dog\u2019s history before turning the dog over to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Ultimately, whether a duty exists is a matter of fairness, depending on a consideration of the \u201crelationship of the parties, the nature of the risk \u2014 that is, its foreseeability and severity \u2014 and the impact the imposition of a duty would have on public policy.\u201d <em>Dunphy v. Gregor, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 642 A.2d 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Those considerations support the imposition of the duty of reasonable inquiry in the peculiar circumstances of this case. Although Abbott was an independent contractor, Guard Dogs held the dominant position and made the decision to accept the dog. Abbott reasonably relied on his employer\u2019s judgment respecting the amenability of the dog for guard work. Since Guard Dogs knew the dog was trained to attack humans, had bitten his trainer on one occasion, and was so aggressive toward other dogs that the prison had determined him to be undesirable after some fourteen months of training and use, the imposition of the duty imposed by the trial court appears reasonable. It gives force in this context to the landowner\u2019s duty to protect an independent contractor against dangers reasonably discoverable by the landowner. And it is particularly appropriate since the special hazards presented by this dog were neither \u201cobvious [nor] visible.\u201d <em>Sanna, supra, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 67, 506 A.2d <em>1258.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Guard Dogs takes issue with the judge\u2019s charge on Abbott\u2019s contributory negligence and his failure to charge assumption of the risk. These issues need not be addressed because there was no evidence to support either defense. Although Abbott assumed the risk that any dog might bite, he did not assume the risk of working with a vicious dog, and his mere presence at the warehouse to pick up his tools did not warrant a charge on contributory negligence. Therefore, the alleged errors could not have prejudiced the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Guard Dogs also argues that it was entitled to judgment n.o.v. or a new trial because the liability verdict was against the weight of the evidence. More particularly, it claims it was not negligent because its principal, Mr. Reynolds, asked for the dog\u2019s history and was misled. The jury rejected the contention that Reynolds was justified in relying on the information he received from Geib, a prison guard and the dog\u2019s trainer. Given the dog\u2019s history, as related by Geib, a reasonable jury could well have concluded that further inquiry was required \u2014 that, for example, the accuracy of Geib\u2019s information should have been confirmed with superior authorities within the prison. Therefore, the judge correctly denied both motions. <em>See Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969); <em>R. </em>4:49-l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\n<em>TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">THE EXCESSIVE DAMAGES CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Both defendants unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on damages on the ground that the damage verdicts were excessive.

As in the trial court, we \u201cmust consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing parties].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>With those principles in mind, we turn first to Abbott\u2019s damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The dog did not simply bite Abbott\u2019s arm and let go; it chewed on his arm, biting down with increasing force, causing Abbott to be covered with blood and to believe that he might die.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The bite damaged about 30% of Abbott\u2019s left arm muscles, and 15% of those muscles had to be removed. Abbott spent fourteen days in the hospital and was subjected to four operations. At times, his treatment caused excruciating pain. He has extensive scars, permanent weakness in his left arm and hand, permanent diminished sensation in several fingers, and nerve and muscle damage. His arm \u201creally throbs and hurts in the cold weather\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u201cafter an hour\u2019s work.\u201d He is self-conscious about his deformity. The experience caused post-traumatic stress disorder, as indicated by his recurring nightmares, depression, alcohol dependency, and a sixty-pound weight gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Glen Curt Reynolds suffered a sustained and savage attack that resulted in numerous injuries. He spent six days in the hospital and was subjected to three surgeries, which included treatment of severed arteries and reattachment of part of his triceps muscle. He has two scars on his right arm, one that is three and a half inches long, and another that is two inches long. He has a scar that runs from his armpit to his elbow, and a four-inch sear on his left leg. He also has a puncture scar under his right arm and two puncture scars on his right ankle. He lost muscle tissue, and he suffers from some loss of function and decreased sensation in the right arm. From time to time, he continues to experience pain in his elbow, shoulder, and arm. He has difficulty sleeping, experiences nightmares, feels irritable, becomes highly emotional, and is fearful of dogs, all aspects of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Dionna Reynolds testified that the attack on her husband had dramatically affected their relationship. He has become irritable, insensitive to her feelings and needs, and less helpful with household chores. In accordance with a recommendation from her husband\u2019s psychologist, they no longer sleep in the same bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">A jury\u2019s assessment of damages may not be set aside unless clearly against the weight of the evidence. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the verdict must stand unless it shocks the judicial conscience. <em>Ibid. </em>Although the award to Dionna Reynolds may have been generous, it is not so high as to shock the conscience. The severe physical and emotional injuries suffered by Glen Curt Reynolds and Martin Abbott provided adequate support for their damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\n<em>V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">ABBOTT\u2019S CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Abbott\u2019s first point is that the trial court erred in refusing to enter judgment against Guard Dogs for the full amount of his damages despite the jury\u2019s determination that Guard Dog\u2019s share of the fault was only 15%. He claims entitlement to that result under the dog-bite statute, which he argues overrides the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.2. This point is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E). Moreover, as we have explained above, Guard Dogs was not liable to Abbott under the dog-bite statute; its liability was based on common law negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Abbott\u2019s second point is that he was entitled to recover from Guard Dogs his attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and interest under the offer-of-judgment rule, <em>R. </em>4:58. Before trial, Abbott had offered to settle with Guard Dogs for $500,000. The offer was refused and Abbott obtained a verdict against Guard Dogs for $225,000. The rule provides, in pertinent part, \u201cIn an action for negligence or unliquidated damages, however, no attorney\u2019s fee shall be allowed to the offeror unless the amount of the recovery is in excess of 120% of the offer.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:58-2. Since Abbott recovered less than he had demanded, the rule provides no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> Plaintiffs dismissed their negligence claims against the individual defendants employed by LCP. Their fraud claims against those individuals were rejected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the jury. Abbott dismissed his claim against Reynolds. Thus, the only parties with whom we are concerned are LCP, Guard Dogs, and the three plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-12\"> We note that LCP was not entitled to argue a lack of duty on appeal since the issue was never raised below. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indent. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. 229, </em>234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). Furthermore, LCP conceded in the trial court that plaintiffs had presented adequate proofs to support consideration of this claim by the jury. It cannot disavow that concession and argue to the contrary on appeal. <em>Brett v. Great Am. Recreation, Inc., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>479, 503, 677 A.2d 705 (1996); <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Vision Mortgage Corp., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 143, 689 A.2d 154 (App.Div.1997). Finally, the judge's charge was substantially in accord with the principles of section 311 and LCP expressed no objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> If we understood the Pennsylvania statute to provide immunity, we would reject its application here because our governmental policies of deterring tortious behavior within our borders and providing full protection to citizens negligently injured far outweigh Pennsylvania\u2019s interest in protecting its public purse. <em>Cf. Gantes v. Kason Corp., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>478, 679 A.2d 106 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-10\"> This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">The owner of any dog which shall bite a person while such person is on or in a public place, or lawfully on or in a private place, including the property of the owner of the dog, shall be liable for such damages as may be suffered by the person bitten, regardless of the former viciousness of such dog or the owner's knowledge of such viciousness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">For the purpose of this section, a person is lawfully upon the private property of such owner when he is on the property in the performance of any duty imposed upon him by the laws of this state or the laws or postal regulations of the United States, or when he is <em>on </em>such <em>property </em>upon the invitation, express or implied, of the owner thereof.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
