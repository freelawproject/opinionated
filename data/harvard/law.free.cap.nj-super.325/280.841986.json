We answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The issue arises in the following procedural and factual context. Following a jury trial, defendant Florence Castoran was convicted of third-degree aggravated assault upon a law enforcement officer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(5)(a). Judge Neustadter sentenced defendant to a custodial term of four years and imposed statutory penalties. As a condition of the sentence, defendant was barred from all Atlantic City casinos during the term of her sentence, although that portion of the sentence was later vacated. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">These are the facts adduced at trial. On April 16, 1996, at approximately 3:00 a.m., defendant was involved in an \u201cincident\u201d at the Sands Casino that caused her to be handcuffed and brought to the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) office located in the Sands. Defendant was escorted into the DGE office by two Sands security officers and seated in a chair in front of a desk. New Jersey State Police Detective Johanna Neupauer (Neupauer), assigned to the Response Team of the Casino Investigations Bureau, then seated herself behind the desk to process the paperwork relating to defendant\u2019s arrest. Immediately upon seeing Neupauer, however, defendant became combative and directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>profanities at Neupauer. Defendant admittedly called Neupauer a \u201cwhore,\u201d \u201ca liar, a perjurer\u201d and, possibly, \u201cwhite trash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Soon thereafter, while Neupauer was still filling out the paperwork, defendant rose from her chair and spat at Neupauer. At that point, Neupauer decided to handcuff defendant to the chair, and as Neupauer began to approach defendant, she kicked Neupauer in the arm, pushing her back against the desk. Defendant admitted that the contact occurred but contended that she believed Neupauer was going to beat her in the face. Defendant admitted raising her feet and pushing Neupauer away, allegedly for protection. In response to the contact, Neupauer and the two other officers \u201cput [defendant] down onto the rug,\u201d and then placed her into a jail cell. As a result of the incident, Neupauer stated that her right wrist was injured, and her right upper thigh was bruised.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">I. THE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY PRECLUDING THE DEFENDANT FROM WEARING THE CLOTHING OF HER CHOICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">II. THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION SHOULD BE REVERSED BECAUSE EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANT\u2019S PRIOR ARRESTS BY DETECTIVE NEUPAUER WAS OFFERED TO SHOW CRIMINAL PREDISPOSITION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">A. THE EVIDENCE WAS NOT RELEVANT TO A MATERIAL AND GENUINE ISSUE IN DISPUTE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">B. OMISSIONS IN THE COURT\u2019S CURATIVE INSTRUCTION WERE CLEARLY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING AN UNJUST RESULT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">III. THE COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL MADE PURSUANT TO <em>R. </em>3:20-1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">A. THE CUMULATION OF ERRORS WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE TRIAL HAD A CLEAR CAPACITY TO PREJUDICE THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\">B. THE DISCOVERY VIOLATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-15\">C. THE PROSECUTOR IMPROPERLY EXPRESSED HER PERSONAL OPINION IN SUMMATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-16\">IV. IMPOSITION OF A FOUR (4) YEAR SENTENCE WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION BY THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>A. THE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY MAKING REFERENCE TO NON-STATUTORY AGGRAVATING FACTORS IN IMPOSING SENTENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">B. IMPOSITION OF A FOUR YEAR SENTENCE WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION BY THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In a supplemental brief, defendant raised the following additional point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">I. THE ORDER BARRING DEFENDANT FROM ALL ATLANTIC CITY CASINOS SHOULD BE VACATED IN THIS CASE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Defendant filed a pro se brief raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">POINT I: DENIAL OF PRO SE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arh\">POINT II: PLEA OFFER BY STATE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4h\">POINT III: EXCESSIVE SENTENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">POINT IV: PROSECUTOR SUMMATION AND WITNESS CREDIBILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">POINT V: UPDATE ON MUNICIPAL COURT CASE RECORD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aih\">POINT VI: PRESENTENCE REPORT ERROR CORRECTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdA\">POINT VII: DEFENSE ON BASIS OF VICTIM OF VIOLENCE</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">With the exception of providing information as to a proposed plea agreement which was rejected by defendant (Point II); submission of disposition of municipal court complaints pending at the time of trial (Point V); and, a suggestion that defendant is entitled to raise the \u201cbattered woman\u2019s syndrome\u201d on this appeal, the issues raised by defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief were addressed in defense counsel\u2019s previously filed brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">Defendant first argues that the trial judge erred in requiring her to change her tee shirt prior to trial. At the commencement of the trial, defendant appeared in court wearing a tee shirt that contained the following language: \u201cAtlantic City Police Department, Atlantic City\u2019s Finest Liars.\u201d The back of the shirt contained additional language: \u201cPolice Brutality Victim, Atlantic City.\u201d The State moved to require defendant to change her tee shirt. Judge Neustadter agreed, noting that the content of the shirt was testimonial in nature and, although this case did not involve an Atlantic City officer, the interaction between the State Police and defendant was in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>We have repeatedly recognized that \u201c \u2018[a] trial judge has the ultimate responsibility to control the trial in the courtroom and is given wide discretion to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ryslik v. Brass, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 297, 652 A.2d 767 (App.Div.1995) (quoting <em>Horn v. Village Supermarkets, Inc., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 175, 615 A.2d 663 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>435, 627 A.2d 1141 (1993)). This discretion necessarily empowers the trial judge to maintain decorum and prevent conduct which may improperly impact on the trial process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201c[A] criminal trial, in the constitutional sense, cannot take place where the courtroom is a bedlam____ A courtroom is a hallowed place where trials must proceed with dignity.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>337, 351, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1057, 1064, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>353, 363 (1970) (Douglas, J. separate opinion). \u201cTo allow the disruptive activities of a defendant ... to prevent his trial is to allow him to profit from his own wrong. The Constitution would protect none of us if it prevented the courts from acting to preserve the very process that the Constitution itself prescribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1064, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 362-363. (Brennan, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\"><em>[State v. Vasky, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 98, 495 A.2d 1347 (App.Div.1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Included in this broad discretion is the authority to restrict dress or conduct which is impermissibly testimonial in nature. This rule applies to both the State and defendant. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rose, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>454, 541 \u2014 42, 548 A.2d 1058 (1988) (noting that the trial judge\u2019s obligation to insure that a trial is conducted fairly and impartially includes limitations on the dress of police or corrections officers during a trial). Dress that conveys a message to the jury and is germane to the subject matter of the jury\u2019s inquiry is particularly susceptible to scrutiny by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The Supreme Court of Colorado alluded to this principle in <em>Ryan v. Cronin, </em>191 <em>Colo. </em>487, 553 P.2d 754 (1976). Defendant was charged with an illegal disturbance and picketing related to a dispute with the Gallo Vineyards. <em>Id. </em>at 754. He appeared at trial wearing a button calling for the boycott of Gallo wines. When ordered to remove the button, he refused and was held in contempt. The Colorado court noted: \u201cThe trial court, in ruling that the button or pin should be removed, made it clear that the defendant\u2019s attempt to communicate with the jury by use of the pin or button was improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755. As here, the button was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>germane to the subject matter of the trial and conveyed testimonial information to the jury. <em>Cf. Frankel v. Roberts, </em>165 A.D.2d 382, 567 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1018 (permitting an attorney to wear a button supporting a strike where the proceeding did not involve jurors or witnesses), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>78 N.Y.2d 1071, 576 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>220, 582 <em>N.E.2d </em>603 (1991). <em>Compare Cohen v. California, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>15, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). In <em>Cohen, </em>defendant wore a jacket bearing the words \u201cFuck the Draft\u201d in the hallways of a courthouse to express his disagreement with the Vietnam war. He was convicted of disturbing the peace. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed his conviction, finding it impermissible under the First Amendment to criminalize the \u201csimple\u201d display of an expletive. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1789, 29 L.Ed.2d at 294-95. In contrast to defendant here, Cohen, who removed his jacket before entering the courtroom, displayed a message that was neither testimonial nor relevant as the slogan was not germane to the subject matter of the court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Defendant, here, attempted to place unsworn \u201ctestimony\u201d before the jury by wearing the tee shirt to her trial. This was particularly improper because defendant asserted that she acted to protect herself from assault by a police officer. The suggestion of \u201cpolice brutality\u201d was relevant to defendant\u2019s theory of the case. The tee shirt message was nothing less than an overt attempt to place that issue squarely before the triers of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that her constitutional rights were violated by the judge\u2019s order. Our decision in <em>State v. Gertrude, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 707 A.2d 178 (App.Div.1998), protects a defendant from involuntarily being tried in prison garb. A trial judge may exercise legitimate discretion to preclude a defendant from wearing inappropriate clothing when such clothing is directed to an improper purpose. A defendant litigant could legitimately be precluded from handing out leaflets to jurors setting forth his or her version of the ease. We perceive no reason why such preclusion should not apply to a litigant who chooses to present such \u201ctestimony\u201d by a sign around one\u2019s neck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>or a shirt on one\u2019s back. Judge Neustadter did not abuse his discretion here by requiring defendant to change her tee shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Defendant next asserts that her conviction should be overturned because of improper references to defendant\u2019s prior arrests. During the course of direct examination, the prosecutor elicited from Neupauer that she knew defendant and had arrested her on three prior occasions. After the questions had been asked and answered, defense counsel objected, Judge Neustadter sustained the objections and instructed the jury to disregard the answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The simple response to defendant\u2019s argument is that the judge sustained the objection, struck the testimony, and the jury presumably followed the instruction. <em>State v. Darrian, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 454, 605 A.2d 716 (App.Div.) (noting that one cannot assume that the jury did not follow the judge\u2019s instructions), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>13, 611 A.2d 651 (1992). Thus, we find no discemable basis for altering the conviction based on defendant\u2019s argument. We do note, however, that the testimony did establish that Neupauer, who was not in uniform but in a business suit at the time of the incident, was a law enforcement officer, and that fact was known to defendant. <em>Cf. State v. Humphrey, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 584, 444 A.2d 1135 (Law Div.1982) (concluding, in a case involving receiving stolen property, that a jury may infer guilty knowledge from evidence that a defendant received stolen property one year earlier), <em>aff'd, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 507 A.2d 241 (App.Div.1986). On that basis, the testimony is arguably admissible, however, because the testimony was struck, we need not address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Lastly, in reference to defendant\u2019s sentence, we conclude that Judge Neustadter carefully weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors in sentencing defendant to the presumptive four-year term of imprisonment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(l)(d). We perceive no basis for our intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>We have carefully reviewed the record in this matter and conclude that defendant\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit and do not require further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
