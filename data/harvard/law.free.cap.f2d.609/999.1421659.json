Rosenthal Co.\u2019s (Ro-senthal\u2019s) classification protest relating to imported men\u2019s and boy\u2019s parkas. Judge Morgan Ford held that proper classification was under item 376.56,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> TSUS, as \u201ccoated rainwear.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">The parkas, imported from South Korea in August, 1973, were made from nylon fabric coated with a waterproofing acrylic polymer. Invisible to the unaided eye, the coating is visible under a microscope at 35x magnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-20\">The Customs Service classified the parkas under TSUS item 380.84<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as \u201cother men\u2019s or boy\u2019s wearing apparel.\u201d Rosenthal advanced a claim of proper classification under TSUS item 376.56 as \u201ccoated rainwear.\u201d Rosenthal also argued that the government should be equitably estopped from classifying the parkas under TSUS item 380.84 because of actions taken and advice given by Customs Service employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-21\">Judge Ford held that the definition of coated fabric in headnote 2(a) of TSUS schedule 3, Part 4, Subpart C<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires the coating to visibly and significantly affect the surface of the fabric, and that visibility of the coating itself to the unaided eye is irrelevant for purposes of classification under head note 2(a). The government conceded that the acrylic polymer treatment had a \u201csubstantial\u201d affect on the fabric. Judge Ford found the fabric surface to have been visibly affected by the coating and held that the test of headnote 2(a) was thus satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-22\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-23\">The dispositive issue is whether headnote 2(a) requires that a fabric coating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>be <em>per se </em>visible to the unaided eye before a fabric may be classified as coated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">The government argues that the appealed judgment: (1) conflicts with precedent; (2) conflicts with legislative history; and (3) fixes an administratively inconvenient definition for coated fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">(1) <em>Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The government cites <em>United States v. Pinney, Cases &amp; Lakey Co., </em>105 P. 934 (2nd Cir. 1900), and <em>Kaplan Products &amp; Textiles, Inc. v. United States, </em>70 Cust.Ct. 166, C.D. 4425 (1973), as authority for its assertion that the coating itself must be visible to meet the requirements of headnote 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">In <em>Pinney, </em>the fabric was cotton cloth, classified by the government as \u201cfilled.\u201d The court held that fabric was filled if the interstices between the fabric threads were substantially closed by the introduction of various kinds of inorganic matter. The test was \u201cinspection or examination by unaided eyesight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937. Nothing in <em>Pinney </em>concerned use of a visual inspection test to determine whether a fabric was \u201ccoated.\u201d The statutory language, \u201ccoated or filled,\u201d being in the disjunctive, no requirement exists to employ the same test for \u201ccoated\u201d as for \u201cfilled.\u201d <em>Pinney </em>is simply irrelevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">The fabric in <em>Kaplan </em>was cotton suede, treated to render it water-repellant. The question was whether the treatment produced a coated fabric under headnote 2(a). Finding an untreated fabric sample visually indistinguishable from a treated sample, the court held that to qualify under headnote 2(a) \u201cthe fabric must be coated with a substance which will <em>\u2018visibly\u2019 </em>affect the surface of the cloth.\u201d <em>Kaplan Products &amp; Textiles, Inc. v. United States, supra </em>at 169 (emphasis the court\u2019s). We agree with Judge Ford\u2019s view that the test in <em>Kaplan </em>was not whether the <em>coating </em>is visible, but whether the <em>fabric surface </em>is visibly affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">(2) <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-17\">Legislative intent is determined, in the first instance, by reference to the statutory language, presumably used in its normal sense. <em>John S. James a/c The Consolidated Packaging Corp. v. United States, </em>48 CCPA 75, C.A.D. 768 (1961); <em>United States v. British Cars &amp; Parts, Inc., </em>47 CCPA 114, C.A.D. 741 (1960). If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no reason to reject its meaning and search for another. <em>Akawo, Morimura &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>6 Ct.Cust.Appls. 379, 381, T.D. 35921 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-18\">Headnote 2(a) defines \u201ccoated\u201d as treatment of the fabric which \u201cvisibly and significantly affect[s] the surface or surfaces thereof otherwise than by change in color.\u201d That definition is sufficiently clear and unambiguous to obviate resort to legislative history in a search for congressional intent. The government points to no ambiguity in the statutory language <em>per se, </em>but asserts that legislative history shows a congressional intent that the headnote have a meaning different from that of its plain language. As stated in <em>United States v. Corning Glass Works, </em>586 F.2d 822, 825, 66 CCPA -, C.A.D. 1216 (1978), \u201c[CJreation of an ambiguity in an otherwise clear and unambiguous statute, by reference to legislative history, is improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-21\">The government\u2019s reliance on a portion of the <em>Explanatory Notes To The Brussels No</em>menclature<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is misplaced. The portion re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>lied on, having been drafted after enactment of the Tariff Schedules, was not part of the legislative history of the headnote. Further, the headnote language differs from that of the <em>Brussels Nomenclature. See F. L: Smidth &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 F.2d 1369, 56 CCPA 77, C.A.D. 958 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">(3) <em>Administrative Inconvenience</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">M The government argues that the result reached here would create an administratively unworkable criterion for identifying a coated fabric, asserting that both coated and uncoated fabric samples would be required to enable the Customs Service to determine whether the fabric is coated. If that assertion be correct, it remains unavailing. That a test required by a headnote may be more difficult to administer cannot justify a disregard of the clear meaning of the headnote. <em>Cf. United States v. F. W. Myers &amp; Co., Inc., </em>45 CCPA 48, C.A.D. 671 (1958) (possibility of fraud does not justify judicially rewriting a statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">The government\u2019s arguments being unpersuasive, Judge Ford\u2019s judgment is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">.
