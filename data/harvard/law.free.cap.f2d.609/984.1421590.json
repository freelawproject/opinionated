In the present case the conflict was not in fact noticed before plaintiff bid, and probably never would have been noticed except by one who was seeking light on the specific problem the discrepant provisions dealt with, and in the course of his investigation, placed them side by side. The trial judge did not define what he meant by a patent discrepancy. It is obvious that no careful writer of contracts would deliberately create a discrepancy, patent or latent, and then leave it to be resolved by the precedence clause. A discrepancy even with the precedence clause therefore indicates a probable mistake, which may be more or less serious. We would assume arguendo that a bidder, who noticed or should have noticed a serious mistake in the invitation or other of the contract documents, must divulge what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>has or should have noticed to the government, and will not in equity be allowed to profit by not doing so, as it would be an instance of overreaching. That is not this case, whether the discrepancy be patent or latent. Defendant does not accuse plaintiff of overreaching nor could it do so. The standard clause prescribes a precedence only in case of discrepancies between specifications and drawings, while one in figures, drawings, or specifications, each by themselves, must be promptly reported to the contracting officer. This no doubt reflects defendant\u2019s experience that the latter class of discrepancies is much more likely to be discovered early. We cannot in the circumstances say in face of the precedence clause, our characterization of a discrepancy as patent automatically triggers an obligation to report. The clause itself seems designed to excuse such reporting, instances where equity would intervene aside. Accordingly, we do not deem it necessary to address in a critical manner the characterization of the discrepancy as patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Since the court agrees with the trial judge\u2019s recommended decision and conclusion, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby affirms and adopts the decision and conclusion, together with the paragraph inserted above by the court, as the basis for its judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">OPINION OF TRIAL JUDGE</p>\n<author id=\"b1080-6\">WILLI, Trial Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">By this suit plaintiff, a construction contractor, seeks reversal of a decision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (the Board) affirming the contracting officer\u2019s denial of its claim for an equitable adjustment to compensate it for an alleged change in the terms of its fixed-price construction contract to build a three-story, 116-bed hospital for the Army at Fort De-vens, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">The parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment present the Board\u2019s decision for review subject to the finality features imparted to it by the Wunderlich Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321-22 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">The controversy concerns only the sequence in which vinyl-asbestos floor tile was to be installed on the ground floor of the building in relation to the Gypsum Wallboard (GWB) partitions to be constructed there; the question being whether the tile was to abut such partitions after they were erected on the concrete subfloor or was to be laid first, with the partitions placed on top of it. Incongruity as between the specifications and drawings is at the heart of the parties\u2019 disagreement over priority of installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-13\">The dispute did not surface until approximately a year into performance when plaintiff had the building under roof and in a weather-tight condition. At that point it began erecting GWB partitions on the concrete surface of the first floor. When it had installed about 5 or 10 percent of them in that manner, the contracting officer rejected the work contending that the contract required that such partitions be placed on top of the vinyl tile with which the floor area was to be finished. Though disagreeing with that interpretation of the contract, plaintiff removed the partitions complained of and complied with the directive. It thereafter filed a claim under the Changes article. It is the Board\u2019s affirmance of the contracting officer\u2019s denial of that claim that precipitated this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">In all significant respects, the facts of this case, as found by the Board, are beyond legitimate dispute. The result that follows from them depends upon whether the duty of inquiry that devolves on a construction contract bidder confronted with patently conflicting specifications and drawings persists even though the contract on which he is bidding contains a so-called order of precedence clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If it does, as held by the Board, plaintiff cannot recover. If the clause displaces that duty, by eliminating the conflict, plaintiff prevails. For reasons that will appear, it is held that on the facts of this case the clause predominates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>As required by the Armed Services Procurement Regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Article 2 of the General Provisions of the subject contract reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-5\">SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS (JUNE 1964)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-6\">The Contractor shall keep on the work a copy of the drawings and specifications and shall at all times give the Contracting Officer access thereto. Anything mentioned in the specifications and not shown on the drawings, or shown on the drawings and not mentioned in the specifications, shall be of like effect as if shown or mentioned in both. <em>In case of difference between drawings and specifications, the specifications shall govern. </em>In case of discrepancy either in the figures, in the drawings, or in the specifications, the matter shall be promptly submitted to the Contracting Officer, who shall promptly make a determination in writing. Any adjustment by the Contractor without such a determination shall be at his own risk and expense. The Contracting Officer shall furnish from time to time such detail drawings and other information as he may consider necessary, unless otherwise provided. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">There are specifications dealing specially with GWB and with vinyl floor tile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">As the Board found,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> section 6C of the specifications, \u201cGypsum Wallboard (Dry Wall),\u201d is inconclusive on the question at issue. Without elucidation, it directs simply that the base members (runners) of the partitions be \u201csecurely attached to floors.\u201d The vinyl tile specification is not similarly equivocal, however. Paragraph 6 of section 9E of the specifications, \u201cFlooring; Vinyl-Asbestos Tile,\u201d is captioned \u201cInstallation of Tile.\u201d Subparagraph 6.1 directs that: \u201cInstallation of tile shall be deferred until all other work that might cause damage to the flooring has been completed.\u201d Subpara-graph 6.4 specifies: \u201cTile shall be laid in accordance with the pattern layout starting from axes that will produce tile against opposite walls of equal width and not less than half the tile width.\u201d The Board read these provisions as being consistent <em>only </em>with a sequence of construction that provides for the walls or partitions to be installed before the tile is laid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">Pointing squarely in the opposite direction is a note (note 3) on one of the contract drawings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No. 32-02-01, sheet 41, titled \u201cDoor Elevations &amp; Interior Finish Details.\u201d It directs that: \u201cAll partitions with GWB on both sides are to set on top of finish floor.\u201d Referring to the meaning and interrelationship of the drawing note and the tile specifications previously quoted, defendant says: \u201cBoth requirements are explicit and they are inconsistent.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion For Summary Judgment and Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion For Summary Judgment, at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">The notation is not, in terms, related to any of the detail drawings showing cross-sections of the base portion of five different types of interior walls and partitions that are shown above it and none of the parti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>tions that are illustrated is of GWB construction on both sides. All of the cross-sections depicted, however, are oriented at their respective bases to a horizontal plane comprised of two closely aligned parallel lines, the upper one of which is labeled \u201cFinish Floor.\u201d One of them shows the base of a partition finished with GWB on one side and plaster on the other positioned atop the upper horizontal line identified as \u201cFinish Floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Relying on a paragraph <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of section 3a of the specifications dealing with concrete, plaintiff\u2019s principal contention before the Board was that the \u201cFinish Floor\u201d appearing in the drawing note referred to the concrete surface to which tile was to be applied, rather than to the exposed surface of the installed tile. It therefore contended that as used in the note \u201cFinish\u201d meant texture <em>(i. </em>e., monolithic finish), not state of completion of the work. The Board properly rejected this contention as opposed to both the obvious purport of the detail drawings and to the specific acknowledgement of plaintiff\u2019s project engineer in a written submission made by him in the early stages of the controversy. 75-1 BCA at 53,159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The configuration of the drawings affirmatively discredits plaintiff\u2019s interpretation. It is undisputed that in no instance was the completed interior floor surface abutting the partitions shown on the drawings to consist of exposed concrete.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Those surfaces were to be of either ceramic or vinyl tile. Accordingly, if the line (labeled \u201cFinish Floor\u201d) shown on the drawings as passing under the base of a partition represented tile surface on both sides of it, the line (being straight and uninterrupted) necessarily denoted the same material under the partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">In sum, the Board correctly concluded that \u201cFinish Floor\u201d as used in note 3 meant vinyl tile. Although, with the drawing note so construed, it recognized that the specifications and drawings were in irreconcilable conflict as to those areas of the building where both GWB partitions and vinyl tile were to be installed, it went on to deny the claim by construing the contract in a way that it felt satisfactorily removed the contradiction. It invoked two familiar and related principles of interpretation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>viz, </em>that potentially conflicting provisions should, if their language reasonably permits, be assigned meanings that will place them in harmony rather than discord. <em>Unicon Management Corp. v. United States, </em>375 F.2d 804, 806, 179 Ct.Cl. 534, 537-38 (1967), and that a provision directed to a particular matter prevails over one which is general in its terms. <em>Hol-Gar Manufacturing Corp. v. United States, </em>351 F.2d 972, 980, 169 Ct.Cl. 384, 396 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">The Board reasoned that congruity resulted if the tile specification\u2019s scope were confined to only the second and third floors of the building, where no GWB partitions were to be found, leaving the drawing note free to govern the areas (primarily the ground floor) calling for such partitions. The difficulty with this approach is that it relieves conflict by means of segregation rather than integration. Thus, the provisions no longer collide only because their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>respective coverages have been made mutually exclusive. The coordination of which <em>Unicon </em>speaks occurs where competing provisions can reasonably be read to operate compatibly on the <em>same </em>aspect of the contract work. There the court found a flooring specification that was silent on the in-cludability of a steel plate to be open to complementation by a drawing calling for such a plate. The language of the tile specification here involved affords no such latitude. That it does not serves both to distinguish the situation at hand from that presented in <em>Unicon, supra, </em>and to render the specific versus general principle inapplicable. The generality comprehended by that principle must emanate from the contract language.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the case of a provision explicit in its terms, generality is not created by a mere showing that the provision can be subordinated in the definition of one aspect of the contract work and still have room to function viably elsewhere. As the defendant forthrightly confirms,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the tile specification is no less complete and specific in terms than is the drawing note. Accordingly, the textual prerequisite to application of the principle is notably lacking in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Ultimately, the Board alluded to the real crux of this case \u2014 the impact of the order of precedence clause. Properly characterizing the interrelationship of the tile specification and drawing note as one of patent conflict, the Board declared: \u201cA contractor may not resolve such a patent conflict between specifications and drawings by resort to the General Provision Article 2 admonition that specifications control over drawings, since that pertains only to such differences as do not require clarification at the bidding stage. See <em>Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Company, </em>ASBCA No. 15855, 71-2 BCA \u00b68959.\u201d 75-1 BCA at 53,160. Though the Board was faithful to the prior holding, albeit <em>obiter, </em>on which it relied to support the limitation that it imposed on the scope of the order of precedence clause,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it failed to acknowledge earlier Board pronouncements to the contrary. For example, in <em>Sides Construction Co., </em>ASBCA No. 9539, 1964 BCA \u00b6 4342 the Board, dealing with a standard order of precedence clause, said: \u201cWe have no difficulty in affirming the principle that in such cases of <em>patent and irreconcilable discrepancy </em>between the specifications and drawings, the specifications govern.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Mapp Contracting Co., </em>ASBCA No. 12205, 68-1 BCA \u00b6 6754, the Board declared that the standard clause \u201cwould require that the specifications be given precedence over an antagonistic indication on the drawings\u201d where there was \u201cessential repugnancy\u201d between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">It distinctly appears that in order to constitute the \u201cdifference\u201d contemplated by the order of precedence clause, specifications and drawings must be in the same degree of affirmative conflict<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the present Board deemed to disqualify the clause and impose a duty of inquiry on the contractor. With due deference, that conclusion cannot be permitted to stand. The Government authored the order of precedence clause as a mechanism to automatical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>ly remove conflict between specifications and drawings by assigning preeminence to the former. As an additional initiative, the clause imposes an affirmative duty of inquiry on the contractor who is confronted with a particular dilemma, <em>viz, </em>discrepancies within, as opposed to between the separate categories of, <em>inter alia, </em>drawings and specifications. <em>Glen N. Allen, </em>ASBCA No. 12728, 68-1 BCA \u00b66807, at 31,467. In this case there is no conflict among either the drawings, as a whole, or the constituent provisions of the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">The plaintiff is entitled to take the Government sponsored order of precedence clause at face value. <em>WPG Enterprises Inc. v. United States, </em>323 F.2d 874, 876-77, 163 Ct.Cl. 1, 6-7 (1963). Once its right to do so in the present situation is recognized, no conflict sufficient to occasion inquiry<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> remains for, as the Board acknowledged,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the specifications in issue are consistent <em>only </em>with the sequence of work from which the plaintiff was compelled to depart. The Board found that this enforced change significantly increased the cost of construction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plaintiff is therefore entitled to a compensatory equitable adjustment under the Changes article.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, defendant\u2019s cross-motion is denied and the case is remanded to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals pursuant to Rule 149 for determination of the amount of the equitable adjustment due plaintiff with further proceedings before this court stayed for a period of six (6) months from the date hereof. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel is designated to advise the court by letter to the trial judge of the status of the remand proceedings pursuant to Rule 149(f). Attention of counsel and the Board is also directed to Rule 150.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">. <em>Franchi Constr.

Moreover, although the Board did not specifically pronounce that work sequence as representative of normal trade practice, such is the clear implication of its opinion.
