He asserts that a retrial would offend principles of double jeopardy. Because we find that his contention is without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-25\">The pertinent facts follow. On November 9, 1978, defendant Luttrell was transferred from the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was placed in administrative detention pending final classification into the general prison population. On November 13, defendant was informed at a prison hearing that he would be transferred from administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>detention to the admission and orientation unit later that day. After the hearing he was returned to his cell. At 12:30 p. m., Luttrell was taken by Corrections Officer Ronald Streeter to the admissions and orientation unit, where he was searched by Counsellor Kossie Thompson. Thompson found a long homemade knife in the front belt of defendant\u2019s trousers. A subsequent search of defendant\u2019s cell disclosed a second knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">On December 11, 1978, defendant met with FBI Agent James Procopio. It was his testimony in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning that precipitated the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">Defendant was indicted for illegally conveying a weapon within a federal penitentiary in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1792.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial defendant was positively identified as the inmate searched by Counsellor Thompson, and both Officer Streeter and Counsel-lor Thompson testified that defendant had a knife hidden underneath his trousers. The government also called on Agent Procopio to testify. The following colloquy between the prosecutor and Agent Procopio ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFaY\">Q: Did there come a time when you met with the defendant, John Luttrell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiy\">A: Very briefly, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-7\">Q: And before you had an opportunity to advise him of anything, did he tell you anything about himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-8\">A: I believe it was on December 11 that I \u2014 Mr. Luttrell was brought in to me in the lieutenant\u2019s office in segregation. I identified myself by name with my credentials, told him who I was with, and before I could go any further, Mr. Luttrell blurted out, My name is John Richard Luttrell. My number is 32678. I have nothing further to say to you without an attorney present. He abruptly turned and walked out the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a8n-dedup-0\">Defendant\u2019s counsel immediately moved for a mistrial on the ground that the agent\u2019s answer constituted a comment upon the defendant\u2019s exercise of his fifth amendment right to remain silent and his sixth amendment right to counsel. Although the trial court concluded that there was no bad purpose on the part of the prosecutor or on the part of the witness, it nevertheless granted defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">Luttrell subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. The magistrate recommended that the motion be denied, and the district court adopted his report and recommendations. Luttrell appeals pursuant to <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 661, 79 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-14\">When a mistrial is granted on motion by the defendant, the government is barred from reprosecuting him only if the prosecutorial misconduct giving rise to the mistrial is \u201cgrossly negligent or intentional.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza, </em>603 F.2d 578, 580 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Kessler, </em>530 F.2d 1246 (5th Cir. 1976). Mere negligence on the part of the government is not sufficient to preclude a second trial. <em>Lee v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 23, 32-34, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 53 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-15\">The government contends that it put Agent Procopio on the stand to demonstrate that the John Richard Luttrell on trial was the same \u201cJohn Richard Luttrell\u201d referred to in government exhibits that had been introduced into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government\u2019s position is that the prosecutor sought to elicit from Agent Procopio Lutt-rell\u2019s inmate number, which Luttrell had related to Procopio at their meeting of De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>cember 11. Instead of asking a specific question concerning the inmate number, however, the prosecutor asked an open-ended question \u2014 \u201cDid he tell you anything about himself? The response that triggered the motion for a mistrial followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">In granting the mistrial, the trial court found that there was no \u201cbad purpose\u201d on the part of the prosecutor or on the part of the witness and that the agent\u2019s isolated remark was <em>\u201c inadvertently] </em>elicited by the prosecutor.\u201d (emphasis added). Similarly, in assessing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, the trial court found no evidence of \u201cprosecutorial overreaching,\u201d \u201cgross negligence\u201d or \u201cintentional misconduct,\u201d concluding only that \u201cthe prosecutor was <em>inartfully </em>attempting to verify the defendant\u2019s prison number, and that the witness simply volunteered the exact words used by the defendant.\u201d (emphasis added). These findings cannot be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Garza, </em>603 F.2d at 580 n.5; <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>566 F.2d 1311, 1318 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">After careful scrutiny, we conclude that they are not clearly erroneous. At oral argument the prosecutor acknowledged that he had not adequately briefed the witness because of time constraints imposed by a crowded prosecutorial calendar. Had he done so, he conceded, Agent Procopio would probably not have implicated Luttrell\u2019s fifth and sixth amendment rights in his testimony. While we do not condone inadequate preparation of witnesses for trial, we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s oversight rose to a level of negligence sufficiently gross to bar defendant\u2019s retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">Our conclusion in this regard is mandated by <em>United States v. Crouch, supra, </em>which we find to be controlling here. In <em>Crouch </em>the prosecutor was questioning an agent of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau about the arrest of defendant Crouch. The agent testified that he had explained to Crouch why he was being arrested and had told Crouch of his constitutional rights. The prosecutor then asked the agent whether Crouch had made any statement, and the agent replied that he had not. In refusing to find this manner of questioning a bar to a second prosecution, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-10\">Appellants\u2019 contention is that the mere asking of a question that allowed [Agent] Taylor to so testify is misconduct. This puts things a little high. <em>We are not prepared to hold that the mere asking of a question, in the absence of a specific agreement not to, would ever insulate a defendant from prosecution, </em>[citations omitted]. We think it takes more than a single question to vitiate the government\u2019s ability to try these defendants on these very serious charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">566 F.2d at 1320 (emphasis added). In our view, the interchange in the instant case is indistinguishable from that in <em>Crouch. </em>Particularly where, as here, \u201cthe prosecutor had absolutely nothing to gain, even remotely, by attempting to indirectly advise the jury that the defendant exercised his right to remain silent,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>our decision in <em>Crouch </em>to affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1792 provides in pertinent part: Whoever conveys into such [any federal penal or correctional] institution, or from place to place therein, any firearm, weapon, explosive, or any lethal or poisonous gas, or any other substance or thing designed to kill, injure, or disable any officer, agent, employee, or inmate thereof, or conspires so to do\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">Shall be imprisoned not more than ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1285-16\">. In its brief the government points to two exhibits: one showing that on November '9, 1978, a John Luttrell was transferred from the United States penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, to the Atlanta penitentiary and was placed in administrative detention, and the other establishing that Luttrell was to be released from administrative detention to admissions and orientation on November 13, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">. Magistrate\u2019s Report, Recommendation and Order at 2 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">Defendant contends, however, that the government did have something to gain. Lutt-rell had apparently made two statements to prison officials \u2014 \u201cAw, shucks, they got me,\u201d and \u201cI got it [the knife] out of the air duct.\u201d The government had not made these statements available to the defendant until the morning of the trial. The trial court found that this withholding violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 16 but reserved a ruling on whether it would suppress the statements. Because the trial was aborted, the judge never ruled on this issue. At a second trial the government would be allowed to introduce the statements since the defendant now has possession of them. Thus, defendant submits, the government will benefit from the mistrial. <em>See United States v. Beasley, </em>479 F.2d 1124, 1127 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that defendant\u2019s contention is valid, it does not follow that we must dismiss the indictment against him. The trial court found that the prosecutor \u201chad proceeded in good faith\u201d and that there was no \u201cintentional violation of the rules [of discovery].\u201d These findings are not clearly erroneous. Defendant cites us to no evidence that indicates to the contrary, and we have found none. To bar reprosecution under such circumstances would contravene the double jeopardy standards in <em>Garza, Kessler </em>and <em>Lee, </em>set out above. This we refuse to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
