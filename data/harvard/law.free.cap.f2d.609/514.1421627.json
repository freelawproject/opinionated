After careful deliberation, we conclude that the Awards Act does not operate as a waiver of sovereign immunity in this context. Therefore, as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees by the courts below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">In <em>Andrulis v. United States, </em>plaintiffs Dr. Marilyn W. Andrulis and Andrulis Research Corporation (ARC) brought an action for damages, declaratory and injunctive relief in which they alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that ARC had been unlawfully terminated from a program administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA) pursuant to \u00a7 2[8](a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(a). Section 8(a) empowers the SBA to enter into contracts with other federal departments and agencies and to arrange, without competitive bidding, for the performance of these contracts by small business concerns. In their complaint, plaintiffs charged that ARC had been excluded from the \u00a7 2[8](a) program as a result of race and sex discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1985(3) and 2000d.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">On November 11,1977, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a temporary restraining order in the <em>Andrulis </em>case. Thereafter, the SBA agreed to reinstate ARC as a participant in the \u00a7 2[8](a) program and the parties entered into a consent decree to that effect. Relying upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, plaintiffs next applied for and were granted $18,739.00 in attorney\u2019s fees and $1,135.03 in costs and disbursements. As to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\"><em>NAACP v. Civiletti, </em>the second case before this Court, grew out of the fatal shooting in 1971 of Carnell Russ, a black male, by a white Arkansas law enforcement officer in the course of an arrest for a traffic violation. The officer was subsequently acquitted of manslaughter charges by a state court jury. After reviewing the transcript of the trial proceedings, as well as FBI reports, the Department of Justice decided not to prosecute anyone under the federal criminal civil rights statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">Following the decision not to prosecute, the NAACP and the Russ family brought suit under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985, challenging the adequacy of the federal investigation and the decision not to prosecute. In essence, plaintiffs claimed that the Justice Department had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>deferred unlawfully to the state proceedings pursuant to a policy established in 1959 by then Attorney General William Rogers of not following a state prosecution with a federal trial for the same act absent compelling reasons. Plaintiffs charged that this policy was unreasonable and racially discriminatory as applied in the Russ case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In February 1977, while this suit was pending in the district court, Attorney General Griffin Bell issued a memorandum dealing with prosecutions of civil rights violations by the Justice Department. The memorandum indicated that the Department would henceforth evaluate \u201ceach and every allegation of a violation of the civil rights laws ... on its own merits\u201d irrespective of related state enforcement action. Agreeing that the Bell memorandum effectively mooted plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the parties to this action moved jointly to dismiss. The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted the motion and plaintiffs subsequently sought and were awarded $26,300.00 in attorney\u2019s fees and $612.25 in costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The decision to award attorney\u2019s fees is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">To recover attorney\u2019s fees against the United States, a prevailing party must first surmount a formidable barrier, the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Under well established precedent, waivers of federal sovereign immunity \u201ccannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501,1503, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969). With respect to awards of attorney\u2019s fees, the policy against implied waivers of federal sovereign immunity is embodied in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which has been consistently construed as immunizing the United States against attorney\u2019s fees awards absent clear or express statutory authority to the contrary. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 267-68, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>Fitzgerald v. United States Civil Service Commission, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. 327, 330, 554 F.2d 1186, 1189 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 111, 113, 512 F.2d 1351, 1353 (D.C.Cir.1975). Such clear statutory authority may be found in language referring specifically to the liability of the United States. Thus, for example, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">\u201cIn any action commenced pursuant to this subchapter, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs, and <em>the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a-3(b) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Alternatively, statutory authorization may be inferred by necessary implication from the statutory context in which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>fee provision arises. This rationale was central to the First Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>484 F.2d 1331 (1st Cir. 1973), that an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the federal government was authorized under \u00a7 304(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604. In that case, the government contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that a prevailing party in a citizen suit brought against the United States under \u00a7 304 of the Act could not obtain attorney\u2019s fees from the federal government because the attorney\u2019s fee provision of \u00a7 304(d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while providing for recovery by \u201cany party,\u201d did not specifically mention the United States by name. The First Circuit responded by noting that the government\u2019s \u201creading of the statute is in sharp conflict with its plain words, which authorize the award against \u2018any party\u2019 and which, in \u00a7 304(a), specifically authorize suits with the United States as a party.\u201d 484 F.2d at 1336, n.5. Because \u00a7 304(a) of the Clean Air Act specifically permitted suits against the Administrator of the EPA, the necessary implication was that Congress had intended the fee provision of \u00a7 304(d), which made express reference to \u00a7 304(a), to allow recovery against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the context of the above discussion, the question before this Court is whether the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976 expressly authorizes the recovery of fees against the United States so as to overcome the barrier of sovereign immunity contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. As amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections [1981, 1985 or 2000d of Title 42] the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ahr-dedup-0\">Appellees submit that the Awards Act by its plain language clearly and unequivocally permits awards of attorney\u2019s fees against the United States by authorizing a fee award in \u201cany action or proceeding\u201d to enforce, <em>inter alia, </em>the Reconstruction Era Civil Rights statutes (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-1983, 1985, 1986) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. Ap-pellees find support for their position in <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), in which the Supreme Court held the language of the Awards Act sufficient to overcome the immunity granted the states under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. In so holding, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">\u201cThe Act itself could not be broader. It applies to \u2018any\u2019 action brought to enforce certain civil rights laws. It contains no hint of an exception for State defending injunction actions; . . . .\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2575.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Similarly, appellees contend, the Awards Act contains no hint of an exception for the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">In their reading of the Awards Act, we think appellees assign too much weight to Congress\u2019 use of the phrase \u201cany action.\u201d That phrase has repeatedly appeared in attorney\u2019s fees provisions, yet when in the past Congress has sought to override 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 it has apparently considered it necessary to add a phrase explicitly establishing the liability of the United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Generally, in construing a statute, we \u201care obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\u201d <em>Reiter v. Sonotone </em>Corp.,-U.S.-at-, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979), citing <em>United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955). Unless we are to regard the prior specific references to the United States inserted in fee provision statutes as mere surplusage, we must assume that Congress considered the \u201cany action\u201d language insufficient standing alone to waive federal sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Considering that the Awards Act was enacted largely in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>supra;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and given the <em>Alyeska </em>mandate that, to overcome the barrier of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, fee awards against the United States must be \u201cexpressly provided for by statute,\u201d 421 U.S. at 267-68, 95 S.Ct. 1612, it is difficult to believe that if Congress had intended to override \u00a7 2412, it would not have used language in the Awards Act at least as clear and unequivocal as it has used in the past to waive federal sovereign immunity. <em>Cf. Shannon v. United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, </em>433 F.Supp. 249, 251 (E.D.Pa.1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>577 F.2d 854 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1002, 99 S.Ct. 611* 58 L.Ed.2d 677 (1978) (\u201cThe unequivocal language to which the Court adverted in <em>Alyeska </em>and that contained in [prior statutes authorizing attorney\u2019s fees awards against the United States] in stark contrast to the silence of the Fees Awards Act.\u201d) Instead, the only specific waiver contained in the Awards Act occurs with respect to actions brought \u201cby or on behalf of the United States . to enforce, or charging a violation of, a provision of\u201d the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See Aparacor, Inc. v. United States, </em>571 F.2d 552 (Ct.Cl.1978). While the liability of the United States for fees in tax cases might have been more specifically defined, Congress\u2019 intent to waive federal immunity in the IRS suits is necessarily inferred since the United States and the taxpaying public are the only parties conceivably included within the provision, and the Awards Act allows an award to \u201cthe prevailing party, other than the United States.\u201d No similar inference necessarily arises with respect to the remaining portions of the Act since the United States is neither the sole nor even the most likely defendant under the civil rights statutes in question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Considering the plain language of the Awards Act, we agree with the government that the most that can fairly be said is that the Act does not, on its face, preclude an assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against the United States. As this Court indicated in <em>Fitzgerald v. United States Civil Service Commission, supra, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. at 330,554 F.2d at 1189, however, the \u201cabsence of\u201d language \u201ccontrary\u201d to an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the government is not enough. There \u201cmust be [an] unequivocally expressed\u201d affirmative authorization to overcome 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">We find nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hutto v. Finney, supra, </em>to contradict our reading of the Awards Act. In ruling that state and local governments are liable for attorney\u2019s fees under the Act, the Court in <em>Hutto v. Finney </em>rejected the state\u2019s argument that in order to abrogate the state\u2019s immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, Congress must \u201cenact express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>statutory language making the States liable.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2576. The Court emphasized that the Act imposes attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas a part of costs\u201d and that costs have traditionally been awarded against the states without regard to the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Id. </em>The Court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">\u201cIt is much too late to single out attorney\u2019s fees as the one kind of litigation costs whose recovery may not be authorized by Congress without an express statutory waiver of the States\u2019 immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2577-78.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>the Supreme Court considered the absence of an express statutory waiver no obstacle to an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the states. The same cannot be said with respect to federal liability. In the case of the federal government, there is no long tradition of awarding costs as a matter of course. Instead, prior to the amendment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 in 1966, costs were recoverable against the United States only if expressly provided for by statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, \u00a7 2412 explicitly requires what the Supreme Court concluded the Eleventh Amendment does not \u2014 that is, an express abrogation of immunity from attorney\u2019s fees awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In concluding that the Awards Act authorizes awards of fees against the states, the Court in <em>Hutto v. Finney </em>also relied on legislative history which focused directly on state liability and established unequivocally that Congress intended the Awards Act to waive state immunity. 98 S.Ct. at 2575-76. No such unequivocal indication of congressional intent exists with respect to the issue of federal immunity. The floor debate surrounding passage of the Awards Act contains indications of divergence of opinion among members of Congress as to the implications of the Act for federal liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The House and Senate Committee Reports on the attorney\u2019s fee legislation contain no discussion of the question of federal liability. This silence appears significant since the Committee Reports are the references members of Congress are probably most likely to consult before casting their votes for an understanding of the purpose and effect of a bill. <em>Mastro Plastics v. NLRB, </em>350 U.S. 270, 287-89, 76 S.Ct. 349, 100 L.Ed. 309 (1956); <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, </em>125 U.S.App.D.C. 6, 365 F.2d 939 (D.C.Cir. 1966); Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction, \u00a7 48.06, p. 203 (4th ed.). Had Congress intended to abrogate federal sovereign immunity for purposes of the Awards Act, some discussion of the matter by the respective House and Senate Committees responsible for the legislation in their Committee Reports might have been expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">The only direct support found in either Committee Report for the proposition that the federal government might be liable for fees under the Awards Act is a citation to <em>Hills v. Gautreaux, </em>425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976), a case involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>a Title VI claim brought against the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which appears in the House Report as part of a string of cases cited as examples of instances in which government officials have been defendants in civil rights actions. H.Rep. No. 94^1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. at 7 (1976). This oblique reference to federal liability is, we think hardly sufficient to constitute the kind of clear statutory authorization required to waive federal sovereign immunity with respect to attorney\u2019s fees awards.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Given the importance of attorney\u2019s fees in ensuring enforcement of our civil rights laws, a strong policy argument can be made that the Awards Act should permit the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees against the federal government.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We leave for the Congress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>however, the decision of whether to amend the Awards Act to explicitly allow recovery of fees against the United States, realizing that to do otherwise would be to exceed the limits of our interpretive function.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Insofar as they award attorney\u2019s fees to appellees, the orders of the district courts are reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A5K\">.

In 1966, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 was amended to permit the recovery of costs unless specifically forbidden by statute. Congress, however, explicitly excluded \u201cthe fees and expenses of attorneys\u201d from the costs recoverable under \u00a7 2412 as a matter of course. Thus, with respect to attorney\u2019s fees, \u00a7 2412 remains an explicit assertion of sovereign immunity. <em>See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 267-68, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1626, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) (\u201cBut \u00a7 2412 on its face, and in light of its legislative history, generally bars such awards, which, if allowable at all, must be expressly provided for by statute . .\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b610-14\">.

With respect to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, at the time the Awards Act was passed Congress was uncertain whether a private action could even be brought under these statutes. Since that time, the Supreme Court has ruled that private causes of action are cognizable under Title IX. <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">. See discussion note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\">. Thus, for example, Congressman Railsback, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee which drafted the Awards Act, seemed to suggest that attorney\u2019s fees might be recoverable against the United States when, in response to a question, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">\u201cMr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, again it would be in the discretion of the court and nowhere in the bill do we prevent a school district or college from recovering reasonable attorneys fees, even in a case where the United States is a party plaintiff.\u201d 121 Cong.Rec.H. 12164 (daily ed., October 1, 1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">However, a contrary stance appears to have been taken by Congressman Rodino, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, in his response to a request from Senator Kennedy for comments on an amendment offered by Senator Goldwater which would have subjected the United States to broad liability for attorney\u2019s fees in tax cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-15\">\u201cI fear that Senator Goldwater\u2019s amendment . . . will jeopardize the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976. S. 2278 presently is a very narrow bill. ... It does not involve federal spending. . . The Committee is presently studying other bills, like Senator Goldwater\u2019s, which would go far beyond the \u2018American Rule\u2019 or the \u2018private attorney general\u2019 exception to it, and which may allow recovery against the Federal Government. We hope to take action next Congress on such bills.\u201d 122 Cong.Rec.S. 16490 (daily ed., Sept. 23, 1976).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b614-4\">. Appellees in the <em>Andrulis </em>case offer two additional theories under which they submit the award of attorney\u2019s fees in their case might be sustained. We find neither of these theories persuasive. Appellees rely first on the language of \u00a7 2[5](b) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 634(b) which provides that the Administrator of the SBA may \u201csue and be sued . in any United States district court . . . Appellees submit that the \u201csue and be sued\u201d clause, which places the SBA on a par with private parties for purposes of federal court litigation, Mar <em>v. Kleppe, </em>520 F.2d 867, 870 (10th Cir. 1975), constitutes an \u201cexpress statutory consent\u201d satisfying the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We acknowledge that through the \u201csue and be sued\u201d clause Congress has provided a limited waiver of the sovereign immunity generally afforded agencies of the federal government. However, it is well established that Congress in waiving governmental immunity has the power to waive immunity entirely or to waive it for some purposes and retain it for others. See <em>Federal Housing Administration Region No. 4 v. Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 244, 60 S.Ct. 488, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1939), and cases cited therein. Congress made no mention of attorney\u2019s fees in permitting the Administrator of the SBA to \u201csue and be sued.\u201d Moreover, the clause was enacted at a time when, under the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d the payment of attorney\u2019s fees would not have been regarded as an ordinary incident of litigation. Thus it seems logical to assume that in subjecting the SBA to suit Congress did not expect the government to be liable for attorney\u2019s fees. In any event, because \u00a7 2[5](b) of the Small Business Act neither directly nor expressly authorizes an award of fees, it appears inadequate on its face to override the general bar of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. <em>See Cassata v. Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., </em>445 F.2d 122 (7th Cir. 1971) (Section 2412 held to preclude the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees from the FSLIC which, like the SBA, is a \u201csue and be sued\u201d agency, see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1725(c)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In the alternative, appellees contend that an amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) enacted contemporaneously with the Awards Act contains an express waiver of sovereign immunity sufficient to sustain an award of fees in the instant case. The APA amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">\u201cAn action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States . . . .\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Appellees submit that \u00a7 702 expressly waives sovereign immunity for relief against the United States, except for money damages, and the Awards Act provides a type of relief, attorney\u2019s fees, which the Supreme Court has concluded do not constitute money damages. <em>Hutto v. Finney, supra, </em>98 S.Ct. at 2576, n.24. Together, appellees claim, these statutes combine to expressly authorize the award of fees against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">While imaginative, appellees\u2019 argument is unconvincing. The legislative history surrounding passage of the APA amendment suggests that Congress sought by the amendment to achieve the narrow purpose of withdrawing the defense of sovereign immunity in actions against federal agencies in which \u201cspecific relief\u2019 such as \u201can injunction, declaratory judgment, or writ of mandamus\u201d not requiring any federal expenditure was sought. H.Rep. No. 94r-1656, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. at 4-5 (1976). The amendment says nothing about the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees ancillary to such an action and, indeed, the amendment itself provides that \u201cNothing herein . . . confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. Section 2412 forbids the award of attorney\u2019s fees against the United States absent express statutory authorization. We do not view the APA amendment as satisfying or modifying in any way that requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\">.

The Supreme Court in <em>Testan </em>described the test for the specificity required as \u201cwhether any federal statute \u2018can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government * * .' <em>Eastport S. S. Corp. v. United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl., at 607, 372 F.2d, at 1009; <em>Mosca v.

We are not ready to tamper with these established principles * * 424 U.S. at 400, 96 S.Ct. at 954. Thus the question presented by these cases is whether Section 1988 \u201ccan fairly be interpreted as mandating [payment of attorneys\u2019 fees] by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the Federal Government.\u201d The majority says that this may be done in one of two ways: (1) statutory language that specifically refers to the liability of the United States; and (2) necessary implication from the statutory context in which the fee provision arises. Majority opinion 197 U.S. App.D.C. at -, 609 F.2d at 516-517. In my view, Section 1988 satisifies the latter test.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Congress enacted Section 1988 in response to the Supreme Court decision in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). In <em>Alyeska </em>the Court held that federal courts do not have the power to award attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties without specific statutory authorization. Prior to that decision lower federal courts had followed the fee-shifting policies Congress enacted in the attorneys\u2019 fees provisions of several civil rights statutes, for example, Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000a-3(b), 2000e-5(k) (1976), and awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties in cases brought under other civil rights laws.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In Congress\u2019 view <em>Alyeska</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3s\">created anomalous gaps in our civil rights laws whereby awards of fees are * * suddenly unavailable in the most fundamental civil rights cases. For instance, fees are now authorized in an employment discrimination suit under Title VII * * *, but not in the same suit brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, which protects similar rights but involves fewer technical prerequisites to the filing of an action. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">S. Rep. No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1976). To eliminate these \u201canomalous gaps\u201d Congress enacted the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Awards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">One theme that runs through the legislative history of the Act is the belief that attorneys\u2019 fees awards are crucial to vigorous enforcement of the civil rights statutes covered by Section 1988. Quoting the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, the Senate Report declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAv\">\u201cNot to award counsel fees in cases such as this would be tantamount to repealing the Act itself by frustrating its basic purpose. * * * Without counsel fees the grant of Federal jurisdiction is but an empty gesture * * *. <em>Hall v.

No. 94-1011, <em>supra, </em>at 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The award of attorneys\u2019 fees is crucial because these civil rights laws depend heavily on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>private enforcement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And as this court has noted, the policy favoring private enforcement of the civil rights laws is particularly compelling when a federal agency or official is the defendant. Unlike the cases involving private or state defendants, the complainants are not merely \u201cprivate attorneys general\u201d; they are the only attorneys general.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Department of Justice does not sue other federal government agencies for violations of the civil rights laws. Indeed, as in the instant cases, the Justice Department is frequently counsel for the other side. Thus the reasons behind the enactment of Section 1988 support the inference that it authorizes awards of attorneys\u2019 fees against the United States and caution against interpreting the statute in a manner that will frustrate Congress\u2019 purposes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As this court has said, \u201c[0]ur duty is to favor an interpretation which would render the statutory design effective in terms of the policies behind its enactment and to avoid an interpretation which would make such policies more difficult of fulfillment, particularly where * * * that interpretation is consistent with the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>National Petroleum Refiners Ass\u2019n v. FTC, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 83, 90, 482 F.2d 672, 689 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 951, 94 S.Ct. 1475, 39 L. Ed.2d 567 (1974). This is particularly essential where civil rights statutes are involved. Courts must accord such a statute \u201ca sweep as broad as its language.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>383 U.S. 787, 801, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 1160, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966); <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 437, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968); <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 97, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Congress used very broad language when it enacted Section 1988. The Act authorizes the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in <em>\u201cany </em>action or proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Supreme Court recently confirmed the Act\u2019s broad reach when it held in <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), that the language of the statute was sufficient to overcome the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity. In so holding the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">The Act itself could not be broader. It applies to \u201cany\u201d action brought to enforce certain civil rights laws. It contains no hint of an exception for States defending injunction actions * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2575. The language of the Act is also broad enough to apply to actions against the federal government. While the Act does not specifically mention the liability of the United States in civil rights cases,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> not every attorneys\u2019 fees pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>vision that has been found to authorize fee awards against the federal government has specifically mentioned the liability of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">For example, in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>484 F.2d 1331 (1st Cir. 1973), the First Circuit held that Section 304(d) of the Clean Air Act, now codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(d) (Supp. I 1977), authorized an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the United States. The court rejected the Government\u2019s claim that fee awards against the federal government were not authorized because the Act\u2019s \u201cany party\u201d language did not specifically refer to the liability of the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, this court recently held, without opposition from the Government, that the recent amendment of Section 307 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(f) (Supp. I 1977), to permit fee awards \u201c[i]n any judicial proceeding under this section\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> authorizes fee awards against the federal government. <em>Sierra Club v. EPA, </em>D.C. Cir. No. 76-1037, order of April 27,1979 (award of attorneys\u2019 fees of $11,760 to Sierra Club ordered paid by EPA) (case consolidated with <em>ASARCO v. EPA, </em>D.C. Cir. No. 76-1030). Equally instructive is the fact that Congress only recently enacted Section 505(b) of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-602, 92 Stat. 2983, an attorneys\u2019 fees provision which, in the words of its sponsor, \u201cparallels the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Awards Act of 1976 * * 124 Cong.Rec. S15590 (daily ed. Sept. 20, 1978) (remarks of Sen. Cranston). The language of Section 505(b) is virtually the same as that of Section 1988.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 505(b)\u2019s sponsor and the accompanying Committee Reports made it clear that this attorneys\u2019 fee provision is to be used to vindicate rights against the federal government.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If Congress thought Section 505(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>was precise enough to apply to the United States, then the same may be said of the statute after which it was modeled, Section 1988.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In any judicial proceeding under this section, the court may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) whenever it determines that such award is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-17\">In any action or proceeding to enforce or charge a violation of a provision of this title, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The legislative history of Section 1988 provides substantial support for the conclusion that Congress intended to authorize fee awards against the United States under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">There are numerous indications in the Senate and House Reports that Congress intended Section 1988 to have substantially the same coverage as the attorneys\u2019 fees provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which apply to the federal government. Both Reports stressed the fact that the legislation was designed to make our civil rights laws consistent. The Senate Report said: \u201cThe purpose of this amendment is to remedy anomalous gaps in our civil rights laws created by [the <em>Alyeska </em>decision], and to achieve consistency in our civil rights laws.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1011, <em>supra, </em>at 1. In a similar vein the House Report stated: \u201cIn order to achieve uniformity in the remedies provided by Federal laws guaranteeing civil and constitutional rights, it is necessary to add an attorney fee authorization to those civil rights acts which do not presently contain such a provision.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1976). Both Reports stressed that Section 1988 was fashioned after the attorneys\u2019 fees provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Senate Report noted: \u201cS. 2278 follows the language of Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 * * S.Rep. No. 94-1011, <em>supra, </em>at 2. The House Report stated: \u201cH.R. 15460 tracks the language of the counsel fee provisions of Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 * *.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, <em>supra, </em>at 5. The Reports also explained that the standards for awarding fees under Section 1988 would \u201cbe generally the same as under the fee provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1011, <em>supra, </em>at 4. The natural inference from all these factors is that Congress intended Section 1988\u2019s coverage to be the same as the coverage of the fee provisions of the 1964 Act. That Congress omitted the language specifically referring to the liability of the United States for attorneys\u2019 fees is not significant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Given all the indications that Congress intended Section 1988 to be just like the other civil rights attorneys\u2019 fees provisions, it is reasonable to assume that if Congress had intended to depart from the norm by immunizing the federal government from liability it would have done so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">The majority agrees that another section of the House Report contains further support for the view that Section 1988 applies to the federal government. <em>See </em>majority opinion, 197 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 609 F.2d at 517-518. In discussing the issue of fee awards to prevailing defendants, the House Report pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">[I]t should further be noted that governmental officials are frequently the defendants in cases brought under the statutes covered by H.R. 15460 [the bill which became \u00a7 1988]. <em>See, e.g., * </em>* * <em>Hills v. Gautreaux, </em>[425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976)]. Such governmental entities and officials have substantial resources available to them through funds in the common treasury, including the taxes paid by the plaintiffs themselves. * * * The greater resources available to governments provide an ample base from which fees can be awarded to the prevailing plaintiff in suits against governmental officials or entities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, <em>supra, </em>at 7 (footnote omitted). By citing <em>Hills v. Gautreaux, </em>a case involving a Title VI claim brought against a federal cabinet officer, as an example of a case in which a government official could be a defendant in a civil rights suit, and by pointing out that such officials would be liable for fee awards under Section 1988, the Report supports the inference that Congress intended the federal government to be liable for fee awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Both the majority in its opinion and the Government in its briefs have studiously avoided any mention of the hearings on the legislation that became Section 1988. This is unfortunate because the report of these hearings shows that even the Department of Justice, represented by Rex E. Lee, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, recognized that the legislation before the House Subcommittee would authorize fee awards against the federal government. In his testimony <em>in support </em>of the legislation, Mr. Lee said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">H.R. 8220 would authorize the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing plaintiff in actions brought under certain civil rights statutes. <em>Actions under the statutes involved have been brought against both federal officers and private individuals.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">H.R. 9552 authorizes the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees as a matter of discretion in certain civil rights litigation.

In introducing H.R. 9552 and several other attorneys\u2019 fees provisions he told the Subcommittee that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">[Ujnder these bills the Federal government could never recover its attorney fees. <em>On the other hand, it would be required to pay the counsel fees of a private prevailing party, which is prohibited generally by current law (see 28 U.S.C. 2412).

However, courts are willing to attach great weight to such testimony when it consists of \u201cprecise analyses of statutory phrases by the sponsors of the proposed laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Congressman Drinan introduced H.R. 9552 to the House Judiciary Subcommittee and was the chief sponsor of Section 1988 in the House.

However, fairly considered the debates offer the Government little support. Rather, they support the conclusion that Congress intended Section 1988 to apply to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">1. <em>The Senate Debates</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ajb\">In his remarks in support of the bill Senator Hugh Scott, who opened the debate on S. 2278, explained that its enactment would \u201cassure that attorney\u2019s fees will be available in suits brought under the reconstruction-era civil rights laws, * * * <em>in the same fashion and to the same extent as the statutes presently provide in cases brought under title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\u201d </em>122 Cong.Rec. S16251 (daily ed. Sept. 21,1976) (emphasis added). Since the United States is liable for attorneys\u2019 fees in Title VII cases, the natural inference from this is that fees may be awarded against the United States under Section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The Government relies on an amendment offered by Senator Helms, an opponent of the bill, which purportedly shows that he understood the bill not to apply to the United States. However, a closer examination of the Helms amendment shows that Senator Helms misunderstood the import of the phrase \u201cother than the United States.\u201d Section 1988 authorizes the award of fees to \u201cthe prevailing party, other than the United States * * The amendment would have inserted the phrase \u201cor any State * * * or any political subdivision thereof\u201d after the latter phrase. 122 Cong. Rec. S16433 (daily ed. Sept. 22, 1976). But the effect of this addition would have been to deny <em>both </em>the United States <em>and </em>state and local governments the right to recover attorneys\u2019 fees if they were prevailing parties. On the other hand, it is significant that Senator Allen, a principal opponent of the bill,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> understood it to permit awards against the federal government. He unsuccessfully sponsored an amendment that would have limited the liability of the United States to situations in which an official of the federal government \u201chas acted in a contumacious or vexatious manner.\u201d 122 Cong.Rec.

In the only portion of the House debates that directly addressed the question of the liability of the United States under Section 1988, Congressman Railsback, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Subcommittee which drafted the House version of the legislation that became Section 1988 and a strong supporter of the bill, made it quite clear that it applied to the United States. The colloquy between Mr. Railsback and Mr. Quie is very revealing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">Mr. Quie. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">I would like to ask the minority member, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Railsback), a question. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">First, I would like to ask if the U.

This is the type of \u201cprecise analyses of statutory phrases by the sponsors of proposed laws\u201d which courts give significant weight. <em>S&amp;E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 13 n.9, 92 S.Ct. at 1418, 1419 n.9. I am at a loss to understand how the majority can maintain, in the face of evidence of this sort, that the legislative history of the Act does not clearly show that Congress intended Section 1988 to apply to the United States.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Only \u201cprevailing parties\u201d may be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 1988. The Government concedes that appellees in <em>An-drulis v. United States, </em>No. 78-2039, are prevailing parties. But it challenges the District Court\u2019s ruling that appellees in <em>NAACP v. Civiletti, </em>No. 78-1639, are prevailing parties. The majority does not reach this issue since it finds that Section 1988 does not apply to the federal government. Because I find Section 1988 applicable to the United States, I will briefly examine the Government\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The case arose out of the fatal shooting of Carnell Russ, a black man, by a white Arkansas law enforcement officer while Russ was detained for an alleged traffic violation. The officer was tried for manslaughter and acquitted by a state court jury. The Justice Department reviewed the transcript of the trial and FBI reports and decided against prosecuting the officer under the federal criminal civil rights statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Subsequently, the Russ family and the NAACP brought suit under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985 (1976), challenging the adequacy of the federal investigation and the decision not to prosecute. The nub of their claim was that the Justice Department illegally deferred to the state proceedings pursuant to a policy, established in 1959 by then Attorney General Rogers, of not initiating a federal prosecution after a state prosecution for \u201ethe same act, unless there were compelling reasons. Plaintiffs sought both damages and injunc-tive relief.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">While this suit was pending, then Attorney General Bell issued in February 1977 a memorandum modifying the 1959 policy against dual prosecutions. He announced a new policy of evaluating \u201ceach and every allegation of a violation of the civil rights laws * * * on its own merits,\u201d without regard to related state enforcement action. Joint Appendix (JA) 277. Both parties agreed that the Bell memorandum effectively mooted the lawsuit, and they filed a joint motion to dismiss. In granting the motion the District Court agreed with the parties that the Bell memorandum was in accord \u201cwith the policy objectives which underlie this lawsuit * * *.\u201d JA 279, 282-283. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for and were awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">The award of attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 1988 is left to the discretion of the court. As such the District Court\u2019s judgment should be reversed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284, 1300 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Sandford v. R. L. Coleman Realty Co., </em>573 F.2d 173, 179 (4th Cir. 1978). The District Court properly identified the test for a prevailing party as \u201cwhether that party has accomplished the objectives of his litigation. <em>Parker v. Matthews, </em>411 F.Supp. 1059,1064 (D.D.C. 1976), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Parker v. Califano, </em>[182 U.S. App.D.C. 322], 561 F.2d 320 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\u201d JA 283.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The District Court found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpersistent prosecution of this action was a strong catalytic factor in the issuance of the Bell memorandum.\u201d JA 284. It also found that the plaintiffs had achieved the policy objective set out in their second amended complaint \u2014 publicizing and correcting the Justice Department\u2019s policy of deferring to prior state civil rights prosecutions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">To be sure, fathoming the Attorney General\u2019s motives is not the easiest of tasks. Nevertheless, I conclude, after a careful review of the record, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to appellees as \u201cprevailing parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The attorneys\u2019 fees provisions of the civil rights statutes were enacted \u201cto encourage individuals injured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief * * <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968). Courts construing these attorneys\u2019 fees provisions must strive to further this goal. The decision by the majority of this court will defeat Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting Section 1988 insofar as suits against the federal government are concerned.

Since the Allen amendment only authorizes fee awards in certain actions <em>brought by the IRS, </em>it could not have used the term \u201cany action\u201d or \u201cany action under the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d Hence, by mentioning the United States specifically in the IRS portion of \u00a7 1988 Congress merely intended to make it plain that \u00a7 1988 does not apply to all tax cases.

Senator Allen led a filibuster against the bill which he ended only when the bill\u2019s sponsors compromised by accepting an amendment that he proposed. <em>See </em>122 Cong.Rec. S17050 (daily ed. Sept. 29, 1976); note 10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b621-16\">. The Government points to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u201cestimate\u201d (see S.Rep. No. 94-1011, <em>supra </em>note 7, at 7; H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, supra note 7, at 10) that enactment of the bill would result in no additional costs to the Government. This \u201cno cost\u201d feature of the bill was referred to in the floor debates. A few points are worth noting in assessing the significance of this \u201cno additional costs\u201d estimate. First, it appears that attorneys\u2019 fees awards against the Government are paid from the Department\u2019s existing appropriations. Mr. Lee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>confirmed this in his testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ane-dedup-0\">[Attorneys\u2019 fees awards * * * necessarily <em>reduce </em>available resources, with concom-mitant impact on other Government programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">House Hearings, <em>supra </em>note 16, at 178 (emphasis added). Thus the CBO did not foresee any additional costs <em>(i.e., </em>new appropriations) to the Government. Second, it is significant that although the United States is liable for attorneys\u2019 fees under other civil rights statutes passed prior to \u00a7 1988, and is liable under \u00a7 1988 to prevailing defendants in some internal revenue cases, there is no line item in the Justice Department\u2019s appropriations for such payments. These payments are apparently made from a general fund for \u201cexpenses necessary for the legal activities of the Department of Justice * * Pub.L. No. 95-431, 92 Stat. 1026. Third, it would have been incongruous for CBO or Congress to \u201cestimate\u201d the expenditures required to compensate individuals for the federal government\u2019s abridgement of civil rights laws. Finally, the amounts involved are likely to be minimal unless one assumes wholesale violations of civil rights laws by federal government agencies or officials. In light of all these factors, and given the other indications that Congress intended \u00a7 1988 to apply to the United States, it is reasonable to conclude that the CBO \u201cestimate\u201d is not incompatible with the conclusion that \u00a7 1988 authorizes awards against the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Much the same explanation can be given to a letter written by Congressman Rodino, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced during the Senate debate on a proposed amendment to S. 2278 that would have subjected the United States to broad liability for tax cases. In the letter Mr. Rodino expressed concern that the amendment could jeopardize Administration support for the bill and weaken its chances for enactment. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">I fear that Senator Goldwater\u2019s amendment \u2014 lacking a careful analysis by the Administration, and in light of the Administration\u2019s prior position on another IRS attorney fee provision \u2014 will jeopardize the * * * Act * * *. S. 2278 is presently a very narrow bill intended to enable private enforcement of civil rights acts. It does not involve federal spending, and has specifically been supported by the Administration at a hearing before [a] House Subcommittee * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-14\">The Committee is presently studying other bills, like Senator Goldwater\u2019s, which would go far beyond the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d or the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d exception to it, and which may allow recovery against the Federal Government. We hope to take action next Congress on such bills. However, I fear that quick action on the Goldwater amendment, which goes far beyond the narrow provisions of S. [2]278, would defeat the bill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">122 Cong.Rec. S16490 (daily ed. Sept. 23, 1976). The majority cites this letter as evidence that some members of Congress did not think that S. 2278 applied to the United States. Majority opinion, 197 U.S.App.D.C. at - n.ll, 609 F.2d at 519 n.ll. While it is possible to interpret Mr. Rodino\u2019s letter in this manner, it is equally plausible that it merely reflects his expectation that the federal government will not often be guilty of violating civil rights laws and, hence, fee awards against the United States will be minimal. In this regard it is significant that Congressman Rodino did not challenge Congressman Railsback\u2019s statement, made in the House at a time when the debate specifically focused on the question of the liability of the United States, that \u00a7 1988 allows recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees from the federal government. <em>See </em>text at notes 21-22 <em>infra. </em>Congressman Rodino\u2019s real concern was with the broad scope of the proposed amendment\u2014 its possible impact on Administration support and therefore on the bill\u2019s chances for enactment \u2014 not the question whether \u00a7 1988 allows recovery against the federal government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">. The Government attempts to explain Congressman Railsback\u2019s statement as due to confusion caused by the House\u2019s \u201celeventh hour\u201d consideration of the bill. In addition, it suggests that this statement was immediately refuted by Congressman Drinan, the bill\u2019s sponsor, when the latter remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">[It] is very clearly limited. If a Federal judge came to that conclusion it would indeed be a most unusual case. This provision was inserted into the Senate bill. It did not originate with the House Judiciary Committee. It does give a remedy for the most extraordinary case where the defense could assert and prove to a Federal judge that an IRS case brought against him was so vexatious and so without merit that he should get compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 12164. However, it seems that if there was any confusion it was on the part of Congressman Drinan. He apparently thought that Congressman Railsback was referring to the amendment to the bill, adopted in the Senate, which made the United States liable to prevailing defendants in certain tax cases. <em>See </em>note 10 <em>supra. </em>Congressman Railsback was not in fact referring to this provision. When Congressman Railsback reiterated his understanding that the bill authorized awards against the United States, his statement was not challenged by Congressman Rodino who shared the view that the Act allowed awards against the federal government. <em>See </em>text at notes 17-18 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b623-15\">. The Government relies on, and the majority cites with approval, court decisions that have held that \u00a7 1988 does not apply to the United States, <em>Shannon v. HUD, </em>433 F.Supp. 249 (E.D. Pa.1977), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>577 F.2d 854 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1000, 99 S.Ct. 611, 58 L.Ed.2d 677 (1978); <em>Southeast Legal Defense Group [SLDG] v. Adams, </em>436 F.Supp. 891 (D.Or.1977). The District Courts that decided the <em>Shannon </em>and <em>SLDG </em>cases did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s comment in <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), about the broad reach of \u00a7 1988. The Third Circuit in its brief <em>per curiam </em>did not address this point. Moreover, these courts appear to have been under the mistaken impression that the only attorneys\u2019 fees provisions that have been applied to the United States are those that specifically mention the United States by name. But as the majority of this court points out, an intention to authorize such awards may be inferred by \u201cnecessary implication\u201d from the context in which a fee provision is found. <em>See </em>text at notes 11-14 <em>supra; </em>majority opinion, 197 U.S.App. D.C. at - \u2014 , 609 F.2d at 516. Finally, the <em>SLDG </em>court misconstrued \u00a7 1988\u2019s legislative history (the Third Circuit\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>opinion in <em>Shannon </em>cited <em>SLDG </em>with approval, 577 F.2d at 856). The <em>SLDG </em>court noted that the Senate rejected an amendment offered by Senator Helms which would have made the United States liable for attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties in every civil case and to acquitted criminal defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>It concluded from this that Congress declined the opportunity to authorize fee awards in civil rights cases under \u00a7 1988. 436 F.Supp. at 893. This conclusion is erroneous. Senator Helms was an opponent of the bill and his aim in offering the amendment was to lessen the bill\u2019s chances for enactment by broadening the Government\u2019s scope of liability. The Administration for one was opposed to such broad liability. <em>See </em>House Hearings, <em>supra </em>note 16, at 177-182 (testimony of Mr. Lee). The fact that Congress declined to enact such a broad attorneys\u2019 fees provision can in no way be interpreted as a rejection of the Government\u2019s liability under the more limited legislation being considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\">.
