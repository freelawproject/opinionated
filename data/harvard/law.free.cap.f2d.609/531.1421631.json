The offenses stemmed from a scheme in which appellant would be paid to have an accomplice delete adverse information from, and add fictitious favorable information to, the computerized credit files of individuals who had difficulty obtaining credit. The altered credit records would then be sent for approval to various lending institutions, ultimately allowing these individuals to purchase automobiles or other items. The indictment, which was based on only eight credit transactions, included one count of conspiracy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> twenty-five counts of mail<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and wire<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> fraud (counts 2-21 and 22-26), three counts of false statements to a federally insured bank (counts 27-29),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and six counts of D.C. felony false pretenses (counts 30-35).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Certain of the multiple convictions under both federal and local law are contrary to congressional intent, requiring vacation of two or four convictions. Furthermore, the mailings at issue here cannot sustain convictions under the mail fraud statute because they occurred after the scheme to defraud had reached fruition. Finally, we vacate the sentences imposed on counts 27 through 29 of the indictment because they exceed the statutory maximum, and we remand for resentencing in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 and this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The remainder of the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-20\">MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS UNDER FEDERAL AND D.C. LAW</p>\n<p id=\"AD00\">Each fraudulent credit transaction gave rise to multiple charges against Alston. In one transaction, an altered credit application and an altered credit report were sent by teletype (counts 13 and 15, wire fraud) to a federally insured savings bank (count 27, federal false statements), the applicant obtained an automobile loan from the bank (count 34, D.C. false pretenses), and the bank notified the dealer about the loan by telephone (count 20, wire fraud). In a second transaction, an individual applied for a home improvement loan from a federally insured bank (count 28, federal false statements), the credit bureau teleeopied an altered credit record to the bank (count 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>wire fraud), and the applicant obtained the loan (count 33, D.C. false pretenses). In four other transactions, applicants obtained automobile loans from a finance company (counts 30, 31, 32 and 35, D.C. false pretenses); in these transactions, wire fraud was charged for each time the automobile dealer telecopied a fraudulent application to the finance company (counts 2, 6, 9 and 11), the credit bureau telecopied an altered credit record to the lender (counts 3, 7, 10, 12 and 16), and the lender telephoned notice of loan approval to the dealer (counts 17, 18, 19 and 21). Mail fraud was charged each time the dealer mailed a completed sales contract to the lender (counts 22 through 26). Two remaining transactions, which involved unsuccessful attempts to obtain loans, triggered charges of federal false statements (count 29) and wire fraud (counts 4, 5, and 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">This case raises problems that flow from an overkill of charges against a defendant. Pyramiding charges is particularly troublesome in the District of Columbia, where local and federal offenses can be joined in one indictment pursuant to 11 D.C.Code \u00a7 502 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Appellant argues that the multiple convictions under federal and local law denied him equal protection of the laws. Subsequent to the submission of this case for decision, this court has clarified the method by which we will analyze challenges to convictions under both federal and local law when the acts complained of arise within essentially the same transaction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As explained in <em>United States v. Dorsey,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court must determine whether Congress intended to authorize multiple punishments under the particular statutes in question, and if so, whether the multiple punishments are constitutional. Therefore, we first consider whether Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for a single fraudulent transaction that violates both the D.C. false pretenses statute and either the federal false statements statute or the federal mail and wire fraud statutes. Because of the similar purposes underlying the false pretenses and false statements statutes, we think that Congress did not intend multiple punishments in the circumstances presented here. On the other hand, we do discern a congressional intent to impose multiple punishments when an act or transaction violates both the false pretenses and the mail or wire fraud statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">The D.C. false pretenses statute, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1301 (1973), provides that \u201c[wjhoever, by any false pretense, with intent to defraud, obtains from any person any service or anything of value,\u201d shall be subjected to imprisonment for up to three years. The federal false statements statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (1976), provides that \u201c[w]hoever knowingly makes any false statement or report, . . . for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of . any [federally insured] bank\u201d can be imprisoned for not more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Congress clearly defined separate offenses in each statute: \u201ceach provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180,182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); <em>see Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). Conviction on the local charge of false pretenses requires proof of the following elements: (1) a false representation; (2) knowledge of the falsity; (3) intent to defraud; (4) reliance by the defrauded party; and (5) obtaining something of value as a result of the false representation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Conviction on the federal charge of false statements requires proof of (1) a material false statement, (2) to a federally insured finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>cial institution, (3) for the purpose of influencing the action of the institution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">On their face, the local and federal statutes address different interests. The local statute focuses on the loss of anything of value, regardless of the identity of the victim. The federal statute is designed to protect specific financial institutions from fraud \u201cin connection with loans or other similar transactions.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The federal offense is complete when the false statement is made; it does not require that the bank actually part with something of value.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Yet some fraudulent loan applications might result in the grant of a loan, as occurred here,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> resulting in separate criminal charges based on the same act or acts. In this case, proof of the federal false statements charge coincided with proof of the D.C. false pretenses charge, except for the element of <em>obtaining </em>the loan: the \u201cfalse <em>statement\u201d </em>knowingly made was a \u201cfalse representation\u201dknowingly made; the <em>\u201cpurpose </em>of influencing the action\u201d of the bank was the <em>\u201cintent </em>to defraud\u201d the bank to obtain a loan; and a <em>bank </em>having federally insured deposits was the <em>\u201cdefrauded party\u201d </em>acting in reliance on the <em>fraudulent application. </em>Thus, in the context of this case the two counts allege essentially the same offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the three year maximum sentence under the D.C. false pretenses statute \u2014 applicable when a loan is actually obtained \u2014 appears analogous to an enhancement of the two years maximum sentence under the federal false statements statute \u2014 applicable when a false statement is made in an attempt to obtain a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">\u201c[U]nless the intent of Congress is stated \u2018clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since we find no such statement here, we apply \u201ca corollary of the rule of lenity, an outgrowth of our reluctance to multiply punishments absent a clear and definite legislative directive.\u201d <em>Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 15-16, 98 S.Ct. 909, 914, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). Accordingly, we direct vacation of the convictions under either counts 27 and 28 (false statements) or counts 33 and 34 (false pretenses) of the renumbered indictment, and appropriate re-sentencing of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">We turn now to the multiple punishments under the federal mail or wire fraud statutes and the D.C. false pretenses statute. The mail<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and wire<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> fraud statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>prescribe a penalty for <em>each </em>use<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of the mails or wires \u201cfor the purpose of executing\u201d a scheme to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of false pretenses. The focus of each statute is upon the misuse of the instrumentality of communication.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The interest to be protected under these federal statutes is clearly distinct from the property interest safeguarded by the local statute. Several courts have found that Congress intended to authorize multiple punishment under both the mail or wire fraud statute and other federal fraud statutes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We conclude that Congress likewise intended violations of the mail or wire fraud statute to be separately punishable from violations of the local false pretenses statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Under the analytical framework established in <em>United States v. Dorsey, supra, </em>we next consider a constitutional inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adu\">[E]ven if Congress intends to punish a defendant twice for violating two statutory provisions, the double jeopardy clause may bar such multiple punishment at a single trial if the two statutory provisions constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d under <em>Blockburger.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">591 F.2d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">The statutes in question clearly define separate offenses. Conviction for mail or wire fraud requires proof of only two elements: (1) a scheme to defraud, and (2) use of the mails or wires for the purpose of executing the scheme.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Conviction for false pretenses requires proof of several additional elements, and does not require proof of use of the mails or wires.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Since each requires proof of a fact that the other does not, they are clearly not the \u201csame offense\u201d under <em>Blockburger. </em>Thus, the double jeopardy clause does not prohibit multiple punishments under these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">Appellant advances a second constitutional question in his claim that the multiple punishments denied him equal protection of the laws. This claim rests on an assumption that no defendant outside the District of Columbia would be subject to such double punishment because the Department of Justice\u2019s Petite<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> policy bars successive state-federal prosecutions for \u201cthe same act or acts.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The <em>Petite </em>policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>was announced in 1959 in direct response to the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings that the Constitution does not prohibit state and federal governments from prosecuting a defendant for the same act.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As the Court recently explained in <em>Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 29, 98 S.Ct. 81, 85, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977): \u201cAlthough not constitutionally mandated, this <em>[Petite] </em>policy serves to protect interests which, but for the \u2018dual sovereignty\u2019 principle inherent in our federal system, would be embraced by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Although we recognize that the <em>Petite </em>policy is of long standing and strictly enforced,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we conclude that it provides no basis for a successful equal protection claim here.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The <em>Petite </em>policy is not law, but rather an executive policy that permits of exceptions in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The federal government remains free, under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Abbate v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 187, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959), to bring a federal prosecution subsequent to a state prosecution. Furthermore, neither the <em>Petite </em>policy nor the Constitution serves as a bar to a <em>state </em>prosecution and sentence following a federal prosecution and sentence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It is possible, therefore, that defendants outside the District could be punished for both federal and state offenses arising from the same act or transaction.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">INTENT TO DEFRAUD</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Appellant also argues that the evidence did not establish the intent to defraud required for convictions under the federal mail and wire fraud statutes, and the local false pretenses statute. Conceding that the loan applications and credit records were falsified in order to allow the applicants to obtain credit, appellant nevertheless contends that there was no intent to defraud because the applicants intended to repay the loans and because retention of a security interest in the goods made the loans risk free.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The requisite intent under the federal mail and wire fraud statutes may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances and need not be proven by direct evidence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Where, as here, the relevant documents contained material misrepresentations designed to induce an extension of credit that would not otherwise be made, the jury could reasonably infer intent to defraud.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In addition, the misrepresentations in each transaction were made on two key documents and by several people acting in concert, thus increasing the likelihood that the creditor would be deceived as to the nature of the financial risk involved. We believe these facts support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We also conclude that intent to defraud under the local false pretenses statute cannot turn solely upon an applicant\u2019s alleged intent to repay the loan. In these transactions, the probabilities of repayment by the borrower over the long term were less than the lender was led to believe. We are not unmindful that installment and other credit sales have created financial problems of substantial proportions for consumers and creditors alike. Many consumers are financially incapable of paying outstanding debts, despite good intentions.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Consequently, we cannot sanction a scheme whereby would-be borrowers fraudulently obtain loans that would not otherwise be available to them, regardless of whether they <em>might </em>have intended to repay so long as they were capable of doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">USE OF THE MAILS</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">Finally, appellant asserts that his convictions on the five counts of mail fraud (counts 22-26) cannot stand. Each count arises from the mailing of an installment sales contract to the lender by the automobile dealer. Appellant argues that, because these mailings occurred after each applicant had taken possession of an automobile, they occurred after the scheme to defraud had reached fruition and were not sufficiently connected to the fraud to fall within the scope of the statute. If appellant is correct, then the convictions are invalid. <em>See United States v. Maze, </em>414 U.S. 395, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">For conviction under the mail fraud statute, the mails must be used \u201cfor the purpose of executing\u201d the fraudulent scheme, and not merely \u201cas a result of\u201d such scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 405, 94 S.Ct. 645. In <em>Kann v. United States, </em>323 U.S. 88, 65 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>148, 89 L.Ed. 88 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a scheme involving fraudulently obtained checks was completed once the checks were cashed. The Court reasoned that the defendants had intended to receive money, and that the money had been received \u201cirrevocably\u201d when they cashed the checks. Thus, when the payor banks mailed the checks to the drawee bank for collection, the mailings were not for the purpose of <em>executing </em>the scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 94, 65 S.Ct. 148. Similarly, in <em>Parr v. United States, </em>363 U.S. 370, 80 S.Ct. 1171, 4 L.Ed.2d 1277 (1960), the defendants had obtained gasoline and other products and services by the unauthorized use of a credit card issued to their employer. The defendants were charged with mail fraud for having \u201ccaused\u201d the sending of invoices to the employer and the sending of payments to the issuer. The Court held the convictions invalid on the ground that defendants\u2019 scheme reached fruition when the goods and services were received, because \u201c[i]t was immaterial to them, or to any consummation of the scheme, how the [oil company] would . . . collect\u201d its payment. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 80 S.Ct. at 1184. Most recently, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maze, supra, </em>the Court ruled that mailings of credit card sales invoices by merchants to a bank, and by the bank to the credit card holder, could not support mail fraud convictions because the defendant, who had stolen the credit card, had irrevocably received the goods and services before the mailings occurred. Nor did the subsequent mailings constitute \u201c \u2018deliberate, planned use of the mails\u2019 \u201d by the perpetrator to aid the continuation or concealment of the fraudulent scheme. 414 U.S. at 403, 94 S.Ct. at 650 (quoting <em>United States v. Sampson, </em>371 U.S. 75, 80, 83 S.Ct. 173, 9 L.Ed.2d 136 (1962)). Thus, the mail fraud statute was inapplicable to the mailings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Appellant here argues that, since the object of the scheme was to obtain an automobile, it reached fruition once the car was driven off the dealer\u2019s lot. The Government, on the other hand, contends that the object was to obtain credit and use of the car <em>over the loan period. </em>Under this theory, the mailing of the conditional sales contract <em>after </em>the loan applicant had obtained credit approval and a car would be within the coverage of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">We believe that the scheme to defraud reached fruition before the mailing of each conditional sales contract. The dealer\u2019s mailing of the contract, which contained the terms of payment and an assignment of the contract to the lending institution, neither furthered the objective of the scheme (i. e., obtaining a loan for the applicant) nor served to conceal the fraudulent representations.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Although the signing of the installment contract may have been a contemplated step toward obtaining possession of the car, we believe the subsequent <em>mailing </em>was immaterial to the fraud perpetrated upon the lender by the borrower.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We therefore vacate the convictions on counts 22 through 26 on the grounds that the mailings were not \u201cfor the purpose of executing\u201d the scheme to obtain loans.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Por the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the District Court with respect to counts 22 through 29 and counts 33 and 34 of the indictment, and we remand for resentencing in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 and this opinion. The remainder of the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b627-15\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1301 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-16\">.

In light of the record as a whole, including the various cautionary instructions to the jury with respect to these matters, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\">. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Girst, </em>(D.C.

In <em>Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 98 S.Ct. 81, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977), the Supreme Court held that federal courts must respect even a belated effort by the Justice Department to invoke the <em>Petite </em>policy. Defendant in <em>Ri-naldi </em>was charged with state offenses and was then indicted for federal offenses stemming from a hotel robbery. He was convicted of the state charges and sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment. Subsequent to the state conviction, two federal trials were held, the first having ended in a mistrial. Defendant was convicted of the federal charges after a jury trial, and was sentenced to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment to run concurrently with the state sentence. On appeal from the federal judgment, defendant argued that his conviction violated the <em>Petite </em>policy. The Government agreed and asked the appellate court to remand the case so that the Government could move to dismiss the indictment. After remand, the District Court denied the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and the Fifth Circuit en <em>banc </em>affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling. But the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and ordered dismissal of the indictment. In so doing the Court stated that, although the expenditure of judicial and prose-cutorial resources was by then irreparable, \u201c \u2018no societal interest would be vindicated by punishing further a defendant who has already been convicted and has received a substantial sentence in state court. . . <em>Id. </em>at 31, 98 S.Ct. at 86 (quoting Solicitor General).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\">. <em>See United States v.

But this underlying rationale is absent where a defendant is prosecuted for violating laws of both the United States and the District of Columbia, since the laws emanate from one sovereign.

I concur in the other holdings in the court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The purchaser of an automobile was required to apply for credit from a lender and to be approved before a dealer would agree to a conditional sales contract. When the lender gave oral approval of the loan application a contract was sent through the mails which provided for assignment of the dealer\u2019s rights and warranted that the purchaser\u2019s representations in the credit application were true. Receipt of the written contract through the mails was a regular, contemplated and necessary step in the consummation of the loan transaction. These facts were sufficient to demonstrate that the mailings were in furtherance of the scheme to defraud, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The purpose of the scheme to defraud was to obtain credit and use of an automobile over the loan period. If any of the representations in the contract with respect to the purchaser\u2019s financial history thereafter proved to be false the lender was free to rescind the loan and demand immediate payment. In short, mailing of the written contracts was an essential step in the execution of the scheme to defraud. <em>See United States v.
