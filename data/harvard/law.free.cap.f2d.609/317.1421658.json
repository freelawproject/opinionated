Employees at that plant strongly reacted to Swift\u2019s announcement that it would pay no vacation benefits for the subsequent year, which employees urged had already been earned in 1969. According to Swift, because the plant would not be open on December 28, 1969, and because the contract provided that one requirement for vacation eligibility was that an employee be on the \u201cactive payroll\u201d of the company on that date, none of the employees met the criteria and none were eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">While the union initially pressed these employees\u2019 vacation pay claim, it later settled with Swift by withdrawing the vacation pay claim and obtaining pension benefits for other employees who were then active union members. This \u201cswap\u201d resulted in the Settlement Agreement of June 30, 1971 entered into between Swift and Amalgamated, which barred the union\u2019s right to further press the vacation pay claim with the company. The trade was made without the participation of the former employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">The plaintiffs thereafter came to federal court, urging that the trade of its valuable vacation pay claim by the union was a breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation to them, and further, that the company had wrongfully refused to pay the vacation benefits in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">The district court held Amalgamated and Swift liable, and apportioned the damages between them. In reaching its final decision, the district court concluded that it was unnecessary for the plaintiffs to have exhausted intra-union appeals, that the union by arbitrary conduct and with hostile discrimination had unfairly represented the plaintiff class, and that the company, under the court\u2019s reading of the contract, owed plaintiffs the vacation benefits. We reverse, based on our interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-20\">\n<em>Exhaustion of Intra-union Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-21\">In its first line of defense in the district court, Amalgamated moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint by contending that plaintiffs had not exhausted internal union remedies provided by Amalgamated\u2019s constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>motion on grounds that the plaintiffs at the pertinent time were nonmembers who lacked standing to invoke remedies provided by the internal union mechanisms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">As a general rule, where a union provides its members with an appeal procedure, resort to the means of appeal is required prior to consideration of the member\u2019s unfair representation claim in federal court. If such exhaustion is required generally, however, it is certainly not the case that the courts are powerless to exercise discretion by assessing the adequacy of the remedy afforded and thus the essential utility of mandating exhaustion in a given case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cGenerally, the courts will require an exhaustion of intra-union remedies in the absence of some showing that to do so would be futile or that the remedies are inadequate.\u201d <em>Foy v. Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., </em>377 F.2d 243, 246 (4th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The <em>Foy </em>case, <em>supra, </em>utilized a statutory section of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 411(a)(4). The <em>proviso </em>to that section (the <em>section </em>primarily <em>prohibits </em>a union from limiting the right of a member to institute an action in any court or agency) <em>permits </em>the use of an exhaustion requirement of limited duration prior to a court suit or administrative action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">(4) Protection of the right to sue. \u2014 No labor organization shall limit the right of any member thereof to institute an action in any court * * * <em>Provided, </em>That any such member may be required to exhaust reasonable hearing procedures (but not to exceed a four-month lapse of time) within such organization, before instituting legal or administrative proceedings against such organizations or any officer thereof * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 411(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">In <em>Detroy v. American Guild of Variety Artists, </em>286 F.2d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 1961) the Second Circuit concluded that \u201cit appears clear that the proviso was incorporated <em>in order to preserve the exhaustion doctrine as it had developed and would continue to develop in the courts, </em>lest it otherwise appear to be Congress\u2019 intention to have the right to sue secured by \u00a7 101 abrogate the requirement of prior resort to internal procedures.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">From the \u00a7 411 jurisprudence the courts have, with varying outcomes, on a case-by-case basis, analyzed the futility, the adequacy of remedy, and the reasonableness of an exhaustion requirement in the context of a \u00a7 301 action alleging breach of contract and unfair representation. <em>See Chambers v. Local Union No. 639, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>188 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 578 F.2d 375 (1978); <em>Battle v. Clark Equipment Co., </em>579 F.2d 1338 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>Winter v. Local Union No. 639, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>186 U.S.App. D.C. 315, 569 F.2d 146 (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>We have carefully considered the posture of this case at the time the plaintiffs allegedly should have taken an intraunion appeal, and find no adequate remedy which such an appeal could have provided the plaintiffs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">The dispositive legal issue is whether appellant had a reasonable and substantial likelihood of obtaining redress of their grievances (if their claims were meritorious) by pursuing the internal remedies of their individual craft unions. If it is clear they could, the District Court is justified in dismissing their complaint for failure to do so. The appellants should not be denied a hearing on the merits of their claim, however, unless there was a genuine possibility that they could have obtained an adequate intra-union remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmOI\"><em>Frederickson v. System Federation No. 114 of Railway Employees\u2019 Department, </em>436 F.2d 764,768 (9th Cir. 1970). In the present case, not only did the union refuse to arbitrate the claim, it concededly gave up that claim to Swift in part for Swift\u2019s agreement to pay other claims in the amount of $928,200. The Settlement Agreement was then ratified by a vote of the then-members of the Local on June 21,1971. It is difficult to understand how an appeal to the union hierarchy could have altered a binding, bilateral agreement between the union and the company, or have reversed the process at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">As the court said in <em>Chambers v. Local Union No. 639, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, supra, </em>188 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 578 F.2d 375, in a similar situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">The union-company position antagonistic to appellants has hardened. Appellants are confronted with a settled decision which conforms to the contentions of the Union, and Kane [the employer] is willing to implement it. That decision, reached on the merits, if not otherwise improper, is final and binding on all parties as provided by the Agreement. Recourse to internal union procedures could not conceivably change that opinion. The seniority-roster-merger question has gone too far, and involves the company too deeply, for the plaintiff-employees to expect any reasonable chance of relief from subsequent internal union complaint proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\"><em>Id. </em>188 U.S.App.D.C. at 136, 578 F.2d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The text of the Settlement Agreement entered into between Swift and Amalgamated described their action as \u201cfinal and binding\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">WHEREAS, Local P-167, the International, and the Company have <em>now concluded a final and binding settlement </em>of such four grievance cases in accordance with paragraph 59 of said Grievance Procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">NOW, THEREFORE, the International, Local P-167, and the Company agree as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">1. The International Local P-167 agree to withdraw from said Grievance Procedure <em>with prejudice </em>the following four grievance cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-14\">South St. Paul Grievance Case No. 69-22</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">South St. Paul Grievance Case No. 69-25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-16\">South St. Paul Grievance Case No. 70-01</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-17\">South St. Paul Grievance Case No. 70-03</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">(Emphasis added.) Note also that the agreement ostensibly bound <em>all levels </em>of the union, both local and international, which distinguishes this case from a case Amalgamated relies upon, <em>Johnson v. Wilson Foods Corp. &amp; Amalgamated Meat Cutters, </em>No. 77-2051 (D.Kan. July 5, 1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>We conclude that on this particular set of facts the chance for a <em>resolution, </em>other than union affirmation of its prior action, was doubtful; neither direct relief nor renouncement of the binding agreement with the company was probable. As the Supreme Court said in <em>NLRB v. Industrial Union of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Workers, </em>391 U.S. 418, 88 S.Ct. 1717, 20 L.Ed.2d 706 (1968), a case grounded on public policy considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">If the member becomes exhausted, instead of the remedies, the issues * * * are never reached and an airing of the grievance never had.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 425, 88 S.Ct. at 1722.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">We therefore agree with the trial court that plaintiffs are excused from the requirement to exhaust, based on our view that there was no reasonable likelihood of a truly effective remedy had they pursued the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Breach of the <em>Collective Bargaining Agreement </em>\u2014 Merits <em>of the Vacation Pay Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">We have carefully reviewed the district court\u2019s construction of the contract terms, but have reached a different conclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">We base our differing interpretation on the actual practice of the parties under the agreement, the bargaining history, and an alternative line of judicial and arbitral authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">The Master Agreement of 1967 between Amalgamated and Swift provided as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">Vacations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">30. <em>Vacation year </em>\u2014 Vacation eligibility requirements are based upon credited service. The period December 28 through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the subsequent December 27 shall be considered the vacation year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">32. <em>Subsequent vacations </em>\u2014 An employe who has received his (or her) first vacation (excluding an employe scheduled to be retired on January 1) is hereafter eligible for subsequent annual vacations as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">(1) On December 28, provided that on said December 28 he is being carried on the active payroll and provided that he has at all times since his last vacation been on either the active payroll or a benefit payroll;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">(2) On December 28, provided that during the preceding 365 calendar days he has not been off the payroll for more consecutive days than sixty (60), Sundays and holidays included, and provided that on said December 28 he is being carried on the active payroll;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">(3) On December 28, provided that during the preceding 365 calendar days he has completed 270 calendar days on the payroll and provided that on said December 28 he is being carried on the active payroll;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">(4) On that date in the vacation year, following the vacation year in which the employe received his last vacation, by which the employe has either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">(a) Completed 365 calendar days of credited service without having been off the payroll for more consecutive days than sixty (60), Sundays and holidays included, while accumulating this credit for service, and provided that he is on that date being carried on the active payroll;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">(b) During the preceding 365 days completed 270 calendar days on the payroll, and provided that he is on that date being carried on the active payroll.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">We conclude, contrary to the district court, that eligibility for a vacation requires that an employee be on the active payroll on December 28 or on a date <em>thereafter </em>(\u201c[o]n that date in the vacation year, following the vacation year in which the employe received his last vacation * * * .\u201d). In other words, employment on the 28th represents not merely an administrative device, but a requirement for vacation eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">The district court concluded that \u201c[a]n employee\u2019s presence on the active payroll on a specified annually recurring day * * * was not designed to reflect any part of the <em>service </em>by which an employee earns a vacation,\u201d and, therefore, noncompliance should not defeat the right to a vacation. Implicit in this analysis is the conclusion that vacation <em>is earned by working </em>a requisite number of days. According to the district court, the members of the plaintiff class had completed \u201c270 days or more on the payroll of the company, thus satisfying the annual vacation year credited service requirement for a vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">Our review of the exhibits shows us, however, that in practice individuals who had \u201cearned\u201d their vacation in this manner were, nevertheless, denied vacation benefits when they were not present in the active employment of the company on the established eligibility date. While the collective bargaining agreement specifically excludfed retirees, the practice was also to deny vacation benefits to those who were discharged, quit, had died, or who did not return to the active payroll due to sickness or layoffs, regardless of the number of days they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>worked for Swift during the previous year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This denial of otherwise \u201cearned\u201d benefits is supported by the testimony of Irving M. King, the union\u2019s lawyer during the time the collective bargaining agreement was in effect. King told the district court that \u201c[w]e had no pro rata vacation under any circumstances, as I recall, for any person leaving the service of Swift and Company for any reason prior to December 28 * * Richard Tagg, a long-time Swift executive, gave the same testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">This situation existed and was tolerated, but it was also from time to time the subject of union proposals for changes. Proposed changes had included eliminating a stated eligibility date (see pp. 2821 and 2806 of transcript) and establishing a pro rata system for vacations for all severed and retired employees (see p. 2815 of transcript).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In August 1964, in a document entitled <em>Suggested Contract Changes </em>\u2014 Swift <em>Contract </em>the union sought to modify provisions of the old 1961-64 contract for the new agreement in 1964-67. Among the suggested changes were proposals to permit vacation benefits for employees retiring on January 1 (which had been specifically excluded by contract) and to eliminate the \u201cDecember 31st active payroll requirement\u201d from Paragraphs 32(2) and 32(3). Another memoranda of national contract demands written at the same time sought to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>1. Establish full pro-rata system on vacations for workers retired or otherwise severed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">2. Clarify vacation eligibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In the ensuing 1964-67 contract the language was not eliminated, however, and only the date was changed: \u201c[a]nd provided that on said December 28 he [the employee] is being carried on the active payroll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">In a July 1967 memoranda prepared to analyze suggested changes for the 1967-70 Agreement which followed, the union\u2019s position again had been: \u201c[T]hat the requirement in Paragraph 32 of being on the payroll on December 28 be deleted.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Again, however, the language appeared in the 1967-70 Master Agreement which followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Our job is to ascertain as authoritatively and as accurately as possible the intent of these private parties in their agreement. We have previously approved the necessity of venturing \u201coutside the four comers of the contract itself\u201d to ascertain intent and to determine the rights and duties of the parties. <em>UAW v. White Motor Corp., </em>505 F.2d 1193, 1197 (8th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 921, 95 S.Ct. 1588, 43 L.Ed.2d 789 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">We conclude that the literal language of the agreement supports the interpretation that presence on the active payroll on December 28 is a precondition to vacation eligibility, and that this interpretation of the language is supported by the practice under the agreement and the collective bargaining history. A plant closing is obviously not identical to other causes of absence from active status on the eligibility date, but we thmk it is very persuasive evidence that the parties recognized that a vacation otherwise \u201cearned\u201d could be lost by failure to meet that condition. We do not quarrel with the general proposition that vacation pay is compensation for work; however, the parties agreed to a system with two eligibility requirements. In operation that system frequently denied benefits to employees who might have received a pro rata or full vacation benefit were it not for the eligibility date. They abided with it as to <em>all </em>other types of severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Moreover, this interpretation of the contract is supported by the reasoning in recent arbitral authority. In <em>Kroger Co. v. Retail Store Employees, </em>74-2 Lab.Arb. Awards \u00b6 8633 (1975) (Goetz, Arb.), the arbitrator reviewed the contract language and the parties\u2019 practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-17\">Paragraph 4 provides that after an employee has qualified for his first one week\u2019s vacation, \u201che automatically qualifies for future one week\u2019s vacations as of January 1 of each year.\u201d Paragraphs 5 through 7 provide that after an employee has qualified for additional weeks of vacation (presumably as of his anniversary date), he \u201cqualifies\u201d for a future weeks vacation in the higher amount \u201cas of January 1 of each year.\u201d Based on these provisions, it would appear that an employee has no right to any vacation pay until he has served beyond his first anniversary date, and <em>that thereafter he does not qualify for vacation pay until January 1 of the year in which the vacation is taken. </em>Under this interpretation, an employee who quits or who is discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>prior to January 1 of a given year cannot qualify for vacation pay for that year, regardless of how much work he may have performed for the Company during the preceding year. The uniform practice of the Company has been not to pay any vacation pay in such cases. <em>To this extent at least, vacation pay under this agreement cannot be viewed simply as an unconditional deferred wage payable under any and all circumstances to everyone who performs any work for the Company during the preceding year.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 5370.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also Duquesne Brewing Co., </em>60 Lab.Arb. 642 (1973) (Altrock, Arb.) (plant close down) (emphasis added). Compare moreover, the decision in <em>Infant Socks, Inc., </em>51 Lab.Arb. 402 (1968) (Moberly, Arb.) where the contract provided that: \u201cLength of employment, for the purposes of determining eligibility for paid vacations, shall be determined as of June 30 of each year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403. Citing this provision, the arbitrator distinguished cases with a clearly stated eligibility date. \u201cThe fact that the agreement does not require an employe to be on the employment rolls as of any particular date in order to be entitled to vacation benefits distinguishes this case from <em>Briggs v. Electric Auto-Lite, </em>37 Wis.2d 275 [155 N.W.2d 32], 67 LRRM 2271 (1967) * * .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Similarly, in <em>Telescope Folding Furniture Co., </em>49 Lab.Arb. 837 (1967) (Cox, Arb.) Arbitrator Archibald Cox granted vacation pay to three grievants, but would have denied it had the contract stated an eligibility date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Employees to be eligible for one (1) weeks vacation with pay shall have worked one hundred forty (140) working days prior to August 1st of the vacation year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">(2) The agreement mentions August 1 only as a cut-off date for determining length of service and days worked in the vacation years. There is no clause stipulating that vacations shall be limited to workers on the payroll, or on the seniority list, or otherwise in the Company\u2019s employ, on August 1 or any other particular date. Such clauses are quite common in collective agreements, although they are probably omitted more often than they are included. <em>If there were such a clause in the Telescope contract, the Company\u2019s position would be correct. In fact, there is none. </em>The arbitrator cannot ignore the omission of such critical words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 838. (Emphasis added.) <em>See also American Zinc Co., </em>57 Lab.Arb. 1140 (1971) (Ray, Arb.) (plant closing). We distinguish <em>Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers Local 2369 v. Oxco Brush Division, </em>517 F.2d 239 (6th Cir. 1975) because the court there found that denying vacation benefits in a \u201cplant closing\u201d would be inconsistent with the contract provisions extending benefits when employment was terminated for other reasons (release, resignation, layoff, death and retirement.) \u201cThese provisions are inconsistent with the position that employment on December 31st was an absolute requirement for vacation benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. In the present case, benefits were concededly denied for these \u201cother reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Accordingly, we conclude that in our opinion the plaintiffs were not eligible for vacation benefits under the terms of the contract to which each had agreed. We choose not to follow that line of authority which would prorate vacation benefits because the company\u2019s unilateral action in effectuating the shutdown made employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ment on the disability date impossible. <em>Schneider v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>456 F.2d 366,372 (6th Cir. 1972). <em>See also Baldwin-Montrose Chemical Co. v. International Union, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers, </em>383 F.2d 796, 798 (6th Cir. 1967). We so hold not only because we do not agree with the reasoning thereof, but because in neither of these cases is there any discussion of the bargaining history of the parties or the past practices in other related situations. As set forth above, it is clear from the bargaining history and past practice in this case, the facts relating to which were not seriously controverted, that the union and its members <em>knew </em>or should have known that the contract did not provide for vacation benefits upon the closing of the plant, bargained to obtain them, and settled without the requested change.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Although we do not interpret the collective bargaining agreement as providing for vacation benefits, clearly other sections of the contract provided specific and substantial plant closing benefits to the employees. According to an exhibit submitted at trial monetary termination benefits amounted to $4,606,901.91, including separation allowances and gratuity payments for retiring employees. Nonmonetary benefits included interplant transfer rights and placement on company-wide waiting lists for openings at new plants, plus 26 week advance notice of the plant\u2019s closing. This is a clear indication that the negotiators were aware of the many monetary consequences of closing the plant, but did not agree on an exception to the requirement of being on the payroll on December 28 for vacation pay purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">As to the liability of the union for unfair representation we hold that because there was no contractual obligation on the part of Swift to pay the vacation pay, that under the circumstances of this case and considering the duty of the union to fairly represent the older employees too, the union could not be held guilty of unfair representation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Swift never conceded that the vacation pay had any merit whatsoever and in our opinion it was correct in its position. To say now, as indicated in the dissent to the denial of rehearing en banc, that the union should have proceeded to arbitration in hopes of obtaining a favorable arbitrator\u2019s decision or a compromise settlement is second-guessing of the most blatant type. It completely ignores the rights of the older employees who were paid retirement pay as a result of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Alternatively we hold that even if the result of an arbitration on the vacation pay issue <em>might </em>have resulted in an award to the plaintiffs, where the union is also processing claims for other employees which are arguably meritorious, and no clear showing has been made of bad faith in making a choice between the two claims, it cannot be said that in making the choice it made, the union unfairly represented the plaintiffs. The evidence adduced at the trial does not affirmatively show bad faith on the part of either Swift or the union and in a situation where, as here, the claim of one group of employees is highly doubtful it cannot be said that either Swift or the union acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in making the compromise decision that was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">The district court held that the union acted in bad faith in refusing to process the vacation pay grievance to arbitration rather than drop it in favor of the retirement benefit claim, but the <em>cornerstone </em>to this finding of bad faith was the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that Swift was contractual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ly <em>obligated </em>to pay the vacation pay claimed. Since we have determined, as a matter of law, that Swift was not obligated under the contract to pay the claim (or at least in the alternative that the contract on its face didn\u2019t require it), the claim of bad faith must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The other reasons given by the trial court for its finding of bad faith are not sufficient, even if true, absent a determination of Swift\u2019s contractual obligation to pay, to justify a determination of bad faith. These reasons include the filing of the grievance by the union and statements by its officers as to the validity of the grievance; Swift\u2019s alleged motivation in closing the plant when it did (which could not be imputed to the union and which was permitted under the contract); and the so-called swap. Rather, in our opinion, the union used its best judgment to obtain the maximum benefit for the largest number of its membership. It made the best of a contract it had been trying to change for several years without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint of the appellees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK9\">Concurring Statement Upon Denial of Petition for Rehearing En banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-13\">.

The district court\u2019s interpretation of the contract terms was based on the following analysis: 1. Absence from the \u201cactive payroll\u201d on December 28, 1969 was the sole obstacle to receipt of vacation pay. 2. Presence on the active payroll on a recurring date was merely an administrative device for calculating an employee\u2019s credited service since the last vacation year. 3. Presence on the designated date was not meant to reflect any part of the service for earning a vacation. 4. Use of the phrase \u201cactive payroll\u201d was in contrast to the status of employees on the benefit payroll or on layoff. The \u201cactive payroll\u201d language had the effect of postponing credit for being on the benefit payroll until the employee returned to the active payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Moreover: 1. The date selected by the company for closing the plant was timed to avoid the vacation pay provisions of the contract, \u201cparticularly the provision that \u2018vacation eligibility requirements are based on credited service.\u2019 \u201d 2. <em>Even if </em>presence on the active payroll on December 28, 1969, was a condition of vacation eligibility, the company\u2019s unilateral decision to close on November 29 rendered it impossible for members of the plaintiff class to meet the conditions of eligibility. 3. In light of Swift\u2019s unilateral power to select the date of closing, requiring active payroll status on the 28th would allow the company to secure a windfall on wages owed to employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">Further: 1. Past bargaining does not show any specific union demand for modification of the Master Agreement to provide for vacation pay for employees terminated by plant closings. Union demands \u201cdid include demands for pro rata vacation pay but such demands seemed to be focused on pro rata vacation pay for employees who retire and go on pension * * * such exclusion being contained in Paragraph 32 of the Master Agreement.\u201d 2. \u201cWhatever the bargaining history may have been,\u201d the union never conceded that employees terminated by a plant closing were not entitled to vacation pay during the year of closing. In the June 30, 1971 Saint Paul Settlement Agreement \u201cthe Union not only did not concede that vacation pay was not payable, but * * * [provided] that it would be \u2018without precedent\u2019 on this subject.\u201d 3.

The one exception to the general rule of nonpayment, which does appear on the exhibit, were benefits paid in the Sioux City, Iowa closing. Swift entered into a Settlement Agreement with the employees of the Sioux City plant to pay them vacation pay and the union thereby promised not to transfer employees en masse for the required <em>one </em>week to the nearby Omaha plant. This agreement provided that: \u201cThe above does not constitute a precedent for either party.\u201d In view of that express language, applicable to both union and company, and in view of the special circumstances involving a short distance to travel and only one week of duty required, we are unwilling to consider it at all in interpreting the collective bargaining agreement between them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\">.

Older employees will usually insist that the greatest attention be paid to seniority and pension benefits. Younger employees will inevitably feel that transfer rights or some form of immediate cash benefits are of more importance. Indeed, in this ease, 931 members of the plaintiff class have already received $4,355,000 in separation allowances and gratuities. As long as conflicting claims of various groups of employees are arguably meritorious, we must permit the union and the company to negotiate a settlement of the claims or submit them to arbitration; and when they have negotiated a settlement of all claims in good faith, then we cannot entertain an employee\u2019s action in federal court to recover for an alleged breach of contract with respect to the settled claims. To do so would be contrary to established labor policy. <em>See Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); <em>Republic Steel Corp. v.

In the context of a case involving a plaintiff class exceeding 1,000 employees and a judgment approximating one million dollars, these deficiencies of fact and law have resulted in an important decision in labor law, a decision rendered by the concurrence of only two circuit judges. These circumstances provide compelling reasons for this court en banc to reconsider the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">I. <em>Contract Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The overwhelming majority of the members of the plaintiff class<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had completed 270 days or more on Swift\u2019s payroll in the year prior to the plant closing and therefore had satisfied the credited service requirement for vacation eligibility. The first sentence of the contract\u2019s vacation provision reads: \u201cVacation eligibility requirements <em>are based on credited service.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) From this, the district court reasoned that vacation pay was \u201cearned\u201d for work performed in 1969.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the district court found \u201c[t]he single obstacle to receipt by members of plaintiff class of vacations earned during 1969 was their absence from the company\u2019s \u2018active payroll\u2019 on December 28, 1969.\u201d In considering the use of the December 28 date in the contract, the district court held it was \u201cmerely an administrative device for spacing the recurring annual function of calculating an employee\u2019s . credited service, since the last vacation year. Such an administrative device is necessary in an ongoing enterprise; it has no relevance or function to perform in a plant close-down termination of employment situation.\u201d The panel concedes the legitimacy of \u201cthe general proposition that vacation pay is compensation for work,\u201d <em>Buchholtz </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>609 F.2d 317 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>325, No. 78-1559, slip op. at 16 .(8th Cir. April 25,1979), but it nonetheless holds that presence on the active payroll on or after December 28 is an additional and essential eligibility requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Such a holding in the context of a plant closing is not in accord with the weight of federal law and gives undue emphasis to the eligibility date. Under the circumstances of this case there should be little doubt that plaintiff class had a vested right under the contract to vacation pay. <em>Schneider v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>456 F.2d 366 (6th Cir. 1972); <em>Local 186, United Packinghouse Workers v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>446 F.2d 610 (6th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 955, 92 S.Ct. 1170, 31 L.Ed.2d 231 (1972). In <em>Armour, </em>an action concerning the company\u2019s liability for vacation pay to its employees when it closed its plant, the court noted the approach taken in labor arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\"><em>When situations such as this have arisen in the past, they have almost uniformly been resolved in the union\u2019s favor. </em>In Mays Landing Water Power Co., 12 L.A. 861 (1949), the employer shut down before a date which . . . was clearly an eligibility date. Nevertheless, the arbitrator granted vacation pay, stating that \u201cThe (eligibility date) is simply a device for finally implementing the results of accumulated employment experience. To ignore the accumulation of such past employment experience because of the impossibility of meeting the eligibility day is to give undue determinative significance to only one of the generally qualifying tests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863. Similarly, in L. Hyman Co., Inc., 13 L.A. 803 (1949), where the contract was again clear that employees had to be \u201con the payroll\u201d on a specified date, the arbitrator adhered to the concept that vacation pay is an earned right, based primarily upon service, and that the employees were entitled to full vacation pay when the plant closed prior to the eligibility date. <em>Accord: </em>Star Woolen Mill Co., 14 L.A. 185 (1950). <em>Id. </em>at 613 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Even absent the above reasons, the plaintiff class of employees are entitled to vacation pay because it was the company\u2019s action in closing the plant that prevented the employees from working until the December 28th date. Not only is that the precise holding of <em>Schneider, supra, </em>and <em>Armour, supra, </em>but it is also the alternative holding made by Judge Larson, which the panel opinion fails to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Judge Larson stated that \u201c[e]ven if presence on the active payroll on December 28, 1969, was a condition of vacation eligibility, the company\u2019s unilateral decision to close the plant on November 29, and to terminate the members of plaintiff class on that date rendered it impossible for members of plaintiff class to meet the condition of eligibility.\u201d Accordingly, Judge Larson held that failure to satisfy the eligibility requirement would not preclude recovery of vacation pay under the contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">This analysis of the vacation pay issue in the context of a plant closing is not only supported by federal law, but also is in complete accord with traditional contract principles which provide that \u201c[t]he occurrence of the event [i. e., presence on the active payroll on or after December 28] is eliminated as a condition if it is prevented by the fault of the promisor . . . .\u201d 6 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1362, at 509 (2d ed. 1962). In the instant case, Swift's closing of the plant rendered the employees\u2019 performance of the condition at the South St. Paul plant impossible. <em>Furthermore, the district court found that the plant closing date was chosen specifically by Swift in order to avoid paying earned vacations. On </em>these facts, Judge Larson\u2019s construction of the contract seems clearly justified \u2014 and correct. The panel opinion ignores this aspect of Judge Larson\u2019s ruling except to state that the panel \u201cchoose[s] not to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that line of authority <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which would prorate vacation benefits because the company\u2019s unilateral action in effectuating the shutdown made employment on the disability date impossible.\u201d . <em>Buchholtz, </em>609 F.2d at 326-327.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">II. <em>Unfair Representation Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Resolution of the contract claim in favor of Swift should not dispose of the claim against the union for its alleged failure to fairly represent the former employees who seek vacation pay. The union\u2019s duty to fairly represent employees, quite apart from the employer\u2019s obligation to comply with the terms of the labor contract,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> stands \u201cas a bulwark to prevent arbitrary union conduct against individuals stripped of traditional forms of redress by the provisions of federal labor law.\u201d Vaca v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 182, 87 S.Ct. 903, 912, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). The panel decision, which gives only perfunctory attention to the unfair representation claim apart from the contract discussion, reflects either abandonment of the court\u2019s \u201ctraditional supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>sory jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id., </em>or a fundamental misconception of the nature of unfair representation suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As to the Section 301 charges, the panel has now amended its original opinion, <em>Buch-holtz, </em>609 F.2d at 327, to provide an alternate holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">[E]ven if the result of an arbitration on the vacation pay issue <em>might </em>have resulted in an award to the plaintiffs, where the union is also processing claims for other employees which are arguably meritorious, and no clear showing has been made of bad faith in making a choice between the two claims, it cannot be said that in making the choice it made, the union unfairly represented the plaintiffs. (Emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Quite apart from the breach of contract, such an analysis ignores 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337, which provides jurisdiction for an employee suit against the union for breach of the duty to fairly represent without regard to the presence of a contract breach. <em>Mumford v. Glover, </em>503 F.2d 878, 883 (5th Cir. 1974). Here the complaint alleges under Section 1337 the failure of the union to adequately represent the class of former union members in negotiations with Swift on the vacation pay claim. The charge is the union recognized the validity of the claim, represented it would in good faith submit the claim to arbitration and <em>then, </em>without notice or representation to the former union members, totally disregarded the rights of the class by asserting the grievance was \u201cthe property of the union\u201d and trading it for benefits to the few remaining union members \u2014 benefits which by the way were not recognized or set forth in the collective bargaining agreement in any way. Discussion of the factual elements of this bad faith charge appears in part III of this dissent, but for now suffice it to say, this claim, which Judge Larson found to be valid, is totally independent of any breach of contract by Swift.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Even under Section 301, however, an employee need <em>not </em>prove a breach of the collective bargaining agreement as an essential element of his suit against the union for its alleged failure to provide fair representation. <em>See, e. g., Czosek v. O\u2019Mara, </em>397 U.S. 25, 28, 90 S.Ct. 770, 25 L.Ed.2d 21 (1970); <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 182-83, 190-98, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); <em>Kaiser v. Local 83, </em>577 F.2d 642, 645 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Minnis v. International Union, UAW, </em>531 F.2d 850, 854 (8th Cir. 1975). Indeed, our court recently held that a discharged employee who had absolutely no contract right to reinstatement could nevertheless bring suit against the union for its alleged inadequate representation of his reinstatement claim in grievance procedures. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Minnis </em>the employee had presented evidence tending to demonstrate that if the union had processed his grievance, as it agreed to do, then the employer would have reinstated the employee. Notwithstanding the admitted absence of a contract breach, we held the employee\u2019s claim that the union\u2019s bad faith had resulted in his failure to be reinstated would, if proven, give rise to union liability. <em>Accord, Kaiser v. Local 83, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Here the panel fails to recognize that regardless of the ultimate merit of the breach of contract claim, if the union traded this claim off in <em>bad faith, </em>such a claim of unfair representation would make the union liable under Section 301. Here the bad faith, as will be discussed, relates to trading away a claim of the vast majority of former employees for a claim favoring only a few.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff need only establish that the union acted in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner in bargaining off the vacation pay claim. The ultimate issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>against the union is whether they exercised bad faith in doing so. Thus, in my judgment, the panel\u2019s opinion decides the case on a point of law that ignores a central issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">III. <em>Bad Faith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">I turn now to discussion of Judge Larson\u2019s finding of bad faith on the part of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">First, one must recognize that disputes will always arise under collective bargaining agreements and a union has considerable discretion to trade off claims in good faith which in some instances will benefit certain members more than others. Swift and the union rely primarily on decisions which so hold. Nonetheless the appropriate method for analyzing \u201ctrade-offs\u201d by the union is evidenced by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Local 13, International Longshoremen\u2019s Union v. Pacific Maritime Ass\u2019n, </em>441 F.2d 1061 (9th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1016, 92 S.Ct. 677, 30 L.Ed.2d 664 (1972). In that decision the court cogently reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">We agree with appellees that a breach of the duty of fair representation would not be established merely by proof that the International union \u201cswapped\u201d a concession that section 17.81 applied to union officials for acceptance by the employers\u2019 association of the position that the contract limited the individual packing of sacks. In this practical world such issues, susceptible of no absolutely \u201cright\u201d solution, are often resolved by accommodation. Although such a choice might impose additional burdens upon union officials, including Velasquez, these burdens might be outweighed by benefits to working longshoremen. If the choice were motivated by a good-faith balancing of interests of different elements within the International union, it might well fall within the \u201cwide range of reasonableness * * * allowed a statutory bargaining representative in serving the unit it represents.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, supra, </em>345 U.S. [330] at 338, 73 S.Ct. [681] at 686 [97 L.Ed. 1048]. \u201cConflict between employees represented by the same union is a recurring fact. To remove or gag the union in these cases would surely weaken the collective bargaining and grievance processes.\u201d <em>Humphrey v. Moore, supra, </em>375 U.S. [335] at 349-350, 84 S.Ct. [363] at 372 [11 L.Ed.2d 370],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">However, a union\u2019s freedom of choice between competing interests is \u201csubject always to good faith and honesty of purpose in the exercise of its discretion.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, supra, </em>345 U.S. at 338, 73 S.Ct. at 686. <em>It must appear that \u201cthe union took its position honestly, in good faith and without hostility or arbitrary discrimination,\u201d Humphrey </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>supra, 375 U.S. at 350, 84 S.Ct. at 372, <em>for the union must \u201cserve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any.\u201d Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 177, 87 S.Ct. at 910. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">Recognizing that the materials before the district court would support an inference that if a \u201cswap\u201d occurred it was a good-faith choice between interpretations of two provisions of the contract, the evidence we have cited is also susceptible of a different inference, namely, that the International union, actuated in part by hostility toward Velasquez, elected to sacrifice him for a favorable outcome on the \u201cbelly-packing\u201d issue. If a \u201cswap\u201d occurred, and if the deregistration of Velasquez rather than an alternative interpretation of section 17.81 was the true consideration, Local 13 would be entitled to judgment. If the duty of fair representation is to stand \u201cas a bulwark to prevent arbitrary union conduct against individuals stripped of traditional powers of redress by the provisions of federal labor law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 182, 87 S.Ct. at 912 the deliberate sacrifice of a particular employee as consideration for other objectives must be a concession the union cannot make. The issue was thus largely one of purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 1067-68 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">This circuit has previously adopted a similar approach. In <em>Corcoran v. Allied Su-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>permkts., Inc., </em>498 F.2d 527, 530 (8th Cir. 1974), for example, this court recognized the union\u2019s \u201cright to settle the anticipated contract dispute . . . However, we made it clear that the union\u2019s power is always subject \u201c\u2018to complete good faith and honesty of purpose in the exercise of its discretion\u2019.\u201d Id (quoting <em>Humphrey v. Moore, </em>375 U.S. 335, 342, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964)). In that case we upheld the union\u2019s settlement of a contract claim that \u201cwas tenuous at best,\u201d where the record showed that the settlement benefited all employees, including those complaining of the settlement, and the union after careful consideration felt the contract claim probably would not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">If this were simply the case of trading one valid claim for another in order to compromise a settlement, the panel\u2019s decision would at least present a palatable result. The facts, however, reveal much to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The evidence credited by Judge Larson reveals the following scenario, which led to the \u201cswap\u201d of the vacation pay grievance. On or about May 29,1969, Swift gave notice of the plant-closing effective November 29. Swift\u2019s decision to close the plant prior to December 28 was motivated by Swift\u2019s desire to avoid liability for vacation pay. A grievance was thereafter filed protesting that the timing of the closing was designed \u201cdeliberately to avoid provisions and benefits under the Master Agreement.\u201d The union local\u2019s grievance committee processed the vacation pay grievance through the first three steps of the five step grievance procedure. The local committee members as well as the officials of the International (Amalgamated), believed the grievance was meritorious.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs were never informed by any union officials that their grievances were without merit. On July 15, 1970, after the members of the plaintiff class had been terminated, a fourth step meeting was held between Swift, the local and Amalgamated in which the union officials again pressed the claim for vacation pay. The grievance was not resolved and Amalgamated immediately requested arbitration. Arbitration was scheduled for April 1971. Amalgamated repeatedly represented to the plaintiff class that the vacation pay grievance would be arbitrated, and expressed confidence in the merits of the claim. On the eve of arbitration, however, Swift\u2019s representative became incapacitated and the arbitration was rescheduled for June 1971. On or about May 28, 1971, Swift announced an additional plant closing in South St. Paul which would affect most of the remaining employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The significance of this announcement cannot be overstated, for prior to this time Amalgamated\u2019s conduct had been consistent with the assurances repeatedly given by it to plaintiff class that the grievance would be submitted to arbitration. Shortly thereafter, at the union\u2019s request, Amalgamated, the local, and Swift met in two \u201cpre-arbi-tration\u201d meetings ostensibly to discuss the grievances to be resolved in the upcoming arbitration. In fact, however, the union officials\u2019 purpose for engaging in these meetings was to determine whether the current employees and union members, who would be terminated as a result of the <em>second </em>plant closing, could receive extra-contractual pension insurance benefits. It is undisputed that pension benefits were not provided for in the contract and that the union had no grievance with the employer over this issue. It is also clear that the union\u2019s request for early pension benefits would not apply to any members of the plaintiff class. Swift stated that it would be willing to consider such a proposal but only if the union agreed to drop the vacation pay grievance in return. Amalgamat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ed officials informed members of the local union that they did not have a strong bargaining position for the early pension benefits unless the vacation pay grievance was included in the negotiations. Faced with these prospects, the union, without notification to the plaintiff class, agreed to the \u201cswap.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 vacation pay grievances were withdrawn by Amalgamated not because the union believed they lacked merit, but rather because they were the only grievance against Swift that had \u201csignificant trading value.\u201d The trade was made without the consent or participation of plaintiffs \u2014 the former employees were not notified of the special meeting at which the settlement was ratified, nor did they participate in or vote on the proposed settlement. Judge Larson found these facts sufficient to show bad faith on the part of the union in processing the vacation grievance. We simply substitute subjective judgment, in light of the record at hand, to say that this finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Having established the union\u2019s bad faith, it is incumbent upon the employees to show damages arising from the unfair representation. At this stage it is often crucial that the employees show a breach of contract. That is, in the typical case an employee contends that the union\u2019s unfair representation resulted in the employee\u2019s loss of contractual rights. In measuring damages, therefore, it is necessary to determine the scope of the employee\u2019s rights under the contract. If, however, the employee can show damages which are not dependent on the breach of a contract then the employee is entitled to recover notwithstanding the absence of a breach. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Vaca v. Sipes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">The appropriate remedy for a breach of a union\u2019s duty of fair representation must vary with the circumstances of the particular breach. In this case, the employee\u2019s complaint was that the Union wrongfully failed to afford him the arbitration remedy against his employer established by the collective bargaining agreement. But the damages sought by Owens were primarily those suffered because of the employer\u2019s alleged breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">Assuming for the moment that Owens had been wrongfully discharged, Swift\u2019s only defense to a direct action for breach of contract would have been the Union\u2019s failure to resort to arbitration, compare <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, </em>379 U.S. 650 [85 S.Ct. 614, 13 L.Ed.2d 580,] with <em>Smith v. Evening News Assn., </em>371 U.S. 195 [83 S.Ct. 267, 9 L.Ed.2d 246] and if that failure was itself a violation of the Union\u2019s statutory duty to the employee, there is no reason to exempt the employer from contractual damages which he would otherwise have had to pay. See pp. 185-186, <em>supra. </em>The difficulty lies in fashioning an appropriate scheme of remedies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">The governing principle, then, is to apportion liability between the employer and the union according to the damage caused by the fault of each. Thus, damages attributable solely to the employer\u2019s breach of contract should not be charged to the union, but increases if any in those damages caused by the union\u2019s refusal to process the grievance should not be charged to the employer. In this case, even if the Union had breached its duty, all or almost all of Owens\u2019 damages would still be attributable to his allegedly wrongful discharge by Swift. For these reasons, even if the Union here had properly been found liable for a breach of duty, it is clear that the damage award was improper. 386 U.S. at 195-96, 197\u2014 98, 87 S.Ct. at 919-920, 920-921.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Here there is no problem measuring damages. The record is clear that, until it agreed to \u201cthrow-in\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 vacation pay grievances, Swift had made a cash offer of only $8,000 to settle the grievances. When the vacation pay grievances were included in the settlement negotiations, the grievances were settled, Swift agreeing to provide benefits to the remaining members of the union which it valued at $928,200. Thus even assuming that plaintiffs were not entitled by virtue of the collective bargaining agreement to vacation pay, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>were entitled to the value of the grievances relating thereto, which the union arbitrarily and in bad faith traded for pension and other financial benefits for the remaining members of the union. On these facts one need not be clairvoyant to determine the damages plaintiffs are entitled to recover due to the union\u2019s breach of its duty of fair representation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\">. The panel opinion concedes that it disagrees on an important question of labor law with a sister circuit. This in itself should compel a rehearing en banc.

Armour &amp; Co., </em>446 F.2d 610 (6th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 955 (1972) and <em>Schneider v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>456 F.2d 366 (6th Cir. 1972), as I feel they would after a plenary study, it would provide one less case for the Supreme Court to consider involving a division between circuits in an important area of labor law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. The Honorable Earl R. Larson, Senior District Judge, District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">.

This construction of the contract is hardly startling. <em>See, e. g., Austin v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>504 F.2d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 1974) (\u201cA paid vacation is fairly understood as part of a worker\u2019s short-term return for labor; hence, treating vacation time earned as a function of actual labor performed is not unreasonable.\u201d); <em>Foster v.

In addition it should be noted that Swift\u2019s purposeful and unilateral prevention of satisfaction of the active service date condition clearly distinguishes this case from instances where employees voluntarily failed to fulfill the condition or where an employer terminated employees for cause. Thus, the panel\u2019s discussion, <em>Buchholtz, </em>609 F.2d at 322-327, in no way undermines the efficacy of Judge Larson\u2019s ruling based on impossibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">. The panel\u2019s distinction of <em>Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers Local 2369 v. Oxeo Brush Div., </em>517 F.2d 239 (6th Cir. 1975) is a straw man. In <em>Aerospace </em>the court cited and relied upon the <em>Armour </em>and <em>Schneider </em>decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">. The panel\u2019s amended opinion now seeks support for its denial of plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Swift on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">[I]t is clear from the bargaining history and past practice in this case, the facts relating to which were not seriously controverted, that the union and its members <em>knew </em>or should have known that the contract did not provide for vacation benefits upon the closing of the plant, bargained to obtain them, and settled without the requested change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Judge Larson\u2019s specific finding and the record dispute this. Judge Larson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">The past bargaining, and the plant closing history with respect to plant closings prior to the South St. Paul plant closing, taken together, do not show any specific contention by or demand by the Union for modification of the Master Agreement to provide for vacation pay for employees terminated by a plant closing, in those terms, and particularly do not show any specific contention by or demand by the Union for modification of the Master Agreement to provide for vacation pay for employees on the payroll 270 or more days prior to a plant closing. During the period for which Swift has records of closings there had been two plant closings in which the closing date was such that there were terminated employees who had 270 or more days on the payroll prior to termination, the Kearny, New Jersey closing in 1966 affecting at most 70 employees and the Sioux City, Iowa closing of December 1968 in which there were at most 176 employees affected. No claim was made by the terminated Kearny, New Jersey employees for vacation pay and none was paid. A claim was made by the Sioux City employees and vacation pay was paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-12\">The contract modification demands made by the Union during the Master Agreement bargaining sessions in the years prior to 1969 did include demands for pro rata vacation pay but such demands seemed to be focused on pro rata vacation pay for employees who retire and go on pension, and these persons were specifically excluded from vacation pay that would otherwise have been earned during the year in which they retire, such exclusion being contained in Paragraph 32 of the Master Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-15\">Whatever the bargaining history may have been, the Union never conceded that employees terminated by a plant closing, who had been on the payroll 270 or more days were not entitled to, or could not assert a claim for, vacation pay earned during the year of closing. The Union demanded and received vacation pay for the terminated Sioux City employees. In the purported settlement agreement of June 30, 1971, the Union not only did not concede that vacation pay was not payable, but in fact preserved the claim, the written agreement providing that it would be \u201cwithout precedent\u201d on this subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Furthermore, Amalgamated official, Fisher testified specifically there were no written or oral demands by the union prior to 1967 relating to vacation pay in the event of plant closing. Tagg\u2019s testimony specifically corroborates this. Furthermore, assuming there were bargaining efforts which the record disputes, it is difficult to accept that futile bargaining efforts can serve to broaden rights which do not otherwise exist. And finally, as the plaintiff class so cogently argues: it is hardly possible for a plant to develop past practices concerning the resolution of problems growing out of a closing of the plant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b425-17\">.
