(Utah Power) and Chaco Energy Co. (Chaco), intervened to support the Department\u2019s position that the Secretary obtains no such discretion either under the Act or the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court agreed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on examination of the statutory framework and the effect of NEPA, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">Prior to 1920, federal lands containing coal and other mineral deposits were sold to private owners and states in accord with the general policy to dispose of land in the public domain. As protection of energy sources and of the environment became pressing public issues during this century, Congress and the Department of Interior (the Department) developed an increasing commitment to deliberate management of coal reserves in federally-owned lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">In the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, under which this case arises in part, Congress established a program to lease mineral deposits for private mining and marketing while preserving federal ownership of the mineral lands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">Until the past decade, the Department routinely granted applications for prospecting permits where the existence of coal deposits was not yet known.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>pecting permittee could then apply for the so-called \u201cpreference right lease\u201d which would be granted automatically upon a demonstration that the land contained commercial quantities of coal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The United States Geological Survey would advise the department that commercial quantities existed if the applicant found coal that could be physically extracted at a profit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, environmental considerations were absent from the decision to grant a prospecting permit and the decision to grant a lease to a permittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The Department introduced environmental considerations in its regulations of January 18,1969. Accordingly, prospecting permits would be granted only after examination of the environmental effects; permittees would be granted leases only after environmental scrutiny and would be allowed to mine only after approval of a mining plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the Department stopped issuing permits for coal exploration in 1973,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the requirements continue to apply to lease applications by holders of outstanding prospecting permits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">In addition, outstanding applications are now subject to regulations passed in 1976 that redefine the statutory term, \u201ccommercial quantities,\u201d and in other ways alter the procedures for obtaining leases. The new regulations require permittees applying for leases to establish through detailed procedures the profitability of the proposed mining while accounting for the costs of complying with environmental requirements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where the applicant sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ports his claim with a reasonable factual basis responsive to the agency\u2019s recommended reclamation requirements,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the lease shall be granted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">II. THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We find no reason to reject the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Secretary has no discretion to reject a coal lease application by a prospecting permittee who has otherwise fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">A. <em>The Coal Leasing Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The only condition that the permit-tee must meet to obtain a lease is to establish the presence of \u201ccommercial quantities\u201d of coal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Act provides that a permit-tee meeting this condition \u201cshall be entitled to a lease under this chapter for all or part of the land in his permit.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This language is unequivocal and clear, and compels our conclusion that the applicant who satisfies the condition is entitled to a lease.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">Petitioners argue that the Secretary\u2019s general discretion under \u00a7 201(a) extends to lease applications under \u00a7 201(b). We approve of the district court\u2019s reasoning that the \u00a7 201(b) prospecting permit, and resulting lease application, constitute a separate, statutory program, not one of the \u201cother methods\u201d within the Secretary\u2019s discretion for issuing leases under \u00a7 201(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">Finally, petitioners claim that the Secretary\u2019s discretion can be inferred from the term \u201cpreference right lease,\u201d assigned in the legislative history to leases under \u00a7 201(b). The meaning of the term is, in fact, ambiguous. Not used in the statute, nor defined in the House Report, the term has, however, been construed by the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>consistently for nearly 60 years to mean an automatic entitlement of a prospecting per-mittee who establishes the presence of commercial quantities of coal in the area covered by the permit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This interpretation has not been disturbed by Congress or the courts, and it influences our conclusion here.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The Department\u2019s regulations since 1969 have required it to scrutinize environmental effects in evaluating permit and lease applications, in stipulating lease terms, and in approving mining plans.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These regulations considerably assist the Secretary\u2019s protection of public lands even though he cannot reject an entitled lease applicant out of hand. Thus, the definition of \u201ccommercial quantities\u201d of coal itself accommodates the cost of protecting the environment, as do lease terms and mining plans under the Department\u2019s supervision. We are satisfied therefore, that the Department and the district court assured only narrow limits on the Secretary\u2019s authority to protect public lands are imposed by \u00a7 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">B. <em>The Effect of NEPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Petitioners claim that NEPA gives the Secretary authority to reject lease applications by prospecting permittees. This claim relies on Section 102(1) of NEPA which directs that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4cU\">to the fullest extent possible, the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this Chapter.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqNG\">The courts have concluded that the limit of this directive is reached when the NEPA policies conflict with an existing statutory scheme. <em>E. g., Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 548, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978); <em>Flint Ridge Dev. Co. v. Scenic Rivers Ass\u2019n, </em>426 U.S. 776, 788, 96 S.Ct. 2430, 49 L.Ed.2d 205 (1976). Certainly, an agency cannot escape the requirements of NEPA by excessively constricting its statutory interpretation in order to erect a conflict with NEPA policies.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But that is not the situation here, where the plain meaning of the statute as well as undisturbed administrative practice for nearly 60 years leaves the Secretary no discretion to deny a \u00a7 201(b) lease to a qualified applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">We find that the Department in fact abided by NEPA\u2019s requirements \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d by introducing environmental analysis at crucial points in the leasing process, pending total revision of the leasing program. The agency requires a demonstration that the estimated revenues can reasonably be expected to exceed estimated costs. 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3520.1-1(c) (1978). Those costs can include the costs of complying with lease terms demanding complete reclamation and safeguards against environmental harm. <em>See </em>43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3521.1-l(c)(2)(vi), 3521.1-4, 3521.1-5 (1978). Even after a lease is granted the awardee may be precluded from harming the environment if the agency disapproves his mining plan.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Petitioners claim that these measures fall short of NEPA\u2019s policies because they do not account for \u201csocietal costs\u201d of environmental harm.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We find, to the contrary, that these costs can be figured into the assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ment of commercial quantities, covered in stringent lease provisions, or adopted as criteria for measuring proposed mining plans. If the Secretary fails to exercise his authority through such measures, then a challenge under NEPA may be appropriate. In the meantime, not even the policies of NEPA, which are of the utmost importance to the survival of our environment, can rewrite \u00a7 201(b) to undermine the property rights of prospecting permittee lease applicants. Congress evidently understood this, as it amended \u00a7 201 to eliminate obstacles to coordinated energy and environmental planning.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">For the some 183 lease applications outstanding under the former version of the provision, the property rights anticipated by permittee applicants cannot be diminished. Where environmental damage from granting leases to entitled parties is certain, the Secretary is authorized to negotiate an exchange for other mineral leases of similar value.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This interim measure will have to do, until all coal development can be conducted under the amended version of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed as to the Secretary\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b) (1975) (amended 1976). The 1976 amendments eliminated prospecting permits and attending lease applications. Hence this appeal is limited to some 183 lease applications submitted prior to 1976.

Plaintiffs below raised two other issues that do not concern us here. First, they argued for the inclusion of environmental costs in the definition of \u201ccommercial quantities,\u201d the statutory term that sets the critical condition for granting a lease under section 2(b) of the Act. The agency resolved this issue by promulgating such a definition on May 7, 1976. <em>See </em>43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3520.1-1 through 3521.1-5 (1978). <em>See </em>458 F.Supp. at 928 n.2. The appellants\u2019 satisfaction with this resolution is apparent in the transcript of the district court proceedings.

In oral argument before this court, the parties indicated total agreement with the Department\u2019s position that major coal leases having such an impact will be accompanied by an EIS, in accord with the district court\u2019s conclusion, <em>see </em>458 F.Supp. at 937 n.20, 939.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-18\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 (1970) (amended 1976). <em>See </em>H.R.

The parties all agree with the District Court\u2019s description of the Department\u2019s longstanding practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-20\">The Department of Interior, throughout the 58 years of administration of these provisions, has consistently interpreted \u00a7 201(b) as giving the Secretary discretion in the granting of the prospecting permits, but as denying him discretion to reject a preference right lease once a permit has issued and coal in commercial quantities has been found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Although the Secretary retained discretion in the granting of prospecting permits, until 1969 permits were issued routinely upon request where consistent with the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">458 F.Supp. at 929 (1978). Before the 1976 amendments, the Act provided for leasing known coal deposits at the Secretary\u2019s discretion, \u00a7 201(a), and granting prospecting permits where necessary \u201cto determine the existence or workability of coal deposits in any unclaimed, undeveloped area,\u201d \u00a7 201(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. The term \u201cpreference right lease\u201d is not mentioned in the statute. It is used by the Department in its regulations governing lease applications by holders of prospecting permits for coal, phosphate, sodium, sulphur and potassium. 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3520 (1978). Petitioners claim that the term \u201cpreference right\u201d signifies no more than a right of first refusal should the Secretary decide to award a lease to anyone. The clear language of the statute compels us to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>page-of 197 U.S.App.D.C., page 557 of 609 F.2d <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\">.
