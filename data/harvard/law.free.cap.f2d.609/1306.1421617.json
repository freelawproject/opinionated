Knecht, </em>456 F.Supp. 889 (C.D.Cal.1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-19\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-20\">The Coastal Zone Management Act was enacted by Congress to preserve, protect, and develop the resources of the Nation\u2019s coastal zones. CZMA \u00a7 303.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Act seeks to achieve wise use of land and water resources in coastal areas by providing monetary assistance to states that develop and exercise management programs consistent with its standards. CZMA \u00a7 302.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act charges the Secretary of Commerce with approving state programs. In performing this duty, he must be satisfied that the state program complies with requirements set forth in CZMA \u00a7 305 and \u00a7 306.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the Secretary has approved a state plan the state receives federal grants that pay up to 80 per cent of the cost of administering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>their program. CZMA \u00a7 306(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Approval triggers a \u201cfederal consistency\u201d provision in the CZMA which requires federal agencies, permittees, and licensees to show that their proposed developments in the coastal zones, including oil and gas developments on the Outer Continental Shelf, will comply with state management program requirements. Federal agencies may not approve proposed projects that are inconsistent with a coastal state\u2019s management program, except upon a finding by the Secretary that the project is consistent with the purposes of the Act or necessary in the interest of national security. CZMA \u00a7 307.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">California was one of the first states to apply for and receive federal assistance under the CZMA. In November, 1972, voters approved the California Conservation Act which established the California Coastal Commission and six regional commissions to prepare a comprehensive plan for the long-range development and conservation of the state\u2019s coastal zone resources. In 1975 the Commission submitted its plan to the legislature and governor for approval. In 1976 the California legislature enacted the California Coastal Act which was similar to the Commission\u2019s proposed plan. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NO A A), the approving agency under the Secretary of Commerce, then began working with state officials to assure that this legislation complied with the requirements of the CZMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">In September, 1977, the plaintiffs brought this action to enjoin NOAA\u2019s approval of the California Program. In October, 1977, the district court issued an order allowing the federal defendants to approve the California Program, but enjoining enforcement of consistency provisions until the case could be resolved on its merits. The Acting Associate Administrator for Coastal Management, on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, then approved the California Coastal Management Program under the CZMA. In August, 1978, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the federal defendants, holding that (1) approval of the California Program complied with the requirements of the CZMA, (2) the Final Environmental Impact Statement complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, and (3) the State could enforce the federal consistency provisions of CZMA \u00a7 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-12\">\n<em>Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-13\">As they did in the district court, appellants challenge the Acting Administrator\u2019s findings that the California Program complied with the requirements of the CZMA. Their specifications of error with respect to the district court\u2019s affirmance of the agency\u2019s approval may be summarized as follows: (1) the court erred in applying the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review and deferring to the agency\u2019s \u201cexpertise\u201d in interpreting and applying the Act; and (2) the California Program failed to comply with numerous CZMA requirements, in that, <em>inter alia, </em>(a) the program was not properly adopted by the State after adequate notice and hearing; (b) it is not sufficiently specific to inform users of the rules to which they are subject; (c) it does not include adequate provisions with respect to local coastal programs; (d) it does not contain the energy elements required; (e) it does not adequately consider the national interests; and (f) it does not protect against unreasonable restrictions on uses of regional benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>Appellees contend that the issues are not ripe for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">\n<em>Ripeness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">Following a careful analysis of the law of \u201cripeness\u201d, the district court held that (1) the approval given by the federal defendants pursuant to \u00a7 306 resulted in action which was ripe for review; but (2) no issues relating to the consistency provisions of \u00a7 307 were \u201cpresently ripe for disposition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">Recognizing that the issue of ripeness presents a close question, the district court concluded, after balancing all relevant factors, that the approval under \u00a7 306 was ripe for review, noting that this approval was the \u201cculmination of the agency review process here involved\u201d and that \u201cthere is nothing further to be done as a part of the administrative process, other than the obligation of \u2018continuing review\u2019 under \u00a7 312(a) . .\u201d 456 F.Supp. at 898. The court found that all parties to the action might suffer substantial hardship if judicial review were denied and concluded that the interests of all parties would be served by the resolution at the earliest practicable date of the challenges to the program\u2019s approval. <em>Id. </em>at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-8\">In holding that no issues regarding \u00a7 307 were ripe for review, the court concluded that, \u201cWhether the state will utilize its consistency powers improperly to retard or halt energy development [is] wholly speculative,\u201d noting that no specific activities contemplated by plaintiffs and no anticipated refusals to certify have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-9\">We agree with the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions on the issue of ripeness, which are set forth in 456 F.Supp. at 897-903.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-10\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-11\">After reviewing numerous cases construing the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review, the district court recognized that deference is due an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations and <em>ts </em>statute it is charged with administering, and that the agency\u2019s decision should not be disturbed unless error is so clear as to deprive its decision of a rational basis. The court referred to the factors to be considered, as set forth in Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s dissent in <em>I.G.C. v. J-T Transport, </em>368 U.S. 81, 127, 82 S.Ct. 204, 7 L.Ed.2d 147 (1961), i. e., \u201cthe precision of the statutory language, the technical complexity of the relevant issues, the need for certainty as against experimentation, and the likelihood that Congress foresaw the precise question at issue and desired to express a foreclosing judgment on it.\u201d The court concluded that all four factors \u201chere favor according considerable deference to the federal defendants\u2019 implicit interpretation of the NOAA program approval regulations\u201d. 456 F.Supp. at 907 \u2014 908.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-15\">We agree with the district court and adopt its opinion with respect to \u201cStandard of Review\u201d, 456 F.Supp. at 903-908, and \u201cScope of Review\u201d, <em>Id. </em>908-912.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-16\">\n<em>Adoption by the State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-17\">CZMA \u00a7 306(c)(1) requires that the Secretary in approving the state program find that the state \u201chas developed and adopted a management program for its coastal zone in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary . .\u201d Regulations adopted pursuant to this requirement provide that the \u201cmanagement program [be] . . . formally adopted in accordance with State law, or in its absence, administrative regulations . . . .\u201d 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 923.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-19\">In finding that the adoption of the California Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) met the requirements of the CZMA, the Acting Administrator considered five elements: (1) the California Coastal Act of 1976; (2) the Coastal Conservancy Act of 1976; (3) the Urban and Coastal Parks Bond Act of 1976; (4) Coastal Commission Regulations promulgated pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>suant to the Coastal Act of 1976; and (5) the \u201cProgram Description\u201d (contained in Part II of the combined State of California Management Program and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">The first four elements present no problem. Appellants contend, however, that the \u201cProgram Description\u201d was never \u201cformally-adopted in accordance with State law\u201d and that the Acting Administrator in approving the program accordingly failed to comply with the Agency\u2019s own regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">The district court found that only Chapter 11 of the 14 chapters of the Program Description had been approved by the California Coastal Commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court concluded, therefore, that the Acting Administrator\u2019s findings that the program satisfied the requirements of CZMA could only be based on the first four elements and Chapter 11 of the \u201cProgram Description\u201d. The court held, however, that excluding Chapters 1 through 10 and 12 through 14 of the Program Description did not invalidate the program approval, since the excluded chapters were primarily descriptive of features of the program and were not essential to the Agency\u2019s conclusions. They were merely used as \u201ca device, an organizational tool, to enable interested parties and the Acting Administrator to see more easily how the specific requirements of \u00a7 306 have been dealt with and satisfied\u201d. 456 F.Supp. at 915-916.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-10\">Appellants point to several specific findings in support of their conclusion that the Acting Administrator relied on the excluded chapters rather than using them merely as an \u201corganizational tool\u201d. We have reviewed these findings in detail. In each case the administrator referred to chapters in the Program Description that were not part of the California Program, but he then explained how various provisions in the California Program satisfied the requirements of the CZMA and the applicable regulations. We agree with the district court that the administrator merely used the excluded sections as an \u201corganizational tool\u201d in reaching his conclusions, that this was permissible, and therefore, the findings should not be overturned.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-11\">We adopt the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions with respect to \u201cAdoption by the State\u201d. 456 F.Supp. at 912-918.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-12\">\n<em>Specificity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-13\">CZMA \u00a7 307 requires that, after the state\u2019s management program is approved, prospective Federal licensees and permit-tees shall provide a \u201ccertification that the proposed activity complies with the state\u2019s approved program and that such activity will be conducted in a manner consistent with the program\u201d. No license or permit may be granted until the state has concurred with the applicant\u2019s certification, unless the Secretary, on his own initiative or upon appeal by the applicant, finds \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>the activity is consistent with the objectives of [the CZMA] or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security.\u201d CZMA \u00a7 307(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Appellants contend that the CZMA imposes a duty on the federal appellees to make findings that the state\u2019s program contains provisions sufficiently specific to inform persons who wish to conduct activities in the coastal zone of the \u201crules and conditions to which they are subject\u201d. Appellants argue that the California Program lacks the requisite specificity and the Administrator\u2019s findings in this respect are therefore insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">The district court noted that the CZMA requires only that the state develop a \u201cmanagement program\u201d and that this term is defined broadly by CZMA \u00a7 304(11) as \u201ca comprehensive statement . . . setting forth objectives, policies, and standards to guide the public and private uses of lands and waters in the coastal zone\u201d. Reviewing pertinent legislative history, the court concluded that this language does not \u201crequire that such programs establish such detailed criteria that private users be able to rely on them as predictive devices for determining the fate of projects without interaction between the relevant state agencies and the user.\u201d 456 F.Supp. at 919. Recognizing that \u201cCongress has granted the Secretary and Acting Administrator considerable discretion\u201d, the court concluded further that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY1\">[T]he Acting Administrator\u2019s findings and Attachment J of the FEIS, when viewed in the context of the legislative history of the Act and of the statutory language itself, satisfy the Court that approval of the California Program has not been arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">456 F.Supp. at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">We agree with the district court that Congress intended only that standards be sufficiently specific \u201cto guide public and private uses\u201d and that the Secretary was to be given considerable discretion in determining whether the state program contained the requisite specificity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-11\">\n<em>Coordination with Local Programs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-12\">CZMA \u00a7 306(c)(2)(A) requires the Secretary to find that the state \u201chas coordinated its program with local, areawide, and interstate plans applicable to areas within the coastal zone existing on January 1 of the year in which the state\u2019s management program is submitted [for approval] . ..\u201d In response to this requirement, the Acting Administrator stated that \u201cby virtue of the requirements of the Coastal Act that all local coastal jurisdictions must develop or amend local programs and zoning ordinances in conformance with the policies of the Coastal Act, coordination between the state\u2019s programs and local plans is assured.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Record, Yol. 2 at 441. Appellants contend that this finding does not address the requirement of the statute because the statute requires coordination as of January 1 of the year of approval, while the California Program only provides for a process that assures local programs will be developed sometime in the future. Appellants argue that this exposes users in the interim to a \u201cmorass of government jurisdictions, with no resolution of the conflicts among the many local and regional zoning and land use plans\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-14\">While the Acting Administrator\u2019s finding is not a model of clarity, we conclude that it does afford a \u201crational basis\u201d for his conclusion that the California Program complies with the requirements of CZMA \u00a7 306(c)(2)(A) and accordingly was sufficient under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d test. See <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas Best Freight System, Inc., supra, </em>419 U.S. at 290, 95 S.Ct. 438. The California Program implements a permit process which coordinates its provisions with local plans. At the time the California Program was approved by the Acting Administrator, coordination was achieved by the implementation of Local Coastal Programs. These programs constitute a process which assures that local programs are adopted by the ear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>ly 1980\u2019s which are consistent with the policies of the California Coastal Act and the CZMA. See California Coastal Act, Chapter 6, Article 2 (Cal.Public Res.Code \u00a7\u00a7 30510 <em>et seq.). </em>Until Local Coastal Programs are developed, the Coastal Commission or a local government entity will issue permits, but in either case, a permit must be issued if it is consistent with California Coastal Act requirements.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After the development of a Local Coastal Program, a local government entity becomes the issuing agency.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although local government entities retain the power to enforce regulations in addition to the requirements specifically set forth in the California Coastal Act, these additional requirements must \u201cnot [be] in conflict with this act\u201d. Pub.Res. Code \u00a7 30005(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">Thus, at all times, California has a process which coordinates the coastal program with local plans and assures potential users that they will not be subject to local plans that fail to comply with the requirements of the California Coastal Act. Considering the deference to be given the Acting Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the requirements of CZMA \u00a7 306(c)(2)(A), we conclude that his findings concerning this statutory provision were not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">\n<em>Consideration of National Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-7\">Prior to 1976, CZMA \u00a7 306(c)(8) required the Secretary in approving a state program to find that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-8\">The [state] management program provides for adequate consideration of the national interest involved in the siting of facilities necessary to meet requirements which are other than local in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ahr-dedup-1\">After the Arab oil embargo, Congress in 1976 expanded the section to require that the Secretary find that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-10\">The management program provides for adequate consideration of the national interest involved in planning for, and in the siting of, facilities (including energy facilities in, or which significantly affect, such state\u2019s coastal zone) which are necessary to meet requirements which are other than local in nature. In the case of such energy facilities, the Secretary shall find that the state has given such consideration to any applicable interstate energy plan or program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1407-11\">In contending that the California Program failed to satisfy the mandate of \u00a7 306(c)(8), appellants first argue that in reviewing the agency\u2019s determination, the district court misinterpreted Congressional intent in passing the statute. They maintain that Congress sought through the CZMA to induce the states to adopt coastal management programs which would include \u201cexplicit commitments\u201d to take into account the national interest in the planning and siting of energy facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of CZMA \u00a7 306(c)(8) is set forth in program approval regulations published on January 9, 1975, and reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-13\">. The requirement should not be construed as compelling the States to propose a program which accommodates certain types of facilities, but to assure that such national concerns are included at an early stage in the State\u2019s planning activities and that such facilities not be arbitrarily excluded or unreasonably restricted in the management program without good and sufficient reasons. No separate national interest \u201ctest\u201d need be applied and submitted other than evidence that the listed national interest facilities have been considered in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>similar to all other uses, and that appropriate consultation with the Federal agencies listed has been conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">16 C.F.R. \u00a7 923.15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">Following a thorough analysis of the legislative history of both the 1972 Act and the 1976 Amendments, the district court concluded that the 1976 Amendment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1408-6\">while expressly recognizing the national interest in the planning for and siting of energy facilities, nevertheless did not alter the requirement of \u201cadequate consideration\u201d in \u00a7 306(c)(8) or make any changes in the degree of specificity required under the Act. Rather, recognizing that coastal states like California were currently burdened by the onshore impacts of Federal offshore (OCS) activities and likely to be burdened further by the plans for increased leases on the OCS, Congress sought to encourage or induce the affected states to step up their plans <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>such facilities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkmY\">456 F.Supp. at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-7\">The district court noted also the NO A A had reiterated the position it had taken since the inception of the CZMA that \u201cthe purpose of \u2018adequate consideration\u2019 is to achieve the act\u2019s \u2018spirit of equitable balance between State and national interests\u2019.\u201d This involves a consideration of \u201cthe act\u2019s broader finding of a \u2018national interest in the . . . beneficial use, protection, and development of the coastal zone\u2019 (Section 302(a))\u201d, including the requirement of subsection 302(g) of the Act that \u201chigh priority\u201d be given to the protection of natural systems. The district court concluded accordingly that \u201cwhile the primary focus of subsection 306(c)(8) is on the planning for and siting of facilities, adequate consideration of the national interest in these facilities must be based on a balancing of these interests relative to the wise use, protection and other development of the coastal zone.\u201d 456 F.Supp. at 925.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court concluded further that NOAA had properly considered the Congressional mandate in its program approval regulations both before and after the 1976 amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-14\">Appellants also contend that \u201cthere is a total want\u201d of any consideration of the national interest in the California Program, contrary to the Acting Administrator\u2019s findings. They argue that the California Coastal Act fails to \u201ctake into account the social or economic needs of people of inland states who . . . are dependent upon use of the California coast to supply . energy needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-16\">In finding that the California Program complied with CZMA \u00a7 306(c)(8) requirements, the Acting Administrator first reiterated the substance of 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 923.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>15(b) quoted above and then set forth the manner in which Chapter 11 of the \u201cProgram Description\u201d and the California Coastal Act met CZMA requirements regarding the national interests. We agree with the district court that \u201cthe Acting Administrator\u2019s finding that the Program satisfies \u00a7 306(c)(8) is supportable and hence not arbitrary or capricious\u201d and that \u201c[i]t proceeds from a correct interpretation of the CZMA.\u201d 456 F.Supp. at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Finally, the district court noted \u201cthat both the California Program and the CZMA contain safeguards to protect plaintiffs from arbitrary exercise by the Coastal Commission of its \u00a7 307 consistency powers\u201d. After discussing the various safeguards, the court concluded that \u201cboth as regards specific determination of inconsistency and as regards general trends in and manner of issuance of such determinations, plaintiffs are amply protected by and have various forms of recourse under the California Program itself and \u00a7\u00a7 307 and 312 of the CZMA.\u201d 456 F.Supp. at 926-927.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">We agree with the findings and conclusions of the district court with respect to \u201cAdequate Consideration of the National Interest\u201d, as set forth in 456 F.Supp. at 922-927.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">\n<em>Unreasonable Restrictions of Uses of Regional Benefit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">CZMA \u00a7 306(e)(2) requires the Secretary in approving a state\u2019s plan to find that the state program provides \u201cfor a method of assuring that local land and water use regulation within the coastal zone do not unreasonably restrict or exclude land and water uses of regional benefit\u201d. In finding that the California Program satisfied this requirement, the Acting Administrator stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-9\">The principal methods by which California will assure that local regulations do not unreasonably restrict or exclude land and water uses of regional benefit is (1) through the application to permit decisions of policies which include consideration of regional and national interests and (2) through the development of Local Coastal Programs and port master plans which must conform to these policies and must accommodate uses of more than local importance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1409-11\">Clerk\u2019s Record, Vol. II, at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-12\">The Administrator explained his finding by referring to specific sections of the California Coastal Act which deal with the requirements of \u00a7 306(e)(2). His finding that the California Program satisfies these requirements was supportable and not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-14\">From our review of the record we are satisfied that the district court reached the right conclusions in a complex case presenting a number of difficult and close questions. Although we have considered all of appellants\u2019 contentions, in this opinion we have addressed only those which appear to be their major concern. We agree with the district court that the Acting Administrator\u2019s findings pursuant to the CZMA were reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious.

Appellants also contend that Chapter 11 was improperly adopted by the California Coastal Commission. The district court recognized that the Commission may not have complied with California law in failing to properly announce in advance that Chapter 11 would be presented to the public at a public hearing. After analyzing the state law, the court, however, \u201cfound no authority for plaintiffs\u2019 assault on the validity of the Commission\u2019s adoption of Chapter 11 as a \u2018declaration of policy\u2019,\u201d and concluded that it was \u201cduly adopted and thus properly considered by the Acting Administrator .. . .\u201d 456 F.Supp. at 914-915.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1405-9\">. Appellants contest in particular the administrator\u2019s finding that the California Program complies with CZMA \u00a7 305(b)(8). This section requires that the state program include \u201c[a] planning process for energy facilities likely to be located in, or which may significantly affect, the coastal zone, including, but not limited to, a process for anticipating and managing the impacts from such facilities.\u201d Appellants contend that in making this finding, the administrator had to consider Chapter 9 of the \u201cProgram Description\u201d as part of the California Program and that the finding must be overturned since Chapter 9 is one of the chapters which the court ruled could not be considered as part of the California Program eligible for approval. We have examined this finding and note that after discussing Chapter 9, the administrator explained how portions of the California Program, which were eligible for consideration under the CZMA, satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 305(b)(8). Disregarding references to Chapter 9, we conclude that the remaining findings satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">.
