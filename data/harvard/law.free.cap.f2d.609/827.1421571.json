Dixon is president of International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (AFL-CIO), Local 1410-1. He is also a member of the Executive Board of the South Atlantic and Gulf Coast District of the union and a vice-president of the International union. On four occasions Dixon, as the Local\u2019s elected delegate to the annual District convention, accepted reimbursement for travel expenses from the Local, and subsequently accepted reimbursement or compensation for the same conventions from either the District or the International or both. He was convicted on three counts (of a four-count indictment) of violating \u00a7 501(c) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)) for willful embezzlement of Local funds. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-19\">The district court charged the jury, over appellant\u2019s objection, that appellant\u2019s good faith belief that the Local would benefit from the expenditures did not constitute a defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The instructions charged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>government need establish only \u201cfraudulent intent and lack of proper authorization.\u201d Appellant argues that these instructions deprived him of a valid defense and improperly permitted the jury to consider only some of the elements of the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">There are two types of offenses under \u00a7 501(c): those involving the authorized use of funds and those involving the unauthorized use of funds. The elements of each differ. In unauthorized use cases the government need only prove lack of proper authorization and fraudulent intent. <em>U. S. v. Nell, </em>526 F.2d 1223, 1231-32 (5th Cir. 1976); 17. <em>S. v. Goad, </em>490 F.2d 1158,1161-62 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 945, 94 S.Ct. 3068, 41 L.Ed.2d 665 (1974). In cases involving authorized use, however, the government must also prove that the defendant \u201clacked a good faith belief that the expenditure was for the legitimate benefit of the union.\u201d <em>U. S. v. Bane, </em>583 F.2d 832, 835-36 (6th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1127, 99 S.Ct. 1044, 59 L.Ed.2d 88 (1979); <em>see also U. S. v. Santiago, </em>528 F.2d 1130, 1133-34 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 972, 96 S.Ct. 2169, 48 L.Ed.2d 795 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The use of funds is only \u201cunauthorized\u201d if the defendant had actual knowledge that the expenditures were not properly authorized. <em>U. S. v. Rubin, </em>591 F.2d 278, 282 (5th Cir. 1979). Thus, a good faith belief in union benefit constitutes a defense unless the government can show that the defendant knew that the funds were unauthorized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the jury instructions did not reflect this standard, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-9\">. The initial instructions charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtiN\">The law does not require that the Government bears the burden of proving lack of benefit to the Union by the actions of the officers or actual harm derived therefrom, but what the Government must establish is fraudulent intent and lack of proper authorization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Supplemental instructions charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, \u2018good faith\u2019 cannot include, as a matter of law, spending Union funds thinking it proper since the Union would benefit from the expenditure. The fiduciary responsibility requires Union officials to follow the proper procedures to authorize the expenditure of funds and the utilization of such authorization. A Union official cannot be acting in \u2018good faith\u2019 when not following his Union\u2019s own procedures in regarding the authorization or expenditure of funds. An elected Union official must know the proper procedures for conducting his Union\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b923-18\">. Appellant also contests the use of an \u201cAllen\u201d or dynamite charge. Because we reverse on the substantive instructions, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b923-19\">. Authorization which is improperly or fraudulently obtained is also treated as lack of authorization. <em>U. S. v. Silverman, </em>430 F.2d 106, 114 (2d Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 953, 91 S.Ct. 1619, 29 L.Ed.2d 123 (1971). However, actual knowledge of the impropriety or fraud is still required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
