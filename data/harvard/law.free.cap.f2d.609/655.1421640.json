(Universal) appeal from an interlocutory judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Carter, <em>J., </em>granting plaintiff-appellee American Footwear Corporation (American) an injunction against infringement of its trademark \u201cBionic\u201d in connection with the promotion and sale of footwear. The judgment appealed from enjoins General and Universal from asserting exclusive rights to use of the term \u201cBionic\u201d in connection with the promotion and sale of footwear, but in no way interferes with Universal\u2019s trademark rights in its T.V. shows or its licensing operations in respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The district court found that inasmuch as Universal had not registered or applied for registration of \u201cBionic\u201d as a trademark pri- or to the time American selected the mark and applied for registration no statutory trademark issues were involved. Relying primarily upon American\u2019s priority of use, the lower court concluded that American established its right to use \u201cBionic\u201d in connection with the promotion and sale of its footwear, and therefore, as a result of Universal\u2019s \u201cBuyers Beware\u201d advertisement, designed to create the impression that American was guilty of trademark infringement, American had suffered irreparable injury. Based upon the foregoing facts, the court determined that American had established its entitlement to an injunction against Universal for trademark infringement and unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Universal and General argue that enjoining them from licensing or using the word \u201cBionic\u201d in connection with the promotion and sale of footwear because of American\u2019s prior use of the word constitutes an inequitable restriction upon a creator\u2019s use of a fanciful term and contend that they are entitled to an injunction against American based on American\u2019s unfair competition in attempting to capitalize upon the success of Universal\u2019s T.V. shows by misappropriating an essential element thereof in the word \u201cBionic.\u201d Defendants-appellants also contend that American failed under recognized principles of trademark law to establish any of the criteria necessary for the issuance of the injunction granted to it by the district court and urge the dissolution of that injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">We are in agreement with the defendants-appellants\u2019 contention that American failed to establish the necessary elements for issuance of an injunction and hereby order its dissolution. As to the appellants\u2019 contention that they are entitled to an injunction restraining American, we find that, because appellants failed to establish a likelihood of confusion such that a substantial number of ordinarily prudent purchasers might be misled into mistakenly purchasing American\u2019s footwear, American\u2019s usage of the trademark \u201cBionic,\u201d although admittedly adopted to capitalize on public receptiveness to a word Universal was responsible for popularizing, does not establish a case of unfair competition or trademark infringement entitling them to enjoin American\u2019s use of the word \u201cBionic\u201d in connection with the promotion and sale of its hiking boot.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">This action, a suit for declaratory relief brought in the New York Supreme Court, was initiated on July 30, 1976, by American against General, which, pursuant to license from Universal, was using \u201cBionic\u201d in the manufacture and sale of inexpensive children\u2019s sneakers. On August 13, 1976, General, however, removed that action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and on September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>20, 1976, commenced a separate action against American in the United States District Court. Universal was granted leave to intervene in both actions. Subsequently the two actions were consolidated for all purposes..</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The consolidated action contains the claims by American as plaintiff in its suit against General and Universal for common law trademark infringement, unfair competition, and tortious interference with business relations, and also the claims Universal and General assert against American in their action for common law and statutory trademark infringement, unfair competition, false designation of origin, passing off, and dilution.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The events leading up to the present controversy are lengthy and involve numerous peripherally related facts which will not be discussed at length. Beginning in January 1974 Universal, a television and motion picture studio, began what became an immensely popular T.V. series entitled \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man.\u201d The story line of this series concerned the adventures of a \u201cbionic\u201d man who, after a catastrophic accident, had been restored by a team of doctors through the use of numerous artificial limbs and organs. As a result, the \u201cbionic\u201d man possessed great physical strength and powers. This series was followed by another with a similar theme featuring a \u201cbionic\u201d woman, first aired in J[anuary 1976 under the title of \u201cThe Bionic Woman.\u201d Universal has applied for or registered numerous trademarks having reference to these two television shows in the fields of entertainment and of toys, and has begun a vigorous merchandising campaign exploiting the popularity of these two television programs. As of January 1976, however, its only registered mark was for \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d in the field of entertainment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In the fall of 1975 American, through its sister company An welt Corp., designed a multipurpose hiking boot. The trademark \u201cBionic Boot\u201d was adopted for the hiking boot in January 1976, at a brainstorming session of the American staff. It is undisputed that the idea for the trademark was generated from the highly popular television series \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man,\u201d where the hero is sometimes referred to as the \u201cBionic\u201d man.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">American searched the records of the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office to ascertain whether \u201cBionic\u201d had been registered as a federal trademark on footwear or whether there were any pending applications so to register. American was advised that the mark \u201cBionic\u201d was available for registration and that while \u201cBionic\u201d or other related terms had been used as trademarks for various goods, the mark \u201cBionic\u201d had never been registered or applied for in connection with footwear. American, therefore, went ahead with its plans to use \u201cBionic\u201d as a trademark and displayed the boot under that mark at the New York Shoe Fair in February 1976. The trademark \u201cBionic\u201d by American was affixed to the heel pad of the boot and was prominently displayed on the box.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> American\u2019s application for federal registration of the trademark \u201cBionic\u201d was filed on June 9, 1976. The first customer orders for the boot were dated February 1976, and the first shipment to customers was in July 1976. \u201cFootwear News\u201d also featured American\u2019s \u201cBionic Boot\u201d in its April 26, 1976 supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">Beginning in December 1975 Merchandising Corporation of America, Inc. (Merchandising), the commercial arm of Universal, began negotiations with General concerning commercial exploitation of its \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d series in the footwear field. Although some agreement was reached in March 1976, the district court found that the earliest date at which a license was effectuated was sometime subsequent to October 4, 1976. The court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that \u201c[t]he licensing agreement as proposed and as finally agreed upon always refer[s] to Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman, and at no time is there any reference to a trademark Bionic or to licensing the use of Bionic alone or indeed licensing anything separate and apart from the TV shows mentioned.\u201d (Joint Appendix at 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">As a result of the article in \u201cFootwear News\u201d featuring American\u2019s \u201cBionic Boot,\u201d Universal\u2019s subsidiary, Merchandising, sent a letter dated June 25, 1976, to American charging trademark infringement. Thereafter on July 26, 1976, Merchandising published in \u201cFootwear News\u201d a \u201cBuyers Beware\u201d advertisement which stated that Universal alone had the right to use \u201cBionic\u201d as a trademark and charged trademark infringement against all who used the mark without its permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">At the outset of its opinion the district court found that Universal had not registered or applied for a registration of \u201cBionic\u201d as a trademark for any goods prior to the time American selected the mark and applied for its registration and accordingly it held that no statutory trademark issues were involved. The district court recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">It was entirely permissible for American to attempt to capitalize on public receptiveness to a concept, idea or word which Universal has been responsible for creating or popularizing. The only limitation is that the party who takes advantage of the atmosphere the other party has helped create may not achieve a competitive boost by confusing the public into mistakenly purchasing his articles believing it to be that of his competitor, (citation omitted). American has not been guilty of that fault. It has at all times made clear that the Bionic boot it was attempting to promote was an American product. No effort of any kind was made to associate the boot with Universal\u2019s TV shows or with any of the characters in those shows. (Joint Appendix at 17 \u2014 18.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATa\">The court concluded, therefore, that the real issue in that controversy was whether Universal through its T.V. shows had foreclosed use in the marketplace of \u201cBionic\u201d or \u201cBionics\u201d by others. The court held that \u201cBionic\u201d as used by American was an arbitrary mark, whereas its use by Universal was a descriptive term (/. e., bionic man, bionic woman, bionic boy, bionic dog),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Universal had therefore failed to establish a right to be accorded use priority over American, <em>citing Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed.2d 25 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Additionally, the court held that \u201c[t]he word bionic has not been shown to have acquired a secondary meaning so that the public associates the term with Universal or its TV series\u201d (Joint Appendix at 18). In so holding the court rejected survey evidence introduced by Universal that purported to demonstrate public association between the word bionic and the T.V. series.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Universal and General concede that if the term, <em>i. </em>e., word, \u201cbionic\u201d had been used in its descriptive dictionary sense in relation to a product whose functional use would correspond to that descriptive sense, Universal has not foreclosed the use of such a term by others in the marketplace; but they argue that the court, in denying their application for an injunction, misapprehended the nature of their claim. First, Universal argues that it has foreclosed the use of the \u201ctelevision word Bionic\u201d to others due to its efforts and skills in developing and popularizing the word through the television series in which the word is used as part of the title of one of the series and is used as an adjective describing both major characters. Universal contends that this issue before the court is not whether the product is identified as being made by American, but whether the public could confuse the source of the product\u2019s sponsorship and purchase it because of a belief that it had some connection with Universal\u2019s television series.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Secondly, appellants argue that Universal\u2019s use of the terms \u201cBionic Man\u201d and \u201cBionic Woman\u201d on products marketed by its licensees was, contrary to the finding of the district court, arbitrary trademark use, so that Universal is entitled to protection against a subsequent user of an identical mark, citing <em>Triangle Publications v. Rohr-lich, </em>167 F.2d 969, 972 (2d Cir. 1948); Le-<em>Blume Import Co. v. Coty, </em>293 F. 344, 358-59 (2d Cir. 1923); <em>National Lampoon, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., Inc., </em>376 F.Supp. 733, 747 \u2014 48 (S.D.N.Y.) <em>aff\u2019d </em>497 F.2d 1343 (2d Cir. 1974). Also, appellants contend that if Universal\u2019s use of the word \u201cbionic\u201d is merely descriptive, the word has acquired a secondary meaning and appellants are thereby entitled to equitable protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The essence of Universal\u2019s and General\u2019s claim of unfair competition and trademark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>infringement is the adoption by American of the \u201ctelevision word\u201d bionic. In support of their alternative theories of recovery, appellants cite: <em>Triangle Publications v. Rohrlich, supra; Lone Ranger, Inc. v. Cox, </em>124 F.2d 650 (4th Cir. 1942); <em>National Lampoon, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., Inc., supra ; </em>and <em>Wyatt Earp Enterprises v. Sackman, Inc., </em>157 F.Supp. 621 (S.D.N.Y. 1958), all of which stand for the proposition that the public, through associating a name or symbol with a particular sponsorship, can be misled as to sponsorship of a product by the overt use by another party of that name or symbol. Hence, appellants reason that if Universal had in fact established a protect-able right in the terms \u201cBionic Man\u201d or \u201cBionic Woman\u201d then, under principles of trademark law, American has infringed by the use as the dominant portion of its mark, the portion, \u201cbionic,\u201d which most clearly identifies the sponsor of the goods, and therefore American should have been enjoined from the use of \u201cbionic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Although at one time the law of unfair competition was limited to claims that one party had attempted to pass off his goods as those of another party, unfair competition is now held to encompass a broader range of unfair practices which may be generally described as a misappropriation of the skill, expenditures, and labor of another. <em>Flexitized, Inc. v. National Flexitized Corp., </em>335 F.2d 774, 781 (2d Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 913, 85 S.Ct. 899, 13 L.Ed.2d 799 (1965); <em>Ideal Toy Corp. v. Kenner Products Division of General Mills Fun Group, Inc., </em>443 F.Supp. 291, 305 (S.D.N.Y. 1977). \u201c[0]ne cannot sell his product by misappropriating the good will of another through misleading the public into thinking that it is \u2018sponsored\u2019 by or derived from something else.\u201d <em>Ideal Toy Corp. v. Kenner Products Division of General Mills Fun Group, Inc., supra </em>at 305. Yet, liability in this area for misimpression or misappropriation has been limited. For example, one can capitalize on a market or fad created by another provided that it is not accomplished by confusing the public into mistakenly purchasing the product in the belief that the product is the product of the competitor. <em>Philip Morris, Inc. v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>188 U.S.P.Q. 289 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). All the cases in this area which appellants rely upon involved proof of a substantial secondary meaning in plaintiff\u2019s arbitrary trademark, <em>Triangle Publications v. Rohrlich, supra </em>(secondary meaning in mark \u201cSeventeen\u201d), or bad faith predatory conduct justifying relief, <em>Lone Ranger, Inc. v. Cox, supra </em>(bad faith); <em>HMH Publishing Co., Inc. v. Brincat, </em>504 F.2d 713 (9th Cir. 1974) (bad faith). <em>See also Lincoln Restaurant Corp. v. Wolfies Restaurant, Inc., </em>291 F.2d 302 (2d Cir. 1961) (deliberate attempt to create name-association). Here the district court found that there was no proof that American\u2019s advertising was built thematically around Universal\u2019s television shows, or that American played down its own name to inspire confusion, or that American acted in any other way except by the use of the word \u201cbionic\u201d to suggest any association with Universal\u2019s television enterprise. In fact, appellants concede that Universal\u2019s merchandising program uses the term \u201cbionic\u201d <em>to describe </em>many products sold under \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d mark and the \u201cBionic Woman\u201d mark; therefore, in view of this descriptive usage there would be no apparent reason for a consumer to assume that because the boots bore the mark \u201cBionic\u201d the creators of \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d or the \u201cBionic Woman\u201d were automatically engaging their creations in the sponsorship of hiking boots. Additionally, there was no evidence of prior dealings between American and Universal as in <em>Wyatt Earp Enterprises v. Sackman, Inc., supra, </em>and <em>National Lampoon, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., Inc., supra, </em>which might tend to support a conclusion that American adopted \u201cBionic\u201d for the purpose of suggesting an association with Universal\u2019s television series. Therefore, while American certainly intended to capitalize on Universal\u2019s popularization of the word \u201cbionic,\u201d we find that it did not so capitalize by confusing consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Challenging the findings of the district court, appellants also contend that by virtue of Universal\u2019s efforts in promoting its tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>vision programs the word \u201cbionic\u201d has come to be equated with the notion of enormous strength and superhuman ability as opposed to its dictionary definition (\u201cThe science of designing instruments or systems modeled after living organisms\u201d) and has, therefore, acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">We previously have discussed the district court\u2019s disposition of this argument. Although we do not subscribe to the view, arguably implicit in the district court\u2019s reasoning, that survey evidence gathered for later use in litigation invariably is suspect and not relevant to the issue of secondary meaning, <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. EverReady, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366, 381 (7th Cir. 1976), we are of the opinion that, in view of the numerous deficiencies inherent in the surveys here, the district court\u2019s rejection of this survey evidence was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>footnote 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The doctrine of secondary meaning requires not only that the mark have a subordinate meaning,' but also that the <em>primary </em>significance of the mark in the minds of the consumers is the identification of the producer, not a designation of the product. <em>See Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. 111, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938); <em>Spang v. Watson, </em>92 U.S.App.D.C. 266, 205 F.2d 703 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 938, 74 S.Ct. 378, 98 L.Ed. 426 (1954); <em>Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastic Co., </em>189 F.Supp. 333 (S.D.N.Y.1960), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>294 F.2d 694 (1961). So, when a company causes the public to associate a certain word with that company\u2019s business, that word has a secondary meaning and receives the full protection of the law of trademark and unfair competition. The crucial question in a case involving \u201csecondary meaning\u201d always is whether the public is moved in any degree to buy an article because of its source. <em>See Wyatt Earp Enterprises, Inc. v. Sackman, Inc., supra. </em>Proof of secondary meaning is often difficult inasmuch as no precise guidelines are applicable and no single factor is determinative. Each case must, therefore, be decided on its facts with consideration given to such elements as the length and exclusivity of use, sales levels, and extent of advertising and promotion. The fact that Universal has succeeded in popularizing the word \u201cbionic,\u201d and cultivated public acceptance of a relatively unknown word, while sufficient to support a finding of distinctiveness, <em>Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Kasser Distillers Products Corp., </em>350 F.Supp. 1341, 1359 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>480 F.2d 917 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>Time Mechanisms, Inc. v. Qonaar Corp., </em>422 F.Supp. 905, 912 (D.N.J.1976), is insufficient to support a finding of secondary meaning. Furthermore, the fact that Universal invested in excess of $20,000,000 in the production of its television shows and received royalties in excess of $10,000,000 from its merchandising program, as compared with American\u2019s minimal advertising expenditures in the promotion of its \u201cBionic Boot\u201d (approximately $3,000), while relevant to the issue of secondary meaning, is certainly not dispositive. <em>HMH Publishing Co. v. Brincat, supra </em>at 719. For just as the expenditure of large sums of money does not in and of itself create legally protectable rights, so, too, the mere presence of extensive advertising does not assure the existence of a likelihood of confusion. <em>HMH Publishing Co. v. Brincat, supra. </em>Appellants\u2019 survey relative to consumer reactions to boots labeled \u201cBionic\u201d only demonstrated a generalized linkage with Universal\u2019s television programs and did not demonstrate the existence of any consumer confusion as to sponsorship or source of manufacture. Such is insufficient to establish a secondary meaning in the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Appellants\u2019 trademark theory of recovery is no more persuasive than its misappropriation theory. It overlooks the well-established principle that trademark rights, unlike statutory copyrights or patents, are not rights in gross or at large. \u201cThere is no such thing as property in a trade-mark except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed.\u201d <em>United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., </em>248 U.S. 90, 97, 39 S.Ct. 48, 50, 63 L.Ed. 141 (1918). The right, therefore, to exclusive use of a trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>mark derives from, and is limited by, its actual use in the marketplace. <em>La Societe Anonyme des Parfums Le Gallon v. Jean Patou, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 1265, 1271 (2d Cir. 1974). The test, under both the Lanham Act and the common law, is the likelihood that the consuming public will be confused as to the source of the allegedly infringing product. <em>See Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R. G. Barry Corp., </em>441 F.Supp. 1220,1225 (S.D. N.Y.1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>580 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>Maternally Yours v. Your Maternity Shop, </em>234 F.2d 538 (2d Cir. 1956). As has often been observed, the law of trademark infringement is but a part of the law of unfair competition, <em>Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, </em>240 U.S. 403, 413, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713 (1916), and the same test is applied in determining each claim. For confusion to arise, the markets need not be identical, <em>Scarves by Vera, Inc. v. Todo Imports, Ltd. (Inc.), </em>544 F.2d 1167 (2d Cir. 1976), but the similarity of the markets or products is a factor meriting the consideration of the likelihood of confusion. <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R. G. Barry Corp., supra. </em>The trademarks registered to Universal were in the areas of T.Y. entertainment and toys. This market area bears little if any relationship to footwear, and diminishes the strength of Universal\u2019s contention that it had established a right to the term \u201cbionic\u201d as a fanciful mark in the field of footwear. Yet, as recognized by the district court, the fact that Universal had not utilized the mark, registered it, or applied for the mark on footwear is not decisive of the issue, for a trademark owner has a right to protection against the use of the mark by third parties on related non-competing goods. The district court determined that American, by virtue of the fact that it was the first user of the arbitrary mark \u201cBionic\u201d in connection with the promotion and sale of footwear, as contrasted with Universal\u2019s purely descriptive use of the term bionic, had established its entitlement to an injunction against Universal and General for trademark infringement and unfair competition and Universal\u2019s \u201cBuyers Beware\u201d advertisement was the basis of the court\u2019s finding that American had suffered irreparable injury. This finding, coupled with the court\u2019s conclusion that American had acquired common law trademark rights to \u201cBionic\u201d in the field of footwear, constituted the factual and legal bases for the award of injunctive relief. Also, the court held that under the standards set forth <em>im Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., supra, </em>287 F.2d at 495, Universal had failed to establish a right to be accorded priority over American in the area of the merchandising of footwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The question of whether a senior user is entitled to protection against a junior user on non-competitive goods was addressed by this court in <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., supra. </em>The factors suggested in <em>Polaroid </em>include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akd-dedup-0\">[T]he strength of his mark, the degree of similarity between the two marks, the proximity of the products, the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap, actual confusion, and the reciprocal of defendant\u2019s good faith in adopting its own mark, the quality of defendant\u2019s product, and the sophistication of the buyers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\"><em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., supra, </em>287 F.2d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">It has long been established in this circuit that the mere fact of seniority alone does not entitle the first user of a trademark to injunctive relief. The determination is to be made on the basis of the equities involved, and thereby requires an evaluation of the legitimate interests of the senior user, the junior user, and the consuming public. <em>Chandon Champagne Corp. v. San Marino Wine Corp., </em>335 F.2d 531, 534 (2d Cir. 1964). Therefore, to the extent that American sought relief for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114, it was necessary for it to prove the elements of trademark infringement. <em>See Scarves by Vera, Inc. v. Todo Imports, Ltd. (Inc.), supra; Kiki Undies Corp. v. Promenade Hosiery Mills, Inc., </em>411 F.2d 1097, 1099 (2d Cir. 1969), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>396 U.S. 1054, 90 S.Ct. 707, 24 L.Ed.2d 698 (1970); <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., supra. </em>American has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>clearly failed to meet this burden. First, \u201cBionic\u201d is a relatively new mark and therefore could not be considered a particularly strong mark in the marketplace. Second, there is little comparability between the expensive hiking boots sold by American and the inexpensive children\u2019s sneakers sold by Universal\u2019s licensee, General. The dissimilarities in the products (i. e., hiking boots vs. children\u2019s sneakers) also have an indirect bearing on the marketplace sophistication of buyers inasmuch as the purchasers of American\u2019s hiking boot undoubtedly are not motivated by the same considerations as purchasers of \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d or \u201cBionic Woman\u201d \u201cBionic Sneakers.\u201d American has not brought its case within the <em>Polaroid </em>factors. American, the senior user, is not \u201cbridging the gap.\u201d It is Universal, the junior user, which is expanding into new fields (i. e., footwear) and not American. As to the quality of General\u2019s product, American made no claim in the court below and none here that it was concerned with General\u2019s competition in manufacturing and selling children\u2019s sneakers. And, finally, American presented no evidence on the crucial issue, essential to sustain a finding of trademark infringement, of whether there was likely to be consumer confusion by the use of the mark by Universal and General. In fact, the only evidence presented on the issue of consumer confusion was the survey evidence offered by appellants, a survey which failed to establish the likelihood of such confusion and the results of which were rejected by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We find, after consideration of all pertinent factors under trademark principles and the law of unfair competition, that neither party has demonstrated entitlement to equitable protection of their respective marks and hereby order the dissolution of the injunction entered against appellants herein. In so holding, we do, however, adopt the suggestion made by appellants that inasmuch as Universal\u2019s and General\u2019s use of the word \u201cBionic\u201d was clearly accompanied by references to the respective television series, and that all the footwear made by General contained the name of the television series elsewhere on the footwear, that American will be permitted to continue to market its \u201cBionic Boot\u201d simultaneously with permitting Universal and General to exploit fully Universal\u2019s creativity by marketing the \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d and the \u201cBionic Woman\u201d \u201cBionic Sneakers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Inasmuch as the district court did not address the pendent state claims under section 368-d of the New York General Business Law (N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law \u00a7 368-d) and therefore made no findings of fact or conclusions of law with respect thereto, we deem it inappropriate to address those issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Opinion of district court reversed in part; affirmed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. American affixes its trademark to its boots on a heel pad as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax84\">BIONIC TM BY AMERICAN</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">The gummed label affixed to the box in which the \u201cBionic Boot\u201d is sold reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alf-dedup-0\">BIONIC TM BOOT BY AMERICAN</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">. Appellants dispute this finding by the district court. They contend that American\u2019s intent to capitalize upon the popularity of Universal\u2019s television shows was evidenced by a poster, showing a woman in a running pose similar to the running pose adopted by Universal\u2019s theme characters in the opening segments of each episode of \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d and \u201cThe Bionic Woman,\u201d which was employed by American as part of the advertising display promoting its \u201cBionic Boot\u201d at the National Shoe Fair held in New York City in February 1976. On the other hand, conceding that American\u2019s \u201cBionic Boots\u201d were not designed to be the functional equivalent of track shoes, an advertisement for footwear does lend itself to a running pose. Moreover, the similarities between the poster and the scenes from the T.V. shows are not so marked that, when the poster is displayed together with numerous and prominent references to American and to no other entity, an ordinarily prudent purchaser would be likely to be misled into believing that any sponsorship arrangement existed between Universal\u2019s T.V. shows and American\u2019s product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-13\">. That is to say, Universal\u2019s usage of the adjective \u201cbionic\u201d was intended to correspond with that term\u2019s dictionary meaning, \u201cconcerning the science of designing instruments or systems modeled after living organisms.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-14\">. At trial Universal offered two surveys conducted under the supervision of Dr. Russell Haley, a telephone survey and a shopping center survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The telephone study was conducted on a national probability sample of individuals 16 years of age or older. 802 individuals were asked a single question: \u201cWith whom or what do you associate a product labelled Bionic?\u201d Of the 802 interviewees 34.7% gave no associational response whatsoever and 55% associated a product labeled Bionic with Universal\u2019s television shows or their principal characters. Although the latter percentage may be significant, the form of the survey question was too self-serving, in that the more relevant inquiry should have been \u201cWith whom or what do you associate a \u2018Bionic\u2019 boot?\u201d <em>See American Basketball Association v. AMF Voit, Inc., </em>358 F.Supp. 981, 986 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d </em>487 F.2d 1393 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert, denied, </em>416 U.S. 986, 94 S.Ct. 2389, 40 L.Ed.2d 763 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The second study, the on-site shopping center survey, involved 307 personal interviews in six shopping centers throughout the country. Each of the interviewees was shown an American promotional poster for the \u201cBionic Boot,\u201d and was then asked: \u201cWith whom or what do you associate the term Bionic Boot?\u201d Out of the 307 persons interviewed 74.3% identified the poster as being connected with Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d or \u201cThe Bionic Woman\u201d television series or with their principal characters. Assuming that this percentage is high enough to be significant, the critical defect in this survey was the failure to conduct it under actual marketing conditions. Whenever American had displayed this poster at various shoe fairs or industry trade shows, the poster always was shown in an environment replete with references to American as the seller of the boot. However, once removed from this environment, the poster differed from American\u2019s other \u201cBionic Boot\u201d advertisements in that the poster itself did not contain any references to American. This defect was pointed out by the district court during Dr. Haley\u2019s testimony, the court stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">. one of the issues in the case is the possibility of confusion on the part of the consumer, so it seems to me that using the advertisement in the form that the defendant finds objectionable would get a more accurate response as to whether or not there is the likelihood of confusion with the defendant\u2019s product than leaving it off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">(Joint Appendix at 698-99); <em>see American Luggage Works, Inc. v. United States Trunk Co., </em>158 F.Supp. 50, 53 (D.Mass.1957) (Wyzanski, J.), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Hawley Products Co. v. United States Trunk Co., </em>259 F.2d 69 (1st Cir. 1958). Moreover, the survey participants, although former purchasers of hiking boots, did not necessarily have any present purchasing interest concerning the particular matter being surveyed. As noted by Judge Wyzanski in <em>American Luggage Works, Inc., supra, </em>158 F.Supp. at 53, \u201cMany men do not take the same trouble to avoid confusion when they are responding to sociological investigators as when they spend their cash,\u201d quoted approvingly in 259 F.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">Accordingly, in light of these methodological defects, the district court\u2019s rejection of this survey evidence was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
