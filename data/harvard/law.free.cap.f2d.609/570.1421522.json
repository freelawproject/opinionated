An indispensable corollary of this responsibility is the right \u2014 indeed, the duty \u2014 to discipline those who fail to conform to the high standards of conduct which have been prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">We are called upon today to determine (1) whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), pursuant to one of its Rules of Practice which has been in effect for more than forty years, may conduct an administrative proceeding to determine whether certain professionals \u2014 in this case, accountants \u2014 should be censured or suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission because of alleged unethical, unprofessional or fraudulent conduct in their audits of the financial statements of two corporations; and (2) if the Commission is authorized to conduct such an administrative proceeding, whether it should be permitted to conclude it before the accountants resort to the courts. For the reasons below, we hold that both questions must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">On September 1, 1976 \u2014 more than two and one-half years ago \u2014 the SEC, pursuant to Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.2(e) (1978),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered an order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided for a public administrative proceeding against the accounting firm of Touche Ross &amp; Co. and three of its former partners, Edwin Heft, James M. Lynch and Arinin J. Frankel. The firm and the three partners, all appellants, will be referred to collectively as \u201cTouche Ross\u201d or \u201cappellants\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The proceeding was instituted to determine whether appellants had engaged in unethical, unprofessional or fraudulent conduct in their audits of the financial statements of Giant Stores Corporation and Am-pex Corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The Commission\u2019s order alleged that Touche Ross and the individual appellants, in examining the companies\u2019 financial statements, had failed to follow generally accepted accounting standards and had no reasonable basis for their opinions regarding the financial statements of these companies. The order also recited that, if these allegations were found to be true, they tended to show that Touche Ross and the individual appellants had engaged in improper professional conduct and willfully had violated, and had aided and abetted violations of, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7, 10 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and rules and regulations thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In view of the nationwide accounting practice of Touche Ross,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the SEC decided that it would be in the public interest to institute a public proceeding and to order a hearing at which Touche Ross would be afforded an opportunity to present a defense to these charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commission then would have been in a position to determine whether the substantive allegations were true and, if so, whether Touche Ross and the individual appellants should be disqualified, either temporarily or permanently, from appearing and practicing before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">No administrative hearings have ever been held in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">On October 12, 1976, Touche Ross commenced the instant action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the Commission and four of its members in their official capacities. By this action, Touche Ross sought a permanent injunction against the on-going administrative proceeding which had been instituted against them by the SEC pursuant to Rule 2(e). Touche Ross also sought a declaratory judgment that Rule 2(e) had been promulgated \u201cwithout any statutory authority\u201d; that the Rule 2(e) administrative proceeding had been instituted against them \u201cwithout authority of law\u201d; and, in any event, since the SEC does not constitute an impartial forum for the adjudication of the issues raised in the SEC\u2019s Rule 2(e) order, that such administrative proceedings would deny Touche Ross due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">The SEC moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1) on the grounds that Touche Ross\u2019 complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the asserted claims for relief. The crux of the SEC\u2019s position in support of its motion to dismiss was that Touche Ross improperly had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>After a hearing, the district court, Constance B. Motley, <em>District Judge, </em>filed a well-reasoned opinion granting the SEC\u2019s motion and ordering that the action be dismissed. [1978 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L. Rep. (CCH) 196,415 (S.D.N.Y. April 24, 1978). The district court rested its decision on the failure of Touche Ross to exhaust its administrative remedies. It did not reach the substantive question of the validity of Rule 2(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">From the judgment entered on the district court opinion, this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In the light of these facts and prior proceedings, we turn first to the question whether appellants must exhaust their administrative remedies before resorting to the courts to assert their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In order to avoid confusion, we distinguish among three possible situations in the context of the instant case where the exhaustion issue arises: (1) when a litigant, such as Touche Ross, seeks to challenge a final Commission decision and order pursuant to Rule 2(e) which imposes sanctions or disciplines professionals for improper or unprofessional conduct; (2) when a litigant, such as Touche Ross, seeks judicial review of claims of agency bias; and (3) when, as in the particular circumstances of this case, Touche Ross requests this Court to adjudicate the question whether the Commission has the <em>authority </em>to promulgate Rule 2(e) and to proceed thereunder. With respect to claims (1) and (2), we agree with the district court that Touche Ross must first exhaust their administrative remedies before challenging a Commission determination on the merits, or raising claims of agency bias. With respect to claim (3), however, because there is no need for further agency action to enable us to reach the merits of appellants\u2019 challenge to the Commission\u2019s authority to promulgate Rule 2(e), we hold, with regard to this claim alone, that appellants need not exhaust their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is concerned mainly with the timing of judicial review. In general, a litigant is required to pursue all of his administrative remedies before he will be permitted to seek judicial relief. The rationale behind the exhaustion doctrine is that a court\u2019s refusal to intervene prematurely in the administrative process gives the agency an opportunity to develop factual findings, to apply its expertise to new issues and to exercise its discretionary powers. <em>See McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 193-94 (1969). Moreover, \u201c[n]otions of administrative autonomy require that the agency be given a chance to discover and correct its own errors\u201d \u2014 a practice that will protect the integrity of the administrative process and prevent litigants from flouting the agency\u2019s procedures. Id. at 195. We emphasize at the outset that normally we will not tolerate the interruption of the administrative process to hear piecemeal appeals of a litigant\u2019s claims on the merits. This is exactly what the exhaustion doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>trine was designed to prevent. Accordingly, we wish to make it clear that Touche Ross must exhaust their administrative remedies by submitting to the Rule 2(e) proceedings before we will consider any challenges which they may assert with respect to any disciplinary action that the Commission may determine is appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Appellants\u2019 principal claim on the instant appeal is that the Commission is acting without authority and beyond its jurisdiction in proceeding against them pursuant to Rule 2(e). They also contend that the administrative proceedings should be enjoined because the Commission is \u201cbiased\u201d, as indicated by the institution of public rather that non-public proceedings; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they argue that, because the proceedings are public, they will not be given a fair and impartial hearing in accordance with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">If the claim of bias were the only basis for appellants\u2019 demand for injunctive relief, it would be unnecessary for us to go further than to hold, with respect to that claim, that exhaustion of administrative remedies is required. As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held, allegations of agency bias or prejudgment based on ex parte communications are insufficient for injunctive relief and cannot be reviewed until the agency has made an adverse determination and an appeal has been taken raising these claims on the record as a whole. <em>R. A. Holman &amp; Co. v. SEC, </em>299 F.2d 127, 129 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 U.S. 911 (1962); <em>National Lawyers Guild v. Brownell, </em>225 F.2d 552, 555 (D.C.Cir.1955), <em>cert. denied, </em>351 U.S. 927 (1956). We agree. Until the Commission has acted and actual bias has been demonstrated, the orderly administrative procedures of the agency should not be interrupted by judicial intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Appellants, however, go further and contend that the SEC, in promulgating Rule 2(e), acted in excess of its statutory authority and now is proceeding against them without jurisdiction. Thus, the question presented is whether \u201cthe long settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted\u201d, <em>Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 50-51 (1938) (footnote omitted), is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the exhaustion doctrine is subject to a number of exceptions, <em>McKart v. United States, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 193, and an examination of the cases indicates that it has not been applied consistently. Perhaps the leading case in which the Supreme Court refused to require exhaustion is <em>Leedom v. Kyne, </em>358 U.S. 184 (1958). The question in <em>Leedom </em>was whether the National Labor Relations Board had acted in excess of its delegated powers by failing to conduct a vote of all professional employees as required by \u00a7 9(b)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act before certifying a particular bargaining unit consisting of both professional and nonprofessional employees. The Supreme Court, in dispensing with the exhaustion requirement, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">\u201cThis suit ... is one to strike down an order of the Board made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act. Section 9(b)(1) is clear and mandatory. It says that, in determining the unit appropriate . . . \u2018the Board <em>shall not </em>(1) decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion. . . . \u2019 Yet the Board included in the unit employees whom it found were not professional employees after refusing to determine whether a majority of the professional employees would \u2018vote for inclusion in such unit.\u2019 Plainly, this was an attempted exercise of power that had been specifically withheld.\u201d 358 U.S. at 188-89 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The exception resorted to in <em>Leedom, </em>however, has been interpreted narrowly by our Court. In <em>Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Wein-berger, </em>509 F.2d 1236 (2 Cir. 1975) (Friendly, J.), in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 claim that <em>Myers </em>is \u201cold-hat\u201d and that <em>Leedom </em>\u201chas become the seminal decision\u201d, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"as0-dedup-0\">\u201cNothing advanced by plaintiffs persuades us to depart from the general position we took after full analysis, only two years ago, that the most that can be extrapolated from <em>Leedom v. Kyne, </em>is that an injunction may be issued \u2018if an agency refuses to dismiss a proceeding that is <em>plainly </em>beyond its jurisdiction as a matter of law or is being conducted in a manner that cannot result in a valid order\u2019 . . . \u2014 a \u2018possibly over-generous\u2019 standard we found not to have been met by the plaintiff there. Until otherwise instructed we shall continue to regard <em>Myers </em>as stating the general rule and <em>Leedom v. Kyne </em>as being what the Supreme Court says it is \u2014 a narrow exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In the instant case, the authority of the Commission to proceed pursuant to Rule 2(e) surely is not \u201cplainly beyond its jurisdiction as a matter of law\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Unlike the Board\u2019s action in <em>Leedom, </em>the action of the Commission in promulgating Rule 2(e) is not specifically <em>prohibited </em>by statute. Viewing appellants\u2019 claim in the light most favorable to them, it may be said that the Commission\u2019s authority to promulgate Rule 2(e) is not specifically <em>provided for </em>by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">While our decision in <em>Sterling Drug </em>makes it clear that we are loath to extend the <em>Leedom </em>exception to situations where the plaintiffs do not allege that an agency is acting \u201cplainly beyond its jurisdiction\u201d, we also have recognized that application of the exhaustion doctrine requires \u201c \u2018an understanding of its purposes and of the particular administrative scheme involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diapulse Corp. v. Food &amp; Drug Administration, </em>500 F.2d 75, 77 (2 Cir. 1974), <em>quoting from McKart v. United States, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 193. Among those purposes outlined by the Court in <em>McKart, </em>are giving the agency an opportunity to develop a factual record, permitting it to exercise its discretion or to apply its expertise, and promoting efficiency by barring the premature interruption of the administrative process which would follow if the parties were permitted to seek aid from the courts at various intermediate stages. <em>Id. </em>at 193-94. In applying these considerations to the actual question in <em>McKart, </em>the Court considered a number of factors before concluding that exhaustion should not be required. In particular, the Court weighed the hardship faced by appellant in going to jail,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the fact that the issue there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>required only statutory interpretation and that there was no need for agency expertise or the exercise of agency discretion. The Court concluded that, since \u201cjudicial review would not be significantly aided by an additional administrative decision, [t]here is simply no overwhelming need for the court to have the agency finally resolve this question in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. The Court also emphasized, however, that, if the exercise of discretion or application of expertise is required, \u201c[i]t may be proper to require a registrant to carry his case through the administrative process before he comes into court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200. Indeed, subsequently in <em>McGee v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 479 (1971), the need for the selective service board\u2019s application of expertise in determining whether a person could claim exemption as a ministerial student or conscientious objector was decisive in requiring exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The absence of the need for agency expertise or discretion has proven decisive in several decisions of our Court which have held that exhaustion was not necessary. In <em>Finnerty </em>v. <em>Cowen, </em>508 F.2d 979 (2 Cir. 1974), appellant, a recipient of benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, challenged the Railroad Retirement Board\u2019s procedure for recouping alleged overpay-ments on the ground that the procedure violated the relevant statutes and regulations and denied her due process because she received no prior notice or opportunity for a hearing. Although we recognized that normally exhaustion is required for recipients who challenge the merits of an administrative determination, we held that exhaustion would be futile when the \u201cvery administrative procedure under attack is the one which the agency says must be exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 982-83. Since there was no need for the agency to make determinations of fact or to apply its expertise before the federal courts could determine the constitutionality of the administrative procedure, exhaustion was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Similarly, in <em>Diapulse Corp. v. Food &amp; Drug Administration, supra, </em>where the question was whether the FDA\u2019s proposed search fees were legally authorized, we held that exhaustion was not required. There was no need for the development of a factual record, no room for the exercise of agency discretion, and little need for agency expertise in deciding the question. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201c[t]o require exhaustion . . . would be overly harsh and wasteful.\u201d 500 F.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Similar considerations are present in the instant case. Appellants challenge the legal authorization of the Commission to proceed against them pursuant to Rule 2(e). While the Commission\u2019s administrative proceeding is not \u201cplainly beyond its jurisdiction\u201d, nevertheless to require appellants to exhaust their administrative remedies would be to require them to submit to the very procedures which they are attacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">Moreover, the issue is one of purely statutory interpretation. <em>See Consumers Union v. Cost of Living Council, </em>491 F.2d 1396, 1399 (Temp.Emer.Ct.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 984 (1974). Further agency action is unnecessary to enable us to determine the validity of Rule 2(e). There is no need for the exercise of discretion on the part of the agency nor for the application of agency expertise. While the Commission has the power to declare its own rule invalid, it is unlikely that further proceedings would produce such a result. Accordingly, we now turn to the merits of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">Section 23(a)(1) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78w(a)(l) (1976), authorizes the Commission to \u201cmake such rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of this title for which [it is] responsible or for the execution of the functions vested in [it] by this title .. <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pursuant to this general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>rulemaking authority, the Commission adopted and subsequently has amended<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.2(e) (1978), the relevant part of which is set forth above. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The current Rule and its predecessors have been in effect for over forty years. It has been the basis for a number of disciplinary proceedings brought against professionals \u2014 including accountants and attorneys' \u2014 during this forty year period. <em>See, e. g., Touche Ross &amp; Co., </em>Accounting Series Release No. 153, Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 72,175 (1974) (firm waived formal Rule 2(e) proceedings, was censured by Commission, and consented to an order providing remedial sanctions); <em>In the Matter of Myers, </em>Accounting Series Release No. 92, Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 72,114 (1962); <em>In the Matter of Touche, Nevin, Bailey &amp; Smart, </em>Accounting Series Release No. 78, Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 72,100 (1957); <em>In the Matter of Masquelette &amp; Co., </em>Accounting Series Release No. 68, Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 72,087 (1949); <em>In the Matter of Logan, </em>10 S.E.C. 982 (1942) (accountants disciplined under Rule 2(e)); <em>In the Matter of Ronald H. Freemond, </em>Release No. 33-4736 [1964-1966 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec. L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 77,190 (1964); <em>In the Matter of Schwebel, </em>40 S.E.C. 347 (1960) (attorneys permanently disqualified from practice before the SEC under Rule 2(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Although the mere fact that the Rule is of long standing does not relieve us of our responsibility to determine its validity, <em>see SEC v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103 (1978), it is noteworthy that no court has ever held that the Rule is invalid. Indeed, in <em>SEC v. Ezrine, </em>Civil Action No. 72-3161, [1972\u2014 1973 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) 1193,594 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 1972), Judge Frankel specifically rejected an attorney\u2019s claim that the Commission lacked the power to discipline him, granted the Commission\u2019s request for an injunction, and enjoined the attorney from further practice before the Commission. <em>See also Schwebel v. Orrick, </em>153 F.Supp. 701, 704 (D.D.C.1957) (district court upheld authority of Commission to proceed under Rule 2(e), <em>affirmed on other grounds, </em>251 F.2d 919 (D.C.Cir.) (denial of injunction affirmed but on ground that appellant failed to exhaust administrative remedies), <em>cert. denied, </em>356 U.S. 927 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Other courts, although not squarely ruling on the question, nevertheless have intimated that the Commission has the authority to promulgate Rule 2(e) and to discipline professionals who appear before it. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., SEC v. Csapo, </em>533 F.2d 7, 12 (D.C.Cir. 1976) (Lumbard, J.) (\u201cNothing in our opinion today is intended to limit the right of the SEC to institute itself such disciplinary proceedings. . . . \u201d); <em>Kivitz v. SEC, </em>475 F.2d 956, 962 (D.C.Cir.1973) (Danaher, J.). These decisions, although persuasive, are not binding on this Court. We must examine independently the statutory scheme to determine if the Rule is in accordance with Congressional policy and purpose. <em>See SEC v. Sloan, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 115-16.</p>\n<p id=\"A0I\">Appellants concede that there is no express statutory prohibition against promulgation of the Rule. They contend, however, that the statutory scheme negates any implied authority that the SEC may discipline accountants pursuant to Rule 2(e). Specifically, they point to \u00a7 27 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (1976), which provides that the district courts \u201cshall have <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction of violations of this chapter\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Viewed in conjunction with other statutory provisions which authorize the SEC to commence proceedings in the district courts to enjoin what the Commission believes to be violations of the Acts,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> appellants argue that these provisions indicate that Congress intended that only the courts should adjudicate violations of the Acts. Absent express Congressional authorization for the Commission to adjudicate such violations \u2014 so the argument goes \u2014 the Commission is without power to promulgate its disciplinary Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">We reject appellants\u2019 argument for several reasons. First, it is clear that the SEC is not attempting to usurp the jurisdiction of the federal courts to deal with \u201cviolations\u201d of the securities laws. The Commission, through its Rule 2(e) proceeding, is merely attempting to preserve the integrity of its own procedures, by assuring the fitness of those professionals who represent others before the Commission. Indeed, the Commission has made it clear that its intent in promulgating Rule 2(e) was not to utilize the rule as an additional weapon in its enforcement arsenal, but rather to determine whether a person\u2019s professional qualifications, including his character and integrity, are such that he is fit to appear and practice before the Commission. Securities Act Release No. 5088 at 1 (Sept. 24, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Moreover, an examination of the policies underlying the securities laws indicates that, contrary to appellants\u2019 assertions, the Rule is not inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s statutory authority. In considering questions of the authority of an agency to promulgate rules or regulations, the Supreme Court has held that, if the regulation is in furtherance of a legitimate statutory purpose, the validity of the regulation will be upheld. In <em>Mourning v.

SEC, </em>360 F.2d 856, 857 (7 Cir. 1966). Congress realized that it could not enact express statutory provisions to deal with every possible evil that might develop. Thus, the wide latitude given to the Commission has been seen as necessary, \u201cin view of the nature of the subject matter, ... to protect investors against fraud or deception made possible by constantly changing conditions.\u201d <em>R. A. Holman &amp; Co. v. SEC, supra, </em>299 F.2d at 132. Indeed, in discussing the role of the SEC in the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Congress implicitly gave its approval to the SEC\u2019s use of Rule 2(e) proceedings as a possible alternative to injunctive action or criminal referral. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No.95-114, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 n.6 (1977); H.R.Rep.No.95-640, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 10 n.l (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>[1977] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4098.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The chief purpose of the 1933 Act was to \u201cprovide investors with full disclosure of material information concerning public offerings of securities in commerce.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 195 (1976). One of the mechanisms designed to implement this policy of full disclosure was the requirement that a registration statement be filed with the Commission before a security could be sold to the public. <em>See SEC v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>584 F.2d 1018,1025 n.51 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1071 (1979). In connection with the filing requirements, the Commission was given broad authority to regulate the contents of the filings, including the authority to prescribe the form and method of preparing financial statements, to define accounting terms,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and to require that financial statements be certified by an independent public accountant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The role of the accounting and legal professions in implementing the objectives of the disclosure policy has increased in importance as the number and complexity of securities transactions has increased. By the very nature of its operations, the Commission, with its small staff and limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>resources, cannot possibly examine, with the degree of close scrutiny required for full disclosure, each of the many financial statements which are filed. Recognizing this, the Commission necessarily must rely heavily on both the accounting and legal professions to perform their tasks diligently and responsibly. Breaches of professional responsibility jeopardize the achievement of the objectives of the securities laws and can inflict great damage on public investors. As our Court observed in <em>United States v. Benjamin, </em>328 F.2d 854 (2 Cir.), <em>cert./ denied, </em>377 U.S. 953 (1964), \u201cIn our complex society the accountant\u2019s certificate and the lawyer\u2019s opinion can be instruments for inflicting pecuniary loss more potent than the chisel or the crowbar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Rule 2(e) thus represents an attempt by the SEC essentially to protect the integrity of its own processes. If incompetent or unethical accountants should be permitted to certify financial statements, the reliability of the disclosure process would be impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">These concerns have led courts to reject challenges to the authority of other agencies to discipline attorneys practicing or appearing before them. In <em>Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, </em>270 U.S. 117 (1926), the Supreme Court upheld the power of the Board of Tax Appeals to adopt rules of practice for professionals appearing before it as a necessary adjunct to the Board\u2019s power to protect the integrity of its administrative procedures and the public in general. Focusing on the character of work done by the Board, the interests affected by its decisions, and the \u201cquasi judicial\u201d nature of its duties, the Court rejected the argument that the absence of explicit statutory authorization to regulate the conduct and admission of attorneys was an indication that Congress did not intend the Board to exercise such power. Instead, the Court stated that \u201cso necessary is the power and so usual is it that the general words by which the Board is vested with the authority to prescribe the procedure in accordance with which its business shall be conducted include as part of the procedure rules of practice for the admission of attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Similarly, in <em>Herman v. Dulles, </em>205 F.2d 715, 716 (D.C.Cir.1953), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that, since the International Claims Commission had been given the \u201cexpress authority to \u2018prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to enable it to carry out its functions\u2019 \u201d, it therefore had implied authority to prescribe rules setting standards of practice and adopting procedures for disciplining attorneys who failed to conform to those standards. <em>Accord, Ko-den v. United States Department of Justice, </em>564 F.2d 228 (7 Cir. 1977) (upholding the authority of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to discipline attorneys appearing before it).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Appellants attempt to distinguish <em>Goldsmith </em>and <em>Herman </em>from the instant case on the ground that the agencies involved in those cases exercised only \u201cjudicial functions\u201d, whereas the SEC, according to appellants, is authorized to act only as an enforcement agency.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Assuming arguendo the correctness of appellants\u2019 restrictive description of the SEC\u2019s functions, it is uniformly accepted that many agencies properly combine the functions of prosecutor, judge and jury. Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that a hearing conducted by such a body does not automatically constitute a violation of due process. <em>Withrow v. Lar-kin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47-50 (1975). <em>Accord, Wright v. SEC, </em>112 F.2d 89, 94 (2 Cir. 1940). Appellants nevertheless argue \u2014 we think facetiously \u2014 that permitting the SEC to discipline attorneys who appear before it would be equivalent to empowering United States Attorneys to disbar lawyers who represent clients in criminal prosecutions in the federal courts. Aside from the obviously inapt analogy, this contention at most merely suggests the possibility that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>power to discipline may be abused; it is wide of the mark of suggesting a reason for invalidating the Commission\u2019s rule. As the Court stated in <em>Withrow v. Larkin, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 47:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">\u201cThe contention that the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions necessarily creates an unconstitutional risk of bias in administrative adjudication has a much more difficult burden of persuasion to carry. It must overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators; and it must convince that, under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness, conferring investigative and adjudicative powers on the same individuals poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">To summarize: we reject appellants\u2019 assertion that the Commission acted without authority in promulgating Rule 2(e). Although there is no express statutory provision authorizing the Commission to discipline professionals appearing before it, Rule 2(e), promulgated pursuant to its statutory rulemaking authority, represents an attempt by the Commission to protect the integrity of its own processes. It provides the Commission with the means to ensure that those professionals, on whom the Commission relies heavily in the performance of its statutory duties, perform their tasks diligently and with a reasonable degree of competence. As such the Rule is \u201creasonably related\u201d to the purposes of the securities laws. <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., supra. </em>Moreover, we hold that the Rule does not violate, nor is it inconsistent with, any other provision of the securities laws. We therefore sustain the validity of the Rule as a necessary adjunct to the Commission\u2019s power to protect the integrity of its administrative procedures and the public in general. <em>Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly refused to enjoin the Commission from proceeding against Touche Ross pursuant to Rule 2(e). We affirm the judgment dismissing the action. In view of our holding that Rule 2(e) represents a valid exercise of the Commission\u2019s rulemaking power, appellants must exhaust their administrative remedies before the SEC prior to attempting to obtain judicial review of their other claims, including their claim that the Commission is acting with bias and will not afford them a fair hearing in accordance with due process.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-10\">.

Nor has it shown that another constitutional right is at stake. Its allegations that the SEC is acting in clear violation of its statutory authority are not supported by precedent. The court finds that there has been no showing of clear abuse of authority by the SEC. Touche Ross has not shown that it will suffer irreparable injury if forced to present its jurisdictional claims to the SEC and then to the reviewing court, in the event of an adverse determination by the SEC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">The court finds that Touche Ross has not made a sufficient showing that this court should depart from the general rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">Therefore, without reaching the substantive question of the validity of Rule 2(e), the court holds that Touche Ross must first exhaust its administrative remedies. Therefore the SEC\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint is granted. See order of this date.\u201d Touche Ross &amp; Co. <em>v. SEC, supra, </em>[1978 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep.

SEC, supra, </em>[1978 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) 96,415 at 93,499. In view of our holding <em>that </em>several factors should be considered in determining whether exhaustion is required, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the standard employed by the district court is the same as \u201cplainly\u201d beyond the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">. Decisions of our Court previously have suggested in dictum that appellants must make a showing of irreparable injury before we will dispense with the exhaustion requirement. <em>E. g., M. G. Davis &amp; Co. v. Cohen, </em>369 F.2d 360, 363 (2 Cir. 1966). <em>Cf. Small v. Kiley, </em>567 F.2d 163, 165 (2 Cir. 1977) (plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies precludes finding of either irreparable harm or likelihood of success on the merits). In <em>M. G. Davis </em>&amp; <em>Co., supra, </em>the challenge to the agency\u2019s authority involved a question of procedural irregularity which we held did not suffice to demonstrate \u201cthe kind or degree of over-stepping of the limits of the Commission\u2019s power which would bring it within ... an exception\u201d to the exhaustion requirements. 369 F.2d at 363. However, in dictum we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">\"Even if appellants could surmount the jurisdictional hurdle, their action must fail, because they do not allege that they would be irreparably injured if denied relief.

In 1935, shortly after it was created, the Commission promulgated its Rules of Practice. Rule 11(1) originally provided that the Commission in its discretion could discipline attorneys or other persons who did not possess the requisite qualifications to represent others before the Commission. <em>See </em>Securities and Exchange Commission, First Annual Report 45-53 (1935). Rule II was amended in 1938 to eliminate the provision that persons wishing to practice before the Commission were required to file applications with the Commission. The disciplinary provision, however, was retained. Securities Act Release No. 1761 (June 27, 1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Appellants contend that the enactment in 1965 of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500, eliminating federal agency practice <em>admission </em>requirements, demonstrates the intent of Congress to strip the SEC of any authority to discipline professionals practicing before it. The stated purpose of the section was quite to the contrary. It was intended to ensure that persons appearing before the agencies <em>be represented by attorneys of their choice. </em>H.R.Rep.No.l 141, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>[1965] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4170, 4171. Moreover, the statute explicitly provides in \u00a7 500(d)(2) that the section <em>\u201cdoes not </em>authorize or limit the discipline, including disbarment, of individuals who appear in a representative capacity before an agency. . . . \u201d (emphasis added). We find nothing in this language to support appellants\u2019 contentions. The language, as appellants acknowledge, is \u201cneutral\u201d. It neither authorizes nor limits the power of the agencies to discipline professionals who appear or practice before them; that was not the purpose of the section. And there certainly is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to limit disciplinary proceedings to those agencies with specific statutory authorization to do so. <em>See, e. g.. </em>Ill Cong.Rec. 27193 (Oct. 18, 1965); S.Rep.No.755, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>[1965] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4170.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">.

Relying on <em>WaUach </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>202 F.2d 462 (D.C. Cir. 1953), and, more generally, the recent decision in <em>SEC v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103 (1978), appellants contend that, unless Congress expressly authorizes an agency to exercise disciplinary powers, the implication of such powers is contrary to the statutory scheme. The question in <em>WaUach </em>involved the extent to which former \u00a7 15(b)(4) of the 1934 Act could be used by the Commission to discipline nonregistered salesmen of a registered broker-dealer. The section expressly authorized the SEC to revoke or suspend the registration of any broker or dealer who had been found to have committed violations. In <em>Wal-lach, </em>however, the Commission had attempted to extend the rule to persons other than those specifically encompassed by the section. The Court held that the action was in plain violation of the statutory language and in excess of the limited authority granted therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"><em>Sloan </em>involved a challenge to the Commission\u2019s authority pursuant to \u00a7 12(k) of the 1934 Act, to \u201ctack\u201d 10 day summary orders suspending the trading of shares beyond the initial 10 day period. The Court held that \u00a7 12(k) should not be read any more broadly than its language and the statutory scheme permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">These two decisions are distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>WaUach </em>the Commission relied on an express statutory section as a predicate for its attempted authority to discipline nonregistered salesmen. Here, however, the Commission relies on its general rulemak-ing authority. Thus, while the Commission\u2019s action in <em>WaUach </em>was contrary to an express limitation in the statute, here the rule neither violates, nor is inconsistent with, any statutory provision. Moreover, an examination of the purposes of the securities laws indicates that, unlike the provision challenged in <em>Sloan, </em>Rule 2(e) is consistent with the entire statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\">.

Touche Ross chose to remain loyal to its retired partners and to challenge Rule 2(e) in a broadside attack on the right of the Commission to discipline <em>anyone. </em>Our opinion today rejects this sally. Nothing in the complaint, or the district court proceedings, or the briefs and oral argument before us purports to raise the question of the extent to which the Commission has the power, in a disciplinary action, to hold Touche Ross and its 525 partners vicariously liable to the extent of permanent revocation of the right to practice for the acts of its erstwhile partners. It may be argued, for example, that the Commission may not proceed against Touche Ross on a theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>without first establishing that Congress has delegated such authority and that the Commission has, through a rulemaking proceeding, set standards for such an adjudication, including a definition of \u201cwillful conduct\u201d by organizations. <em>See generally Fuller, The Forms and Limits of Adjudication, </em>92 Harv.L.Rev. 353, 373 (1978). We express no view on this question, but it is one that the Commission might want to consider. In any event, since it is far from clear that the Commission will In fact determine to discipline Touche Ross, and since the question was <em>not </em>raised before the Commission or this court, the resolution of such issues should await the conclusion of the administrative process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b676-10\">IRVING R.

SEC, </em>547 F.2d 171, 183-85 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1009, 98 S.Ct. 719, 54 L.Ed.2d 752 (1978). And it follows naturally that if sanctions are unjustifiably extensive in scope \u2014 e. <em>g., </em>embracing every partner despite the isolated transgressions of a few \u2014 the corrective process of judicial review may be called into play.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Our opinion today affirms the ability of the SEC to ensure that the professionals who practice before it \u2014 on whose probity the viability of the regulatory process depends \u2014 meet the highest ethical standards. The assertion of that authority is consistent with the underlying purposes of the securities laws, and manifests the wisdom of the congressional decision to vest wide rulemak-ing authority in the Commission. But in recognition that any power may be misused, dispassionate panels of Article III judges stand ready to correct the occasional excesses and errors that are an inevitable part of the administrative process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">. I do not, of course, intend to intimate any views concerning the merits of the case before us; indeed, on the record we have, it would be impossible to hazard so much as a guess.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
