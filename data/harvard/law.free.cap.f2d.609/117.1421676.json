(taxpayer).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to the filing of taxpayer\u2019s petition in bankruptcy, the IRS assessed a deficiency and demanded payment. Apparently recognizing that the pre-petition assessment and demand, without more, perfected a lien in favor of the IRS, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6321; <em>United States v. Speers, </em>382 U.S. 266, 86 S.Ct. 411,15 L.Ed.2d 314 (1965), the district court nonetheless held that the lien was invalid as against the bankruptcy trustee because the IRS had failed to file notice of its tax lien in the proper place. I.R.C. \u00a7 6323(f)(l)(A)(ii). Respondent practically concedes that this holding was error. The notice was properly filed with the Clerk of the Florida Circuit Court as required by Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 28.222(3)(e) (West 1974). The district court\u2019s decision was founded on an erroneous reference to the statutory provisions governing security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code, which have no applicability to federal tax liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-22\">The judgment of the district court is reversed with directions to enter judgment treating the claim of the United States for withholding of income taxes and FICA taxes as a perfected secured claim in bankruptcy-</p>\n<p id=\"b211-23\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-19\">. Before both the bankruptcy and district courts, the IRS also attempted to prove the existence of a levy upon certain of the bankrupt\u2019s accounts receivable, <em>cf. United States v. Eiland, </em>223 F.2d 118 (4th Cir. 1955), in addition to proving a lien under I.R.C. \u00a7 6321. The IRS does not appeal from the district court\u2019s adverse resolution of the levy issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
