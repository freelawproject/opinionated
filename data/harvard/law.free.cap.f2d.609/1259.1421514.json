The relative priority of that lien and a federal tax lien, upon which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has levied, depends on the resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-21\">State law governs the vast majority of conflicts between lienholders competing for the same property. However, when one of the competitors, as here, is the United States Government holding a lien for unpaid taxes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> federal law governs. <em>United States v. Pioneer American Insurance Co., </em>374 U.S. 84, 83 S.Ct. 1651, 10 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); <em>United States v. City of New Britain, </em>347 U.S. 81, 74 S.Ct. 367, 98 L.Ed. 520 (1954); <em>Avco Delta Corporation Canada Ltd. v. United States, </em>484 F.2d 692 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 931, 94 S.Ct. 1444, 39 L.Ed.2d 490 (1974). Specifically, the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6321-6326 (1976), outlines the rights of private creditors with respect to a federal tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Although the Act generally conforms to the notion that a lien first in time is first in right, a plethora of particularized rules govern the determination of priorities and consequently the resolution of this case. <em>See generally </em>Overman, <em>Federal Tax Liens: A Guide to the Priority System of Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code, </em>16 B.C. Indus. &amp; Com.L.Rev. 729 (1975). Our analysis begins with the rule that a federal tax lien arises \u201cat the time the assessment is made.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6322 (1976). That the Government might not file notice until some future date, if at all, does not affect the immediate attachment of a tax lien when liability is admitted or assessed. Seemingly unencumbered property may therefore in fact be subject to a \u201csecret\u201d tax lien, which remains undisclosed until the Government files notice. The resulting uncertainty for those engaged in secured credit transactions is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">Subsection (a) of section 6323 provides a measure of protection for the holders of certain interests. Notwithstanding the attachment of a tax lien upon assessment, this subsection provides that purchasers, holders of security interests, mechanics lienors, and judgment lien creditors will prevail if their interest attaches before the Government files appropriate notice. Attachment occurs at the moment the interest becomes choate, which is a question of federal law. <em>Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. United States, </em>466 F.2d 1040, 1051 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 1367, 35 L.Ed.2d 591 (1973). If \u201cthe identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established\u201d before the Government files notice, those falling within the statutory class will prevail over a prior-tax lien. 347 U.S. at 84, 74 S.Ct. at 369; <em>see </em>Plumb, Federal Tax Liens 149-50 (3d ed. 1972 &amp; Supp.1974). Consequently, when a complete record search does not disclose a tax lien, holders of the interests listed above can rest assured that as of that date their interest, if choate, is not compromised by a prior tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Subsection (c) recognizes that some regular business transactions require the holders of the interests enumerated in subsection (a) to take inchoate liens on secured property. For example, a common way to secure a line of credit is to use one\u2019s accounts receivable as collateral. Such a loan may be secured by the outstanding balances in the debtor\u2019s accounts receivable at the time the loan is made and by further balances as they become due. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.1708, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1966] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 3722, 3729. Since a subsequently arising balance is not in existence at the time the loan is made, the resulting lien remains inchoate until the underlying debt becomes due. Similarly, the further advancement of funds on the same secured line of credit does not give rise to a choate lien until the funds are actually advanced and the amount of the lien can be established. In both instances, the resulting lien remains unprotected by subsection (a) until it becomes choate and therefore would be subject to a tax lien filed in the interim. A lender seeking assurances that his loans are secured by accounts receivable that are not subject to prior tax liens would have to examine the records each time the underlying debts change or he makes further advances secured by the same accounts receivable \u2014 a task most lenders are unable or unwilling to undertake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">\u201c[T]o keep this obligation within practical bounds,\u201d <em>id., </em>Congress provided in subsection (c) for relief in certain very narrow circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-10\">(c) Protection for certain commercial transactions financing agreements, etc.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQx\">(1) In general. \u2014 To the extent provided in this subsection, even though notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 has been filed, such lien shall not be valid with respect to a security interest which came into existence after tax lien filing but which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>(A) is in qualified property covered by the terms of a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing and constituting\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-4\">(i) a commercial transactions financing agreement,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-5\">(ii) a real property construction or improvement financing agreement, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-6\">(iii) an obligatory disbursement agreement, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-7\">(B) is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(c)(1) (1976). Congress, however, limited the relief provided therein to loans extended within forty-five days of the filing of notice or, if earlier, when the lender has actual notice of the filing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6323(c)(2)(A). With the enactment of subsection (c), lenders engaging in accounts receivable financing and similar transactions that meet the statutory requirements need only perform a records search every forty-five days to be assured that the accounts receivable on which they hold a lien are unencumbered by a prior tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">Since the priority accorded security interests that arise from the enumerated transactions abrogates the \u201cfirst in time\u201d rule, the requirements of subsection (e) are exceedingly strict. The plaintiff-appellee, Sgro, nevertheless contends his lien arose from a prior \u201ccommercial transactions financing agreement\u201d and therefore has priority regardless of when it became choate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To prevail, Sgro must show that he took his lien pursuant to an agreement that meets the Code\u2019s strict requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-11\">(2) Commercial transactions financing agreement.- \u2014 For purposes of this subsection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-15\">(A) Definition. \u2014 The term \u201ccommercial transactions financing agreement\u201d means an agreement (entered into by a person in the course of his trade or business)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-16\">(i) to make loans to the taxpayer to be secured by commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-17\">(ii) to purchase commercial financing security (other than inventory) acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-18\">but such an agreement shall be treated as coming within the term only to the extent that such loan or purchase is made before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing or (if earlier) before the lender or purchaser had actual notice or knowledge of such tax lien filing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-19\"><em>Id. </em>Judge Ackerman, in an order dated December 19,1978, found that \u201cthe security agreement and financing statement here fall within the ambit of this section.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court accordingly entered judgment for Sgro in the amount of $15,071.04, which represents the product of Government levies on the taxpayer\u2019s accounts receivable and a seizure of funds from its cash register and safe. The Government appeals from that judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-20\">Until July 1, 1975, Sgro was the sole shareholder of Sgro Construction, Inc. (the Corporation). On that date, Sgro sold his interest in the Corporation to a syndicate of three purchasers in exchange for a cash payment of $25,000 and a $400,000 note executed jointly by the purchasers and the Corporation. To secure payment of the note, the same parties entered into a security agreement naming as collateral the assets of the Corporation including its accounts receivable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the following day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>Sgro perfected his lien by filing an appropriate financing statement with the Illinois Secretary of State and the Sangamon County Recorder of Deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">On January 15,1976, the IRS assessed the Corporation $22,231.21 for unpaid employment and withholding taxes. On February 2,1976, the IRS filed, notice of a tax lien for the unpaid balance, $18,460.54, and promptly served notices of levy upon various businesses whose accounts contained outstanding balances owed to the Corporation. After recovering $10,429.27 on these levies, IRS agents, on February 6, 1976, seized the contents of the Corporation\u2019s cash register and safe, which together yielded $4,641.77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">When the syndicate defaulted in its payments on the note, Sgro took possession of the Corporation\u2019s tangible assets and instituted appropriate foreclosure proceedings. At those proceedings <em>(Sgro I </em>),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Ack-erman entered summary judgment in favor of Sgro and against the United States on the ground that Sgro perfected his security interest in the tangible assets before the IRS filed notice of its tax lien. The Government did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">Sgro then brought suit under section 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426 (1976),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to recover the product of the Government\u2019s levies on the Corporation\u2019s account debtors and the seizure from its cash register and safe pursuant to the same tax lien at issue in <em>Sgro I. </em>The parties stipulated to the <em>Sgro I </em>finding that the July 1, 1975 security agreement between Sgro, the purchasers, and the Corporation gave rise to a security interest in the Corporation\u2019s assets that is valid under Illinois law. In addition, their arguments indicate they are in substantial agreement that the applicable law is accurately represented by the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-13\">However \u201ccomplete\u201d a lender\u2019s perfection may be under state recording laws and however \u201cspecific\u201d state law might deem that interest to be, it is federal law that determines the extent to which that state determination will protect a private lien from a federal tax lien. It appears clear from the case law that an account receivable not yet \u201cacquired\u201d at the time of the filing of a tax lien because the final transaction creating the account receivable was not yet in existence cannot be considered choate, save for those accounts receivable now protected by Section 6323(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-14\"><em>Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. United States, </em>466 F.2d at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-15\">As one would expect, where the parties agree on the facts and the law, they are likely to disagree on the application of the latter to the former. Such is the case here. The Government contends that under federal law its lien is superior unless Sgro can establish that the accounts receivable were due and owing to the Corporation and the funds seized from its safe were in its possession before February 2,1976, the date on which the Government filed notice of its tax lien. Sgro concedes that the proceeds of the levies and seizure did not meet these requirements and that his lien was therefore inchoate under federal law on that date. He argues, however, that the security agreement falls within the statutory exception to the choateness requirement for \u201ccommercial transactions financing agreements,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(c)(l)(A)(i) (1976), and that he therefore is entitled to judgment in his favor because the account debts became due and the seized funds came into the Corporation\u2019s possession within forty-five days of the tax lien filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>Subsection (c)(2)(A), which defines a \u201ccommercial transactions financing agreement,\u201d contains the prerequisites to the applicability of subsection (c)(l)(A)(i). First, the agreement must have been \u201centered into by a person in the course of his trade or business . . . And second, the agreement must be one providing for the extension of loans \u201cto the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6323(c)(2)(A)(i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">Nothing in the record suggests that Sgro was engaged in any activity that qualified as a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for tax purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the picture it paints is the simple one of an investor selling his stock in a close corporation. It is well-settled that one\u2019s personal investment activities are not a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>373 U.S. 193, 83 S.Ct. 1168, 10 L.Ed.2d 288 (1963); <em>Higgins v. Commissioner, </em>312 U.S. 212, 61 S.Ct. 475, 85 L.Ed. 783 (1941); <em>United States v. Trigg, </em>465 F.2d 1264 (8th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 963, 35 L.Ed.2d 270 (1973). Even assuming for the moment that Sgro\u2019s management of the corporation was a \u201ctrade or business,\u201d the sale of his stock marked his <em>exit </em>from that position. Accordingly, the security agreement was not entered \u201cin the course\u201d of his management of the Corporation. Had Sgro\u2019s dominant motivation for taking the note been to protect his employment with the Corporation, we might have reached a different result on this issue. <em>Cf. United States v. Generes, </em>405 U.S. 93, 92 S.Ct. 827, 31 L.Ed.2d 62 (1972); <em>Niblock v. Commissioner, </em>417 F.2d 1185 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that the July 1, 1975 security agreement was a \u201ccommercial transactions financing agreement\u201d reads out of the statute the requirement that such an agreement be entered in the course of the secured party\u2019s \u201ctrade or business.\u201d In <em>Bjork v. United States, </em>486 F.2d 934, 937 n.3 (7th Cir. 1973), this court recognized that satisfaction of the parallel requirement of subsection (c)(4) is a prerequisite to according the same priority to an \u201cobligatory disbursement agreement.\u201d We see no reason to treat the \u201ctrade or business\u201d requirement in subsection (c)(2) differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-12\">Alternatively, we hold that the agreement securing payment of the purchase price for Sgro\u2019s stock in the Corporation is not an agreement \u201cto make loans to the taxpayer\u201d within the meaning of subsection (c)(2)(A)(i). Rather, the agreement merely grants Sgro an interest securing the note that the purchasers of the stock executed jointly with the Corporation. Even if we were to read the purchase agreement and the security agreement conjunctively as a single agreement \u201cto make loans\u201d secured by the Corporation\u2019s assets \u2014 an issue we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>reserve \u2014 it would still fall beyond the scope of subsection (c)(2)(A)(i). Construing the agreement in this way, it is clear that the \u201cloan\u201d was extended not \u201cto the taxpayer,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the Corporation, but instead to the purchasers of Sgro\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">The result we reach is consistent with the role Congress intended section 6323(c) to play in the statutory scheme of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6321-6326 (1976). Its purpose in part is to give \u201can inventory or accounts receivable, etc., financier assurance that his loans or purchases are not inferior to some recently filed tax lien as long as he searches the records at least once every 45 days.\u201d S.Rep.No.1708, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1966] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 3722, 3729. Because subsection (c)(2) abrogates the general rule of first in time, first in right, Congress narrowly defined its applicability to a specific problem posed by the exigencies of commerce. It chose not to extend protection to those whose engagement in the enumerated transactions is not incident to their \u201ctrade or business\u201d and to those who extend loans to debtors other than the taxpayer. We are powerless to rewrite the clear words of the statute even if we thought it desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">In light of the foregoing, the Government\u2019s tax lien held priority on the accounts receivable and the funds contained in the cash register and safe. The levies and seizure therefore did not compromise Sgro\u2019s rights. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1354-12\">. Section 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321 (1976), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-13\">If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1356-12\">.

The Corporation\u2019s assets consisted principally of the accounts receivable, fixtures, inventory, and equipment of the St. Nicholas Hotel in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, Sgro took a security interest in the shares of stock sold to the syndicate and in a land trust. The latter two items, however, are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">. <em>Sam P.

Such action may be brought without regard to whether such property has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary or his delegate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">. In addition, subsection (c)(2)(A)(i) applies only when such loans are \u201cto be secured by commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business.\u201d Although this requirement is not at issue, we note that subsection (c)(2)(C) includes accounts receivable within its definition of \u201ccommercial financing security.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-7\">Sgro does not contend on appeal that the transactions were entered pursuant to an agreement \u201cto purchase commercial financing security (other than inventory) acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business. . . .\u201d26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(c)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-8\">(2)(A)(ii) (1976). Nevertheless, our resolution of the question whether the transaction satisfied the \u201ctrade or business\u201d requirement of subsection (c)(2)(A)(i) would be dis-positive of an attempt to invoke the protection of subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1358-9\">. Sgro\u2019s sole contention on this issue is that since the Government did not so argue in the trial court, it is foreclosed from raising the issue on appeal. We disagree. At trial, the Government argued that the July 1, 1975 security agreement did not qualify as a \u201ccommercial transactions financing agreement.\u201d In so arguing, it focused on the failure to meet the statutory requirement that the agreement be \u201cto make loans to the taxpayer.\u201d In this court, the Government now adds the failure to satisfy the \u201ctrade or business\u201d requirement to its argument that the statute is inapplicable on its face and, in doing so, relies on the same factual record. We are cognizant of the general rule forbidding an appellant from raising new issues on appeal. However, we retain discretion to hear new grounds supporting the facial inapplicability of a statute provided further factual findings are not needed. See <em>Commissioner v.
