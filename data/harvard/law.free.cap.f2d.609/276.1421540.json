Nine of the counts were dismissed by the District Judge on defendant\u2019s motions for acquittal, and the jury found appellant guilty on Count 12 only, involving embezzlement of $332.80 from the union\u2019s Health and Welfare Fund. This issue is the sole subject of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-25\">The facts show that Felice had purchased a woman\u2019s ring while in Hawaii at a Teamsters Union Conference, and had paid for it by charging it on his American Express card. The American Express bill was mailed to his union office and the union bookkeeper paid it from union funds, according to her testimony, at a time when she was unable to ask Felice about it. This expenditure was, however, approved at an executive board meeting of the Local while Felice was presiding. Defendant\u2019s basic argument is that American Express had made a mistake by listing the place of purchase as \u201cLa Galleria Original\u201d rather than \u201cPex of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Hawaii,\u201d and that the bookkeeper had made a mistake in paying it by union check. Appellant also claims that he was deprived of a proper charge reflecting his mistake defense when the District Judge did not submit the charge on that subject which his counsel had submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In answer to all of the above the government argues that the evidence shows defendant\u2019s personal participation in approving payment by the union\u2019s Health and Welfare Fund of the ring purchase, and that the District Judge gave strong instructions on the government\u2019s burden for proving beyond reasonable doubt \u201cthat Mr. Felice had a fraudulent intent to deprive the union of its funds\u201d and \u201cto act with intent to defraud means to act willfully and with specific intent to deceive or cheat\u201d and that \u201che did so with fraudulent intent to deprive the union\u2019s Health and Welfare Fund of its funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On review of this record we find that the charge taken as a whole was ample to protect defendant against conviction for any reason other than intentional fraud, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
