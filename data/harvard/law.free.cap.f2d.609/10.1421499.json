GORDON.</p>\n<author id=\"b105-12\">JAMES F. GORDON, Senior District Judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">This matter reaches us upon dismissal by the District Court, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, of appellants\u2019 challenge of the constitutionality of a regulation (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 733.124 (1979)) promulgated by the Civil Service Commission under its authority to implement the Hatch Political Activity Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7324, <em>et seq. </em>(1967 &amp; Supp. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">The regulation under scrutiny finds its genesis in 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7327(b) (1967) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-18\">The Civil Service Commission may prescribe regulations permitting employees and individuals to whom section 7324 of this title applies to take an active part in political management and political campaigns involving the municipality or other political subdivision in which they reside, to the extent the Commission considers it to be in their domestic interest, when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-19\">(1) the municipality or political subdivision is in Maryland or Virginia and in the immediate vicinity of the District of Columbia, or is a municipality <em>in which the majority of voters are employed by the Government of the United States; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-20\">(2) the Commission determines that because of special or unusual circumstances which exist in the municipality or political subdivision it is in the domestic interest of the employees and individuals to permit that political participation, (emphasis ours).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-21\">Acting pursuant to such authority, the Civil Service Commission promulgated and issued the challenged regulation which is identical to regulations issued with respect to a number of other federally impacted areas in the United States. In pertinent part, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 733.124(a) (1979) provides that the Hatch Act proscriptions do</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">not prohibit activity in political management or in a political campaign by an employee in connection with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-22\">(1) A nonpartisan election, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-23\">(2) Subject to the conditions and limitations established by the Commission, an election held in a municipality or political subdivision designated by the Commission under paragraph (b) of this section.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>On the content of the record before us we are unable to address appellants\u2019 assertions of unconstitutionality for nowhere do we find factual establishment in the District Court that \u201cthe majority of voters are employed by the Government of the United States,\u201d and this determination is essential to the Commission\u2019s power to regulate, as its actions must be based upon the second alternative of subsection 7327(b)(1). See, <em>Joseph v. United States Civil Ser. Comm\u2019n, </em>554 F.2d 1140, 1155, 1157 (D.C.Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therein lies the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Though we recognize the parties here agree among themselves that this \u201cmajority of voters\u201d requirement in fact is met and exists, absent some authoritative statistical factual establishment, we are confronted with the not yet faced problem of possible lack of the Commission\u2019s basic authority\u2014 or, to put it another way, we could be countenancing regulation by agreement of these particular litigants rather than requiring regulation only if justified by the statutory standard. We refuse to assume the risk of that possibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Accordingly, we remand this action to the District Court for the necessary inquiry and its resolution of this threshold uncertainty. We also direct the District Court\u2019s attention to the question of the legitimacy of the Commission\u2019s assertion to us during oral argument that <em>family members </em>of employees of the United States may be counted in achieving the \u201cmajority\u201d mandated by 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7327(b)(1) (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">Remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-14\">. James F. Gordon, Senior United States District Judge, Western District of Kentucky, sitting by designation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 294(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-24\">. Paragraph (b) lists a number of municipalities, primarily in the Washington metropolitan area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\">. Judge Tamm speaking for the Court said, \u201cIf the Civil Service Commission does have power . , it must be on the basis of the second alternative of subsection 7327(b)(1) that the District \u2018is a municipality in which the majority of voters are employed by the Government of the United States. . . \u2019 \u201d 554 F.2d at 1155, and further at page 1157 said, \u201c[w]e could not uphold a claim of Commission authority to act under subsection 7327(b)(1) based on the tenuous statistical evidence presented in this case. . . . The fact that a majority of voters in an area are employed by the Government must be established by more satisfactory statistical proof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b106-10\">. That there is a real possibility that the required \u201cmajority of voters . . employed by the Government of the United States\u201d does not exist is shown by the absence of reliable figures in the record. It was asserted at oral argument that there are 269,000 registered voters and 135,000 U.S. Government employees. Appellees\u2019 brief also states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-24\">We have been informed by the Merit Systems Protection Board, however, that more reliable statistical evidence was also used [than in the <em>Joseph </em>case], including a published statistical survey in the Washington <em>Star-News, </em>March 18-20, 1974, which was studied by the CSC and found to be 95% reliable. (Appel-lees\u2019 Brief p. 13.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-25\">At first blush this does not appear to be a sufficiently reliable basis for asserting the claimed authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-26\">How many of the employees are also voters is not shown, but it is apparent even on the claims of the parties that almost every employee needs to be a voter for the statutory majority to be reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
