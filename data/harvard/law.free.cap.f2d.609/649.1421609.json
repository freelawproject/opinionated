She filed for Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(c), 423 &amp; 1381a, and after denial of her request, her applications were reviewed by an Administrative Law Judge. Physicians\u2019 reports introduced in evidence noted a continuous improvement in Mrs. Gullo\u2019s condition, although all agreed that she could not return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-22\">The Administrative Law Judge reserved decision and ordered Mrs. Gullo to submit to an examination by an orthopedist, Dr. Irwin Miller. After Dr. Miller submitted a report concluding that Mrs. Gullo was capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>limited work activity, the Judge denied her claim, finding her not \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d) or 1382c. The claimant was never given an opportunity to examine or challenge Dr. Miller\u2019s report prior to the decision denying her claim. Both the HEW Appeals Council and the District Court below affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Social Security claimants must receive \u201ca reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1441, and, if a hearing is held, the Secretary\u2019s decision must be based upon evidence adduced at the hearing, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405. Nonetheless, physician\u2019s reports despite their hearsay character are generally admissible if submitted prior to the administrative hearing, <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). The Secretary\u2019s reliance upon such reports, however, has been held to invalidate a decision denying benefits where the claimant was afforded no opportunity to subpoena and cross-examine the declarant. <em>Lonzollo v. Weinberger, </em>534 F.2d 712 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.926. The procedures utilized in the case at bar denied the claimant any opportunity to rebut Dr. Miller\u2019s report, and, since the hearing judge\u2019s substantial reliance upon the Miller report is clear, due process has been denied. Consequently, we view with some alarm the Secretary\u2019s confident assertion that \u201cit is not uncommon for the ALJ to receive reports subsequent to the administrative hearing,\u201d especially if such unchallenged submissions supply the basis for decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\">. Mrs. Gullo\u2019s claim that she had a right to a homebound hearing before the Administrative Law Judge is premature since she failed to make a timely request that the Secretary provide such a hearing. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.923.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
