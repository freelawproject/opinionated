East, Senior Uniti sitting by designation. States District Judge for the District of Oregon,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1023-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1023-26\">Progressive Pharmaceutical Systems, Inc., appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming a bankruptcy judge\u2019s determination that a judgment lien obtained by Progressive on the assets of Western Adams Hospital Corporation (Western Adams) was null and void because obtained within four months of Western Adams\u2019 bankruptcy at a time when Western Adams was insolvent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-27\">Progressive contends that the bankruptcy judge failed to make a fair valuation of Western Adams\u2019 assets in determining that the corporation was insolvent at the time the lien attached. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1(19), 107(a) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Because Western Adams was an operating entity on the date the lien attached, the bankruptcy judge correctly valued its assets as those of a \u201cgoing concern\u201d, determining their value not as isolated articles but as parts of the whole and useful in the operation of the corporation. <em>Edward R. Bacon Co. v. Grover, </em>420 F.2d 678, 679 (9th Cir. 1970). <em>See In re Nathanson Brothers Co., </em>64 F.2d 912, 913 (6th Cir. 1933); 1 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 1.19[3] at 121 (14th ed. 1974). The judge was presented with conflicting expert testimony with respect to the proper value and made a reasonable determination under the appropriate standard. The judge found that the debts of the corporation substantially outweighed its assets and that it was insolvent on the relevant date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">This finding, affirmed by the district court, had ample support in the record and is more than sufficient to withstand review under Bankruptcy Rule 810 and Fed.R. Civ.P. 52. <em>In re Houtman, </em>568 F.2d 651, 653 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
