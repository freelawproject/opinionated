They brought this Texas action for libel and invasion of privacy after appellees distributed news reports that stated appellants were ordered by a Washington state court to make restitutions to consumers that \u201ccould total\u201d up to $700,-000. The district court granted summary judgment for appellees on both claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-27\">In 1974 appellants consented to entry of a judgment against them in the state of Washington. The judgment provided, in essential part, that appellants had engaged in unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>of Washington law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that they would restore all money obtained by deception, either by settling consumers\u2019 claims or by referring unsettled or rejected claims to specially appointed masters. One of appel-lees\u2019 reporters questioned a member of the Washington Attorney General\u2019s office about the claims, and was told that known claims averaged $500 each and that appellants would be required to mail 1,400 letters to consumers advising them of their right to press a claim. Multiplying 1,400 by $500, the reporter stated in the challenged news reports that appellants\u2019 liability \u201ccould total\u201d $700,000 to 1,400 customers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The reports constitute substantially accurate accounts of the Washington judgment and the reporter\u2019s conversation with the Attorney General\u2019s office. A statement that is substantially true is not defamatory. <em>Gulf Construction Co. v. Mott, </em>442 S.W.2d 778, 784 (Tex.Civ.App.1969). There was also no invasion of privacy in the accurate reporting of a newsworthy event, as it does not fall within one of the four well-recognized categories of the tort. <em>See Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., </em>433 U.S. 562, 571 n.7, 97 S.Ct. 2849, 2855, 53 L.Ed.2d 965, 973-74 n.7 (1977); Warren &amp; Brandeis, <em>The Right to Privacy, </em>4 Harv.L.Rev. 193 (1890). Since the news report is, therefore, not actionable, we need decide no other questions raised by appellants. <em>Southard v. Forbes, </em>588 F.2d 140, 145 n.9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 62, 62 L.Ed.2d 41 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-9\">. Appellant\u2019s illegal practices consisted primarily of \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-10\">. The relevant portions of the reports read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-11\">Freezer beef firms in five Washington cities were ordered Tuesday to make restitutions for \u201cbait and switch\u201d advertising that could total $700,000 to 1,400 customers, the attorney general\u2019s office said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-24\">A spokesman for the Consumer Protection Division said the customer list involved 1,400 names and an average purchase of $500.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
