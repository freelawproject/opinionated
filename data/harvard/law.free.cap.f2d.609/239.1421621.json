Ala., 1979, 375 So.2d 251. The Court ruled: (1) that the conveyance of title to returned goods to an accounts receivable purchaser results simply in the retention of a security interest in favor of that purchaser, and (2) that the Uniform Commercial Code provision governing the priority dispute involved in the case is \u00a7 7-9-312(5), not \u00a7 7-9-306(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">The Government concedes \u2014 as it must\u2014 and then only after a dying gasp that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s holding \u201cflies in the face of\u201d \u00a7 7-9-306(5) and is clearly wrong \u2014 that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s rulings demonstrate that Citizens and Southern Factors\u2019 motion for summary judgment should have been granted by the District Court. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions that judgment be entered in favor of Citizens and Southern Factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">REVERSED and REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-35\">.
