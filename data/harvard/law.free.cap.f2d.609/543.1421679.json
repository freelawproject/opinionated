GORDON, District Judge:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b638-19\">This case involves a ruling by the respondent, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (hereinafter FERC), that the sale of natural gas from the intervenor, the Cities Service Gas Co., to the Army with a portion of that gas then being conveyed to Defense Family Housing (hereinafter DFH) is not a \u201csale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption\u201d within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717 <em>et seq. </em>(1976 &amp; Supp. 1979), and therefore not within the rate jurisdiction of the FERC. DFH houses army personnel on the Ft. Leavenworth Army base. The petitioner, the Secretary of the Army, has appealed this decision to this Court which has jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r(b) (1976). Cities Service has been a party to this action since its intervention at the time of the Secretary\u2019s application for rate jurisdiction in March of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-20\">There are three issues which have been presented by the counsel for the petitioner: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(1) Whether this transaction is a \u201csale for resale\u201d for purposes of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717(b) (1976); (2) Whether the gas sold by Cities Service to the Army is subject to the FERC\u2019s rate jurisdiction under the comin-gling doctrine, and; (3) Whether the FERC decision resulted in discrimination against the Army. At the oral argument, counsel for petitioner conceded that their entire case would fall or stand by the resolution of the first issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons, the decision of the FERC is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Since 1963, the Army has been trying to bring the natural gas sold to it by Cities Service for its Fort Leavenworth facilities within the rate jurisdiction of the FERC (formerly the Federal Power Commission, hereinafter FPC). In September of that year during a general rate proceeding for Cities Service, the Army filed a petition with the FPC claiming that all the natural gas sold to it by Cities were \u201csales for resale\u201d and subject to the FPC\u2019s rate jurisdiction. On February 24, 1964, the FPC severed this issue from the general rate proceeding and instituted a separate proceeding to determine this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In 1966, the FPC issued Opinion No. 489, 35 FPC 571 (1966) (TR. 160-65). The FPC found that of all the gas sold to the Army, only 6.7% of it was actually \u201cresold\u201d for jurisdictional purposes, this amount going to small commercial users at Ft. Leavenworth. However, the FPC could find no basis for concluding that it should extend the jurisdictional rate for this small amount to the rest of the gas sold to the Army. The FPC generally characterized this sale as a sale to the Army for its direct use. It based this decision on the fact that the Army had not previously sought authorization from the FPC for jurisdictional rates, as well as previous case law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the long history of Cities Service selling this gas to the Army with both parties considering this to be a nonjurisdictional direct sale. The FPC, however, did not attempt to enter a definitive ruling on this matter, and left the parties to negotiate an agreement over its findings. The FPC also stated that should these negotiations not be fruitful, the Army would be authorized to file an application pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Act for a ruling to require Cities Service to provide all or part of the gas at jurisdictional rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">The parties did attempt negotiations, but, alas, impasse. After giving the required notice, Cities Service terminated its contract with the Army in March, 1971, but it has continued since to supply the Ft. Leavenworth facility with natural gas. The parties could not agree as to the proper compensation to be paid Cities Service for the gas sold, the Army allegedly paying only jurisdictional rates. In 1973, Cities Service filed suit in the United States Court of Claims against the United States on an alleged implied-in-fact contract to recover on a quantum meruit basis compensation for the sale of gas to the Ft. Leavenworth facilities. <em>Cities Service Gas Co. v. United States, </em>205 Ct.Cl. 16, 500 F.2d 448 (1974). Pursuant to a court order entered in that case on March 1, 1974, the Army filed an application under \u00a7 7(a) of the Act for a determination on whether the gas sold by Cities Service was within the jurisdiction of the FPC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>A hearing before an administrative law judge (hereinafter ALJ) was held on January 20,1975, to determine the merits of the Army\u2019s application. On June 10, 1977, the ALJ issued a decision denying the Army\u2019s application. The ALJ found that of the total volume of gas sold, only 4.34% of the gas was actually a sale in interstate commerce for resale under \u00a7 717(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Of the remainder, 52.13% was a direct nonjurisdic-tional sale to the Army, this not being in dispute among the parties. What was in dispute was the remaining 43.53% which the Army delivered to DFH. The Army contended that this was a resale for purposes under the Act, but the ALJ determined that this was not a resale but merely an \u201cinterdepartmental transaction\u201d within the Army for its own use. (TR. 200-17).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The Army appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision, and on January 26, 1978, the FERC entered an opinion and order affirming the initial decision (TR. 218-23). An order denying the Army\u2019s application for a rehearing was entered on March 28, 1978 (TR. 228-29). As previously mentioned, an appeal was subsequently taken to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Whether the transfer of gas from the Army to the DFH is a resale for jurisdictional purposes or whether it is merely an interdepartmental transfer within the Army is a question of law and not of fact and so the standard of review found in 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r(b) (1976) is not controlling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The standard of review on a jurisdictional decision of the FERC is whether the decision was without an adequate basis in law. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, </em>347 U.S. 672, 678, 74 S.Ct. 794, 98 L.Ed. 1035 (1954); <em>Louisiana Land &amp; Exploration Co. v. Federal Energy Reg. Comm\u2019n., </em>574 F.2d 204, 206 (5th Cir. 1978). Another consideration for this Court is that great deference should be given to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. <em>United States v. National Ass\u2019n. of Sec. Dealers, </em>422 U.S. 694, 719, 95 S.Ct. 2427, 45 L.Ed.2d 486 (1975); <em>Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n., </em>420 U.S. 395, 410, 95 S.Ct. 1066, 43 L.Ed.2d 279 (1975); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">The Court disagrees with the petitioner\u2019s assertion that it should give weight to the opinions of the Comptroller General concerning interagency transfers. Questions on review concerning the authority of the FERC are for the Court to decide and this responsibility should not be abdicated to the Comptroller General. See, <em>Greene County Planning Bd. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n., </em>559 F.2d 1227, 1238-39 (2d Cir. 1977). Furthermore, it would be inappropriate to consider these opinions at this level in that they were not raised as an objection in the application for rehearing as is required by 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r(b) (1976). No where in the application is there a specific reference to supposed failure to follow the Comptroller\u2019s General\u2019s opinion as error to be considered on appeal, and this Court considers that it would be inappropriate to consider this issue at this time. See, <em>Feder</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>al Power Comm\u2019n. v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., </em>348 U.S. 492, 498, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583 (1955); <em>Rhode Island Consumer Council v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n., </em>164 U.S. App.D.C. 134, 504 F.2d 203, 212 (D.C.Cir. 1974); see also, <em>Vanceburg v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n., </em>187 U.S.App.D.C. 196, 571 F.2d 630, 642 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>North Carolina v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n., </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 475, 479, 533 F.2d 702, 706 (D.C.Cir.1976); <em>Indiana &amp; Mich. Elec. Co. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n., </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 502 F.2d 336, 339 (D.C.Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">In any event we do not consider that the Comptroller General\u2019s opinions run <em>contra </em>to our conclusion. It is appellant\u2019s claim that the Comptroller General\u2019s opinions interpreting Section 601 of the Economy Act of 1932, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 686 (1976)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> require courts to conclude that the instant transaction is a \u201csale for resale for ultimate public consumption\u201d because \u201cinteragency reimbursement cost recoveries are to be consistent with government-private contractor reimbursement cost recoveries.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20. However, the relevant statute and opinions are directed to assuring that the bookkeeping adjustment of the respective appropriation accounts reflect the full \u201cactual cost\u201d when goods or services are requisitioned from one agency by an order of another agency under the authority of Section 601. In such instances the statute and opinions do not operate to establish or alter the basic character of the requisitional order as an interdepartmental transaction between agencies of the United States Government. In fact, the Comptroller General in interpreting the Economy Act in 46 Comp.Gen. 73 (1966) (cited by Appellants) with respect to an interagency requisition of services, only approved the request with the proviso that \u201cthe final plans . [be] approved by the Bureau of the Budget\u201d and the suggestion that \u201cyou obtain the concurrence of the pertinent congressional committees . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76. This recognition and treatment of the various agency interests that are involved reflects the interdepartmental nature of such transactions and is not supportive of a conclusion that the characteristics of the transaction involved in this intradepartmental arrangement constitute an actual \u201csale for resale\u201d, much less \u201cfor ultimate public consumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">This Court also disagrees with the petitioner\u2019s assertion that it should give no deference to the FERC\u2019s interpretation of the contract between the Army and Cities Service. As this Court stated in <em>Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n., </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 204, 530 F.2d 1056 (D.C.Cir.1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>[Tjhere is room, in review of administrative agencies, for some deference to their views even on matters of law like the meaning of contracts, as on the meaning of statutes, where the understanding of the documents involved is enhanced by technical knowledge of industry conditions and practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In making its decision, the FERC primarily relied on the <em>Vint Hill </em>cases<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as the basis for denying the Army\u2019s 7(a) application. These cases have a fact pattern very similar to the case at bar. The Army was the sole distributor of natural gas at its Vint Hill Farms Station in Virginia, and, as here, was trying to have a large quantity of gas it alleged it resold brought within the rate jurisdiction of the FPC. DFH was a recipient of some of this gas and its method of payment or reimbursement by offsetting departmental bookkeeping entries was similar to the method used in this instance. In the initial decision made by a presiding examiner, it was held that \u201cnatural gas furnished by the Army to Defense Family Housing is not a sale for public consumption but (is) in lieu of partial housing allowances.\u201d <em>Vint Hill I, </em>39 F.P.C. at 360. On appeal, the FPC affirmed this finding, stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">The so-called \u201csales\u201d to the Defense Intelligence and to Defense Family Housing are nothing more than intra-Defense Department accounting transactions undertaken for the convenience of the military. In no traditional sense can they be considered \u201csales,\u201d certainly not jurisdictional sales to the public. In all instances where natural gas purchased by the Army is furnished to non-Army Defense facilities the Department of Defense Finance and Accounting office credits the Army\u2019s utility services appropriation account. That is the extent of the \u201csale.\u201d And, where the Army supplies natural gas to military occupants of Army housing it plainly does so in discharge of its obligation freely to supply necessary utility services. See, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4593 and Army Regulation 420-80(8)(b)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 351. The case was appealed and remanded to the Commission on different grounds. The case was again brought before a presiding examiner who made the following findings in a decision dated January 20, 1971.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">Army argues that the gas, lodging, etc., are furnished to Defense personnel in lieu of a cash allowance which military personnel would otherwise be entitled to and that the furnishing of gas therefore constitutes sales. However, Army\u2019s obligation is to furnish quarters and fuel to the military men at government expense, not to sell them such services. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4593. * * * A member of a uniformed service who is assigned to * * a housing facility under the jurisdiction of an uniformed service * * * is not entitled to a basic allowance for quarters * * sje <em>ff</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-14\">The Examiner finds and concludes that Army cannot convert its basic obligation to furnish its personnel with quarters and fuel, at Vint Hill Farms, into a sale of such services to the members of the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-15\">Defense Family Housing serves to support certain activities that fall under the cognizance of other components of the Department of Defense. Defense Family Housing is concerned with the acquisition and construction of living quarters for military personnel and their dependents living on military installations. At Army installations the Post Engineer is usually charged with the responsibility of supervising and operating such systems. Congress obviously felt that it was more efficient and desirable to incorporate into one agency under the sponsorship of the Department of Defense the entire responsibility relating to the providing of quar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ters for military personnel and their families.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">It is clear from the record in this proceeding that the rates chargeable in transactions between governmental agencies are not necessarily geared to the recoupment of the full cost expended by the government. It is further clear that a motive for profit is non-existent (sic) in these transactions. They are primarily bookkeeping in nature, i. e., geared to make certain that out-of-pocket expenses incurred by one agency on behalf of another are properly credited and accounted for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">The transactions between the agencies of the Department of Defense at Vint Hill cannot be classified as sales. The Army has the responsibility of providing the utility services to Defense Housing; however, aside from the physical aspects of the task these transactions amount to no more than a transfer of funds between appropriations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">The examiner finds no basis for treating interdepartmental transactions, wherein supplies and services are provided by one executive agency to another, as being the equivalent of bona fide sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">The Commission in its Opinion in <em>Secretary of the Army v. Atlantic Seaboard Corporation, </em>39 FPC 346, and in its order denying the Army\u2019s application for rehearing in the latter proceeding, held similarly that intra-departmental transactions between government agencies cannot be considered as being sales to the public. The court in remanding this proceeding back to the Commission did not indicate that there was any error in this categorization as made by the Commission in its aforementioned opinion. There is no evidence in this record that would warrant a change in the above findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ald-dedup-0\"><em>Vint Hill II, </em>46 F.P.C. at 571. This finding was appealed to and adopted by the FPC on August 26, 1971, <em>Id. </em>at 565-67, and was subsequently affirmed by this Court in a <em>per curiam </em>order without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We are of the opinion that the <em>Vint Hill </em>cases provide adequate <em>stare decisis </em>for which the FERC could have based its decision in this case, and that this precedent by itself would constitute the \u201cadequate basis of law\u201d needed for this Court to affirm the FERC\u2019s ruling. The Court sees nothing of substantial difference between this case and the <em>Vint Hill </em>cases that would persuade us to change or differentiate this case from that one, and so depart from the <em>ratio deci-dendi </em>of the Agency\u2019s opinion in <em>Vint Hill. </em>The Army claims that the Commission was in error for relying on <em>Vint Hill </em>insofar as it ignored Comptroller General precedent and the language of the Economy Act, but this Court has indicated, <em>supra, </em>why these arguments are not applicable to this case at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Both FERC and Cities Service allege that the <em>Vint Hill </em>cases collaterally estop the Army from litigating the issue of a possible resale to DFH in this case under the reasoning found in <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, </em>402 U.S. 313, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971); <em>see also, Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979). It is not necessary to decide this issue in that the <em>Vint Hill </em>cases, at the very least, do provide an adequate basis in law for the FERC to base their opinion and order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">The other basis for the FERC\u2019s denial of the Army\u2019s application was its examination of the transaction between DFH and the Army. The FERC concluded that this interaction was not a sale of gas but an interdepartmental transfer between sister agencies within the Department of Defense. This Court agrees with this characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">One indication that this transaction is not a sale is the different forms used by the Army when it contracts to sell utility services to a source within the private sector and when it agrees to sell such services to another government agency. Army Regulation (hereinafter AR) 420-62(2)(b) <em>requires </em>that DA Form 2099-R, entitled \u201cContract for Sale of Utility Services\u201d, be used \u201cwithout deviation for all sales to purchasers other than Government agencies and non-appropriate fund activities.\u201d DA Form 2100-R, a form entitled a \u201cMemoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>dum of Understanding for Sale of Utilities Services\u201d, is to be used \u201cwithout material deviation from all sales to other Government agencies and nonappropriated fund activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The FERC correctly characterized these documents as being \u201cvirtually identical in style, language and format\u201d and that \u201call additional discrepancies between the two documents must be considered as intentional and significant\u201d (TR. 211).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The FERC relied on key differences between these two forms to come to the conclusion that there was not a \u201csale\u201d of natural gas from the Army to DFH. It stressed the different terminology used in the sections of both forms dealing with \u201cServices Rendered\u201d and \u201cPayment\u201d. A private entity purchasing utility services from <em>the government </em>must <em>\u201cpay\u201d </em>for these services; a government agency \u201creimburses\u201d <em>the Army </em>for the services it receives. This terminology is consistent with the idea that there can be no \u201csale\u201d from the government to itself, see <em>Vint Hill II, </em>46 F.P.C. at 571, and that this transaction is in reality an interdepartmental transfer of natural gas in furtherance of the Army\u2019s duty to furnish this service to military personnel at government expense pursuant to 10 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 4593 (1959); AR 420-80(b)(l).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">These forms further differ in that the \u201cContract for Sale\u201d contains six paragraphs not found in the \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Of these missing paragraphs, the most important by its absence is the section in the \u201cContract for Sale\u201d providing for a procedure the parties can use when there is a dispute over a factual issue concerning the contract. The FERC was correct in concluding that the absence of these paragraphs indicates that the \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d is something less than a \u201cContract for Sale\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The FERC also looked to the difference in the procedures which the Army used in billing the small commercial users on Ft. Leavenworth and how it billed DFH. The record shows that the Army billed the commercial users in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">Gas will be measured by - (displacement) (orifice) meter(s) to be furnished, installed and maintained by the Purchaser. The meter(s) will be read by the Contracting Officer, or by his authorized representative, and bills will be rendered monthly to the Purchaser by the Government. All such bills will be due and payable 15 days after receipt thereof by Purchaser. (TR. 143).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">This is a typical metering and billing procedure for the sale of utility services: the Army -sells that gas, checks the purchaser\u2019s meter to see the volume consumed, bills the purchaser for its use, and the purchaser then must pay the bill within an allotted time period. Contrast this to the billing and metering procedure used in the transaction between the Army and DFH:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-13\">The usage will be estimated by the Facilities Engineer, with monthly breakout by housing category, compatible with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>accounting system. Bills will be prepared by Budget Branch of the Facilities Engineer, rendered monthly to Finance and Accounting Office as appropriation reimbursement to the credit of the appropriation or appropriations currently available for the supply of such services (TR. 150).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"avj-dedup-0\">This is not a typical billing and metering procedure. The amount billed for is arrived at by monthly estimates by the Facilities Engineer, and not through reading of gas meters. The monthly bill is not sent to the DFH who allegedly purchases the gas, but is sent to the Finance and Accounting Office. There is no payment as such by the purchaser; rather, the Finance and Accounting Office credits the account of the DFH and debits the Army\u2019s account. This is another factor which indicates that the DFH-Army transaction was an interdepartmental transfer, and not a sale in its commonly used sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The Army asks for this Court to primarily consider the <em>fact </em>of payment over the <em>manner </em>of payment. In doing so this Court would be ignoring the Army\u2019s own regulations, forms and manner of dealing. If there is no difference between the sale of gas from the Army to a commercial body and a similar sale to a government agency, why does the Army itself provide for such a differentiation? As with a sale to a commercial body, DFH did purchase gas, and gas was delivered for its use. However, in light of the regulations the different forms, and especially in light of the <em>Vint Hill </em>precedent, this Court cannot say that the FERC did not have an adequate basis in law upon which to deny the Army\u2019s application for jurisdictional rates for the gas it sold to DFH.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In summary, this Court finds that the FERC had an adequate basis in law upon which to deny the Army\u2019s \u00a7 7(a) application. Since the volume of gas sold to DFH does not come within the rate jurisdiction of the FERC, the petitioner\u2019s other arguments alleging jurisdiction under the comingling doctrine as well as discrimination against the Army fall by the wayside. Therefore, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the decision of the FERC is affirmed, and that the petitioner\u2019s appeal be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\">. James F.

The counsel for the Secretary has agreed that in order for the comingling doctrine to apply, the volume of gas transferred from the Army to DFH would have to be considered as a \u201cresale for ultimate public consumption\u201d under \u00a7 717(b). The Army concedes that the small amount of gas sold by the Army to the small commercial users on Fort Leavenworth which is an admitted jurisdictional resale is not enough in itself to make the comingling doctrine applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">.

Another persuasive point in support of this notion of interdepartmental transfer, but which was not discussed in the FERC opinion was the statutory authorization and basis for these forms. The \u201cContract for Sale\u201d form cites as its basis 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2481 (1975) which allows the Secretary of Defense to sell utility services to \u201cpurchasers within the immediate vicinity of an activity of\u2019 any of the armed services. The statutory basis for the \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d is 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 686 (1979) which allows purchase or manufacture of stores, materials or performance of services between governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The Court is aware that 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 686(c) (1976) provides that \u201c[o]rders placed as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be considered as obligations upon appropriations in the same manner as orders or contracts placed with private contractors.\u201d While this would seem to put a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d upon the same level as a \u201cContract for Sale\u201d, this matter will not be determined at this time for it was not properly brought up on appeal from the FERC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b644-15\">. In addition to the paragraph dealing with the dispute procedure, the \u201cContract for Sale\u201d contains paragraphs which absolve the federal government from liability under the contract, provide the government the right to recapture its utility facilities, prevent congressmen and resident commissioners from benefitting from such contracts, and forbid a purchaser from using an agent or agency to secure such a contract when the agent or agency does so on a commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent fee basis. The \u201cContract for Sale\u201d also contains a definitions section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b645-10\">WILKEY, Circuit Judge, concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">I concur in Judge Gordon\u2019s careful and analytical opinion primarily because the <em>Vint Hill </em>cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before the Federal Power Commission and their ultimate affirmance in this court were binding upon the agency on the decisive issue of whether the gas going from the Army to the Defense Family Housing Agency is a \u201cresale for ultimate public consumption\u201d within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act. A subsidiary supporting rationale is that the various Government entities involved have so structured and documented their transactions in a manner which makes it difficult to construe the transfer from the Army to the DFH as a \u201cresale.\u201d I add this concurring opinion to point out that the Defense Department and its components are discriminated against in comparison with other large purchasers of gas; to no one\u2019s surprise, the ultimate non-beneficiary or ultimate entity losing by these arrangements and construction of the regulations and statute is the long-suffering American taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The primary purpose of Natural Gas Act regulation is to protect the consumer. In relation to that objective, it has been recognized that where the purchaser (the Army here) from the pipeline (Cities Service) is one who performs the function of redistribution to other ultimate users, the purchaser from the pipeline is entitled to buy at a lower regulated rate because it is reselling the gas. The Army buys the gas on the basis of negotiation, but negotiation is a partial misnomer, because the Army really has no alternative source of supply to Cities Service. The Army has invested capital in the distribution facilities at Fort Leavenworth just as a municipality, privately owned public utility, or other wholesale pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>chaser would have done for ultimate redistribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The difficulty in calling the Army\u2019s sale to Defense Family Housing a \u201cresale\u201d for the purposes of the Natural Gas Act comes from the fact that the Army does not either sell directly to individual homeowners nor does it in fact sell to a truly arm\u2019s length third party or a group of third parties. The Army \u201csells\u201d to another Government agency, DFH. The DFH is not controlled by the Army; it, like the Department of the Army, is a part of the Defense Department, and functions for many more people and entities other than the Army. Like all inter-Govemmental transactions, the \u201csale\u201d by the Army to the DFH is accomplished by an entry on the books of the Government Accounting Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">It is of some significance that the obligation to furnish the gas to the household units at Fort Leavenworth is the obligation of \u201cthe United States,\u201d not the Army, because it follows from this, as counsel at oral argument for both the FERC and Cities Service were free to admit, that if the DFH were located in another Government department, HUD for example, and were not part of the Defense Department, the position of the parties would be exactly the same. The FERC would contend that \u201cpayment\u201d was accomplished by an accounting entry on the books of the Government, and was not a sale or resale within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The statute, \u00a7 717, clearly says \u201cresale for ultimate public consumption.\u201d The DFH itself does not sell at all; the DFH supplies the individual families in satisfaction of the obligation of the United States to provide heat and fuel for the Government employees\u2019 housing. If the DFH and the Government employees it services are considered together, then arguably the DFH could be considered an ultimate public consumer; yet, the DFH itself does not consume a cubic foot of gas, it has the responsibility of supplying it to the households which do.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">So here we have an original sale, Cities Service to the Army, a transfer by the Army to the DFH, and use of the gas by the ultimate consumer, the Government employee households. It is this transfer by the Army to DFH which must be classified as a \u201cresale\u201d within the meaning of the statute for the Army to be able to buy at a wholesale rate from Cities Service. The difficulty with the Army\u2019s position is that the householder does not pay the DFH for the gas, because this is part of what he is entitled to be furnished by \u201cthe United States\u201d; nor does the DFH \u201cpay\u201d the Army for the gas, because the \u201cpayment\u201d is accomplished by a transfer of accounts on the Government\u2019s books.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">What this court is holding, by sustaining the position of the FERC here, is that no Government department such as the Army can be a wholesale purchaser at regulated prices, even though it expends capital and installs a distribution system for those whom it services, if another Government agency appears in the chain of distribution as the \u201cpurchaser\u201d from the Army (because no Government agency can be a true purchaser nor can there be a true \u201cresale\u201d within the meaning of the statute), and if those who ultimately consume the gas receive it in satisfaction of an obligation owing them from the United States rather than paying outright for the gas. Our holding, at the FERC\u2019s behest, thus knocks out economies of wholesale purchase by <em>all </em>federal Government agencies, while municipalities or privately owned public utilities are enabled to buy at wholesale regulated rates, because they are reselling to individual householders, and thus unquestionably come within the language of the statute \u201cresale for ultimate public consumption.\u201d The FERC\u2019s interpretation of the statute thus protects all consumers except the biggest one, the United States Government, whose bill is, of course, financed by the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">I suggest that where a Government agency performs the distribution function of a municipality or large private utility buying gas for resale, the Government agency should enjoy the same economies of purchase. This desired result could be reached simply by treating the sale by the Army to another Government agency (DFH here) as a resale within the meaning of the statute, but this seems to be precluded by the <em>Vint Hill </em>cases and the manner in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Government has arranged and documents its internal transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">I concur because the law is now rigged this way, as Judge Gordon\u2019s analysis convincingly shows, but we ought clearly to recognize how the law is rigged against the federal Government entities and their employees in comparison with the advantage of wholesale purchase conferred on municipalities, privately owned utilities, and their ultimate consumer-distributees. The FERC should reconsider its interpretation of the statute, and if the Agency does not, then Congress should consider an amendment to the statute to put government purchases on an equal basis with private.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">. <em>Secretary of the Army v.
