He has argued that there was insufficient corroborating evidence, as required by Subsection (B) of that statute, to support a conviction for sexual imposition. This court affirms the judgment of the trial court because the corroborating evidence was sufficient under R.C. 2907.06(B) to support defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">During February 1996, defendant Randy Pinson was an employee of Ford Motor Company in Avon Lake, Ohio. His duties included going to a building nearby on the premises of Auto Warehousing Company several times a day. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>February 23, 1996, defendant allegedly entered a room in that building in which Lisa Pettry, an employee of Auto Warehousing, was working alone. He allegedly came up behind her, placed his hand around her hip, pressed his chest and groin into her back and buttocks, pinned her against a waist-high counter, and moved his groin in a gyrating motion against her buttocks. According to her testimony, she turned her head to see who was doing this and said, \u201cUh uh, Randy,\u201d at which point he released her and left the room. She related these alleged events to a coworker, Ms. Allgood, several minutes later, who testified that Pettry looked nervous and shaky and had tears in her eyes while doing so. At Allgood\u2019s suggestion, they told another coworker, Mr. Cisman, shortly after that. The three of them were together when they saw defendant within an hour. Allgood testified that she then confronted defendant about the incident. According to Cisman, Allgood told defendant that Pettry had said that defendant had come up behind her and \u201cstarted grinding on her,\u201d and that she \u201cfelt something hard.\u201d According to the testimony of Pettry, Allgood, and Cisman, defendant responded by laughing and saying, \u201cIf she thinks that was hard, she hasn\u2019t felt anything yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Defendant was charged with one count of sexual imposition, was tried to a judge, and was convicted on August 20, 1996. He was fined $500 and given a deferred sentence of sixty days in jail. Defendant timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error is that there was insufficient corroborating evidence, as required by R.C. 2907.06(B), to support a conviction for sexual imposition. R.C. 2907.06(B) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be convicted of a violation of this section solely upon the victim\u2019s testimony unsupported by other evidence.\u201d A recent decision by the Ohio Supreme Court, <em>State v. Economo </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 56, 58, 666 N.E.2d 225, 227, addressed the question of \u201cwhat quality of evidence will satisfy the \u2018other evidence\u2019 or corroboration requirement\u201d of R.C. 2907.06(B). In <em>Economo, </em>the court held that the corroboration requirement \u201cdoes not mandate proof of the facts which are the very substance of the crime charged,\u201d but rather requires only \u201cminimal evidence\u201d to corroborate a victim\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 666 N.E.2d at 228. Such minimal evidence may consist of \u201cslight circumstances or evidence which tends to support the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Defendant has argued that the conversation reported to have taken place between him and Allgood concerning the alleged sexual imposition was insufficient to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony that defendant had sexual contact with her. He has argued that corroborating evidence \u201cmust tend to prove some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>material facts of the crime charged and tend to connect the Defendant with the crime,\u201d and that sexual contact is the \u201cmaterial substance\u201d of R.C. 2907.06. Therefore, according to defendant, the corroborating evidence must relate to sexual contact between defendant and Pettry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s position is that the reported conversation did not do so, because it was not an admission that improper sexual contact had occurred, nor was it evidence that corroborated a conclusion that the contact was for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either himself or Pettry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the defendant has asserted, that conversation had nothing to do with sexual contact between him and Pettry, and there was, therefore, insufficient corroborating evidence to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Corroborating evidence in a sexual imposition case need not be \u201cproof of the facts which are the very substance of the crime charged\u201d but, rather, may consist of \u201cminimal evidence.\u201d <em>Economo, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 59, 666 N.E.2d at 228. \u201cSlight circumstances or evidence which tends to support the victim\u2019s testimony\u201d is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. Pettry testified that defendant approached her from behind, pressed his chest and groin into her, pinned her against a counter, and moved in a gyrating motion against her buttocks. Allgood, her coworker, testified that Pettry told her of the incident several minutes later and that she was tearful and nervous. Allgood testified that she confronted defendant about the incident within an hour. Cisman, a witness to that confrontation, testified that Allgood told defendant that Pettry had said that defendant had come up behind her and \u201cstarted grinding on her\u201d and that she had \u201cfelt something hard.\u201d Pettry, Allgood, and Cisman all testified\u2019 that defendant responded by laughing and saying, \u201cIf she thinks that was hard, she hasn\u2019t felt anything yet.\u201d There was no evidence that defendant seemed confused about what Allgood meant, or that he denied the incident when she confronted him. This evidence, even if not independently sufficient to convict defendant, constituted at least \u201cslight circumstances or evidence which tends to support the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d Defendant\u2019s conviction, therefore, was supported by sufficient evidence to convict defendant of a violation of R.C. 2907.06. Defendant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Defendant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.
