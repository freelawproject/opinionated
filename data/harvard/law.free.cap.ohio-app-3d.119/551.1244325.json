Appellant filed this declaratory action against Metropolitan Cablevision\u2019s insurance carrier, appellee General Accident Insurance, to determine whether appellant\u2019s insurance coverage extends to the bodily injury she suffered. If the insurance policy covered her bodily injury, appellant could recover the $20,000 judgment against Metropolitan Cable from appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. Appellant filed this timely appeal from the granting of appellee\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>for summary judgment, asserting one assignment of error. Appellant filed a separate appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for sanctions against appellee\u2019s attorney. The appeal from the summary judgment and the appeal from the denial of sanctions are consolidated for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\u201cThe lower court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Appellant argues that her declaratory judgment action should have been granted, ruling that appellee is liable for the judgment under the insurance policy provided to Metropolitan Cable. Appellant\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Appellee and Metropolitan Cablevision entered into an agreement whereby appellee would provide coverage to pay for any sums Metropolitan Cablevision became legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person.\u201d The trial court found that appellant\u2019s claimed physical injuries stemmed from emotional distress, not from any external accident or occurrence. We agree with the trial court that Ohio law does not extend insurance coverage to injuries stemming from emotional distress where \u201cbodily injury\u201d is the term interpreted by the courts in the policy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">' The trial court relied upon two cases, one of which is binding precedent upon this court. The Ohio Supreme Court determined that an automobile liability policy which provided coverage for bodily injury did not extend coverage under that provision to a spouse under a loss-of-consortium claim. The Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">\u201c \u2018The words \u201cbodily injury\u201d are commonly and ordinarily used to designate an injury caused by external violence * * *.\u2019 <em>Burns v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 222, 233, 12 O.O. 18, 23, 16 N.E.2d 316, 321.\u201d <em>Tomlinson v. Skolnik </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 11, 14, 540 N.E.2d 716, 719.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">While the present cause of action can be distinguished from a loss-of-consortium. claim, where no physical symptoms are claimed, <em>Tomlinson </em>is instructive for the purpose of interpreting the common meaning of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The Hamilton County Court of Appeals followed the interpretation of \u201cbodily injury\u201d set forth by the Ohio Supreme Court when it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">\u201cBased on the commonly accepted definitions of \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 \u2018sickness\u2019 and \u2018disease,\u2019 the judicial trend to exclude non-physical harms such as emotional distress from the term \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and the coverage anticipated by the parties in an automobile liability policy, we hold that the Bowmans\u2019 claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is not a separate \u2018bodily injury\u2019 under the Auto-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Owners policy.\u201d <em>Bowman v. Holcomb </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 216, 220, 614 N.E.2d 838, 841.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We find <em>Bowman v. Holcomb </em>to be persuasive authority for our decision in the present case. The provision in the policy issued by appellee to Metropolitan Cablevision where coverage is offered for bodily injuries does not cover the type of physical symptoms stemming from the emotional distress caused by a wrongful discharge. Appellee is not liable for the payment of the $20,000 judgment against its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\u201cThe lower court erred in overruling plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motions for frivolous conduct sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Appellant argues that her motions presented triable issues pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 and should have been ruled on subsequent to a hearing before the trial court. Appellant\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Appellant\u2019s motions claimed that appellee\u2019s counsel were asserting defenses that were not warranted under existing law. Appellant was particularly troubled by appellee\u2019s assertion that an exclusionary clause existed in the policy to preclude liability for payment on appellant\u2019s judgment. The provision cited by appellant had been deleted and replaced by an addendum to the policy, providing different exclusionary language, which was, as applied to appellant, essentially the same as the deleted language.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">We cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to hold a hearing as to these motions for sanctions. A motion for attorney fees under R.C. 2323.51 can be denied without a hearing when the trial court finds no basis for imposing sanctions. <em>Pisani v. Pisani </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 83, 654 N.E.2d 1355; <em>Sheridan v. Harbison </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 206, 655 N.E.2d 256. We' find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s determination that a basis for imposing sanctions did not exist where appellee cited an irrelevant portion of the policy for support of an argument that could have been supported just as well by the relevant provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Appellant filed a motion for sanctions against appellee\u2019s appellate counsel with this court, arguing the same point as was argued in appellant\u2019s motions filed with the trial court. We do not find merit in appellant\u2019s motion for sanctions. Although appellee\u2019s counsel is obviously not reading the policy thoroughly, a basis for the defense exists elsewhere in the policy. We do not find frivolous conduct in asserting the defense itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled. The trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for sanctions is affirmed. Appellant\u2019s motion for sanctions filed on appeal is denied. The trial court\u2019s decision to grant appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-6\">David T.
