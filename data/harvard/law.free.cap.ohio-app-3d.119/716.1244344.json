Floyd appeals from a judgment of the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court\u2019s granting a directed verdict in favor of appellee United Home Improvement Center, Inc. (\u201cUHIC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">Floyd advances two assignments of error. First, he contends that the trial court erred by directing a verdict following his case-in-chief despite his presentation of evidence supporting an inference of the appellee\u2019s negligence. Next, Floyd argues that- the trial court erred by declaring his claims for anxiety, distress, shock, or other mental suffering all \u201cemotional distress\u201d claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">The present appeal stems from UHIC\u2019s construction of a room addition for Floyd\u2019s home. While digging a footer trench and crawlspace for the new room, UHIC employees uncovered a four-inch-diameter metal pipe crossing the twelve-foot-wide trench. Dave Marvin, a UHIC representative, testified at trial that a city inspector arrived and instructed UHIC employees to cut the pipe and bury it if they detected no odor. UHIC employees then cut the pipe at approximately 4:00 p.m. on a Thursday, smelled no odor, and observed no fluid flowing from the dry pipe. Marvin also testified that a city inspector observed the cut pipe and approved the pouring of concrete into the trench. Rain moved into the area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>however, and UHIC workers did not pour the concrete on Thursday evening or on Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In contrast to Marvin\u2019s testimony, Floyd testified on direct examination that only two construction workers were present when the pipe was cut. He further testified that he was home watching the work and did not see a building inspector examine the severed pipe. On cross-examination, however, UHIC\u2019s attorney confronted Floyd with his answers from a pretrial deposition, suggesting that Floyd was uncertain how many people were present and did not know whether a city inspector checked the pipe. After reviewing the deposition testimony, Floyd finally acknowledged that his recollection of the events \u201cpossibly\u201d was \u201cmuch fresher\u201d during the 1993 deposition than it was three years later at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In any event, on a Saturday morning two days after UHIC workers cut the pipe, Floyd smelled what he believed was gas. After checking inside his house, Floyd looked out the back door and saw a \u201creddish looking fluid\u201d in the trench. Marvin returned to the construction site a couple of days later and also observed the fluid, which was oil, in the trench. The parties subsequently discovered that the severed pipe was attached to an abandoned underground oil tank. Rainwater apparently ran down the pipe and into the tank, filling the tank and forcing oil into the trench. As a result of the oil contaminating Floyd\u2019s soil, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered Floyd\u2019s home destroyed and the contaminated soil removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Floyd filed a complaint on March 23, 1993, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that UHIC had breached its duty to perform the work in a professional and workmanlike manner. Floyd also sought recovery for \u201cannoyance and discomfort, severe emotional distress, anxiety, [and] shock to his nervous system.\u201d The trial court subsequently granted UHIC summary judgment on Floyd\u2019s emotional distress claim. Thereafter, the trial court clarified its ruling and held that \u201cemotional distress\u201d also encompassed Floyd\u2019s claims for anxiety, distress, shock or other mental suffering. At Floyd\u2019s October 21, 1996, jury trial, the trial court bifurcated the issues of liability and damages. Following Floyd\u2019s case-in-chief, however, the court granted UHIC a directed verdict. The trial court based its ruling on Floyd\u2019s failure to present any expert testimony concerning how a contractor exercising \u201cordinary care\u201d would have proceeded under the circumstances confronting UHIC. Specifically, the court found \u201ca lack of expert testimony as to what is the common construction practice and what duty the defendant allegedly breached.\u201d Floyd then filed a timely appeal, advancing two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">In his first assignment of error, Floyd contends that the trial court erred by directing a verdict in UHIC\u2019s favor despite his presentation of evidence permitting the jury to infer negligence. In support of his argument, Floyd first relies upon the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>After reviewing the record, however, we find this argument unpersuasive. Initially, we note that Floyd failed to raise <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>before the trial court when responding to UHIC\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. UHIC\u2019s based its motion upon Floyd\u2019s failure to present expert testimony establishing what local contractors would have done when confronted with the situation facing UHIC. In response, Floyd argued only that he did present sufficient expert testimony. Specifically, he interpreted Marvin\u2019s testimony as establishing that capping the pipe with concrete would have been appropriate. Floyd\u2019s response neither expressly nor implicitly made any reference to <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>Given Floyd\u2019s failure to suggest the doctrine, we cannot say that the trial court erred by failing to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Furthermore, we find <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>unnecessary given the facts before us. As Floyd notes, the doctrine applies when (1) the instrumentality causing injury was under the defendant\u2019s exclusive control, and (2) the injury ordinarily would not have occurred in the absence of negligence. <em>Becker v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. W. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 202, 203, 560 N.E.2d 165, 166-167. In recognition of these requirements, Floyd argues that (1) UHIC retained exclusive control of the work site, and (2) the oil would not have flowed into his yard absent UHIC\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In our view, however, the present case does not warrant application of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>The doctrine applies only when an accident occurs under \u201cunexplained circumstances\u201d and the defendant has exclusive control of the instrumentality causing injury. <em>Moore v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 107, 112, 623 N.E.2d 1214, 1217. By contrast, the present case is not a case of \u201cunexplained circumstances\u201d causing an injury. To the contrary, the evidence plainly demonstrated the oil leak\u2019s cause. The parties do not dispute that UHIC cut a pipe and that following a rainstorm the pipe leaked oil into Floyd\u2019s yard. Under these circumstances, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was unnecessary. See <em>id. </em>at 112, 623 N.E.2d at 1217. Undisputed evidence demonstrated how the oil leak occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The critical issue simply was whether UHIC acted negligently by leaving the severed pipe exposed to the elements rather than capping it immediately. Resolution of this issue depends upon whether, under the circumstances, UHIC fulfilled its duty to perform in a workmanlike manner. It is well settled that once a builder undertakes a construction contract, common law imposes upon him a duty to perform in a workmanlike manner. <em>Mitchem v. Johnson </em>(1966), 7 Ohio St.2d 66, 36 O.O.2d 52, 218 N.E.2d 594; <em>Velotta v. Leo Petronzio Landscaping, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 376, 23 O.O.3d 346, 433 N.E.2d 147. To prevail on a negligence claim for failure to perform in a workmanlike manner, a plaintiff must \u201cshow by a preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant] failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>exercise ordinary care and skill, and such failure proximately caused the damages.\u201d <em>M.L. Simmons, Inc. v. Bellman Plumbing, Inc. </em>(July 6, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67832, unreported, 1995 WL 396349, citing <em>Mitchem, supra; Velotta, supra; McMillan v. Brune-Harpenau-Torbeck Builders, Inc. </em>(1983), 8 Ohio St.3d 3, 8 OBR 73, 455 N.E.2d 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">As we noted above, the trial court directed a verdict for UHIC because Floyd failed to provide expert testimony identifying the \u201ccommon construction practice\u201d when a builder encounters circumstances like those in the present case. Absent expert testimony stating that UHIC acted improperly, and, in so doing, breached its duty of ordinary care, the trial court found Floyd\u2019s case-in-chief insufficient to withstand a directed verdict motion. In support of its ruling, the trial court relied exclusively upon <em>Ohio Historical Soc. v. Gen. Maintenance &amp; Eng. Co. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 139, 583 N.E.2d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In the portion of <em>Ohio Historical Soc. </em>relied upon by the trial court, the Tenth District Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">\u201cThe duty to perform construction services in a workmanlike manner sounds in tort and is implied by law. <em>Barton v. Ellis </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 251, 518 N.E.2d 18. In order to prevail, OHS must establish that General Maintenance was negligent in that it failed to use ordinary care. <em>Velotta v. Leo Petronzio Landscaping, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 376, 23 O.O.3d 346, 433 N.E.2d 147. Merely proving the existence of a defect is insufficient without showing that the defect resulted from the contractor\u2019s failure to use ordinary care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">\u201cOHS presented sufficient evidence to show that a defect in the EPDM system existed. However, as the trial court found, OHS solicited no expert testimony concerning the standard of ordinary care to be used in this type of construction. Without showing that General Maintenance did not use ordinary care, OHS has failed to show that General Maintenance was negligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 583 N.E.2d at 345.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">In his brief to this court, Floyd contends that the trial court erred by relying upon <em>Ohio Historical Soc. </em>to sustain UHIC\u2019s directed verdict motion. Floyd argues that the facts demonstrate UHIC\u2019s \u201cobvious departure\u201d from the standard of ordinary care even absent expert testimony on the issue. Conversely, UHIC cites <em>Ohio Historical Soc., </em>and <em>Schlachter v. Davis </em>(May 26, 1978), Defiance App. No. 4-77-12, unreported, for the proposition that expert testimony is required to establish what a builder in Montgomery County normally does when finding a four-inch pipe while digging a foundation. Without this testimony, UHIC contends that Floyd could not demonstrate that its conduct fell below the appropriate standard of care, and, therefore, Floyd failed to adduce evidence on an essential element of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>After reviewing the record and relevant case law, this court cannot agree that a plaintiff <em>always </em>must present expert testimony to prove a builder\u2019s deviation from common standards of workmanship or failure to exercise ordinary care. In <em>Kemper v. Builder\u2019s Square </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 127, 671 N.E.2d 1104, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201cExpert testimony, or any testimony at all, for that matter, is not always required to establish a standard of care. Even where not all of the factors involved as to how a standard of care should be exercised are obvious to, or readily understandable by, a lay jury, affirmative evidence of the standard of care is not necessarily required. <em>Thompson, Admx. v. Ohio Fuel Gas Co. </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 116, 117-118, 38 O.O.2d 294, 295-296, 224 N.E.2d 131, 133-135.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">\u201c\u2018Except for malpractice cases (against a doctor, dentist, etc.) there is no general rule or policy requiring expert testimony as to the standard of care, and this is true even in the increasingly broad area wherein expert opinion will be received. * *\u25a0 * Courts could very easily expand the area in which expert testimony is required to establish the standard of conduct, but the tendency has been instead to resolve doubtful questions in favor of allowing the jury to decide the issue of negligence without its aid. * * * \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 118, 38 O.O.2d at 296, 224 N.E.2d at 134, quoting 2 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts (1956), 966, Section 17.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">\u201cSignificantly, the plaintiffs decedent in <em>Thompson, supra, </em>was an equipment operator for a county engineer who was killed as a result of an explosion when the blade of a road grader he was operating struck the defendant\u2019s gas transmission line. If a lay jury could be expected to determine the proper standard of care in that case without the aid of an expert familiar with the usages and customs of the industry, we see nothing so esoteric in the case before us that would require expert testimony to establish the standard of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">\u201cFurthermore, evidence of usage and custom, while relevant to the determination of the standard of ordinary care, is not controlling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">\u201cWhat usually is done may be evidence of what ought to be done, but what ought to be done is fixed by a standard of reasonable prudence, whether it usually is complied with or not. <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Behymer </em>(1903), 189 U.S. 468, 470, 23 S.Ct. 622, 623, 47 L.Ed. 905, 906, quoted approvingly in <em>Thompson, supra.\u201d Kemper, supra, </em>109 Ohio App.3d at 132-133, 671 N.E.2d at 1107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Even in legal and medical malpractice cases, where the law typically does require expert testimony to establish the applicable standard of care, exceptions are made when the conduct at issue is within the jury\u2019s general experience and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>knowledge. See <em>McInnis v. Hyatt Legal Clinics </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 112, 113, 10 OBR 437, 438, 461 N.E.2d 1295, 1296-1297; <em>Jones v. Hawkes Hosp. of Mt. Carmel </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 503, 506-507, 26 O.O.2d 170, 172-173, 196 N.E.2d 592, 594-595.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Likewise, in two recent construction cases, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals and the Sixth District Court of Appeals have held that expert testimony is unnecessary to sustain a plaintiffs cause of action. In <em>Sparks v. Martin </em>(Mar. 3, 1995), Lucas App. No. L-94-129, unreported, 1995 WL 84686, the court rejected an argument that the lower court should have required expert testimony to establish the failure to repair a roof in a workmanlike manner. In that case, the defendant-appellant shingled the plaintiffs house with different colored shingles, and the roof leaked upon completion of the work. Similarly, in <em>Jurgens Real Estate Co. v. R.E.D. Constr. Corp. </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 292, 659 N.E.2d 353, the court found expert testimony unnecessary for the jury to determine \u201cthe cause, the fault, and the effect\u201d of delays in a construction project. The court noted that the issue \u201cwas not a matter which was highly technical, scientific in nature, or beyond the experience or knowledge of the average jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 659 N.E.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In light of the foregoing authorities, we cannot endorse a <em>per se </em>rule requiring expert testimony in workmanlike-construction cases. In the present case, however, we also, cannot say that the jury would have known whether a reasonably prudent construction worker should immediately cap an apparently empty pipe rather than leaving it exposed. The record before us reveals no reason for UHIC\u2019s workers to have suspected the presence of an abandoned oil tank. In fact, Marvin testified that he never had encountered such a tank. He also testified that four-inch pipes like the one uncovered typically were drainage pipes. Absent some testimony concerning the industry custom <em>or </em>some other evidence in the record of circumstances suggesting that a reasonably prudent builder immediately would have capped the pipe (for example, evidence that UHIC knew of the tank\u2019s existence), we find Floyd\u2019s case-in-chief insufficient to withstand a directed verdict motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Civ.R. 50(A)(4) provides for a directed verdict when \u201cthe trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party.\u201d Moreover, a directed verdict is proper when the non-moving party fails \u201cto adduce any evidence on the essential elements of his claim.\u201d <em>Bittinger v. Klotzman </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 847, 682 N.E.2d 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Floyd, we find a directed verdict proper. Floyd has failed to adduce any evidence suggesting that UHIC acted in an unworkmanlike manner and did not exercise ordinary care under the circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The mere occurrence of an injury ordinarily does not create an inference of negligence. <em>Ferguson v. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 460, 464, 590 N.E.2d 1332, 1334. Accordingly, we overrule Floyd\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In his second assignment of error, Floyd contends that the trial court erred by holding that his emotional distress claim encompassed his claims for anxiety, distress, shock, and other mental suffering. Specifically, Floyd argues that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of UHIC on his emotional distress claim should not have resulted in summary judgment on the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Our resolution of Floyd\u2019s first assignment of error, however, renders this assignment of error moot. Given our holding above that the trial court properly directed a verdict for UHIC on Floyd\u2019s negligence claim, Floyd cannot recover for these alleged injuries. Consequently, pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(c), we need not address this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b765-8\">Wolff and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. In his argument to the trial court, Floyd suggested that Marvin\u2019s own testimony demonstrated UHIC\u2019s failure to perform in a workmanlike manner. Specifically, he contended that Marvin testified that the pipe would have been capped with concrete if rain had not arrived, indicating that capping was appropriate. The trial transcript does not reveal any testimony from Marvin that he specifically planned to cap the pipe, however. Marvin testified only that after cutting the pipe to determine whether it was abandoned, UHIC workers planned to proceed with their work, which incidentally included pouring a concrete footer. Nothing in Marvin\u2019s testimony suggests that the workers intended to pour the concrete as a precaution against drainage from the pipe.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
