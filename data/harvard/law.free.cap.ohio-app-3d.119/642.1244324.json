Deputy Kent Hall of the Butler County Sheriffs Office responded to the call. At Hall\u2019s request, the Madison Township Life Squad also responded. After a medical evaluation determined that Myers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>was \u201cnormal,\u201d Hall charged Myers -with inducing panic, a violation of R.C. 2917.31.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">At a pretrial hearing on December 18, 1996, the prosecution stated that \u201cinducing panic [is not] the proper charge but false alarms is the proper charge * * The court amended its disposition card to show the charge as making false alarms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">At a bench trial on December 26,1996, the prosecution announced Myers\u2019s case by stating, \u201cThis is State of Ohio versus Tonya Myers. * * * The charge is false alarms, first degree misdemeanor.\u201d At the close of the evidence, the trial court found Myers \u201cnot guilty of the charge of making false alarms but guilty to [sic ] the lesser included offense of disorderly conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment entry states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201cOn December 26, 1996, the defendant appeared in open court charged with violation of Section 2917.31-1 of the Statutes of the State of Ohio, INDUCING PANIC and * * * entered a plea of NOT GUILTY to the charge of DISORDERLY CONDUCT, Section 2917.11-1 and was found GUILTY TO AMENDED CHARGE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Myers now appeals her conviction for disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Myers presents the following assignment of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s conviction of appellant for disorderly conduct in violation of O.R.C. 2917.11 is contrary to law and should be reversed when appellant was not charged with disorderly conduct or any offense for which disorderly conduct is a lesser included offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">We begin by noting that the state has not filed a brief in this case. Under App.R. 18(C), this court \u201cmay accept the appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.\u201d See <em>George v. Fannin </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 703, 706, 588 N.E.2d 195, 198. Here, we find that a reversal is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Because a court speaks through its journal, it is imperative that the court\u2019s journal reflect the truth. <em>Worcester v. Donnellon </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 117, 118, 551 N.E.2d 183, 184. All \u201clitigants have a clear legal right to have the proceedings they are involved in correctly journalized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 551 N.E.2d at 185. Therefore, making an incorrect journal entry is a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 120, 551 N.E.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">An examination of the record in this case reveals that the judgment entry filed December 26, 1996 is incorrect insofar as it reflects (1) that Myers was charged with inducing panic, (2) that she pled not guilty to disorderly conduct, and (3) that she was properly adjudicated guilty of disorderly conduct. The record of the proceedings reveals that the amended charge against Myers was making false alarms, not inducing panic. The court\u2019s own judgment entry and sentencing card, docketed as a \u201cstay card\u201d and filed on December 27, 1996, lists the charge as \u201cFalse Alarms.\u201d Myers pled not guilty to the charge of making false alarms, and following the trial, the court stated that Myers' was \u201cnot guilty <em>of the charge of making false alarms.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">While it is true that the trial court also found Myers guilty of \u201cthe lesser included offense of disorderly conduct,\u201d this statement does not accurately reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the proceedings below. Disorderly conduct is not a lesser included offense of making false alarms. See <em>State v. Deem </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294. Moreover, Myers was never charged with disorderly conduct; therefore, she cannot be convicted of that offense. <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 314, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2786, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 570-571; <em>State v. Burkitt </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 214, 224, 624 N.E.2d 210, 216-217.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">It is apparent from the transcript and the docket that the proceedings in this case were not correctly journalized. In addition, Myers was adjudged not guilty of the charge against her, that is, making false alarms. Accordingly, the assignment of error is sustained, the judgment against Myers is reversed, and Myers is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-7\">William W.
