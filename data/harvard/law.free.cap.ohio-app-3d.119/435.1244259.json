Harmon filed a complaint in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas alleging that she was subjected to unlawful <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment by appellees Isaac Gilliam and Belcan Engineering Group, Inc. (\u201cBelcan\u201d), in violation of R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.99. The complaint also included a negligent-supervision/retention claim against Belcan. Subsequently, appellant filed a federal civil rights claim and appellees removed the cause to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The cause was remanded to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas after appellant dismissed her claim under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on June 30, 1995. Following oral argument on August 3, 1995, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion by entry dated August 8,1995. Appellant appealed on August 9,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">Appellant\u2019s two assignments of error, which allege that the trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on appellant\u2019s claims for sexual harassment and negligent supervision/retention, will be considered together..</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">In Ohio, \u201cfederal case law interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 2000e <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code, is generally applicable to cases involving alleged violations of R.C. Chapter 4112.\u201d <em>Little Forest Med. Ctr. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 607, 609-610, 575 N.E.2d 1164, 1167, quoting <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 196, 20 O.O.3d 200, 202-203, 421 N.E.2d 128, 131; <em>Neal v. Hamilton Cty. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 670, 676-677, 622 N.E.2d 1130, 1135; <em>Pulver v. Rookwood Highland Tower Invest. </em>(Mar. 26, 1997), Hamilton App. Nos. C-950361 and C-950492, unreported, 1997 WL 133422. In analyzing statutory sexual-harassment claims, we look to the statute, R.C. 4112.02(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the administrative counterpart,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to federal case law interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 2000e <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code. <em>Delaney v. Skyline Lodge, Inc. </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 264, 270, 642 N.E.2d 395, 399; <em>Retterer v. Whirlpool Corp. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 847, 677 N.E.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment occurs where the employee\u2019s submission to or rejection of unwelcome sexual conduct is used as the basis for promotion or other employment decisions. <em>Western-Southern Life Ins. Co. v. Fridley </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 190, 194, 590 N.E.2d 325, 328. To prevail on a claim for <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment, the employee-plaintiff must show (1) that the employee was a member of a protected class; (2) that the employee was subjected to unwelcomed sexual harassment in the form of sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; (3) that the harassment complained of was based on sex; (4) that the employee\u2019s submission to the unwelcomed advances was an express or implied condition for receiving job benefits, or that the employee\u2019s refusal to submit to a supervisor\u2019s sexual demands resulted in a tangible job detriment; and (5) the existence of respondeat superior liability. <em>Kauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1992), 970 F.2d 178, 185-186; <em>Highlander v. K.F.C. Nat. Mgt. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1986), 805 F.2d 644, 648. In an action for <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment, an employer is held strictly liable for the conduct of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>supervisory employees having authority over hiring, advancement, dismissal, and discipline, under the theory of respondeat superior. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court held that appellant had failed to meet her burden of proof with respect to two of the required elements of a claim for <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment. Specifically, the trial court held that appellant did not show that she was subjected to unwelcomed sexual advances or that she was subjected to a tangible job detriment as a result of her refusal to submit to the alleged sexual advances. The court further determined that because appellant had not set forth sufficient evidence to support her sexual-harassment claim, her claim for negligent supervision/retention also failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Civ.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and with the evidence viewed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <em>State ex rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377, 1379; <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264, 274, the Ohio Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cAccordingly, we hold that a party seeking summary judgment, on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case, bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the essential element(s) of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Rather, the moving party must be able to specifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion <em>for </em>summary judgment must be denied. However, if the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the nonmoving party then has a reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial and, if the nonmovant does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Appellant argues that when the evidence is construed most strongly in her favor, she has set forth a prima facie case of <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment and raised genuine issues of material fact such that reasonable minds can reach different conclusions as to whether she was subjected to unlawful <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Construed most strongly in appellant\u2019s favor, the evidence shows that appellant was employed by appellee Belcan as a designer doing engineering and drafting work. She met appellee Gilliam, who headed Belcan\u2019s Pulp and Paper Technology Group, during smoking breaks. As early as July 1993, appellant suspected that Gilliam was interested in more than a professional relationship with her. Gilliam frequently told appellant that she was the best dressed and most attractive woman in the office. Gilliam asked appellant out to dinner and to his apartment. Appellant went to dinner with Gilliam, where she attempted to deflect attention from herself by introducing Gilliam to her friends, hoping that he would show interest in one of them. During two separate dinners, Gilliam put his arm around appellant\u2019s waist, but she removed it. Gilliam attempted to kiss appellant on two occasions. On at least one occasion, she turned her head and converted the attempted kiss into a hug.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In her affidavit submitted in opposition to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, appellant stated that during one dinner Gilliam told her about sexual problems he was experiencing with his wife, whom he was in the process of divorcing. According to appellant, Gilliam told her that he wanted to \u201cmeet a woman he could travel with and have good sexual relations with\u201d and then asked her \u201cif she liked to travel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In approximately July 1993, Gilliam approached appellant about transferring into the newly created position of Marketing Coordinator in the Pulp and Paper Technology Group. Gilliam offered appellant the position in spite of the fact that he knew that she did not have a marketing background, that she did not possess clerical or typing skills, and that she did not have a working knowledge of certain computer software programs she would be using in the position. Gilliam assured appellant that her lack of skills would not be a problem and that he believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>she had the potential to do the job. He also told appellant that she would be provided the necessary resources and training. Gilliam indicated that appellant could double or triple her salary within two or three years. Appellant accepted the position of Marketing Coordinator and was placed under Gilliam\u2019s direct supervision. On August 23, 1993, approximately two weeks after appellant\u2019s transfer to the Marketing Coordinator position, she was assigned a project that involved preparing a comprehensive business plan for the Pulp and Paper Technology Group. The project, which had been in progress for several months, required knowledge of certain computer software programs which appellant was in the process of learning.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">On August 25, 1993, Gilliam took appellant to a marketing seminar in Atlanta. Appellant asked Gilliam how she was doing in her new position, to which he responded that she was \u201cdoing just great.\u201d While they were in Atlanta, appellant confronted Gilliam about her concern that he wanted a romantic relationship with her. Appellant reminded Gilliam that she had a boyfriend and that she wanted to keep her relationship with Gilliam strictly professional. Gilliam assured appellant that he had no \u201chidden agenda\u201d with respect to hiring her for the Marketing Coordinator position. He also told appellant that he \u201cliked her very much.\u201d Immediately after this conversation, Gilliam\u2019s treatment of appellant changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The following day, Gilliam left Atlanta to attend another out-of-town seminar, and appellant returned to Cincinnati. Another Belcan employee informed appellant that Gilliam had stated that the business plan was to be completed by the time Gilliam returned from his business trip, in approximately four days. Appellant, who was responsible for the graphics portion of the business plan, testified that it was an impossible task. The business plan, which was already approximately two to three months late, took months to complete after appellant left the Marketing Coordinator position.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The day before Gilliam returned to Cincinnati, appellant informed him by telephone that she had been unable to complete the project by the deadline. Gilliam responded that he wanted to see whatever appellant had completed the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Upon his return, appellant showed Gilliam the graphics portion of the business plan, which was about ten to fifteen percent completed. Gilliam looked at what appellant had done, turned, uttered a profanity and stormed out of appellant\u2019s office. Appellant followed Gilliam to his office, where a heated discussion took place. Gilliam told appellant that \u201cthe learning curve was over\u201d and that he could not afford to pay appellant what he was paying her. Gilliam also stated that he had to \u201cmeet with his team players\u201d about \u201cwhat to do with\u201d appellant. Gilliam testified in his deposition that he told appellant that the \u201cmanagement team\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>going to have to review appellant\u2019s performance during the next week, and then decide what \u201cwas going to be done\u201d about appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Appellant understood by Gilliam\u2019s remarks that he intended to fire her, and she asked to be transferred back to the Engineering Department. Appellant believed that Gilliam\u2019s reaction to her work and his comments about her performance were directly related to the conversation they had in Atlanta where she had made it clear that she was not interested in a personal relationship with Gilliam, because that was the only circumstance that had changed in the week\u2019s time between Gilliam\u2019s telling appellant that she was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d and the confrontation in Gilliam\u2019s office. Appellant\u2019s belief that Gilliam intended to terminate her employment is supported by Gilliam\u2019s statement in his deposition that appellant \u201cwasn\u2019t being criticized or discharged for anything other than the performance on preparing graphics for the business plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Appellant took her concerns about sexual harassment to Robert Przybylowicz, Belcan\u2019s Vice President of Human Resources. Appellant admitted that there was \u201cnothing really overt\u201d about Gilliam\u2019s conduct. When Przybylowicz asked appellant the basis for her claim that Gilliam was \u201chitting on her,\u201d she stated, \u201cIt\u2019s just a feeling.\u201d Przybylowicz questioned Gilliam about appellant\u2019s accusations, whereupon Gilliam became angry and stated that his only concern was getting his work done. Appellant was subsequently assigned to Ken Ziemak, Belcan\u2019s Resource Manager, who tried for approximately one month to find another position for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Ziemak testified in his deposition that while he was trying to find another position for appellant at Belcan, Gilliam asked Ziemak, \u201cWhat are you doing about June Harmon, or why is June Harmon still here?\u201d Ultimately, Ziemak terminated appellant\u2019s employment. Appellant testified in her deposition that when she asked Ziemak why she was being terminated, Ziemak stated that he thought that Gilliam had recommended her for layoff because she \u201cdidn\u2019t put out.\u201d Appellant also testified that Ziemak stated, \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t give Isaac what he wanted, so you\u2019re out the door.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Appellees\u2019 evidence tended to show that appellant became disillusioned with the Marketing Coordinator position because of her difficulties in performing the job. Further, appellant discovered that three other Belcan employees had turned down the Marketing Coordinator position because Gilliam was known as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>difficult manager who set impossible deadlines. Appellees presented evidence that Gilliam\u2019s criticism of appellant was based solely on her poor work performance as Marketing Coordinator, that appellant had essentially quit the position of Marketing Coordinator when she asked to be transferred back to the Engineering Department, thereby negating the possibility of disciplinary action by Gilliam short of termination, that appellant\u2019s billable hours as a percentage of hours worked were substantially below Belcan\u2019s minimum of eighty to eighty-five percent during the month that she worked under Ziemak, and that appellant was ultimately laid off by Ziemak because of a lack of productive work. Ziemak denied making any statement to the effect that appellant was terminated because she would not \u201cput out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Construing the evidence set forth above, and the inferences drawn therefrom, most strongly in favor of appellant, we hold that she presented evidence that created genuine issues of material fact such that reasonable minds could conclude that she was subjected to unwelcomed sexual advances, and that she suffered a tangible job detriment as a result of her unwillingness to submit to the sexual advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We point out that appellant\u2019s evidence showed that she did not respond to Gilliam\u2019s advances and that on more than occasion she actively resisted him. For example, when Gilliam attempted to kiss appellant, she turned her head, converting the attempted kiss into a hug. After appellant made it clear that she had no interest in a personal relationship with Gilliam, he began to treat her differently, placing impossible demands on her. Further, appellant presented evidence that Gilliam intended to fire her from the Marketing Coordinator position, and that even after she was transferred from his department, Gilliam continued to attempt to have appellant terminated from her employment by pressuring Ziemak to fire her. In addition, there was evidence that, if believed, showed that appellant was terminated because she would not \u201cput out.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We hold that the trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The assignments of error are sustained. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-9\">Doan, P.J., Gorman and Shannon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Raymond E.

Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05(J) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\u201c(1) Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of division (A) of section 4112.02 of the -Revised Code.

Appellees argue that appellant\u2019s affidavit should not be considered because it contradicts her deposition testimony. We disagree. The affidavit does not contradict her deposition testimony; it supplements the testimony. When asked during her deposition what events appellant believed showed sexual harassment, she stated that aside from those to which she had already testified, she could not think of any. Presumably, appellant remembered the dinner incident after her deposition was taken. Appellees also contend that the affidavit should not be considered because appellant\u2019s counsel stipulated at the deposition that there was nothing to indicate sexual harassment other than the events mentioned previously in her deposition testimony. However, appellees\u2019 counsel declined to accept that stipulation, stating, \"That doesn't help me.\u201d We point out that the trial court considered the statements contained in the affidavit during oral argument on appellees' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\">. Appellees argue that Ziemak's alleged statements, should not be considered because they constitute hearsay. We disagree. The trial court took the statements into consideration in ruling on the motion for summary judgment. There is a sufficient foundation in the record to conclude that the statements are admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(d) as admissions by a party opponent because they were offered against Belcan and were made by Belcan's employee concerning a matter within the scope of his employment during the existence of the employment relationship. See <em>Delaney v. Skyline Lodge, Inc. </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 264, 642 N.E.2d 395.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\">.
