Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">On a morning in early December 1993, plaintiff-appellant Paul Nadel was driving his son, plaintiff-appellant Christopher, and two younger daughters, Ashley and Brittany, to school.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paul\u2019s mother, plaintiff-appellant Evelyn Nadel, was seated next to the passenger window. Christopher was seated in the front seat between Evelyn and Paul, with one foot on the transmission hump and one foot on the passenger side of the hump. Brittany and Ashley were in the back seat. On the way, they ordered breakfast from the drive-through window of a Burger King restaurant owned and operated by defendant-appellee Emil, Inc. (\u201cEmil\u201d) under a franchise agreement with defendant-appellee Burger King Corporation (\u201cBK\u201d). Paul\u2019s order included several breakfast sandwiches and drinks and two cups of coffee. The cups of coffee were fitted with lids and served in a cardboard container designed to hold four cups, with the two cups placed on opposite diagonal corners. Emil\u2019s employee served the coffee through the car window to Paul, who passed it to Christopher, who handed it to Evelyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Evelyn testified that she tasted the coffee in the cup on the right side of the container, by raising the flap on its lid, and found it too hot to drink. She also testified that the lid of the coffee \u201cjiggled off\u2019 and burned her on her right leg after she lifted the flap. After bending the flap of the lid so that it was closed, Evelyn returned the cup, covered by the lid, to the container. She then either started to place the container of coffees on the floor next to Christopher\u2019s foot or placed the container on the dashboard, or she had already placed the container on the floor next to Christopher\u2019s foot, when Paul drove away from the restaurant, making a left turn onto a street. At that point Christopher began screaming that his foot was burned. Christopher, Paul, and Evelyn discovered that one or both of the cups had tipped, and that hot coffee had spilled on Christopher\u2019s right foot. Neither the cups, the lids, nor the container are in the record. Christopher was treated for second-degree burns on his right foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In their complaint, the Nad\u00e9is (Brenda Nadel is the mother of Christopher Nadel) raised several claims, including (1) breach of a warranty of merchantability and breach of a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, both based on the allegation that the coffee was too hot to consume, (2) products liability for a defective product and a failure to warn of the dangers of handling liquid served as hot as appellees\u2019 coffee, and (3) negligence both for failing to instruct employees how to properly serve hot coffee and for failing to warn business invitees of the danger of handling coffee at the temperature Emil\u2019s coffee was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Emil moved for summary judgment, claiming that no genuine issue of material fact existed. In support of its claim, Emil cited the deposition of Paul, in which he testified that he knew that coffee is served hot, that he expected coffee to be served hot, that he knew Emil\u2019s coffee was served hot, that coffee would burn someone if it was spilled on him or her, and that whoever was handling hot coffee needed to be careful not to spill it. Evelyn testified that she knew the coffee that was spilled was hot, and that it had burned her. Emil\u2019s owner\u2019s affidavit averred that BK\u2019s operating manual required coffee to be served at approximately one hundred seventy-five degrees, that the coffee machine thermostats were set at that temperature, and that Emil was unaware of any problems resulting from coffee being served at that temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">BK also moved for summary judgment and pointed to evidence in the depositions that appellants knew that the coffee was hot and that coffee was purchased and served as a hot beverage. It also contended that under the circumstances, Evelyn\u2019s and Paul\u2019s actions were intervening, superseding causes precluding any actionable negligence on its part.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In opposition to the motions for summary judgment, the Nad\u00e9is argued that Emil and BK knew or should have known that second-degree burns could occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>as a result of coffee served at one hundred seventy-five degrees, because \u201cthe whole industry has long been aware of the danger of liquid this hot,\u201d and they cited several journal articles in their supporting memorandum. The Nad\u00e9is also attached the affidavit of their attorney with Christopher\u2019s medical records affixed, which averred that the medical records were true copies of what was received through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The trial court granted both summary judgment motions, and the Nad\u00e9is appealed. The trial court based its judgment on its conclusion that Christopher\u2019s injury resulting from spilled hot coffee was, as a matter of law, the result of intervening, superseding causes attributable to Paul and Evelyn. Appellants raise two assignments of error, contending, respectively, that the trial court improperly granted BK\u2019s summary judgment motion and Emil\u2019s summary judgment motion. We will address these assignments together, except in those instances where separate treatment is warranted for the various claims alleged by the Nad\u00e9is.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">II. Standard of Review for the Nad\u00e9is\u2019 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">In order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment, a movant has the burden to demonstrate that'no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that it appears from the evidence, when viewed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 471-472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274. Where a moving party is seeking summary judgment on the basis that a nonmoving party cannot prove its case, the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim by specifically pointing to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56 that affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support its claim. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264, 274. Once this burden is met, the nonmoving party must then produce evidence on the issues for which it bears the burden at trial, by setting forth specific facts by the means listed in Civ.R. 56(C), demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of fact. <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 526 N.E.2d 798, 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">III. Intervening Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Here, the trial court granted summary judgment solely on the basis of its conclusion that Christopher\u2019s injury resulting from spilled hot coffee was, as a matter of law, the result of intervening, superseding causes attributable to Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and Evelyn. Only a reasonably unforeseeable action may constitute an intervening, superseding cause. See, <em>e.g., Leibreich v. A.J. Refrigeration, Inc. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 266, 617 N.E.2d 1068. A spilled drink at fast-food windows or shortly after pulling 'away from fast-food windows occurs with enough frequency that it cannot be said to be so unforeseeable that it constitutes an intervening, superseding cause as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court erred when it held that the spill was an intervening, superseding cause on summary judgment. But we are permitted to affirm a correct judgment even though it was entered for the wrong reason, as only prejudicial error is reversible. See, <em>e.g., Cook v. Cincinnati </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 80, 658 N.E.2d 814, citing <em>State ex rel. Carter v. Schotten </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 89, 637 N.E.2d 306. Therefore, we must examine each claim as to each party, and determine whether summary judgment was otherwise proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">IV. Warranties of Merchantability and Fitness for a Particular Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The Nad\u00e9is\u2019 first claim alleges breaches of the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. As no express contract is alleged between the parties, we assume that the asserted warranties are implied warranties set forth by the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code. See R.C. 1302.27 and 1302.28.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the Ohio Products Liability Law has preempted the Nad\u00e9is\u2019 warranty claims. R.C. 2307.72; 2307.73; <em>Saylor v. Providence Hosp. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 1, 680 N.E.2d 193; Raitt, The Preemption and Economic Loss Provisions of the Ohio Product Liability Code (1991), 16 U.Dayton L.Rev. 583, 586-589; O\u2019Reilly and Cody, Ohio Products Liability Manual (1992) 57, Section 5.05. R.C. 2307.72(A) states that \u201c[a]ny recovery of compensatory damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>based on a product liability claim\u201d is subject to the Ohio Products Liability Law. R.C. 2307.73(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201cA manufacturer is subject to liability for compensatory damages based on a product liability claim <em>only </em>if the claimant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>all </em>of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201c(1) Subject to division (B) of this section, the product was defective in manufacture or construction <em>as described in section 2307.74 of the Revised Code, </em>was defective in design or formulation <em>as described in section 2307.75 of the Revised Code, </em>was defective due to inadequate warning or instruction <em>as described in section 2307.76 of the Revised Code, </em>or was defective because it did not conform to a representation made by the manufacturer as <em>described in section 2307.77 of the Revised Code.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\n<em>\u201c[AND]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">. \u201c(2) Subject to sections 2307.80, 2315.20, and 2323.59 of the Revised Code, a defective aspect of the product as <em>described in division (A)(1) of this section </em>was a proximate cause of harm for which the claimant seeks to recover compensatory damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\n<em>\u201c[AND]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\"><em>\u25a0 </em>\u201c(3) The manufacturer designed, formulated, produced, created, made, constructed, assembled, or rebuilt the product.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">R.C. 2307.71(M) defines a product liability claim as a claim \u201casserted in a civil action and that seeks to recover compensatory damages from a manufacturer or supplier for death, physical injury to person, emotional distress, or physical damage to property other than the product involved, that allegedly arise from any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">\u201c(1) The design, formulation, production, construction, creation, assembly, rebuilding, testing, or marketing of that product;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">\u201c(2) Any warning or instruction, or lack of warning or instruction, associated with that product;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">\u201c(3) Any failure of that product to conform to any relevant representation or warranty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Thus, claims for personal injuries caused by a product\u2019s failure to conform due to a defect is governed solely by the Products Liability Law. <em>LaPuma v. Collinwood Concrete </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 64, 661 N.E.2d 714. For a good explanation of the rationale behind this rule, see Raitt, <em>supra, </em>16 U.Dayton L.Rev. at 586-586, fn. 15 and 17. Thus, we conclude that summary judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>proper for the claims for breach of warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose against both BK and Emil.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">V. Products Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The Nad\u00e9is argue two product liability claims: (1) design defect \u2014 that the coffee was excessively hot \u2014 and (2) the failure to warn of the danger of handling coffee served at that temperature. The law in Ohio governing design-defect claims states that defective designs are those in which the foreseeable risks exceed the benefits, <em>or </em>those that are more dangerous than \u201can ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner.\u201d R.C. 2307.75(A)(1) and (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Welch Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. O &amp; K Trojan, Inc. </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 218, 224, 668 N.E.2d 529, 533. To support their claim that the temperature of the coffee constituted a defect, the Nad\u00e9is presented evidence that the coffee was served at one hundred seventy-five degrees and that Christopher received second-degree burns when the coffee was spilled on him. The Nad\u00e9is also provided, in their memorandum opposing summary judgment, citations to journals to support the allegation that one-hundred-seventy-five-degree coffee is excessively hot.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Generally, the determination of whether a design defect exists is a question of fact. See <em>Welch Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., supra, </em>107 Ohio App.3d at 225, 668 N.E.2d at 534. Here, the question is not whether the Nad\u00e9is expected it to be hot, but rather <em>how hot </em>they, or a reasonable consumer in their shoes, expected the coffee to be. If the Nad\u00e9is could show that a reasonable consumer would find that coffee brewed at one hundred seventy-five degrees was unreasonably and excessively hot, and therefore that the coffee failed to be as safe as an ordinary consumer would expect, then a question of fact existed, and summary judgment was inappropriate. See, <em>e.g., Leichtamer v. Am. Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 456, 21 O.O.3d 285, 424 N.E.2d 568. But the Nad\u00e9is have failed to produce any evidence that the coffee was hotter than it was expected to be aside from the second-degree burns that Christopher Nadel suffered. The Nad\u00e9is\u2019 citations to articles in their memorandum in opposition to summary judgment make interesting reading, but the articles have no evidentiary value.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Civ.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>56(C) allows a trial court to consider only \u201cpleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact,\u201d in deciding a summary judgment motion. The proper procedure for introducing evidentiary material not specifically authorized by the rule is to incorporate such material by reference in a properly framed affidavit. See <em>Biskupich v. Westbay Manor Nursing Home </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 220, 515 N.E.2d 632. Documents submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment that are neither sworn, certified, nor authenticated by affidavit have no evidentiary value. <em>Green v. B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 223, 228, 619 N.E.2d 497, 500-501. The articles cited by the Nad\u00e9is are not even a part of the record, much less properly framed by an aff\u00edd\u00e1vit as required by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Nevertheless, we are convinced that a jury is better equipped to determine whether consumers expect coffee to be so hot that it would cause second-degree burns when spilled, or that its risk of second-degree burns would outweigh its benefit. The fact that the coffee caused second-degree burns is sufficient by itself to raise a factual issue whether the coffee was unreasonably hot, and therefore it is presently sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The Nad\u00e9is also claim that the coffee was defective because it failed even to contain a warning as to the danger of handling liquid served at one hundred seventy-five degrees. BK and Emil, through the depositions of Evelyn and Paul, presented evidence that the Nad\u00e9is knew the coffee was hot and that they had ordered it hot. But this knowledge is not dispositive, because the issue is not whether the coffee was hot or expected to be hot, but whether the coffee was so exceedingly hot that serving it without a warning of unforeseen danger was unreasonable. We believe that it is a question of fact whether second-degree burns can result from spilled coffee is an unforeseen danger, and perhaps this is the sum of our disagreement with the dissenting opinion, which believes that such possibilities are common knowledge. R.C. 2307.76(B) provides that \u201c[a] product is not defective due to lack of warning\u201d as a result of the failure to warn about an open and obvious risk or a risk that is a matter of common knowledge. We are not so convinced that we will take judicial notice and remove this issue from a jury. We cannot conclude from the evidence before us that the hot coffee posed such an obvious danger of severe burns and that the Nad\u00e9is were aware of such danger, although, with a more developed record, such facts could perhaps be demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Thus, the issues of whether BK and/or Emil \u201cknew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known about a risk [second-degree burns] that is associated with the product\u201d and whether BK and/or Emil failed to provide the warning that \u201ca manufacturer exercising reasonable care would have provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>concerning that risk, in light of the likelihood that the product would cause harm of the type for which the claimant seeks to recover compensatory damages and in light of the likely seriousness -of the harm\u201d should be reserved for the trier of fact. R.C. 2307.76(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">As to BK\u2019s motion for summary judgment, BK alleges that it is immune under the statute because it is not a manufacturer, seller, or supplier of the coffee under R.C. 2307.71. But Emil stated via affidavit that it brewed and sold the coffee pursuant to BK\u2019s specifications <em>as required by the franchise agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A principal-agent relationship exists when one party retains a right to control the actions of its agent and those actions are directed toward the attainment of an objective which the former party seeks. <em>Hanson v. Kynast </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 171, 24 OBR 403, 494 N.E.2d 1091, paragraph one of the syllabus. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, a principal is vicariously liable for the acts of its agent committed within the scope of the agency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Because BK at least arguably retains control over such details as the temperature that the coffee must be brewed, Emil could be considered an agent of BK with respect to those details. Under R.C. 2307.71(1), a manufacturer is \u201ca person engaged in a business to design, formulate, produce, create, make, construct, assemble or rebuild a product or a component of a product.\u201d Emil makes the coffee to BK\u2019s specifications. Therefore, BK qualifies as a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d under the definition in R.C. 2307.71(1) for summary judgment purposes, when every factual benefit of the doubt is given to the Nad\u00e9is.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">As to Emil\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Emil based its motion exclusively on its argument of intervening, superseding causation and the holding in <em>Reese, supra. </em>As we have already stated, these arguments are insufficient to sustain summary judgment on the failure-to-warn claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In sum, we hold that both the design-defect claim and the failur\u00e9-to-warn claim survive BK\u2019s and Emil\u2019s motions for summary judgment, because issues of fact remain whether the coffee was defective due to the heat at which it was served, and whether a warning existed, and if so, whether it was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">VI. Claim of Negligence Toward Business Invitees</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">The Nad\u00e9is\u2019 next claim, alleges that appellees violated their duty to the Nad\u00e9is as business invitees by negligently failing to warn them of the danger of handling hot coffee. While such a claim usually is premised on the duty to maintain safe <em>premises </em>for a business invitee and to warn of a defect <em>on the property, </em>see <em>Albright v. Montgomery Inn, Inc. </em>(Aug. 16, 1995), Hamilton App. No. C-940747, unreported, 1995 WL 481485, a business proprietor has a duty to exercise ordinary and reasonable care to warn an invitee of latent defects o\u00bb <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>property of </em>which the proprietor has knowledge or should have knowledge. See <em>Westwood v. Thrifty Boy </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 84, 86-87, 58 O.O.2d 154, 155-156, 278 N.E.2d 673, 675; <em>McGuire v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1996), 118 Ohio App.3d 494, 693 N.E.2d 807. Because the failure to warn here involves a product, it more reasonably falls under the rubric of products liability rather than premises liability. Thus, we hold that the summary judgment was properly granted in favor of BK and Emil on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">VII. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Negligent infliction of emotional distress is a claim based upon the negligence of one party creating actionable emotional distress in another. <em>Heiner v. Moretuzzo </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 80, 652 N.E.2d 664, citing <em>Schultz v. Barberton Glass Co. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 131, 4 OBR 376, 447 N.E.2d 109. In <em>Paugh v. Hanks </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 72, 6 OBR 114, 451 N.E.2d 759, the Ohio Supreme Court stated in paragraph three of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201c3. Where a bystander to an accident states a cause of action for negligent infliction of serious emotional distress, the emotional injuries sustained must be found to be both serious and reasonably foreseeable, in order to allow a recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c3a. Serious emotional distress describes emotional injury which is both severe and debilitating. Thus, serious emotional distress may be found where a reasonable person, normally constituted, would be unable to cope adequately with the mental distress engendered by the circumstances of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Here, Evelyn and Paul Nadel, Christopher\u2019s grandmother and father respectively, are the ones making claims for negligent emotional distress. Yet the only evidence of any emotional distress as a result of the incident is (1) Evelyn\u2019s statement that she was \u201cworried,\u201d though not enough to seek psychological treatment, and (2) Paul\u2019s statement that while receiving psychological treatment for depression resulting from his divorce and stress, the incident \u201ccame up,\u201d although it was not a contributing reason for seeking or receiving counseling. Absent from the record is any showing of the type of emotional distress where a reasonable person, normally constituted, would be unable to cope adequately with the mental distress engendered by the circumstances of the case. Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">VIII. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Punitive damages in a products liability context are controlled by R.C. 2307.801. See, <em>e.g., Saylor, supra. </em>In order to prevail, the Nad\u00e9is must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that they are entitled to compensatory damages on either their design-defect claim or their failure-to-warn claim, and that the harm was the result of misconduct of BK, Emil, or both, in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>capacity as a manufacturer or supplier, that manifested a flagrant disregard for the safety of persons who might be harmed by the product involved. R.C. 2307.801(A). Relevant factors include (1) the likelihood that serious harm would arise from the misconduct of the manufacturer or supplier, (2) the degree of the awareness of the manufacturer or supplier of that likelihood, (3) the duration of the misconduct and any concealment of it by the manufacturer or supplier, (4) the attitude and conduct of the manufacturer or supplier upon the discovery of the misconduct and whether the misconduct has terminated, and (5) the financial condition of the manufacturer or supplier. R.C. 2307.801(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Although the record has little to support the Nad\u00e9is\u2019 claim beyond the pleadings, the motions for summary judgment cite no specific reason based on the record for granting summary judgment on the punitive-damages claim as required under <em>Dresher, supra. </em>At this point, it is premature to grant summary judgment to either BK or Emil without further inquiry into these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">IX. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s summary judgment with respect to the claims based upon warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, the claim of premises-related negligence and the claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress.

Intervening, superseding causes should not be confused with the editorial comments of the court in <em>Reese v. Burger King Restaurant </em>(Feb. 13, 1990), Franklin App. No. 89AP-856, unreported, 1990 WL 12383, which noted that causes of action under facts such as these should be limited. The <em>Reese </em>court held as a matter of law that the Burger King employees did not act unreasonably. Quite so, unless the temperature of the coffee they brewed and served was unreasonably hot, in light of the knowledge that customers do spill drinks from time to time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">. Prior to the enactment of the Ohio Products Liability Law, R.C. 2307.71 to 2307.80, Ohio case law also recognized a theory of implied warranty based not on contract, but instead on \u201can action in tort for strict product liability similar to that recognized by Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.\u201d 1 Ferriell, Ferriell Commercial Code (1996) 175, Section 10.10. This implied-warranty claim is no longer a viable cause of action for compensatory damages for personal injury due to a defective product. Raitt, The Preemption and Economic Loss Provisions of the Ohio Product Liability Code (1991), 16 U.Dayton L.Rev. 583, 586-587, fn. 15 and 17. A cause of action in tort for implied warranty is recognized for solely economic damages caused by a defective product. <em>LaPuma v. Collinwood Concrete </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 64, 661 N.E.2d 714.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. But, see, <em>Carrel </em>v. <em>Allied Products Corp. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 284, 677 N.E.2d 795, which brings some of this rationale into question.

If the articles had evidentiary value, they might have at least served notice that the industry standard for coffee brewed at fast-food restaurants is roughly forty degrees hotter than coffee brewed in coffee machines at home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b633-11\">Hildebrandt, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3_\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">While I agree with the majority opinion as set forth in Sections III, V, and VI, I respectfully dissent from Sections IV and VTI. The majority correctly notes that the Nad\u00e9is failed to produce evidence beyond the burn-producing spill to defeat Emil\u2019s and BK\u2019s-motions for summary judgment regarding the Nad\u00e9is\u2019 claim that the coffee was a defective product because its temperature was unreasonably and excessively hot. It holds nonetheless that the fact that the coffee caused second-degree burns is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the coffee was a defective product and \u201cwhether the coffee was so exceedingly hot that serving it without a warning was unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>I disagree that the fact that Christopher suffered second-degree burns is sufficient to establish the existence of a disputed issue of material fact as to whether the coffee was a defective product under either prong of the defective-design section of Ohio\u2019s Products Liability Act. R.C. 2307.75(a)(1) and (2). The fact that a product may cause injury does not mean that the product is defective. Accord <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Volkswagen of Am. </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App.3d 58, 29 OBR 68, 502 N.E.2d 651. A manufacturer need not make its product accident-proof or foolproof. It is \u201cnot an insurer that [its] product is, from a design viewpoint, incapable of producing injury.\u201d <em>Gossett v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1966), 9 Ohio Misc. 1, 5, 36 O.O.2d 207, 210, 359 F.2d 84, 87. The majority opinion, by allowing the Nad\u00e9is to meet their Civ.R. 56 burden by practically going no further than the mere allegation of wrongdoing creates an absolute liability on the manufacturer based on the fact that an injury occurs when its product is used. To accept the majority opinion would mean that one \u201cwould truly have reached the scenario envisioned by Justice Holmes in his dissent in <em>Cremeans [v. Internatl. Harvester Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 232, 238, 6 OBR 302, 307, 452 N.E.2d 1281, 1286] where \u2018 * * * summary judgment for a defendant would never be possible since the plaintiff need only assert that a given product is defectively designed and that he was injured by it.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. K.R. Wilson Co. </em>(1983), 8 Ohio St.3d 9, 11, 8 OBR 79, 80, 455 N.E.2d 1282, 1283 (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">I also conclude that summary judgment was properly entered against the Nad\u00e9is on their failure-to-warn claim, because the fact that coffee is hot and can cause burns is open and obvious. The evidence demonstrates that Evelyn and Paul knew the coffee was hot and that they had ordered it hot. In fact, coffee is usually served hot and allowed to cool before consumption. R.C. 2307.76(B) provides that \u201c[a] product is not defective due to lack of warning\u201d as a result of the failure to warn about \u201can open and obvious risk or a risk that is a matter of common knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The majority opinion focuses on the severity of the injury as the crux of whether a warning is required. I believe that \u201crisk\u201d is not to be so liberally construed. It is not the severity of a specific injury that constitutes the open and obvious risk; the open and obvious risk is the \u201cdanger or potentiality for danger\u201d that a product possesses, regardless of the innumerable degrees of severity of injury which might occur. See Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 353, Section 402A, Comment j.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\u201cA manufacturer has no duty to warn of an obvious danger. Knives are sharp, bowling balls are heavy, bullets cause puncture wounds in flesh. The law has long recognized that obvious dangers are an excluded class. [Footnote deleted.] As the colorful Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner once wrote in an Indiana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>federal case, if you \u2018go to the zoo and put your hand through the lion\u2019s cage, and the lion bites your hand off, * * * you do not have an action against the zoo.\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Reilly and Cody, Ohio Products Liability Manual (1992), Section 10.13, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">A knife may cause various degrees of injury ranging from the mere slicing of skin to the severing of a limb; however, the fact that the injury is a severing of a limb does not make the risk of causing some type of cutting any less obvious. Likewise coffee is served hot. The fact that its heat may cause a slight burn in some instances, or second-degree burns when, like in this case, the coffee is spilled and compressed between a child\u2019s sock and his skin for a period of time, does not make less obvious the risk that hot coffee purchased for consumption will burn upon contact with skin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I would conclude that hot coffee is an open and obvious risk which requires no warning. Cf. <em>Koepke v. Crosman Arms Co. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 1, 582 N.E.2d 1000 (no warning required regarding the dangers of firing a loaded BB gun toward a person); <em>Gawloski v. Miller Brewing Co. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 160, 644 N.E.2d 731 (dangers of prolonged and excessive use of alcohol is a danger within the body of common knowledge); <em>Hanlon v. Lane </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 148, 648 N.E.2d 26 (no warning required of the danger of carbon monoxide where its lethality is a matter of common knowledge); <em>Taylor v. Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co. </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 62, 520 N.E.2d 1375 (no claim for failure to warn where truck\u2019s propensity to spark was fairly obvious).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Because of my conclusion above, I also would overrule the Nad\u00e9is\u2019 claims for punitive damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, a question is thus raised as to what warning would be adequate. Obviously, if the danger is the severity of possible injury and not the fact that the coffee is hot, a warning of \u201cCaution! Hot Coffee!\u201d is arguably inadequate. Would a manufacturer have to determine the most severe injury which could occur under all circumstances and provide a warning of that possibility, so that if the instant case constituted that situation a warning to be sufficient would need to advise \"Warning! Hot Coffee Can Cause Second-Degree Burns If Spilled In Sock!\u201d?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
