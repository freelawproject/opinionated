Brandon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">On June 30, 1996, at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon, Officer Allen Fite, Jr., of the Akron Police Department Street and Narcotics Unit, patrolling in a cruiser with his partner, observed Brandon and another male standing at a corner known for drug activity. As the officers neared the location, they observed Brandon and his companion enter a store on the corner. Several minutes later, the officers decided to speak to them. As they got out of the cruiser, Brandon and the other man left the store and began walking toward the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">As the four men approached each other, the officers began questioning Brandon and his companion. Officer Fite asked Brandon if he could pat him down for weapons, and Brandon consented. As Officer Fite felt the left front pocket of Brandon\u2019s shorts, he felt something in Brandon\u2019s pocket that he testified he recognized to be crack cocaine. Fite handcuffed Brandon, placed him under arrest, and then retrieved from his pocket nine rocks of crack cocaine wrapped in cellophane.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">Brandon was thereafter indicted for one count of drug abuse in violation of R.C. 2925.11, and one count of aggravated trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2). Brandon pleaded not guilty to these charges. He then filed a motion to suppress the crack cocaine that Officer Fite had removed from his pocket. After a hearing on the issue, the trial court granted Brandon\u2019s motion to suppress. The state now appeals, assigning as error the court\u2019s decision to suppress this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has said that searches conducted without a warrant, and therefore without prior approval by a judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, subject only to a few specifically established exceptions. <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585. One of these specific exceptions is the \u201cplain feel\u201d exception, which applies when an officer discovers contraband through the sense of touch during an otherwise lawful search. <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 366, <em>375, </em>113 S.Ct. 2130, 2136-2137, 124 L.Ed.2d 334, 345. Under this exception, \u201c[i]f a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons.\u201d Id. at 375, 113 S.Ct. at 2137, 124 L.Ed.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">At the suppression hearing in the current case, Officer Fite testified that it was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d to him that the lump in Brandon\u2019s pocket was crack cocaine. In her ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial judge made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\u201c17. The item Officer Fite claims to have been able to identify that he felt in the pants pocket was rock cocaine. He claims this was \u2018plain.\u2019 This court does not find that credible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In a suppression hearing, a trial court assumes the role of the trier of fact. It is the trial court, then, that is best situated to determine the credibility of witnesses. We do not intend to suggest that there is no circumstance under which an officer can identify crack cocaine by plain feel; however, it is not this court\u2019s task to reevaluate the trial court\u2019s determination of witness credibility. The lower court simply did not find Officer Fite\u2019s testimony credible, and, the court having so found, the seizure of the cocaine in this instance was not within a legitimate plain-feel exception to the warrant requirement. The evidence was properly suppressed, and appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-9\">Dickinson, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
