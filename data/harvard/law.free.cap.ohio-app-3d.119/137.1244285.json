Combs was injured in an automobile accident with the tortfeasor, Francis Mainous. Mainous had liability insurance with Aetna Casualty and Surety Company in the amount of $100,000. Appellant had uninsured/underinsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage with Nationwide in the amount of $500,000 per person and $1,000,000 per accident. Appellant\u2019s UM policy contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">\u201cNo payment will be made until the limits of all other liability insurance and bonds that apply have been exhausted by payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">In April 1994, appellant sued Mainous for negligence. The parties agreed to settle the claim for $62,500, and appellant sought Nationwide\u2019s consent to the settlement before pursuing UM coverage. In a letter dated May 1, 1995, Nationwide stated that because the \u201ctortfeasor\u2019s limits [were] not sufficiently exhausted,\u201d there was not a valid underinsurance claim. Nationwide stated further that a settlement of $62,500 would constitute an abandonment of the underinsurance claim. Appellant settled the claim for $62,500. He then filed suit against Nationwide. Nationwide moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to Nationwide, finding on undisputed facts that the settlement of $62,500 was not sufficient to \u201cexhaust\u201d the $100,000 liability policy and, therefore, appellants were not entitled to UM benefits as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">In their sole assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment was in error. Appellants contend that under the authority of <em>Bogan v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 22, 521 N.E.2d 447, they satisfied the \u201cexhaustion requirement\u201d in their UM policy when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>they settled their claim with the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier for $62,500, or 62.5 percent of the value of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In <em>Bogan, </em>the tortfeasors had liability insurance in the amount of $25,000, and the injured insureds settled their case against the tortfeasors for $21,000, or $4,000 less than the liability policy limit. The Supreme Court preceded its discussion of the issues in that case by mentioning a list of public policy considerations that generally argue in favor of settlements over litigation. These include avoiding litigation \u201cwith its attendant expenses and resultant burden upon the legal system,\u201d \u201chastening] the payment to the injured party who obviously needs compensation soon after the injuries when the medical expenses begin to amass and when the anxiety level is probably quite high,\u201d and precluding \u201cproblems of proof.\u201d <em>Bogan, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 26, 521 N.E.2d at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Addressing the exhaustion requirement, the court in <em>Bogan </em>noted the plain meaning of the word \u201cexhaust,\u201d but declined to construe the term literally to find that a liability policy must be wholly paid upon before an insured can collect UM insurance. Instead, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\u201cAn injured insured satisfies the \u2018exhaustion\u2019 requirement in the underinsured motorist provision of his insurance policy when he receives from the underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier a commitment to pay <em>an amount </em>in settlement with the injured party retaining the right to proceed against his underinsured motorist insurance carrier only for those amounts in excess of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Following <em>Bogan, </em>other appeals courts addressing the exhaustion requirement have combined the Supreme Court\u2019s general discussion of litigation expenses with the particular facts of that case to engage in a kind of numerical calculation. They have found that a settlement amount satisfies the exhaustion requirement as long as the \u201cgap\u201d between the actual settlement amount and the maximum amount available under the liability policy approximates litigation costs saved. This approach was first adopted in <em>Queen City Indemn. Co. v. Wasdovich </em>(May 31, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. <em>56888, </em>unreported, 1990 WL 71536. Citing <em>Bogan, </em>the court concluded that a $20,000 settlement on a $50,000 liability policy did not fulfill the \u201cexhaustion requirement\u201d because $30,000 was neither a \u201cgenuine savings in litigation expenses as contemplated in <em>Bogan </em>\u201d nor \u201cas a matter of practicality receipt of the entire proceeds of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. As Nationwide points out, the rationale of <em>Queen City </em>was followed in <em>Stahl v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 599, 612 N.E.2d 1260 (relying on <em>Queen City, </em>the Third District found that a $1,500 settlement did not exhaust a $50,000 liability policy); and <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Cos. v. Grischkan </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 148, 620 N.E.2d 190 (citing <em>Queen City, </em>the Eighth District determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that a $75,000 settlement did not exhaust a $100,000 liability policy where projected litigation expenses were $10,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Notwithstanding this trend among other appellate courts, we do not agree that <em>Bogan </em>supports the analysis first used in <em>Queen City. Bogan </em>states plainly that the exhaustion requirement is satisfied if an injured party settles for <em>any </em>amount with the liability insurer as long as the UM carrier receives credit for the entire amount of the liability policy, that is, as long as the UM carrier is responsible only for amounts in excess of the full amount of the liability policy. <em>Bogan, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201c[T]he objective of the exhaustion clause * * * is quite clearly to <em>absolve the [UM] insurer from liability for those uncollected amounts which were below the stated limits of the underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s policy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 28, 521 N.E.2d at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The trial court expressed concern that a decision such as this one would expose the UM carriers to increased litigation, <em>\u201ci.e., </em>get rid of the tortfeasor defendant and substitute in his place an insurance company defendant.\u201d The Supreme Court addressed this issue in <em>Bogan, </em>stating that the exhaustion clause prevents an insured from abandoning his claim against the liability insurer and proceeding directly against the UM carrier by serving as a valid precondition to UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The standard of review for summary judgment is the same for both trial and appellate courts. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198, 199-200. Summary judgment will be granted if there are no genuine issues of material fact and, when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reasonable minds could only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 146, 524 N.E.2d 881, 883-884. There being no disputed facts, we find, based on the foregoing, that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment to Nationwide. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-9\">Koehler, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b182-10\">Powell, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b182-11\">Powell, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQ6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bogan v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 22, 521 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>N.E.2d 447. Therefore, I dissent and would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">I concur with the analyses set forth by the Eighth Appellate District in <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Cos. v. Ghischkan </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 148, 620 N.E.2d 190, and <em>Queen City Indemn. Co. v. Wasdovich </em>(May 31, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 56888, unreported, and by the Third Appellate District in <em>Stahl v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 599, 612 N.E.2d 1260. These decisions interpret <em>Bogan </em>as holding that an insured has not exhausted the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy unless the \u201cgap\u201d between the settlement amount accepted by the insured and the liability limit of tortfeasor\u2019s policy approximates the litigation costs saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The $37,500 gap between the settlement amount accepted by the appellants in this case and the $100,000 liability limit imposed by Mainous\u2019s policy simply does not bear any relationship to the actual costs appellants saved by choosing settlement over litigation. The trial court properly found that appellants are not entitled to underinsured motorist coverage on these facts under the rule enunciated in <em>Bogan. </em>Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
