Mrs. Caudill confronted each of the boys about Katie\u2019s comment and discovered that Katie had been sexually abused by her brothers. Mrs. Caudill also discovered, based upon her conversations with Katie\u2019s brothers, that appellant and Scott Tindle, a fifteen-year-old relative of the Caudills, were present when Katie was molested and participated in the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">As a result of Mrs. Caudill\u2019s discovery, the Butler County Children Services Board (\u201cBCCSB\u201d) and the Oxford Police Department became involved. Detective Dwight Johnson interviewed all of the Caudill children individually and obtained a written statement from appellant. Following Johnson\u2019s investigation, a delinquency complaint was filed against appellant alleging that he had committed acts of sexual abuse upon Katie and her five-year-old cousin, Tiffany Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On June 14, 1996, the state filed a motion seeking permission to allow the child victims to testify by closed circuit television from outside of the courtroom pursuant to R.C. 2151.3511. The motion indicated that if the child victims were to testify in front of appellant, they would suffer serious emotional trauma and would not be able to communicate regarding the allegations due to extreme fear. On July 9, 1996, appellant filed a motion to suppress any and all statements made by him to any investigating police officer, including his written confession. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to suppress and subsequently permitted Katie, Tiffany, Bobby and Josh to testify via closed circuit television at the adjudication hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Following the hearing, appellant was adjudicated delinquent by reason of the trial court finding that he had sexually abused Katie and Tiffany. The trial court found that appellant was guilty of the rape of Katie and felonious sexual penetration of Tiffany. The trial court ordered appellant to be placed in the custody of the Department of Youth Services for a minimum period of twelve months and a maximum period not to exceed his twenty-first birthday. It is from this judgment that appellant now appeals, setting forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by applying R.C. 2151.3511 in violation of his 6th and 14th Amendment rights to confront witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by misapplying R.C. 2151.3511.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by overruling his motion to suppress his confession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by convicting him of felonious sexual penetration against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by applying R.C. 2151.3511 in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to confront witnesses. Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to enter case-specific findings of fact that Katie, Tiffany, Bobby, and Josh would experience significant trauma if they were required to testify in court in appellant\u2019s presence, prior to allowing their out-of-court testimony by closed circuit television, violated his right to confront his accusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the accused in a criminal prosecution the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d Likewise, the Ohio Constitution provides that in any trial, the accused must be permitted \u201cto meet the witnesses face to face * * *; but provision may be made by law for the taking of the deposition by the accused or by the state, to be used for or against the accused, of any witness whose attendance can not be had at the trial, always securing to the accused means and the opportunity to be present in person and with counsel at the taking of such deposition, and to examine the witness face to face as fully and in the same manner as if in court.\u201d Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">While a face-to-face confrontation between an accused and the witnesses against him is an important component of a criminal proceeding, such confrontation is not \u201can indispensable element of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to confront one\u2019s accusers.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Craig </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 836, 849-850, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3166, 111 L.Ed.2d 666, 681; see, also, <em>State v. Self </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 73, 77, 564 N.E.2d 446, 450-451. A physical face-to-face encounter is not required in cases where the \u201cdenial of such confrontation is necessary to further an important public policy and * * * the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>at 850, 110 S.Ct. at 3166, 111 L.Ed.2d at 682, citing <em>Coy v. Iowa </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 1012, 1021, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 2803, 101 L.Ed.2d 857, 867; <em>Self, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 77, 564 N.E.2d at 450-451. The protection of child sexual abuse victims is an important public policy recognized in Ohio. <em>State v. Eastham </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 307, 310, 530 N.E.2d 409, 411-412. Thus, the state\u2019s interest in protecting the well-being of child sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>victims may, under certain circumstances, override an accused\u2019s right to confront the accusers in court. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 853, 110 S.Ct. at 3167-3168, 111 L.Ed.2d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">A special procedure designed to allow a child sexual abuse victim to testify at trial through closed circuit television is permissible if the state proves the necessity of such a procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 855, 110 S.Ct. at 3168-3169, 111 L.Ed.2d at 685. The necessity determination must be made on a case-by-case basis after the court has heard evidence on the issue, and the court must find not only that the child victim would suffer trauma due to the presence of the accused, but that the emotional stress from which the child would suffer would be significant. <em>Id. </em>at 855-856, 110 S.Ct. at 3168-3169, 111 L.Ed.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">R.C. 2151.3511(C) provides for the testimony of a child sex offense victim by closed circuit television. \u201cR.C. 2151.3511 applies only when the accused is a child and the victim is a child under the age of eleven years.\u201d' <em>In re Burchfield </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 148, 153, 555 N.E.2d 325, 330. The statute further provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201cFor purposes of divisions (C) and (D) of this section, a juvenile judge .may order the testimony of a child victim to be taken outside of the room in which a proceeding is being conducted if the judge determines that the child victim is unavailable to testify in the room in the physical presence of the child charged with the violation due to one or more of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">* <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">\u201c(2) The inability of the child victim to communicate about the alleged violation because of extreme fear, failure of memory, or another similar reason;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u201c(3) The substantial likelihood that the child victim will suffer serious emotional trauma from so testifying.\u201d R.C. 2151.3511(E).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">When the trial court determines whether to allow the testimony of a child victim in accordance with R.C. 2151.3511, the court \u201cshall enter the determination and findings on the record in the proceeding.\u201d R.C. 2151.3511(F)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">Dr. Sherry Baker, a psychologist with the Children\u2019s Diagnostic Center in Hamilton, testified that, in general, a child may experience trauma when testifying in front of the alleged perpetrator and that such trauma would overwhelm the child\u2019s ability to cope. Baker stated that a child who is highly traumatized would re-experience the trauma by talking about it in front of the perpetrator. In addition, Baker testified that a child who was forced to observe sexual abuse upon another child can have problems discussing the observations in front of the alleged perpetrator. According to Baker, \u201csimply being exposed to abuse can have the same effect as experiencing it.\u201d Baker then began discussing Katie in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>particular; however, the remainder of the testimony was not recorded. In a supplementation of the record submitted by appellant and appellee, the parties agreed that Baker recommended that Katie have no contact with appellant as a result of her determination that Katie had been sexually abused by multiple people.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Casey Caudill testified that he forced his younger brothers, through the use of threats, to perform and observe sexual acts upon Katie. Christopher Caudill testified that he is very afraid of Casey and that Casey told him that he would hurt him if he told about anything that he had seen. Christopher also testified that he was afraid of appellant and was afraid that appellant would try to hurt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Josh Caudill testified that Casey had threatened him and told him not to tell about any of the things he had seen. Josh testified that Casey \u201cwas like taking up for [speaking for] the whole group,\u201d which included himself, appellant, and Tindle, and that Casey threatened both him and his brother Bobby. Josh stated that he was very afraid of Casey and that Casey had cut his (Josh\u2019s) arm and throat. Josh also stated that Casey had thrown a knife at Christopher, which became lodged in Christopher\u2019s ankle. Josh stated that on one occasion he announced that he was going to \u201ctell\u201d about the sexual abuse and that Casey shoved him into a broken windowsill, where a protruding nail cut his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Bobby Caudill testified that he was handcuffed to a bedpost and forced to watch as Casey and appellant raped Katie. Bobby testified that Casey threatened him with a knife and told him that if he told anyone about what had happened, Casey would kill him. Bobby also stated that appellant threatened him and said that appellant would kill him if he told anyone. Bobby stated that he was very scared and afraid to tell anyone about what had happened. Bobby testified that he is afraid of appellant because appellant told him that he was going to kill him when he gets out of the detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The record indicates that the state\u2019s motion requesting that Katie, Tiffany, Christopher, Bobby, and Josh be permitted to testify via closed circuit television was discussed prior to the adjudication hearing. Specifically, during the adjudication hearing, in response to an objection by defense counsel, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Is that what you\u2019re going to * * * is this one of the witnesses you indicated * * * you talked about in pre-trial[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] that * * * you mean she\u2019s not an alleged victim today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cQ. [Prosecutor] Oh, no. No. Tiffany\u2019s an alleged victim and she\u2019s one of the victims of * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Furthermore, prior to the commencement of the closed circuit television testimony, the court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections to the televised testimony of Christopher Caudill because he was eleven years old when the complaint against appellant was filed. See R.C. 2151.3511. However, as to the other child witnesses, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cBY THE COURT: And Katie, obviously is to both clients. So Bobby and Josh, as the Court indicated, we would permit the testimony to take place that way [via closed circuit television] and reserve that issue for the Court of Appeals if necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Although the record indicates that the closed circuit television testimony issue was discussed at a pretrial conference and the trial court\u2019s final determination of the matter is contained in the record during the adjudication hearing, the trial court did not enter findings related to its determination that Katie, Tiffany, Bobby, and Josh would be permitted to testify by two-way closed circuit television as required by R.C. 2151.3511(F)(2). Therefore, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">It is our belief, however, that the trial court\u2019s error is harmless under the circumstances of this case. After carefully reviewing the record, we can find no evidence indicating that any of appellant\u2019s substantial rights were materially prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to enter findings on the record. The record contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the closed circuit television testimony. Further, the child witnesses in this case testified under oath, were subject to full cross-examination, were able to be observed by the judge and appellant as they testified, and were able to observe appellant as they testified. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s constitutional right to confront his accusers was not compromised. See <em>Self, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 79, 564 N.E.2d at 452-453. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by incorrectly applying R.C. 2151.3511. Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to require Bobby and Josh, two child witnesses, as opposed to the two child victims named in the complaint, to testify in court and in his presence violated the provisions of R.C. 2151.3511.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">This court has recently addressed the issue of whether a child who witnesses the sexual abuse of another child can be considered a victim in order to allow the witness to testify via closed circuit television. <em>In re Tindle </em>(Feb. 10, 1997), Butler App. No. CA96-08-151, unreported, 1997 WL 50157. In <em>Tindle, </em>we held that where there is sufficient evidence for the trial court to determine that a child witness would be unable to testify in the defendant\u2019s presence due to fear and the substantial likelihood of emotional trauma, such a witness is a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2151.3511 and allowing the testimony of such a witness to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>televised from outside the courtroom would fulfill the purpose behind the statute. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>In re Graves </em>(Apr. 10, 1995), Clinton App. No. CA94-07-018, unreported, at 10,1995 WL 155367.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">After carefully reviewing the record, we find sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision to allow Bobby and Josh to testify by closed circuit television from outside the courtroom. Dr. Baker testified that a child who observes the sexual abuse of another child can have problems discussing those observations in front of the perpetrator. Furthermore, Josh and Bobby testified that they were afraid of appellant and had been threatened by Casey, who was \u201ctaking up\u201d for himself and appellant. Moreover, Bobby specifically testified that appellant had threatened him. Therefore, based upon our analysis in <em>Tindle, </em>appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In his third assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by overruling his motion to suppress. Appellant argues that his due process rights were violated when he was interrogated by police because he was separated from his mother at critical junctures, his confession contains multiple rewrites in the margin which correspond to the elements of the charged crimes, the interrogation lasted for three to four hours, an officer, bet appellant that his confession contained mistakes, and the interrogation involved a series of lie detector tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">An appellate court may not disturb a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to. suppress where it is supported by substantial, credible evidence. <em>Maumee v. Johnson </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 169, 171, 628 N.E.2d 115, 116; <em>State v. Emerson </em>(Mar. 6,1995), Clermont App. No. CA94-11-093, unreported, 1995 WL 90183. A trial court serves as the trier of fact in a suppression hearing and must weigh the evidence, and judge the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 1 OBR 57, 57-58, 437 N.E.2d 583, 584-585. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, an appellate court accepts the trial court\u2019s factual findings, relies upon the trial court\u2019s ability to assess the credibility of witnesses, and independently determines \u201cwithout deference to the trial court, whether the court has applied the appropriate legal standard.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 688, 691, 654 N.E.2d 1034, 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In order to determine whether a confession given by a juvenile is voluntary, \u201cthe court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including the age, mentality and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; and the existence of physical deprivation or inducement.\u201d <em>In re Watson </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 86, 548 N.E.2d 210, paragraph one of the syllabus, citing <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 40\u201441, 3 O.O.3d 18, 23-24, 358 N.E.2d 1051, 1058-1059. A juvenile\u2019s confession is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>not rendered involuntary where the juvenile does not have either a parent or an attorney present. <em>Watson </em>at 89, 548 N.E.2d at 213-214.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Detective Dwight Johnson, an Oxford police officer, testified that on May 27, 1996, appellant and his mother arrived at the Oxford police station at approximately 11:00 a.m. Johnson testified that he escorted appellant and his mother to a conference room, where he read the <em>Miranda </em>rights to appellant. Johnson stated that after reading the <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant and his mother both signed the <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver card. Johnson stated that appellant\u2019s mother was present during the appellant\u2019s initial interview. According to, Johnson, during the initial interview, appellant denied any involvement in the alleged sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Johnson stated that he informed appellant that he did not believe that appellant was being completely truthful and that he asked appellant if he would submit to a Computer Voice Stress Analyzer (\u201cCVSA\u201d) test. Johnson testified that appellant and his mother agreed that appellant would take the CVSA test. Appellant was then taken to another room where the CVSA is located and introduced to Sergeant Daniel Umstead, who conducted the test. Appellant\u2019s mother was not present during the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Johnson stated that after the CVSA test was concluded, he and Umstead talked with appellant and that appellant then offered a written statement on a form that contains the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Johnson stated that appellant\u2019s statement indicated that he had touched Katie and Tiffany. Johnson testified that he read through appellant\u2019s statement and then had appellant clarify a few areas that were unclear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Johnson stated that during the interrogation process, appellant was not under arrest, was not handcuffed, and was free to go at any time. Johnson stated that appellant appeared to understand the procedure, answered all the questions that were asked of him, did not hesitate in what he said, was not shaking, and did not appear to be nervous, as his voice did not fluctuate when he spoke with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">According to Johnson, the entire interrogation process concluded at approximately 3:30 p.m., approximately four hours after appellant and his mother arrived at the police station. Johnson stated that appellant was offered the restroom and water. Johnson indicated that he may have \u201cbet\u201d appellant a cola that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>made some mistakes in his written confession, but Johnson also indicated that he would not have offered to buy. appellant a cola or anything else in exchange for appellant making changes to his statement. Johnson testified that appellant never made any request to have his mother present following the initial interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Sergeant Daniel Umstead, an Oxford police officer, testified that he performed a CVSA test on appellant on May 27, 1996. Umstead testified that prior to performing the test, he had appellant read, and he read to appellant, a consent form that advised appellant of his rights and that appellant signed the form. Umstead testified that during the testing, appellant made some admissions and he took a break to talk with Johnson and appellant\u2019s mother because it was apparent that appellant was not being totally truthful. Umstead stated that he, Johnson, and appellant\u2019s mother discussed the possibility of having appellant\u2019s mother sit with appellant during the remainder of the testing, but that they all agreed that the testing should continue without appellant\u2019s mother because appellant might not be willing to openly discuss the situation in his mother\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Umstead stated that he performed three CVSA tests upon appellant during a period of thirty minutes to an hour. Umstead stated that appellant appeared to understand what was going on. Umstead stated that appellant was calm and \u201c[p]retty matter of fact.\u201d Umstead testified that he does not recall appellant expressing a desire to have his mother present during either the CVSA tests or the execution of the written confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Patricia Rose, appellant\u2019s mother, testified that she took appellant to the Oxford police station on May 27, 1996. Rose stated that Johnson escorted her and appellant to a conference room, where he read appellant his rights. Rose stated that she and appellant executed a <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver. Rose testified that she understood that she could have an attorney present but did not feel that she needed one at that time. Rose testified that she did not object to the CVSA test. Rose stated that while appellant was taking the CVSA test, she asked if she could see appellant, but she was not permitted to see him at that time. Rose also indicated that appellant had been questioned by the police prior to the May 27, 1996 questioning on an unrelated matter and that he was vaguely familiar with the questioning process.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Appellant testified that when he arrived at the Oxford police station on May 27, 1996, he was nervous. Appellant stated that when Johnson read the <em>Miranda </em>rights to him, he was given a card to read along with Johnson and that he read part of the card along with Johnson. After Johnson read the rights to appellant and asked him if he understood, appellant stated that he nodded his head affirmatively. Appellant stated that he signed the waiver card because he was nervous and afraid. Appellant testified that during the three-to-four-hour inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>rogation process, he never received a restroom break although he did not ask for one. Appellant stated that he did receive a drink when he was writing his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Appellant testified that before he began the CVSA test, he requested his mother\u2019s presence but was told that she could not be present. Appellant also testified that he asked for his mother when he began to complete his written statement, but was told that his mother could not be present at that time either. Appellant stated that after Johnson read his confession, Johnson told him to write certain words on it. Appellant stated that he wrote the words as requested by Johnson, because he was afraid that he was going to go to jail if he did not do what Johnson told him to do. Appellant also indicated that while he had been questioned by the police on a previous occasion, he really does not understand the questioning procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that appellant\u2019s statement was knowing and voluntary. The court found that appellant understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and had no right to have his mother present during any stage of the interrogation, although her presence during the initial interview and questioning was a courtesy to appellant. The court found that appellant and his mother consented to the CVSA procedure and that \u201cit was not surprising that [appellant] would start talking a little bit more without his mother\u201d present. The trial court found that there was no police coercion and that the police handled the situation with \u201ckid gloves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Based upon a review of the testimony presented at the suppression hearing, we conclude that under the totality of the circumstances the trial court did not err in determining that the statement given by appellant was voluntary. See <em>Watson, </em>47 Ohio St.3d 86, 548 N.E.2d 210, paragraph one of the syllabus. Appellant had no right to have his mother present at any stage of the interrogation process, the interrogation process was not unreasonably lengthy or intense, the confession was clarified, not rewritten, and appellant voluntarily, and with his mother\u2019s approval, submitted to the CVSA tests. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. See <em>Maumee, </em>90 Ohio App.3d at 171, 628 N.E.2d at 116. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In his fourth assignment of error, appellant contends that his conviction of felonious sexual penetration upon Tiffany was against the manifest weight of the evidence because his first confession draft, his trial testimony, and Tiffany\u2019s trial testimony fail to establish vaginal penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">When reviewing a manifest weight claim, an appellate court is required to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and to decide \u201cwhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty .beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492, 503. See, also, <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 172, 10 O.O.3d 340, 341-342, 383 N.E.2d 132, 134-135. Thus, we must determine whether there is substantial evidence contained in the record from which the trial court \u201ccould reasonably conclude that all the elements of an offense have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Eskridge </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 59, 526 N.E.2d 304, 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Appellant was convicted of a sexual act upon Tiffany which, if committed by an adult, would constitute felonious sexual penetration in violation of R.C. 2907.12. R.C. 2907.12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201c(A)(1) No person, without privilege to do so, shall insert any part of the body or any instrument, apparatus, or other object into the vaginal or anal cavity of another who is not the spouse of the offender * * *, when any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201c(b) The other person is less than thirteen years of age * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Christopher Caudill testified that he observed appellant place \u201chis finger in Tiffany\u2019s private.\u201d Tiffany testified that appellant has touched her \u201cprivate part\u201d with his hand. Tiffany also testified that appellant touched her on the outside of her shorts and panties. Bobby Caudill testified that appellant \u201chunched\u201d Tiffany and that appellant\u2019s pants were off and Tiffany\u2019s pants were partially down.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Detective Johnson testified that appellant represented to him during his confession that he had inserted a finger into Tiffany. In his confession, appellant indicated that he inserted his finger into Tiffany\u2019s vagina. However, at the adjudication hearing, appellant testified that he wrestled with Tiffany and placed his hand over her clothes on her vaginal area, but he did not place his finger into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Based upon a careful review of the record before us, we find that the state presented sufficient, credible evidence which would allow a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that appellant was guilty of felonious sexual penetration upon Tiffany. See <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 273, 574 N.E.2d at 503. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-12\">William W. Young, P.J., and Koehler, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-11\">.

Johnson stated that he went through appellant\u2019s statement with him in the same fashion, so as to clarify any unclear words, phrases, or statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
