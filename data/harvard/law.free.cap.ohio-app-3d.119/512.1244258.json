Upon approaching her car and speaking with her, Officer Haury noticed a strong odor of alcohol on her and observed that her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. After having appellee get out of her car, he asked her to perform several field sobriety tests. She performed the tests poorly and was arrested for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), and for failure to reasonably control her vehicle, a minor misdemeanor in violation of R.C. 4511.202. Later, she agreed to submit to a breath test, which indicated a breath-alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d) of .135 grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath. As a result, she was also charged with driving with a BAC greater than .10 grams, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(3). .</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">At her initial appearance on June 3, 1996, appellee entered a plea of not guilty to all three charges. On July 18,1996, appellee filed a motion to dismiss both the R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) and (3) charges against her on the basis of double jeopardy. However, this motion was overruled by the trial court on July 23, 1996, on the basis that an administrative license suspension h\u00e1d not been imposed against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">On August 5, 1996, appellee filed a motion to dismiss and/or suppress the two charges under R.C. 4511.19, challenging whether there was reasonable cause to stop her, whether there was probable cause to arrest her, and the procedures used in administering the breath test. A hearing was held on appellee\u2019s motion on August 13, 1996, at which both appellee and the state stipulated that the calibration solution used to calibrate the breath tester was from Batch No. 95080, one of the calibration solutions included in a memorandum written by the former Director of the Alcohol Testing Program for the Department of Health, Leonard Porter, on January 29, 1996. That memorandum pertained to the calibration formula\u2019s need to be adjusted to increase its accuracy, and it included a list of the affected batches with new target concentrations and ranges. Subsequently, the Department of Health repudiated Porter\u2019s findings, stating that he had been wrong and that the solutions were reliable as originally stated in the solution affidavit from the Department of Health.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">On September 4, 1996, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion to suppress evidence with regard to her BAC charge under R.C. 4511.19(A)(3), but overruled her motion to suppress evidence pertaining to the charge of driving under the influence of alcohol under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), finding that the police had reasonable cause to stop her and probable cause to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The state timely filed the instant appeal, pursuant to Crim.R. 12(J) and R.C. 2945.67, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in granting the appellee\u2019s motion to suppress her BAC test result.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The state failed to provide a transcript of the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress. Usually, an appellant must provide a reviewing court with a transcript of the proceedings in the trial court in order to demonstrate its claimed error. App.R. 9. Failure to do so normally necessitates a presumption that the judgment and proceedings in the trial court were valid. <em>Knapp v. Edwards Laboratories </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 197, 15 O.O.3d 218, 400 N.E.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">However, in the instant matter, the transcript of the suppression hearing is not necessary in order to demonstrate the state\u2019s claimed error because it is clear from the trial court\u2019s judgment entry that it did not rely upon any evidence presented at that hearing in granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress the breath test results. Rather, the trial court explicitly stated that its decision to grant the motion with regard to the BAC charge was based upon decisions rendered by other trial courts outside this district and Porter\u2019s memorandum. The only factual findings made by the court were based on evidence presented at the hearing with regard to appellee\u2019s claim that the officers did not have reasonable cause to stop her or probable cause to arrest her. Those issues were not appealed. Thus, the trial court\u2019s denial of appellee\u2019s motion to suppress with regard to the charge of driving under the influence is not at issue in this appeal, and no transcript is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In its assignment of error, the state argues that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to' suppress the results of the breath test simply because of use of a calibration solution from the batches of calibration solution criticized by Porter. A motion to suppress is the proper way to challenge the results of a breath test when a defendant is charged with a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(3). <em>Defiance v. Kretz </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 1, 573 N.E.2d 32; <em>State v. Smoot </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 702, 600 N.E.2d 772. Admissibility of the results of a breath test depends upon whether there has been substantial compliance with the requirements promulgated by the Department of Health. <em>Id. </em>at 705, 600 N.E.2d at 774. At the hearing on her motion to suppress, appellee challenged the procedures used in administering her BAC test. Specifically, she challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>whether the calibration of the instrument had been properly checked before and after her test in light of Porter\u2019s memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">An abuse of discretion \u201cconnotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149. See, also, <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 413, 575 N.E.2d 167, 170-171. The trial court stated that in granting appellee\u2019s motion, it considered the fact that the batch of calibration solution used in administering appellee\u2019s test was on Porter\u2019s list. It also considered the fact that other courts across the state have rejected BAC tests resulting from batches listed in the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">A trial court is free to rely upon the <em>logic </em>of courts outside its appellate district in rendering a decision. However, other such decisions are merely persuasive and do not constitute binding authority. Although technically not judicial notice, the trial court accepted the factual findings of other courts outside its appellate district. A trial court can only take note of its own factual findings based on the evidence before the court until appropriate precedent has been established within its own district or by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Otherwise, such factual findings are insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">This court has subsequently addressed the merits of Porter\u2019s memorandum. <em>State v. Mouser </em>(Feb. 14, 1997), Geauga App. No. 96-G-1992, unreported, 1997 WL 123763.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject both the state\u2019s and appellee\u2019s arguments, as they are based on Porter\u2019s authority to issue the memorandum. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Mouser, </em>this court specifically held that Porter\u2019s memorandum was essentially \u201ca recommendation that the mathematical calibration formula be adjusted prospectively to further narrow the range of variation in connection with the calibration of the machines used in such exercises so as to increase modestly the percentage of probability accuracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Further, we held that the present variation resulting under the then-existing mathematical formula did not have any substantive effect on a given test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\u201cWe do not translate this language to mean that the present equipment, application formula, and batch solution employed have resulted in invalid testing results, or that the range variations are beyond acceptable probability levels. Additionally, we find nothing in this material which suggests that a vial from the solution batch referenced here was not proper nor that the equipment was not properly calibrated for the test in this given case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The sole reason stated by the trial court for granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress was that the decisions from other districts essentially found that a <em>per se </em>suppression was required. Based on <em>Mouser, </em>and the fact that the evidence before the court was insufficient as a matter of law, the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Accordingly, the state\u2019s sole assignment of error has merit, and the judgment of the trial court is reversed. This case is hereby remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-7\">Ford, P.J., and Nader, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">. Neither party included a copy of Porter\u2019s memorandum or the Department of Health\u2019s repudiation in the record. The statements made in this opinion with regard to the memorandum are thus gleaned from both parties' briefs and this court\u2019s knowledge of the memorandum as predicated on previous opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">. Although appellee alludes to the fact that the state did not perfect its appeal pursuant to Crim.R. 12(J), this court held on January 3, 1997, that the appeal was properly perfected. Upon further review for purposes of this opinion, we again find appellee's contention that the appeal was not properly perfected to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\">. Although <em>Mouser </em>was based on a motion to withdraw a no contest plea, its holding is nevertheless applicable to the instant set of facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
