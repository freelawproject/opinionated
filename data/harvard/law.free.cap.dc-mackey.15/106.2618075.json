The statute provided that the company should keep the bridge and draw in efficient working condition at all times. A schooner passing through the draw of the bridge so injured it that it was immediately closed by the company and kept so for four days, during which time the repairs made necessary to the draw were prosecuted with all due diligence. By reason of the closing of the draw, a tug boat was detained and prevented from performing her regular business. <em>Held, </em>that she was entitled to recover damages for the detention.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-10\">The Case is stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-11\">Nathaniel Wilson for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-12\">Those who, for commercial purposes, are using a navigable stream as a highway for vessels have the primary and paramount right thereto ; and every obstruction of the navigation thereof, or hindrance to the free passage of vessels upon it, is <em>prima facie </em>unlawful.

Pierce on Railroads, p. 202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">The charter or legislative authority for the maintenance of such a bridge is to be strictly construed; nothing is conceded hut what is granted in plain terms.

In Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island the statutes require the corporations to keep this highways in repair, <em>\u201c so </em>that the same may be safe and convenient for travelers, with their teams, carts and carriages at all seasons of the year.\u201d Angel\u00ed on Highways, \u00a7 259, note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-9\">A bridge carried away by a flood, must be rebuilt within a reasonable time, regard being had to the importance of the road, the recognition of the work, the opportunity of procuring materials, and other circumstances connected with its 'reconstruction.

It is bound to employ skilful workmen, and to see. to it that the bridge has been properly constructed and properly guarded and inspected. Having done this, the company does its whole duty and cannot be held as an insurer; it is not liable for accidents which skill and care are unable to avoid. Toledo, Peoria <em>&amp; </em>W. R. R. <em>vs. </em>Conroy, 68 Ill., 560.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-5\">In the case of Townsend <em>vs. </em>Turnpike Road (6 John., 90), a traveler with his team was passing over a bridge of the defendant, and the bridge broke and fell, killing one of the horses. The proof showed that the defect was latent, and that on the morning of the day of the accident, the bridge had been inspected and some repairs had been put upon it by the defendant. Held, that <em>\u201c </em>the defendants are bound to bestow ordinary care and diligence in the construction and preservation of their bridges. They are not responsible for accidents if those accidents do not arise from the want of ordinary care and skill. See also Wilson <em>vs. </em>Susq. Co., 21 Barb., 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-6\">The degree of diligence required of toll bridge and turnpike road companies has been held to be greater than that enforced ordinarily, because of the contract relations between the parties and the special consideration paid.

St., 290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-7\">When a corporation, in consideration of the franchises granted to it, is bound by its charter to keep a road or bridge in repair, it is liable for any injury to a person, arising from want of repair, whether the defect be patent or latent, unless he be in default, or unless the defect arose from inevitable accident, tempest, lightning, or the wrongful act of some third person, of which they had no notice or knowledge.

St., 312, relied upon for the plaintiff, is in favor of the defendant and not against it. The statutory requirement in that case was that the bridge should not be so built \u201cas to injure, stop or interrupt the navigation of said river by boats, rafts or other vessels.\u201d It is practically conceded in that case that if the obstruction had been by act of providence or of a third person the company would not be liable.

For this he claims damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>It was agreed that the case should be certified to the General Term, and if the court should be of the opinion that the plaintiff should pay the judgment, that judgment should be entered for $293.15 with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">As set forth in the agreed statement of facts, it appears that the draw of the bridge had been injured by a schooner which passed through it, and that it was immediately closed by the company and kept so for four days, during which time the-repairs made necessary to the draw were prosecuted with due diligence, and this tug boat was detained and prevented from performing her regular business during that period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The case seems to have been argued for the defence as if the proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff was the act of this schooner in passing through this bridge and injuring the draw. That is not the subject of complaint on the part of the plaintiff. The subject of complaint is the closing of the draw by the railroad company \u2014 the voluntary closing of it \u2014 and the keeping of it closed for a period of four days. We have been referred to authorities holding, generally, that a railroad or bridge company is not an insurer of the condition of the road or bridge at all times and of its fitness for travel; that a company of that kind is simply responsible for due diligence, and in this case it seems that it used due diligence in putting the bridge in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">It is claimed that'the closing of the draw was necessary in order to make the necessary repairs. It was necessary, it is said, in order that travel, over the bridge could be resumed, which was vastly more important than the travel up and down the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">It does not appear, however, from the facts, that it was at all necessary to keep the draw closed in order to make the repairs, and it does not appear either that it was necessary for the ordinary travel, because <em>non constat </em>that the travel might not have been conveyed across the river by a ferry boat. But whether it was or not is immaterial, unless the proposition can be maintained that the right of way over the bridge was paramount to the right to navigate the river, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>and that can hardly be said in the face of the law which gives the railroad company the privilege of going over the river, and which says that it shall keep the bridge and draw in efficient working condition at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We think on the whole that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and the judgment will be entered according to the stipulation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
