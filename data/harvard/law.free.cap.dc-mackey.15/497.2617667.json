G.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">The plaintiff thereupon moved the court for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence which was granted. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-9\">Mills Dean for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-10\">The defendant\u2019s pleas and affidavit taken together do not set forth specifically and in \u201c precise and distinct terms \u201d a defence to the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-11\">He is sued for the price of certain specific articles which are described in the bill of particulars to a degree of particularity ; the date of sale and delivery is given. If he did not buy the articles, or if he has paid for. them, it was an easy matter for him to say so, but he contents himself with filing inconsistent pleas, swearing that they are \u201c correct and true,\u201d and then goes on and says he had dealings down to about January 19,1883 (the date of the alleged sale and delivery), and claims to have paid in full all he ever promised or that he owed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-12\">In Bank <em>vs. </em>Hitz, Mac A. <em>&amp; </em>Mackey, 200, the learned Chief Justice says of the 73d rule:</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-13\"><em>\u201c </em>Now what does the rule mean, this being its office ? * * * It says that the defendant shall set out his grounds of defence and swear to them.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-15\">The defendant has not done this. The court does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>know whether the defendant will claim at the trial that he never got the goods, that the plaintiffs gave them to him, or that he has paid for them. Under the first plea he might deny ever having received the goods; under the second plea he might claim the plaintiffs gave him the goods, and under the third plea he might claimthat he paid for the goods. He swears that all the pleas are true, but nowhere gives the grounds of his defence ; he nowhere denies that the plaintiffs sold and delivered the goods charged in the bill of particulars; he nowhere claims that he has paid for the goods sued for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-4\">What, then, are his grounds of defence ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-5\">The object of the 73d rule is the same as that of a plea, <em>i. e., </em>to inform the court of the nature or grounds of the defence, and the defendant here has wholly failed to set forth his grounds; he leaves us as much in the dark as we would be if he had filed only the plea of <em>non-assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\">The pleas and affidavit must he taken as a whole; the affidavit treats the pleas as the \u201c record of facts \u201d (see Bank <em>vs. </em>Hitz, <em>supra), </em>and taken together they only set up \u201c a vague and general denial,\u201d and fail to show \u201cthe particulars of the defence relied upon.\u201d See Ford <em>vs. </em>Cornish, 2 Mac A., 59.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-7\">A. K. Browne and T. Q. Hildebrant for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-8\">In support of his plea, the defendant files his affidavit that the averments of the plea are true, and while it is not artistically drawn, it in substance complies fully with the requirements of the rule as interpreted in the case of Ford <em>vs. </em>Cornish, 2 Mac A., 57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-9\">Taking the plea and affidavit together, it is difficult to see how payment could be more strongly pleaded. It is stated: \u201c I had dealings with them down to about January 19 (the date of this bill), and purchased clothing from them at different times, and have paid them in full all that I ever promised or that I owe them.\u201d The court will construe this plea according to the plain meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>words used, that the defendant states he has paid all he ever promised, and all he ever owed the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-4\">Rule 29 says: \u201c Every plea shall set forth the true defence upon which the defendant supposes he may defeat the plaintiff\u2019s action. It may deny all or any particular mentioned allegation of the declaration, or it may confess and avoid,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">The defendant in this case has denied the promise, denied the indebtedness, and averred, in as plain language as can be used, that he has paid the account on which suit is brought. \u201c I have paid them in full all that I ever promised to pay or ever owed them.\u201d Could language be more explicit? Will it be held that he should have specified the time, date of payment, the place where paid, the kind of money paid, the individual member of the firm to whom it was paid, whether by check, gold, currency, or otherwise ? Such a claim would be the climax of absurdity. What else than he has stated could he state unless he gave such particulars? We submit that rule 13 does not require a more specific statement. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment, \u201cunless the defendant shall file, along with his plea, an affidavit of defence, denying the right of plaintiff as to the whole or some specified part o\u00ed his claim, and specifically stating also, in precise and distinct terms, the grounds of his defence, which must be such as would, if true, be sufficient to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim in whole or in part.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-6\">\u201c I have paid them in full all that I ever promised or ever owed them.\u201d If this is not stated in distinct and precise terms, we do not understand the meaning of the words. It will not be claimed that if the statement is true the plaintiff can recover in this case. If true; it certainly defeats the action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b517-7\">Mr. Justice Merrick</author>\n<p id=\"A1l\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">This was an appeal from a final judgment rendered by the circuit court under the T3d rule for the deficiency of the affidavit of defence under that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The party pleaded \u201c never indebted,\u201d that he did not promise, and that, before the action was commenced, he, by payment, discharged the claim, and then he made an affidavit under it in these words :</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u201c That the foregoing pleas are correct and true, and I deny the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover from me the amount claimed in their declaration, or any other sum of money from me ; that while the plaintiffs were said to have an existence as a firm I had dealings with them down to about January 19,1888, and purchased clothing from them at different times, and had paid them in full all that I ever promised or that I owe them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The rule requires that, along with the pleas, there shall be a specific statement of defence. Now it is quite apparent upon reading this affidavit that it is no more than a change of the terms in the plea, but does not state any specific defence or give any specific warning to the plaintiff as to what the defendant means to rely upon for the purpose of defeating the claim. It is a matter entirely free from doubt in the mind of the court that this affidavit which I have read does not conform to the spirit and requirement of the rule, and therefore the judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
