By the statute of Virginia the note was not entitled to days of grace, so that the note matured on the 5th of July, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-9\">The declaration was. filed, summons issued, and service had on defendants July 6, 1882. Counsel for respective parties agreed that, unless the note was barred by limitations, judgment might be entered for plaintiffs. Under this agreement the only question raised in the case was whether in the computation of the three years\u2019 limitation the day when the cause of action accrued, viz., the 6th of July, 1879, was to be included or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-10\">The court below included that day and rendered judgment for defendants, from which the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-11\">C.

In the case at bar, the note was due July 5, 1879, and the defendants had all that day within which to pay; no action lay until the whole day (July 5) had expired, and the right of action did not accrue until the 6th of July, 1879.

The only defence interposed is the Statute of Limitations, which provides that such suits shall be brought <em>\u201c </em>within three years ensuing the cause of such action, and not after.\u201d Act 1115, ch. 23, sec. 2. If the day on which the cause of action accrued, which in this case was July 6,1819, is to be included, the action\"was begun one day too late; if excluded, it was brought in proper time. Authorities differ on this point, but we prefer the rule followed in New York and Pennsylvania, which excludes the day on which the cause of action accrues, as a point of time after which the limitation ensues. The three years of limitation ensuing the 6th of July, 1819, had not expired when this suit was brought. Judgment is, therefore, for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
