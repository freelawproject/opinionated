J.</author>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Defendant and appellant Tomiekia Johnson (defendant) was convicted of the first degree murder of her husband, Marcus Lemons (Lemons). (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant contends, inter alia, that her statutory and constitutional rights to be present at trial were violated when the trial court, without defendant being present, allowed the bailiff to demonstrate the operation of the murder weapon in response to a jury request and to respond to questions from the jury about how the weapon operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that the trial court erred by allowing the bailiff, without the presence of defendant, to conduct for the jury a demonstration of how the murder weapon operated and answer jury questions about that subject, but that error was not prejudicial because defendant was present when the prosecution\u2019s expert provided testimony that was consistent with the bailiff\u2019s communications with the jury. The failure of defendant\u2019s counsel to object to the colloquy between the bailiff and the jury forfeited any contention concerning that process. We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">1. <em>Summary of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\"><em>A </em>surveillance video from the inside of a bar showed Lemons and defendant drinking at the bar on February 21, 2009. Later that evening, the driver of a car and her passenger observed a physical altercation between a female and a male outside their car and noticed that when the female departed in the couple\u2019s car, they only saw the female\u2019s head; neither the driver nor her passenger saw the male. They testified the man and woman were African-Americans, and that the man wore a baseball hat. Their descriptions of the man and the woman were consistent with the physical appearance of defendant and Lemons in the video at the bar, and with the hat subsequently recovered near Lemons\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">In response to a 911 call from defendant\u2019s mother, the police found Lemons\u2019s body in defendant\u2019s car parked outside her mother\u2019s house. Lemons had suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head. Defendant was arrested. The police found in the car a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun, loaded with a magazine containing five rounds and one round in the chamber. Just behind the driver\u2019s seat there was an expended .25-caliber shell casing. The hammer on the gun was in the cocked position, and the safety lever was in the center position.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">A deputy medical examiner concluded that based on the trajectory of the bullet and the wound, the gun was in a position above and to the right of Lemons when it was fired and that the gun was in contact or near contact with Lemons\u2019s head. She further opined that Lemons was seated on the front passenger seat, and the shooter was standing near the front passenger doorframe.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>At the time of the shooting, defendant was a seven-year veteran California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer. Nevertheless, she had a history of making threats, firing her weapon, and engaging in threatening conduct, including against Lemons.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">According to defendant, she and Lemons argued on the way home from the bar on the evening of February 21, 2009, and she exited the car to walk home. She thought Lemons was going to reach for a gun that she believed was in her purse that she left in the car. Lemons was in the passenger seat with one foot on the ground. When defendant saw the gun on the ground on the passenger side of the car, she was afraid Lemons would get it so she picked it up, squeezed the gun tightly, and, in so doing, it fired accidentally, striking Lemons. She drove him to her parents\u2019 house and told them to call 911 because she had shot and killed Lemons. Defendant\u2019s firearms and trajectory reconstruction expert said that Lemons did not suffer a contact wound and that there was not sufficient evidence to determine Lemons\u2019s position when he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">B. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The Los Angeles County District Attorney filed an information charging defendant with one count of murder. (\u00a7 187, subd. (a).) It was alleged that defendant personally and intentionally discharged a firearm which caused great bodily injury and death (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)), that defendant personally and intentionally discharged a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c)), and that defendant personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder and the firearm allegations true. The trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for a term of 50 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">A. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence for First Degree Murdef</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>B. <em>Right to Be Present</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Defendant contends that her statutory and constitutional rights to be present at trial were violated when, without her presence, the trial court in response to a jury request allowed the bailiff to demonstrate, and answer questions about, the operation of the murder weapon. As set forth above, the evidence at trial showed that after an evening of drinking, defendant and Lemons argued on their way home from a bar. After defendant stopped and exited her vehicle, she shot Lemons at close range with a handgun while he was seated in the passenger seat of the car. Defendant claimed that the handgun discharged accidentally, but, after considering the evidence, including expert witness testimony about the operation of the handgun, the jury rejected that claim. We conclude that although the trial court erred, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">1. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The California Supreme Court has summarized the law relating to a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at proceeding as follows: \u201c \u2018A criminal defendant\u2019s right to be personally present at trial is guaranteed under the federal Constitution by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is also required by section 15 of article I of the California Constitution and by sections 977 and 1043.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be personally present at any proceeding in which his appearance is necessary to prevent \u201cinterference with [his] opportunity for effective cross-examination.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Due process guarantees the right to be present at any \u201cstage that is critical to [the] outcome\u201d and where the defendant\u2019s \u201cpresence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cThe state constitutional right to be present at trial is generally coextensive with the federal due process right. [Citations.]\u201d [Citation.] Neither the state nor the federal Constitution, nor the statutory requirements of sections 977 and 1043, require the defendant\u2019s personal appearance at proceedings where his presence bears no reasonable, substantial relation to his opportunity to defend the charges against him. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Defendant has the burden of demonstrating that his absence prejudiced his case or denied him a fair trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Blacksher </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 769, 798-799 [130 Cal.Rptr.3d 191, 259 P.3d 370], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The presence of a defendant is not required for certain legal and procedural discussions. For example, the California Supreme Court has noted that \u201ca defendant may ordinarily be excluded from conferences on questions of law, even if those questions are critical to the outcome of the case, because the defendant\u2019s presence would not contribute to the fairness of the proceeding.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 302, 312 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 30, 132 P.3d 235]; see <em>People v. Lopez </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 1028, 1051 [157 Cal.Rptr.3d 570, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>301 P.3d 1177] [a defendant does not have the right to be present in chambers or at bench discussions outside the jury\u2019s presence on questions of law]; <em>People v. Butler </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 847, 865 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 376, 209 P.3d 596] [discussion of jury instructions is not a critical stage of the proceedings requiring a defendant\u2019s presence]; <em>People v. Rogers </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 826, 855-856 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 141 P.3d 135] [a defendant\u2019s right to attend a counsel\u2019s jury screening discussions]; <em>People v. Avila </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 598 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 133 P.3d 1076] [rereading of testimony is not a critical stage of a criminal proceeding]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1196 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969] [the defendant\u2019s presence at discussions concerning television coverage, jury instructions, or which exhibits to send to the jury \u201cwould neither have contributed to the fairness of the procedure nor have affected the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charges\u201d]; <em>People v. Ervin </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 48, 72 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 623, 990 P.2d 506] [a defendant has no absolute right to be present during a hardship screening]; <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 17-20 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673] [the dismissal of a juror for misconduct is not a proceeding at which the defendant must be present], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Rogers, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 879; see also <em>Kentucky v. Stincer </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 730 [96 L.Ed.2d 631, 107 S.Ct. 2658] [a defendant may be excluded from a conference on the competency of child witnesses]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 522, 526-527 [84 L.Ed.2d 486, 105 S.Ct. 1482] [trial court\u2019s ex parte discussion with a juror was not at a critical stage of the proceedings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The California Supreme Court also has explained, \u201cErroneous exclusion of the defendant is not structural error that is reversible per se, but trial error that is reversible only if the defendant proves prejudice. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Perry, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 312.) \u201c \u2018A defendant claiming a violation of the right to personal presence at trial bears the burden of demonstrating that [the defendant\u2019s] personal presence could have substantially benefited the defense. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 408 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 R2d 610], superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in <em>People v. Hinks </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1161 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 440].) As the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit pointed out, \u201cThe [United States] Supreme Court has \u2018adopted the general rule that a constitutional error does not automatically require reversal of a conviction . . . and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u2019 [Citation.] Automatic reversal due to a constitutional error is required only if this error was a \u2018structural defect\u2019 that permeated \u2018[t]he entire conduct of the trial from the beginning to end\u2019 or \u2018affect[ed] the framework within which the trial proceeds.\u2019 [Citation.] If the error was simply a \u2018trial error,\u2019 on the other hand, a court conducts a harmless-error review. ...[][] The list of structural errors that the Supreme Court has recognized is short and limited. ...[][] The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>[United States] Supreme Court has never held that the exclusion of a defendant from a critical stage of his criminal proceedings constitutes a structural error. To the contrary, in <em>Rushen </em>v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 117 [78 L.Ed.2d 267, 104 S.Ct. 453] (1983) (per curiam), the Court determined that the fact that the defendant was denied the right to be present during an <em>ex parte </em>communication between the judge and a juror was a trial error that was subject to harmless error analysis. The court explained that the right to be present during all critical stages of the proceedings and the right to be represented by counsel, \u2018as with most constitutional rights, are subject to harmless error analysis unless the deprivation, by its very nature, cannot be harmless.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 117 n. 2 . . . (citations omitted).\u201d <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Rice </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 408 F.3d 1166, 1171-1172.) Thus, an error pertaining to defendant\u2019s presence involving a federal constitutional right is evaluated under the \u201charmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard.\u201d <em>(People v. Davis </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 510, 532 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 96, 115 P.3d 417]; see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 23 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">2. <em>Forensic Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdJ\">(a) <em>Criminalist Keil</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Robert Keil, a Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department senior criminalist, testified about the operation of the handgun recovered from the purse found in defendant\u2019s car. Keil used a photograph of a firearm to, as he testified, \u201cdepict[] the hammer, which is in this particular position in the forward or uncocked position. . . . The trigger, which is essentially connected to the firearm to the position that holds the hammer in a cocked position so that when it\u2019s depressed, the hammer can be released. . . . The slide, which is the part that moves back and forth on a semiautomatic firearm such as this. It controls the operation after firing, the removal, extraction, and ejection of a fired cartridge case. That is the purpose of this slide mechanism as it comes to the rear, pulls that out, extracts and ejects that. As it comes forward, takes another live round off the magazine and chambers it. [][] The safety mechanism. In this case it\u2019s a lever-type safety on the left side of the firearm that swings in this example 180 degrees. So as depicted, this is in a ready-to-fire position. If it were rotated 180 degrees to the front, it would be in a safe position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Using another photograph of a gun, Keil explained, \u201cThis particular safety mechanism on this firearm rotates 180 degrees. It has what\u2019s known as a detent or a depression in the frame that as you push it around to engage the safety, it sort of holds it or keeps it there more tightly. So in this position it\u2019s held in the . . . completely off position, [and] can be rotated around using typically your thumb. If you\u2019re right-handed, you\u2019d use your right thumb to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>rotate it around and engage it in the forward position which would be safety on. [f] In this particular firearm, . . . [t]he safety will be engaged from six o\u2019clock or greater, meaning that you cannot pull the trigger. [][] If it\u2019s between six o\u2019clock and three o\u2019clock, you will be able to fire the firearm. So it will discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Keil testified that there was an \u201cF\u201d on the gun. According to Keil, when the \u201cF\u201d was showing, the gun was ready to fire. He stated, \u201cF is for \u2018fire,\u2019 meaning that it will discharge with the safety in the position as depicted. [][]... [f] [If I move the safety lever] instead of an F, underneath the lever as it is right now you would see an S for \u2018safe.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Keil further testified that he had test-fired defendant\u2019s pistol and determined it was functional. He also performed a \u201cpush off\u201d examination, which is a test performed by using one\u2019s thumb to push down the cocked hammer in an attempt to disengage its mechanism without touching the trigger. Keil determined that he could not disengage the hammer with his thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The prosecutor asked Keil, \u201cCan you tell us how this gun works? [f] You called it a single-action.\u201d Keil responded that as opposed to a double-action firearm, \u201ca single-action mode of fire, means that the hammer must be in a cocked position before you attempt to fire it. So the operator can thumb it back, meaning they pull it to the rear where it\u2019s held by the internal mechanisms of the firearm until the trigger is depressed, in this case [requiring] at least seven and a half pounds of force, at which time the firearm will release the hammer, the hammer will fall forward, strike the firing pin, the firing pin will ram itself into the primer, causes sparks and flame to go into the gunpowder. That expanding gas operates the top of the firearm known as the slide, bullet leaves down range, slide moves to the rear, and what this does is pulls that fired cartridge case out of the chamber, extracts it and ejects it free of the firearm. As the slide gets all the way to the back and starts moving forward, it takes another live round, if it\u2019s present in the magazine, and pushes it into the chamber at the same time recocking the hammer. [][] The operator then would release the pressure from the trigger and re-depress it if they wish to fire it a second time, hence the name \u2018semi-automatic.\u2019 The trigger can\u2019t be held to the rear and continue to be fired. You must release it and re-depress it for subsequent shots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Using a Titan .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol, i.e., the same type of weapon used in Lemons\u2019s shooting, Keil further explained its operation, stating, \u201c[A]t this point the firearm is in a cocked position because the slide has been to the rear. The hammer is held to the rear. ... If this had been loaded with a unit of ammunition, it would be in a position where it could be fired. In this case the safety mechanism is on. The operator would rotate it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>the rear, at which point I could apply pressure to the trigger, and the hammer will discharge. The hammer will fall forward striking the firing mechanism and then beginning the process of a cycling where the fired cartridge case will come out of this part on the top and to the rear, and the next live round will come forward as it moves forward. Again, cocking the hammer. [][] . . . <em>[f] </em>So that is the operation of this. It is a single-action, meaning that the hammer must be in a cocked position to fire. If it is not, pulling the trigger accomplishes nothing. It does not function. In a cocked position, putting seven and a half pounds of pressure on the trigger will cause the hammer to be discharged or fall forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In response to the prosecutor\u2019s request that Keil demonstrate for the jury how one could pull back on the slide to shoot the gun, Keil testified, \u201c[Ajfter [the magazine is] loaded and inserted, the operator would then pull the . . . slide to the rear and release it, and what this . . . movement does [is to cause] that first live round to be pushed up inside the magazine a little bit, and part of the slide mechanism actually pushes on the back of it and pushes it into the chamber, and what this accomplishes is even if this hammer were in a forward position when they started, it\u2019s now cocked and held to the rear, so now I can simply, provided the safety is off, apply pressure to the trigger and discharge it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Keil test-fired the Titan pistol to see what the \u201cnatural sweep position would be of [the] safety mechanism\u201d before he shot it. He did so to \u201ceducate myself on how this safety mechanism operates. I put it in a cocked condition. I rotated that lever so that the knurled part is facing the front of the firearm which is in a safe position, I can see the letter S for \u2018safe,\u2019 verified that... by pushing the trigger [I could not fire it]. . . . And I tried sweeping the hammer down with my thumb, sweeping it down to see how fast I could disengage [the safety], and when I did that, I noted what position it went in. [][] So with the natural movement of my thumb as I sweep it down, if I simply sweep my thumb down starting with . . . my thumb on top of the knurled lever, sweeping it and pulling it all the way down towards the grip, it frequently goes to a four- or five o\u2019clock position, meaning that I can then pull the trigger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">(b) <em>Bailiff\u2019s Demonstration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">During deliberations, the jury requested a reading of defendant\u2019s testimony about how the gun discharged, an opportunity to view the gun, and a demonstration of the gun\u2019s \u201csafety, hammer, &amp; trigger.\u201d In response to those requests, the following exchange occurred between and among the trial court and counsel: \u201c[Trial court]: We are outside the presence of the jury. . . . The defendant is not present. [Defendant\u2019s counsel], what are your thoughts on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>whether [defendant] has to be here? [ft] [Defendant\u2019s counsel]: I traditionally, your honor, waive my client\u2019s appearance, particularly when they\u2019re out of custody. I spoke with her this morning. I just texted earlier and told her that the jury wanted to read some of the transcript regarding her testimony about the gun and her description during direct examination and she said she\u2019d rather not be here for that and it was okay if I represented her interest, [ft] [Trial court]: So you\u2019re waiving her appearance? [ft] [Defendant\u2019s counsel]: Yes, Your Honor, [ft] [Trial court]: That\u2019s agreeable to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Regarding the jury\u2019s request for a demonstration of the operation of the gun, the following exchange occurred outside the presence of the jury: \u201c[Trial court]: The other thing we have to discuss is the second note ask[ing] for viewing of the gun and demonstration of safety, hammer[,] and trigger, [ft] To me this is a significant issue. I don\u2019t know how you want to handle it. The Bailiff is prepared to show the jurors the gun and to demonstrate the use of the safety and the hammer and the trigger if that is acceptable. I don\u2019t know what else we can do. I\u2019m seeking some advi[c]e here. How would counsel want to proceed in response to this request to [view] the gun and to demonstrate the safety[,] hammer[,] and the trigger, [ft] [Prosecutor]: I\u2019m in agreement with the trial court\u2019s suggestion, [ft] [Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I don\u2019t think you can do it any other way, your Honor. The Bailiff obviously will be instructed not to answer any questions or any inquiries, [ft] [Trial court]: Well, let\u2019s do it in open court. Just have him ... do it. In fact, . . . I\u2019ll take him through it and say, okay, show the jurors where the safety is and he can show them where the safety is. And I will ask him, how ... do you fire the gun and have him do the slide and pull the trigger and pull the hammer back. Are we okay with that? [ft] [Prosecutor]: I\u2019m fine with that, [ft] [Trial court]: The other option is to give the jurors the gun, and we just don\u2019t do that as a rule____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Then the following occurred in the presence of the jury: \u201c[Trial court]: Good morning everyone. We are with the jury and we\u2019re going to be responding to the jurors\u2019 inquiry. We have two notes from the jury. First of all, I\u2019m going to explain that [defendant] has waived her appearance for this response to your questions. We have questions. I want to take up the question regarding testimony second. Let\u2019s deal with the first question which is you have asked to view the gun and you\u2019ve asked for a demonstration of the safety, hammer[,] and trigger. And so the Bailiff has the gun and he\u2019s going to walk over in front of you and he\u2019ll show you where the safety is.

As explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>above, defendant had a right to be present at each critical stage of the trial, and because it amounted to the jury\u2019s receipt of evidence, the bailiff\u2019s demonstration constituted a critical stage of defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\u201cIn all cases in which a felony is charged, the accused shall be present . . . during those portions of the trial when evidence is taken before the trier of fact . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 977, subd. (b)(1).) \u201c \u2018Evidence\u2019 means testimony ... or other things presented to the senses that are offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 140.) \u201cEvery witness before testifying shall take an oath or make an affirmation or declaration in the form provided by law . . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 710.) Evidence Code section 165 states, \u201c \u2018Oath\u2019 includes affirmation or declaration under penalty of perjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Without defendant present, the bailiff spoke extensively<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the jury about, and demonstrated for the jury, the operation of the gun\u2019s safety and hammer, including their effect on the gun\u2019s ability to fire, the time it takes to release the gun\u2019s safety, and the \u201cracking\u201d of the gun to ready it for firing\u2014pulling back on the slide thereby cocking the hammer. The bailiff responded to a number of questions posed by the jurors, and one of the jurors at that time expressly characterized the bailiff as \u201can expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Although the bailiff was not a sworn witness, his \u201cdemonstration\u201d essentially amounted to testimony. Even if the bailiff\u2019s remarks were not testimony, they resulted, in effect, in the jury\u2019s receipt of evidence. <em>(People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 325 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374] [\u201cAlthough a jury view is not among the designated proceedings in section 977, we have long held that \u2018in so viewing the premises the jury was receiving evidence\u2019 even if nontestimonial.\u201d].) Therefore, the trial court erred by allowing the bailiff to demonstrate to the jury the operation of the gun, including answering the jurors\u2019 questions, without defendant being present because the demonstration was a critical stage of the trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The Attorney General argues that there was no error because defense counsel waived defendant\u2019s presence. There was, however, no valid waiver of defendant\u2019s statutory right to be present during the bailiff\u2019s demonstration. As noted, section 977, subdivision (b)(1) required defendant \u201c[to] be present. . . during those portions of the trial when evidence is taken before the trier of fact . ...\u201d A written waiver executed by a defendant is required for a defendant to waive his or her presence at such a hearing. (\u00a7 977, subd. (b)(2).) Defendant did not execute a written waiver of her right to be present at the bailiff\u2019s demonstration, and, therefore, there was not a valid waiver under section 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Even if defendant\u2019s counsel could waive defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights to be present at the bailiff\u2019s demonstration, there was no valid waiver. In <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Tansy </em>(10th Cir. 1990) 911 F.2d 392, the defendant was found guilty of criminal sexual penetration and sentenced to life imprisonment. During trial, the defendant spent much of the time with his head on the counsel table and never talked to his trial counsel. At the conclusion of all testimony, the trial court told the defendant\u2019s counsel that the defendant could leave the courtroom if counsel would waive his presence. Defense counsel agreed, the defendant was escorted back to the psychiatric hospital to which he had been admitted, and defense counsel represented that the defendant was voluntarily absenting himself from the proceedings. The defendant was absent for the remainder of his trial, including the jury instruction conference, jury instructions, closing arguments, and the rendering of the verdict. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The court in <em>Larson v. Tansy, supra, </em>911 F.2d at page 394 said \u201cthat defendant had a constitutional right to be present at the jury instructions, the closing statements, and the rendering of the verdict.\u201d In holding that there was not a valid waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at those proceedings, the court stated, \u201cThe record indicates defendant\u2019s counsel, and not defendant, waived defendant\u2019s right of presence at trial. The trial court never directly addressed defendant concerning his counsel\u2019s request to conduct the remainder of the trial in defendant\u2019s absence. We hold that defendant did not waive his right to be present. [][] Several circuits have held that defense counsel cannot waive a defendant\u2019s right of presence at trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 396.) The court added, \u201c[T]wo circuits that have allowed a defendant\u2019s counsel to waive his client\u2019s right of presence both involve counsel that at least communicated with their clients the need or possibility for attendance at trial. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>595 F.2d 101, 104 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Dunlap, </em>577 F.2d 867, 868 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>439 U.S. 858 [58 L.Ed. 2d 166, 99 S.Ct. 174] (1978). No such communication took place in this case. Even if defense counsel could have validly waived defendant\u2019s right to be present for the conclusion of his trial, where defense counsel did not consult with defendant concerning the waiver and did not obtain defendant\u2019s consent, the waiver will not be binding on defendant. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 510, our Supreme Court stated, \u201cIt does not appear that we have addressed the question whether defense counsel may waive the defendant\u2019s presence. Some federal cases that have addressed this issue have held that defense counsel may do so, but only if there is evidence that the defendant consented to the waiver. (E.g., <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Sowders </em>(6th Cir. 1993) 5 F.3d 975, 981-982; <em>Larson v. Tansy[, supra,] </em>911 F.2d [at pp.] 396-397; but see <em>United States v. Gordon </em>(D.C. Cir. 1987) 264 U.S. App. D.C. 334 [829 F.2d 119, 125-126] [personal on-the-record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>waiver of presence right required].) At a minimum, there must be some evidence that the defendant understood the right he was waiving and the consequences of doing so. (See <em>United States v. Nichols </em>(2d Cir. 1995) 56 F.3d 403, 416-417.) [][] Here, there is scant evidence of consent, and even less evidence that defendant understood the right he was waiving and the consequences of his waiver. All the record shows is that defense counsel represented to the court that counsel had discussed the hearing with defendant and that defendant would waive his presence. There is no evidence that defense counsel informed defendant of his right to attend the hearing; nor is there evidence that defendant understood that by absenting himself from the hearing he would be unable to contribute to the discussion .... Accordingly, we cannot conclude that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to presence at the hearing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 532, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Here, defendant\u2019s counsel purportedly waived defendant\u2019s presence, but the record reflects only that defendant\u2019s counsel advised defendant that the jury wanted a transcript of some of defendant\u2019s testimony and, on that basis, she orally agreed with defendant\u2019s counsel to waive her presence. There is nothing in the record showing that defendant knew about the proposed demonstration or that the bailiff would answer questions from the jurors. Based on the record, the oral waiver of defendant\u2019s presence by defendant\u2019s counsel, at most, related only to the jury\u2019s request for a transcript of some of defendant\u2019s testimony. Thus, defendant did not waive her constitutional rights to be present at the bailiff\u2019s demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The trial court\u2019s error in connection with the bailiff\u2019s demonstration in defendant\u2019s absence does not require a reversal because it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 399, 424 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 732, 213 P.3d 77].) The bailiff\u2019s demonstration, which included answering the jurors\u2019 questions, although improper, was in substance materially the same as Keil\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Keil, like the bailiff, demonstrated for the jury, and spoke to the jury about, the weapon\u2019s operation including, inter alia, the location, use, and effect of the gun\u2019s safety, hammer, and slide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition to being similar to the bailiff\u2019s demonstration, Keil\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>testimony concerning the operation of the gun was substantially more extensive than that demonstration. Defendant was present during Keil\u2019s testimony, and her counsel cross-examined him. Any issues defendant had concerning the accuracy, characterization, or relevance of Keil\u2019s testimony could have been raised by objection during Keil\u2019s testimony on direct examination, or by defendant\u2019s counsel during his cross-examination of Keil.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">In addition, defendant testified about her extensive knowledge of firearms, but she did not testify about Keil\u2019s testimony or otherwise challenge the manner in which he characterized the operation of the gun. Also, defendant did not offer the testimony of an expert witness to contradict Keil\u2019s testimony concerning the operation of the gun, or explain how the gun could discharge accidentally if, as defendant testified, she \u201csqueezed\u201d the gun or held it \u201ctightly\u201d and did not \u201ctry to pull the trigger.\u201d Moreover, defendant\u2019s firearms and trajectory reconstruction expert did not disagree with Keil\u2019s testimony concerning the operation of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Defendant contends that, in a response to one juror\u2019s question, the bailiff stated during his demonstration that if a shooter was proficient with the weapon, he or she could release the safety, pull back the hammer or the slide, and fire the gun \u201cin a second.\u201d Defendant argues that she was prejudiced by her improper absence during the bailiff\u2019s demonstration because Keil did not testify about the time it takes to perform those tasks, and she did not have an opportunity to address the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">With respect to the time it takes to perform one of the two steps described by the bailiff\u2014disengaging the safety\u2014Keil testified that in performing a test on the gun, \u201c. . . I tried sweeping the hammer down with my thumb, sweeping it down to see how fast I could disengage [the safety] .... [f] So with the natural movement of my thumb as I sweep it down, if I <em>simply </em>sweep my thumb down starting with . . . my thumb on top of the knurled lever, sweeping it and pulling it all the way down towards the grip, it frequently goes to a four- or five o\u2019clock position, meaning that I can then pull the trigger.\u201d (Italics added.) This testimony suggested that a person proficient in the use of handguns, such as defendant, who \u201csimply\u201d swept his or her finger in the manner described by Keil could ready the gun to fire quickly. Thus, defendant could have cross-examined Keil on the issue of how quickly the gun could have been readied to fire. In addition, defendant testified that she did not know whether the gun had the safety on or whether \u201cthe hammer was cocked\u201d when she picked up the gun and shot Lemons. Based on that testimony, there was no way to know if, just before defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>shot Lemons, the safety was engaged and the hammer was not cocked (by pulling back the hammer or the slide). Therefore, anything the bailiff said concerning how fast a gun could be readied to fire was of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Defendant next contends that the error was prejudicial because, unlike the bailiff, Keil testified that \u201cif the gun were cocked and the safety on, the safety could accidentally disengage and the gun could fire by putting pressure on the trigger.\u201d Defendant argues that had she been present, she \u201ccould have pointed out that the bailiff\u2019s demonstration failed to represent accurately how she maneuvered the gun.\u201d The challenged portion of Keil\u2019s testimony, however, concerned whether it was advisable to carry a gun in a person\u2019s pocket, and there was no testimony in the record that the gun was in defendant\u2019s pocket immediately before she shot Lemons. In addition, as noted above, defendant testified that she did not know whether the gun\u2019s safety was on or whether \u201cthe hammer was cocked\u201d when she picked up the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Further, the prosecution\u2019s forensic evidence rebutted defendant\u2019s contention that she squeezed the gun tightly and it fired accidentally. That evidence showed that Lemons\u2019s wound was caused by a shot from a gun that was placed on or very near Lemons\u2019s head, and at the time Lemons was shot he was seated in the car and defendant was standing near the passenger doorframe. The evidence also reflected that for the gun to fire, over seven pounds of force had to be applied to the trigger. Thus, Keil\u2019s testimony covered the substance of the bailiff\u2019s demonstration and was more extensive. The demonstration during defendant\u2019s absence from the courtroom was therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at p. 424; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at pp. 22, 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">In addition, defendant\u2019s counsel acceded to the bailiff\u2019s demonstration in defendant\u2019s absence. Although defense counsel conditioned his agreement to allow the demonstration on the basis that the bailiff not answer questions, once the bailiff began to answer jurors\u2019 questions, defense counsel did not object. Thus, there was a forfeiture of any claim of error with respect to the bailiff\u2019s conduct, apart from the issue of defendant\u2019s absence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cunningham </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 926, 989 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 25 P.3d 519].)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">C.-G.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Kriegler, J., and Kumar, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 11, 2013, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
