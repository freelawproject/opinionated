Respondent Superior Court of San Francisco ruled for Quellos, and the Board seeks review of a single issue: whether a 2003 amendment to Revenue and Taxation Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 19177 increasing the penalty for promoting an abusive tax shelter from $1,000 to 50 percent of the gross income received can be retroactively applied. The financial consequences of the answer are enormous: if the statute is not retroactive, the two promoters here have to write a check for only $2,000, but if the statute is retroactive, the promoters must write a check for almost $27 million, plus a dozen years of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Respondent court concluded that the statute cannot be retroactively applied, and the Board must be satisfied with the $2,000. We reach the same conclusion, relying in large part on an uncodified provision enacted with the 2003 amendments to section 19177, in which the Legislature directed that \u201cthis act shall apply with respect to any penalty assessed on or after January 1, 2004, <em>on any return for which the statute of limitations on assessment has not expired. </em>All other provisions of this act shall apply on or after January 1, 2004.\u201d (Italics added.) The FTB acknowledges that the penalty imposed by any version of section 19177 is not a penalty \u201cassessed ... on [a] return.\u201d And what we conclude is dispositive is other language in the uncodified provision, which establishes that the Legislature did address the issue of retroactive sanctions in a variety of contexts, including for promoters, but only authorized retroactive application of a penalty in the case of a specific type of inaction by them. Because the issue of retroactive application was expressly addressed by the Legislature, we cannot expand that application as the Board requests, and we thus deny its petitions for mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ABp\">The Setting and the Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">A knowledgeable observer of abusive tax shelters, recognizing that they represent one of the most fertile fields for financially driven creativity, likens them to pornography in that they \u201cmay be easier to recognize than define.\u201d (Bankman, <em>The New Market in Corporate Tax Shelters </em>(June 21, 1999) 83 Tax Notes 1775, 1777.) They are also very much a moving target in that one of their typical characteristics is that \u201cthe shelter is likely to be shut down by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>legislative or administrative change soon after it is detected.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1777; see <em>id. </em>at p. 1781.) Like performance-enhancing drugs in sport, it appears impossible for taxing authorities to anticipate what the latest generations of shelters will look like until they actually appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">California\u2019s primary weapon in the fight against bogus shelters has always been section 19177. The state was following the lead of the federal government, which first legislated on the subject in 1982. When originally enacted, section 6700 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6700) directed that promoters of abusive tax shelters \u201cshall pay a penalty equal to the greater of $1,000 or 10 percent of the gross income derived or to be derived by such person from such activity.\u201d (Pub.L. No. 97-248, \u00a7 320(a) (Sept. 3, 1982) 96 Stat. 611.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1993, California followed with the first version of section 19177, which provided simply: \u201cA penalty shall be imposed for promoting abusive tax shelters. The penalty shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 6700 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 31, \u00a726, p. 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">A decade later, California resolved to address the issue in a more systematic fashion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 2003, as part of a multifaceted approach to halting (or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>least slowing) the hemorrhaging of state revenues caused by abusive tax shelters (see fn. 10, <em>post), </em>section 19177 was amended to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201c(a) A penalty shall be imposed for promoting abusive tax shelters. The penalty shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 6700 of the Internal Revenue Code, except as otherwise provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201c(b) Notwithstanding Section 6700(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, if an activity with respect to which a penalty imposed under Section 6700(a) of the Internal Revenue Code involves a statement described in Section 6700(a)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] the amount of the penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>imposed under subdivision (a) shall be equal to 50 percent of the gross income derived (or to be derived) from that activity by the person on which the penalty is imposed.\u201d (Stats. 2003, ch. 654, \u00a7 9, p. 5023; Stats. 2003, ch. 656, \u00a7 9, p. 5051.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">An uncodified section in the 2003 enactments provided in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Unless otherwise provided, this act shall apply with respect to any penalty assessed on or after January 1, 2004, on any return for which the statute of limitations on assessment has not expired. All other provisions of this act shall apply on and after January 1, 2004.\u201d (Stats. 2003, ch. 654, \u00a7 15, p. 5037; Stats. 2003, ch. 656, \u00a7 15, subd. (a), p. 5064.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We shall refer to this language as \u201csection 15(a)\u201d and the entirety of the uncodified provision as \u201csection 15.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Pursuant to this language, and the 2003 version of section 19177, the FTB assessed Quellos $26,954,965 in penalties, this being 50 percent of the $53,909,930 Quellos allegedly received for promoting an abusive tax shelter to a California taxpayer in 2001. In accordance with section 19180, Quellos paid 15 percent of the assessment ($4,043,244.75) to the FTB and then, when their administrative requests were denied, filed separate actions in respondent court for refund. The FTB responded with cross-complaints for the unpaid 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>percent of the assessed penalties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the two actions were joined, the parties agreed to a bifurcation whereby they agreed to submit to respondent court the issue of whether the 2003 version of section 19177 applied to Quellos\u2019s 2001 transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">After hearing argument, and considering the voluminous papers and requests for judicial notice of the legislative history for the 2003 enactments, respondent court filed a tightly reasoned 16-page statement of decision largely accepting Quellos\u2019s view of the matter. The court\u2019s conclusion was that \u201cNo iteration of Section 19177 supports the imposition of the fifty percent penalty on Quellos\u2019 2001 alleged promotional activities. Instead, the maximum penalty allowed against each is $1,000. The Quellos are each entitled to a refund from the FTB of the amount paid in excess of that maximum.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The FTB then commenced these original proceedings, filing a petition for each of the actions against the separate Quellos entities, seeking a writ of mandate \u201cdirecting respondent superior court to set aside and vacate its Statement of Decision and enter a Statement of Decision holding that the 2003 amendments to section 19177 apply to all promoter penalty assessments issued on or after January 1, 2004, including those assessments that penalize promoter activities that occurred prior to January 1, 2004.\u201d After issuing an order to show cause and receiving Quellos\u2019s return, we ordered the two proceedings consolidated for purposes of argument and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Propriety of Review by Extraordinary Writ Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Respondent court\u2019s written decision was in effect a ruling on an issue of law in a bifurcated trial, akin to a ruling on an in limine motion. Ordinarily, such an interlocutory ruling is not appealable and must await entry of a final judgment to secure review by an appellate court. <em>(Alan v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 894, 901 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 534, 152 P.3d 1109]; <em>Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841, 851 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Appeal, \u00a7 119, p. 183.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ordinary processes of an appeal are therefore not an adequate remedy at this time. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 116, 127, pp. 1009, 1020.) But expedited review is sometimes permitted in exceptional circumstances. Here, the issue is whether Quellos\u2019s collective liability is $2,000 or almost $27 million with similar disparities present in the follow-on cases to this case. This, as described by the FTB, presents a strong case for extraordinary interlocutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>review: \u201cThe Board has assessed increased section 19177 penalties post-2004 against not just these plaintiffs, but also against numerous entities in the banking, accounting and financial management community who promoted abusive tax shelters to multitudes of taxpayers pre-2004. At least 1525 transactions and $300,000,000 in total penalties are at stake.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] The trial court\u2019s ruling is the first judicial decision on the issue, and it is being closely followed by the Board and other promoters subject to these same promoter penalties. [jQ Without an expeditious appellate resolution, the parties will have to litigate Quellos\u2019 liability\u2014a process that would involve months of discovery, motion practice, and ultimately a protracted trial\u2014even if the final result would only be a $1000 penalty. For the same reasons, if writ review is not accepted now, numerous other actions involving increased promoter penalties will also have to determine the legality of the penalty amount over and over again, as well as each promoter\u2019s liability for each individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>transaction, even if the penalty is ultimately determined by this Court to be $1000 per transaction. A quick and final appellate resolution of the legality of the penalty amount now would result in the streamlining, and in many cases the virtual elimination of many similarly situated cases.\u201d And, \u201cIf review is not granted it will take months of expensive, protracted litigation before any appealable judgment can be entered. To conduct a liability trial simply to generate an appealable judgment would be a waste of resources and truly inefficient, especially when the appellate court could review the core legal issue on an extraordinary writ [petition].\u201d Although disagreeing as to some details, Quellos concurs that expedited review is both \u201cwarranted\u201d and \u201cneeded\u201d to consider this \u201cimportant legal issue of first impression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">It thus appears all of the points raised by the FTB come within the following formulation; \u201cRelief by mandamus is appropriate where it will prevent a needless, expensive trial and an ultimate reversal [citation], particularly where the issue presented is purely one of law and it is in the public interest to have a prompt settlement of the question presented [citations].\u201d <em>(City of Huntington Beach v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 333, 339 [144 Cal.Rptr. 236]; see 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 134-135, pp. 1028-1033 and decisions cited.) A final factor favoring accelerated consideration is that it will let state authorities know if they may budget for future income generated by retroactive application of the 2003 version of section 19177. For each and all of these considerations, we conclude that speedy review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Nature of the Problem</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d against applying a statute retroactively. <em>(McClung </em>v. <em>Employment Development Dept. </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 467, 475 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 428, 99 P.3d 1015].) The court elaborated; \u201c \u2018Generally, statutes operate prospectively only.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018[T]he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly .... For that reason, the \u201cprinciple that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] \u2018The presumption against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference to the unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after the fact.\u2019 [Citation.] [f] This is not to say that a statute may never apply retroactively. \u2018[A] statute\u2019s retroactivity is, in the first instance, a policy determination for the Legislature and one to which courts defer absent \u201csome constitutional objection\u201d to retroactivity.\u2019 [Citation.] But it has long been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>established that a statute that interferes with antecedent rights will not operate retroactivity unless such retroactivity be \u2018the unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018[A] statute may be applied retroactively only if it contains express language of retroactivity <em>or </em>if other sources provide a clear and unavoidable implication that the Legislature intended retroactive application.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Ambiguous statutory language will not suffice to establish such an intent. <em>(Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, 841 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 40, 50 P.3d 751].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">A statute is deemed to be retroactive if it <em>substantially </em>changes the legal consequences of past events. <em>(Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn\u2019s, LLC </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 230-231 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 57, 138 P3d 207]; <em>Western Security Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 232, 243 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 933 P.2d 507]; <em>River Garden Retirement Home v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 922, 956-957 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 62].) \u201cPhrased another way, a statute that operates to \u2018increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct\u2019 is retroactive.\u201d <em>(Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 828, 839, quoting <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Products </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 244, 280 [128 L.Ed.2d 229, 114 S.Ct. 1483].) \u201c \u2018If so, then application to . . . preenactment conduct is forbidden, absent an express legislative intent to permit such retroactive application.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn\u2019s, LLC, supra, </em>at p. 231, quoting <em>Eisner v. Uveges </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 915, 937 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 102 P.3d 915].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\u201cLaws which . . . exact new penalties because of past transactions\u201d qualify as retroactive measures. <em>(Pignaz v. Burnett </em>(1897) 119 Cal. 157, 160 [51 P. 48]; accord, <em>In re Marriage of Reuling </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1439 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 726]; <em>Helm v. Bollman </em>(1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 838, 841 [1 Cal.Rptr. 723].) Increasing Quellos\u2019s collective fines from $2,000 to almost $27 million satisfies any definition of a <em>substantial </em>change in the liability Quellos may face for actions taken in 2001. The operative question is whether this increase was intended to be retroactive by the Legislature when it enacted the 2003 enactments amending section 19177. This inquiry involves a pure issue of law to which we bring our independent, de novo review. <em>(In re Tobacco II Cases </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 298, 311 [93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20]; <em>People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 432 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 11 P.3d 956].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Our Resolution of the Problem</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The FTB and Quellos expend considerable effort in parsing and analyzing the language of section 15(a), which figured prominently in respondent court\u2019s statement of decision. Indeed, the FTB commences its argument by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>telling us that \u201cprinciples of statutory construction compel a reading of section 15(a) that applies the increase in the promoter penalty to all assessments issued on or after January 1, 2004.\u201d But the FTB is putting the cart before the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The issue of whether the 2003 version of section 19177 is retroactive is initially approached by looking to nothing but the actual language of that statute. We recently explained the steps in the process for ascertaining statutory meaning: \u201cWhen interpreting a statute, \u2018[o]ur fundamental task . . . is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u2019 [Citation.] When determining what the Legislature meant, \u2018 \u201c[t]he statutory language itself is the most reliable indicator, so we start with the statute\u2019s words, assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings, and construing them in context. If the words themselves are not ambiguous, we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the statute\u2019s plain meaning governs. On the other hand, if the language allows more than one reasonable construction, we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the measure and maxims of statutory construction. In cases of uncertain meaning, we may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation ....\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dacey v. Taraday </em>(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 962, 979-980 [126 Cal.Rptr.3d 804].)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The plain language of the 2003 version of section 19177 is silent on the issue of retroactivity. Simply put, there are no words indicating that the Legislature even considered the issue. Thus, the statutory language of section 19177 has \u201cnothing ... to overcome the strong presumption against retroactivity.\u201d <em>(McClung v. Employment Development Dept., supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 467, 475.) But we do not choose to halt our analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">As previously shown, all versions of section 19177 have retained the reference to \u201cSection 6700 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d This incorporation makes it proper to consult the federal statute for whatever pertinency it may have on the issue of retroactivity. (See \u00a7 9 [\u201cWhenever any reference is made to any portion of this code or of any other law, the reference applies to all amendments and additions thereto now or hereafter made.\u201d]; <em>Droeger v. Friedman, Sloan &amp; Ross </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 26, 50 [283 Cal.Rptr. 584, 812 P.2d 931] [\u201ceven though a statute may appear to be unambiguous on its face, when it is considered in light of closely related statutes a legislative purpose may emerge that is inconsistent with, and controlling over, the language read without reference to the entire scheme of the law\u201d]; 2B Singer &amp; Singer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Statutes and Statutory Construction (7th ed. 2012) Interpretation by Reference to Related Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 51:7-51:8, pp. 306-315.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That consultation, too, is fruitless, because in none of its versions (see legislative materials cited at fn. 2 and accompanying text, <em>ante) </em>has Congress ever inserted language evidencing an intent for retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">But here there is an unusual wrinkle: the uncodified section 15 enacted with the 2003 version of section 19177. Both the FTB and Quellos treat the language of the uncodified section 15 as highly pertinent, if not dispositive. This assumption will be likewise indulged. <em>(Droeger </em>v. <em>Friedman, Sloan &amp; Ross, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 26, 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We recently explained that uncodified language such as section 15 \u201cis known as a \u2018plus section,\u2019 which our Supreme Court termed \u2018a provision of a bill that is not intended to be a substantive part of the code section or general law that the bill enacts, but to express the Legislature\u2019s view on some aspect of the operation or effect of the bill. Common examples of \u201cplus sections\u201d include severability clauses, saving clauses, statements of the fiscal consequences of the legislation, <em>provisions giving the legislation immediate effect or a delayed operative date </em>or a limited duration, and provisions declaring an intent to overrule a specific judicial decision or an intent not to change existing law.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 846, 858-859, fn. 13 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 984 R2d 486].) The court subsequently explained that \u2018statements of the intent of the enacting body . . . , while not conclusive, are entitled to consideration. [Citations.] Although such statements in an uncodified section do not confer power, determine rights, or enlarge the scope of a measure, they properly may be utilized as an aid in construing a statute.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Canty </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1266, 1280 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 90 P.3d 1168].)\u201d <em>(Sequoia Park Associates v. County of Sonoma </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1287, fn. 8 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 669], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cAn uncodified section is part of the statutory law.\u201d <em>(Carter v. California Dept. of Veterans Affairs </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 914, 925 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 223, 135 P.3d 637].) Because uncodified section 15 and the 2003 version of section 19177 obviously deal with the subject of penalizing abusive tax shelters, it is appropriate to construe them together, an approach that \u201c \u2018 \u201cis most justified, and . . . has the greatest probative force, in the case of statutes relating to the same subject matter that were passed at the same session of the legislature, especially if they were passed or approved or take effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>same day . . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(International Business Machines </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 923, 932 [163 Cal.Rptr. 782, 609 R2d 1].) That is certainly the case with the virtually identical 2003 enactments. (See fh. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">According to the Board, income for promoting an abusive tax shelter is usually discovered from an examination of the taxpayer\u2019s return, and then backtracked to the promoter, a process that commonly takes years. Thus, as the FTB puts it, \u201chere, the Board assessed the promoter penalty against Quellos in 2009, although the promoters\u2019 . . . activities occurred in 2001. That is because it took years for the Board to determine if a tax abuse scheme took place, and if tax advisors participated in the promotion of that scheme.\u201d It follows, as the Board concedes, the section 19177 penalty is not one \u201cassessed ... on [a] return\u201d within the meaning of the first sentence of section 15(a). This accords with the construction given the federal counterpart to section 19177. (See <em>Sage </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(5th Cir. 1990) 908 F.2d 18, 25 [\u201c \u2018. . . Section 6700 assessments do not depend on the filing of a tax return.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">However, the Board first maintains the increased penalty is still within this sentence because it is \u201cassessed\u201d on or after January 1, 2004, and therefore \u201cnecessarily include[s] penalties imposed as a result of activities conducted prior to January 1, 2004.\u201d As the Board elaborates: \u201cThe key term in that [part of] section 15(a) is the word \u2018apply.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u2018apply\u2019 to mean \u2018to employ\u2019 or \u2018to put to use with a particular subject matter.\u2019 [Citation.] Applying or employing the increased penalty rate on or after January 1, 2004 to the section 19177 penalty means that <em>all </em>section 19177 penalties assessed on or after January 1, 2004 must reflect the increased penalty amount. [][] By finding that the second sentence expresses a prospective-only application, the superior court in effect ruled that the increased penalty provisions apply only to penalties for activities that occurred on or after January 1, 2004. However, such a reading is contrary to law because that interpretation would require this Court to insert the words \u2018to activities\u2019 into the language of the statute. This the Court cannot do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Board\u2019s next argument segues from \u201cactivities\u201d to \u201ctaxable years.\u201d The argument begins with the premise of respondent court\u2019s \u201cimplied finding that the 2003 amendments to section 19177 apply to \u2018activities\u2019 that occur on or after January 1, 2004.\u201d The Board submits that such a determination \u201cis equivalent to saying that [the second sentence of section 15(a) is] applicable for the taxable years beginning January 1, 2004. But section 15(a) does not include any references to taxable years. In fact, it is the very absence of the words \u2018to activities\u2019 or \u2018taxable years beginning January 1, 2004\u2019 that reinforces the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to delay application of the increased penalty rate until penalties are assessed for activities that occurred on or after January 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201cThe Revenue and Taxation Code provides that unless a legislative act \u2018otherwise specifically provided therein,\u2019 the provisions of an act which affect the imposition of taxes or penalties \u2018shall be applied to the <em>taxable years beginning </em>on or after January 1 of the year in which the act takes effect.\u2019 (\u00a7 18415, subd. (a), (emphasis added).)[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] Here, section 15(a) did otherwise specially provide. Had section 15(a) not specifically stated that the act\u2019s provisions applied on or after January 1, 2004, the increased penalty amendments to section 19177 would have been applicable to the <em>taxable years beginning </em>January 1, 2004, pursuant to section 18415. The Legislature\u2019s intentional use of language specifically providing for a different application date reflects the Legislature\u2019s intention for that date to apply, and for the general provisions set forth in section 18415 to be overridden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The Board maintains that \u201c[t]he absence of any reference to the \u2018beginning of a taxable year\u2019 is underscored by the fact that the Legislature included the phrase \u2018beginning of a taxable year\u2019 in section 15(b) and (c) when other penalties went into effect, but did not include that term in section 15(a). \u2018It is an equally settled axiom that when the drafters of a statute have employed a term in one place and omitted it in another, it should not be inferred where it has been excluded.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1010 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].) Had the Legislature intended to apply the increased promoter penalties beginning as of taxable year 2004, it would have said so. But it did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Finally, citing legislative history materials demonstrating the Legislature\u2019s supposed desire for \u201cimmediate action\u201d against <em>\u201call </em>of the players in the abusive tax shelter industry,\u201d the Board contends the second sentence of section 15(a) demonstrates that \u201cthe Legislature intended to make the amendments to section 19177 apply to all promoter penalties assessed on or after January 1, 2004, including those penalties based on promoter activities that occurred prior to that date.\u201d \u201c[T]he public policy that compelled the Legislature to become a trailblazer in the area of tax shelter reform could only be effectuated if the increased penalties were applied immediately to all assessments, including those for past conduct.\u201d Any other construction would, in the Board\u2019s view, produce the absurd result of the most culpable participant in abusive shelters escaping with only the risible penalty of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The Board\u2019s arguments are creative, and are obviously the product of considerable thought. They are not, however, persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Although section 15(a) has received most of the FTB\u2019s and Quellos\u2019s attention, the entirety of section 15 merits quotation in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201c(a) Unless otherwise provided, this act shall apply with respect to any penalty assessed on or after January 1, 2004, on any return for which the statute of limitations on assessment has not expired.

The 2003 enactments did not involve a single statute, but a systematic adjustment of the entire subject of abusive tax shelters. Many of the provisions concerned the specification of the new duties imposed on a variety of parties, and in numerous instances the Legislature specified when the new duties would take effect.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>prominent was a number of new or increased penalties imposed on those parties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rather than insert language addressing retroactivity into each of these provisions, the Legislature obviously elected to use section 15 as a collection point for a number of determinations concerning the scope of application. Clearly, this was not an instance where the legislative intention must be divined from a complete silence or lack of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>No less apparent is that the Legislature rejected the idea of a single universal rule of retroactive application. Instead, section 15 very clearly reflects a number of considered decisions by the Legislature as to what new or enhanced duty should receive what specific penalty commencing on what specific date.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The FTB\u2019s first two arguments, each of which seize upon a single word, will not detain us long. The first is built entirely on the word \u201cassessed,\u201d the second on the word \u201capply,\u201d both in the language \u201cthis act shall apply with respect to any penalty assessed on or after January 1, 2004, on any return for which the statute of limitations on assessment has not expired.\u201d Both of these arguments isolate one word and ignore the rest of the language\u2014and thus the context. This is contrary to bedrock principles of statutory construction. <em>(Smith v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 77, 83 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 394, 137 P.3d 218]; <em>Alford v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1033, 1040 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 63 P.3d 228].) The language of the entire sentence can only be read as dealing with the assessment of \u201cany penalty ... on any return,\u201d which the FTB advises is not what happens with shelter promoters. The simple fact that an assessment may be on someone or after January 1, 2004, is irrelevant to whether a nonreturn based penalty is to be imposed on the promoter. And the proper context for \u201capply\u201d is again \u201cany penalty assessed on . . . any return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Board\u2019s next argument appears but a variation on the first, assuming as it does that \u201capplication\u201d is still dependent upon a return-based penalty, even if this does \u201cnecessarily include penalties imposed as a result of activities conducted prior to January 1, 2004.\u201d If the Board means to suggest that so long as a <em>taxpayer\u2019s </em>return remains liable for a penalty assessment (a period that can be quite extensive),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the <em>promoter </em>is subject to a coextensive period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>of vulnerability, this is untenable bootstrapping. Such vicarious liability tortures beyond any reasonable endurance the language of section 15(a)\u2019s first sentence. It makes nonsense of the sentence\u2019s central emphasis\u2014the existence of a penalty \u201cassessed on .... [a] return.\u201d And it cannot be squared with the Board\u2019s position that section 19177\u2019s penalty is not within this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The Board\u2019s argument about \u201ctaxable years\u201d is equally groundless. It is predicated upon a supposed \u201cimplied finding\u201d made by respondent court, as if such a finding would control our analysis. However, as already noted, that analysis is independent and de novo. <em>(In re Tobacco II Cases, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th 298, 311; <em>People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 415, 432.) True, as the Board argues, \u201csection 15(a) does not include any references to taxable years,\u201d but that is the function of section 18415, which inserts such a reference by operation of law. It is only when the Legislature intends a different date that it makes that intent clear with specific language, which, as the Board notes, was done with uncodified section 15, subdivisions (b) and (c)(4). So, when the Board argues that \u201c[t]he absence of. . . language providing that provisions apply as of a particular taxable year reinforces the conclusion that the Legislature intended the [the 2003 version of section 19177] to apply immediately,\u201d the Board is reversing the correct interpretation and application of section 18415. The absence of \u201ctaxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2004\u201d attached to the 2003 version of section 19177 therefore lacks the legal consequence claimed by the Board with its citation to <em>People v. Woodhead, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">If anything, the Board\u2019s logic works against its argument because the absence of language in section 15(a) of a taxable year other than the one beginning January 1, 2004, must be accounted as evidence the Legislature did not intend the 2003 version of section 19177 to apply to any earlier taxable years. Which, as the Board points out, the Legislature did in uncodified section 15, subdivision (b): \u201cSections 18407, 19772, and 19773 ... as amended or added by this act, apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2003.\u201d And in uncodified section 15, subdivision (c)(4): \u201cFor purposes of applying section 19778 . . . , section 18407 ... as added by this act, applies for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998.\u201d To quote the Board:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201cHad the Legislature intended to apply the increased promoter penalties [prior to the] taxable year 2004, it would have said so. But it did not.\u201d Accordingly, the absence of a reference to taxable year, and an express connection to section 19177, must work against the Board\u2019s contention that retroactive application was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We have inspected the voluminous legislative histories of the 2003 amendments and found virtually nothing supportive of the Board\u2019s arguments. The FTB fails to draw our attention to anything showing that the Legislature was aware of the delay in ascertaining the identity of shelter promoters entailed by FTB\u2019s administrative procedures, much less that this situation was intended to be addressed by any part of section 15.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Granted, given the peculiar evolution of the 2003 enactments (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>much of this material is repetitive and overlapping. And much is devoted to the need for action, the scope of the proposed measures vis-a-vis parallel federal legislation, and the mechanics and expectations of the amnesty program. (See fn. 10, <em>ante.) </em>As may be gathered from the gigantic escalation in penalties imposed by the 2003 version of 19177, the promoters of abusive tax shelters did not escape attention <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As the FTB repeatedly states, the 2003 enactments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>represented a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and \u201cmulti-faceted effort\u201d by the Legislature that included \u201cincreased penalties against <em>all </em>of the players in the abusive tax shelter industry\u2014taxpayers (investors), tax preparers, tax advisors and promoters.\u201d That broad front approach is also reflected in section 15 which is devoted exclusively to the issue of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Look at the language of section 15. Really look at it, all of it. Section 15 is a honeycomb of disparate decisions reflecting that the Legislature considered the issue of retroactivity from many different angles. The Legislature did not adopt a single standard for retroactivity. Instead, it chose multiple, and differing, chronological points at which different obligations and penalties would commence. In light of this comprehensive approach, it would be difficult to maintain that the Legislature inadvertently omitted something.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Promoter penalties were not neglected in section 15. Uncodified section 15, subdivision (c)(2)(A) and (B) clearly specify that promoters are to be penalized for failing to register a tax shelter if the shelter \u201cwas offered for sale between February 28, 2000, and January 1, 2004.\u201d Meanwhile, subdivision (c)(1)\u2014and section 19772 that it references\u2014penalizes <em>taxpayers </em>who fail to report income from a shelter <em>for almost that exact same period. </em>Had the Legislature intended to impose section 19177 penalties on promoters for the taxable years 2000 through 2004, as the FTB contends it did, one would logically expect such intent to be expressed in close vicinity to this language. Or, of course, in section 19177 itself. Yet such language is missing from both locations. And, as the Board reminds us, it is not for us to read it in. <em>(People v. Woodhead, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1002, 1010; cf. <em>Samantar v. Yousuf </em>(2010) 560 U.S. 305, 317 [176 L.Ed.2d 1047, 130 S.Ct. 2278, 2288] [\u201c \u2018Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate . . . [when] Congress has shown that it knows how to [address an issue] in express terms.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Both before respondent court, and here, the FTB places considerable emphasis on the argument that retroactive application of the 2003 version of section 19177 will advance the Legislature\u2019s goal of deterring the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>abusive tax shelters. Undoubtedly it would. But the issue here is whether a clear and unmistakable intent to promote that objective can be discerned from the language of section 15, more particularly, the silence of section 15. It cannot. As already pointed out, the Legislature did not employ the necessary language it did in other places in section 15 evidencing its intent for retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">It is pertinent to note that in one crucial aspect the Legislature treated <em>taxpayers </em>with unique severity, doubling the statute of limitations for deficiency assessments from four to eight years, and specifically providing that this change \u201cshall apply to any return filed under this part on or after January 1, 2000.\u201d (Stats. 2003, ch. 654, \u00a7 13, p. 5027; Stats. 2003, ch. 656, \u00a7 13, p. 5055, adding \u00a7 19755.) The theory behind this change was \u201c[l]engthening the statute of limitations on FTB\u2019s ability to issue deficiencies in cases involving the use of tax shelters is intended to allow FTB to pursue individuals who used tax shelters that were found to be illegal after the end of the current four-year statute of limitations.\u201d (Off. of Assem. Floor Analysis, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1601 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 19, 2003, p. 5.) Equivalent language was not directed at shelter promoters, nor added to the 2003 version of section 19177.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The situation may be summarized as follows: The Legislature wanted to quash the burgeoning growth of abusive tax shelters by enacting a comprehensive scheme against all parties involved in that growth. Increased penalties were a prominent feature, perhaps the most prominent, of that scheme, and the most draconian, section 19177, was aimed squarely at promoters of the shelters. The Legislature\u2019s scheme was enacted with a provision, section 15, that dealt with the sole subject of whether, and to what extent, various features of the scheme would be retroactively applied. In that provision, the Legislature expressly authorized retroactive application of a penalty <em>against taxpayers, </em>as well as retroactive application of a new duty <em>on promoters </em>for the same period, 2001 to 2004. But it did not provide for the equivalent retroactive reach for section 19177 for which the FTB now argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">As citizens and taxpayers, we might debate whether the Legislature let shelter promoters too easily off the hook, and whether it is unfair to double the statute of limitations against taxpayers but not against promoters. It might indeed seem absurd to make a promoter write a check for a thousand dollars when the taxpayer who bought the promoter\u2019s scheme will have to pay far more. There is an undeniable logic to the Board\u2019s argument that taxpayers may be, relatively speaking, less culpable than promoters, so it might seem odd that enhanced penalties apply to taxpayers but not to promoters. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>might strike many as a misguided approach to deterring the proliferation of abusive tax shelters. Maybe the Legislature truly intended that, as between promoters and taxpayers, it should be the promoters who are more sternly disciplined. Maybe that is a conclusion we would like to reach. Certainly it is a conclusion that appears in the best interest of the California fisc. But it is not a conclusion we can endorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Making such determinations and choices is what legislatures do; it defines the legislative function. (E.g., <em>FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc. </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 307, 315-316 [124 L.Ed.2d 211, 113 S.Ct. 2096]; <em>Untied. States </em>v. <em>Ptasynski </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 74, 82 [76 L.Ed.2d 427, 103 S.Ct. 2239]; <em>Warden </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 628, 645 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 283, 982 P.2d 154].) As judges, the wisdom of such policy decisions, particularly when they address economic or financial considerations, is beyond our proper inquiry. (See <em>Service Employees Internat. Union, Local 1000 v. Brown </em>(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 252, 273 [128 Cal.Rptr.3d 711] and decisions cited.) Retroactivity determinations are likewise \u201c \u2018a policy determination for the Legislature and one to which courts defer absent \u201csome constitutional objection\u201d to retroactivity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McClung v. Employment Development Dept., supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 467, 475.) There is no such objection here. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">There is no express language of retroactivity in the 2003 version of section 19177. There is no language in any part of the 2003 enactments that comes near rebutting the strong presumption against giving the 2003 version of section 19177 a retroactive application. Our careful examination of the legislative histories attending the 2003 enactments has disclosed nothing proving that retroactivity of the 2003 version of section 19177 was \u201c \u2018the unequivocal and inflexible import of [its] terms, and the manifest intention . . . .\u2019 [citations] \u2018. . . that the Legislature intended retroactive application.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McClung v. Employment Development Dept., supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 467, 475.) Acceding to the FTB\u2019s construction of the 2003 version of section 19177 would amount to a wholly improper rewriting of that statute in the belief that this court knows what the Legislature really intended. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858; <em>Doe v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 545 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 330, 169 P.3d 559]; <em>Cornette v.

In quite properly refusing the FTB\u2019s invitation to do so, and by correctly recognizing that the second sentence of section 15(a) furnishes the controlling principle, respondent court committed no error of law necessitating extraordinary intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The petitions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Kline, P.

Not until 2003 was that omission remedied, albeit in a peculiar fashion. The Legislature statutorily described an \u201cabusive tax shelter\u201d in several ways, one of which was \u201cAny entity, investment plan or arrangement, or other plan or arrangement which is of a type that the Secretary of the Treasury or the Franchise Tax Board determines by regulations as having a potential for tax avoidance or evasion.\u201d (Former \u00a7 19777, subd.

Although not formally part of the statutory definition of what is now called an \u201cabusive tax avoidance transaction\u201d (\u00a7 19777, subd. (a), amended by Stats. 2011, ch. 14, \u00a7 24), the concept of the abusive tax shelter was elsewhere described as \u201cany transaction of a type . . . having a potential for tax avoidance or evasion[,] including deductions, basis, credits, entity classification, dividend elimination, or omission of income.\u201d (\u00a7 18407, subd. (a)(3).) However, because the term \u201cabusive tax shelter\u201d was retained in all the versions of section 19177, and because it is more widely employed in everyday usage, it will continue to be used here.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Another peculiarity of the Legislature\u2019s output on abusive tax shelters is that while section 19177 penalizes \u201cpromoting abusive tax shelters,\u201d the concept of \u201cpromoting\u201d or the identity of the person or entity doing the \u201cpromoting\u201d is nowhere statutorily defined. It used to be, generally following the language of a prior version of 26 United States Code section 6700. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>(See former \u00a7 18648, subd.

But the Legislature dropped this definition in the 2003 enactments, replacing the single concept of \u201cpromoter\u201d with the new terms \u201corganizer,\u201d \u201cseller,\u201d and \u201cmaterial advisor,\u201d all \u201cmeaning] a person that meets any of the requirements of this section or of Section 6112 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d (\u00a7 18648, former subd. (e), amended by Stats. 2003, ch. 654, \u00a7 4, p. 5015; Stats. 2003, ch. 656, \u00a7 4, p. 5042.) But the version of 26 United States Code section 6112 in effect at the time dealt only with organizers and sellers (Pub.L. No. 98-369, \u00a7 142(a) (July 18, 1984) 98 Stat. 681), and now only addresses material advisors, adopting the definition in 26 United States Code section 6111. Section 18648 kept up with this last change, and now discusses only a material advisor, that is, a person or entity that \u201c[provides any material aid, assistance, or advice with respect to organizing, managing, promoting, selling, implementing, insuring, or carrying out any reportable transaction with respect to a taxpayer that meets any of the following conditions: ['][] (A) Is organized in this state, [f] (B) Does business in this state, [f] (C) Derives income from sources in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 18648, subd.

It thus appears that while section 19177 still penalizes \u201cpromoting abusive tax shelters,\u201d its current target is \u201cmaterial advisors\u201d involved with \u201cabusive tax avoidance transactions\u201d (e.g., \u00a7 19751, subd.

Given that we agree with the purely statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>approach of respondent court\u2019s decision, we also express no opinion on this constitutional question, which neither the FTB nor Quellos address in their briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> To be fair, the FTB and Quellos anticipated this problem. Initially respondent court was favorably disposed to their suggestion that, in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 166.1, it would \u201cindicate in any interlocutory order a belief that there is a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion, appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.\u201d Respondent court subsequently declined to take this step, erroneously believing that its \u201cruling was a final judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">After respondent court issued its statement of decision, the FTB filed two notices of appeal from it. <em>(Quellos Group LLC </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(July 12, 2012, A134901), app. dism.; <em>Quellos Financial Advisors LLC v.

However, because writ review could prevent a costly and unnecessary trial and resolve an important legal issue of first impression, Quellos supports writ review, provided that it is given an opportunity to provide full briefing in response to the writ petition filed by the Franchise Tax Board.\u201d The purported appeals were thereafter dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b573-5\"> The amounts of money mentioned in connection with abusive tax shelters are truly staggering. A prominent feature of the 2003 enactments was an amnesty program, known as the voluntary compliance program, which started on January 1, 2004, and ended on April 15, 2004.

Professor Bankman\u2019s figures are slightly different, but equally impressive: \u201cThe amnesty was forecast to bring in $90 million. It in fact took in $1.3 billion\u2014all this from about 1,000 taxpayers.

Here in California, the Franchise Tax Board estimates that illegal tax shelters cost the state as much as $500 million a year. [1] AB 1601 is needed to recoup this lost tax revenue. This bill will provide the Franchise Tax Board with better tools for investigating illegal tax shelters and prosecuting those offenders who use these tax shelters to reduce their tax liability.

If the FTB believes the taxpayer has understated his or her gross income by more than 25 percent, \u201ca notice of a proposed deficiency assessment may be mailed to the taxpayer within six years after the return was filed.\u201d (\u00a7 19058, subd.

Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>38 Cal.4th 897, 902 [taxpayers\u2019 1983 return, timely filed in 1984, still being examined by IRS in 1996]) or assessing the federal promoter penalty. <em>(Sage v.

If the IRS determines that the taxpayer\u2019s federal income and liability amounts should be increased, the taxpayer is required to report this to the FTB. (\u00a7 18622, subd. (a).) If the taxpayer does so, the FTB has up to six years to issue a deficiency assessment. However, if the taxpayer does not so advise the FTB, there is no time limit for FTB action. (See <em>Ordlock v.

The Legislature appears to have initially been of the same mind, setting the penalty rate for promoters at 25 percent (Assem. Com. on Revenue and Taxation, Analysis of Assem.
