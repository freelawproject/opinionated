(mother), to make his nondependent sister, five-year-old Angel H., available for weekly visitation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Luke contends (1) the juvenile court erred when it relied on <em>In re A.R. </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 1160 [138 Cal.Rptr.3d 169] <em>(A.R.) </em>to deny his petition, (2) the court had authority to enter a visitation order against mother with respect to a nondependent sibling, (3) the denial of his petition seeking sibling visitation violated his constitutional right to due process, and (4) the court denied him a meaningful hearing. We conclude the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to grant Luke\u2019s modification petition for visitation with a nondependent sibling. We find the <em>A.R. </em>case to be controlling on this issue. Luke\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>A.R. </em>are not persuasive. The fact that the juvenile court had jurisdiction over mother does not mean the court had jurisdiction to compel visitation with a sibling who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Further, in this case, Luke did not have a constitutional right to visitation with his nondependent sibling. Finally, Luke has forfeited his argument that there was no evidentiary hearing. In any event, this argument fails because the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to order visitation with a nondependent sibling regardless of any evidence that would have been presented. Accordingly, we affirm the juvenile court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATkr\">\n<em>Originating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">In April 2011, the Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services (the Department) received a referral from a mandated reporter expressing concerns about Luke\u2019s mental health related to ongoing abuse and exploitation by mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">\n<em>Section 300 Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">In April 2011, a petition was filed alleging Luke came within section 300, subdivision (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in that he was suffering serious emotional damage as a result of mother\u2019s conduct. The petition alleged mother degrades and belittles Luke, deprives him of sleep as a form of punishment, yells at him for hours past his bedtime, threatens to \u201c5150\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Luke if he does not listen to her, and engages in other excessively controlling, humiliating, and exploitive behavior. The petition alleged that, as a result, Luke suffered physical symptoms including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), rashes, shingles, and blood in his stool.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">A separate, nondetaining petition was filed on behalf of Angel, a developmentally delayed five-year-old girl who had been adopted by mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">\n<em>Detention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">At a detention hearing in May 2011, the juvenile court found a prima facie showing had been made that Luke comes within section 300. Luke was ordered detained with the family of his best friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">\n<em>Contested Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">At a contested jurisdiction hearing in June 2011, the juvenile court sustained the section 300, subdivision (c), allegations. The court found Luke may suffer serious emotional damage as a result of anxiety and depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>By stipulation of the parties, the juvenile court dismissed the section 300 petition as to Angel.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">\n<em>Contested Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">At the conclusion of a contested disposition hearing, the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that there was a substantial risk Luke\u2019s physical health and emotional well-being would suffer if returned to mother. The court adjudged Luke a dependent and removed him from mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">\n<em>Luke\u2019s Section 388 Modification Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Mother refused to allow visitation between Luke and Angel. She explained to a social worker that, due to Luke\u2019s past history of involvement with child pornography, she was not comfortable letting Luke visit with Angel. In addition, allowing the visitation would expose mother to further allegations and emotionally destabilize Angel who was working to adjust to new family dynamics.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">In February 2012, Luke filed a section 388 modification petition (modification petition) seeking to compel mother to make Angel available for weekly visits with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">The juvenile court ordered that a hearing take place in March 2012, \u201cbecause the best interest of the child may be promoted by the request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">In March 2012, mother filed opposition to Luke\u2019s modification petition seeking sibling visitation, citing her constitutional right to parent her nondependent child, Angel.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">In March 2012, the juvenile court issued a tentative decision denying Luke\u2019s modification petition. In its ruling, the court stated, \u201c[t]he decision is controlled by the case of\u2019 <em>A.R., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">At a hearing in April 2012, the juvenile court adopted the tentative decision as its final decision. The court first held former section 388, subdivision (b), does not apply to this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court next held the policy of \u201cfostering of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>sibling relationships\u201d is \u201cto protect groups of siblings who all come under the jurisdiction of the juvenile dependency court and to emphasize the importance of the role of the Court and the social services system once children become our children, to recognize the importance of keeping those children together.\u201d Expressly relying on <em>A.R., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th 1160, the court held it would be acting in excess of its jurisdiction if it ordered visitation between Luke and his nondependent sibling, Angel.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Luke contends the juvenile court erred when it denied his modification petition seeking visitation with Angel, his nondependent sibling. Specifically, Luke contends (1) the juvenile court erred when it relied on <em>A.R. </em>to deny his petition, (2) the court had authority to enter a visitation order against mother with respect to a nondependent sibling, (3) the denial of his modification petition seeking sibling visitation violated his constitutional right to due process, and (4) the court denied him a meaningful hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\"><em>The Juvenile Court\u2019s Reliance on </em>A.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Luke contends the juvenile court\u2019s reliance on <em>A.R., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th 1160 was misplaced. This contention has no merit. In fact, <em>A.R. </em>is controlling in the resolution of the modification petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">In <em>A.R., </em>the appellate court reversed the portion of a dispositional order entitling A.M., a 17-year-old dependent child, to supervised visitation with her five-year-old half brother, A.R., whose dependency petition had been dismissed. The <em>A.R. </em>court described the limited jurisdiction of the juvenile court to make only those determinations authorized by specific statutory authority. <em>(A.R., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1170.) The court explained: \u201cThe filing of A.R.\u2019s dependency petition vested the juvenile court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction, i.e., the inherent authority to deal with the case or the matter before it. [Citation.] When the court dismissed A.R.\u2019s petition following the jurisdictional hearing, A.R. was no longer in need of the juvenile court\u2019s protection and its jurisdiction over him terminated. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The <em>A.R. </em>court explained, \u201cthere is no statutory provision requiring sibling visitation in these circumstances.\u201d <em>(A.R., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.) The court first considered section 361.2, which provides: \u201cWhere the court has ordered removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to Section 361, the court shall consider whether there are any <em>siblings under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, </em>the nature of the relationship between the child and his or her siblings, the appropriateness of. developing or maintaining the sibling relationships pursuant to Section 16002, and the impact of the sibling relationships on the child\u2019s placement and planning for legal permanence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (j).) <em>A.R. </em>reasoned that, \u201c[b]ecause A.R. was not under the court\u2019s jurisdiction at the time of A.M.\u2019s dispositional hearing, this section is inapplicable.\u201d (203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">The <em>A.R. </em>court next considered section 388, subdivision (b), \u201cwhich permits a person who desires a sibling relationship with <em>a child, who is either a dependent of the juvenile court or the subject of a dependency petition, </em>to petition the court to assert that relationship and seek, inter alia, visitation with the dependent child.\u201d <em>(A.R., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171, italics added.) <em>A.R. </em>reasoned this statute \u201cexpressly requires the filing of a verified petition on behalf of a person seeking sibling visitation with a dependent of the juvenile court. Since no such petition was filed here, that section is inapplicable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">We reach the same conclusion here. By stipulation of the parties, the juvenile court had dismissed the section 300 petition as to Angel. At that point, Angel was no longer in need of the court\u2019s protection and its jurisdiction over her terminated. Luke filed his modification petition following the dismissal in Angel\u2019s case and the disposition hearing in this case. At that point, the court had jurisdiction over Luke, not Angel. Because Angel no longer was under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, section 361.2 is inapplicable to the present case. Luke acknowledges section 388, subdivision (b), does not apply in his case.  The fact that section 388, subdivision (b), allows a modification petition to be filed by persons other than a dependent child does not mean the petition may be targeted <em>at </em>a sibling <em>outside </em>the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. Based on <em>A.R., </em>we conclude there is no statutory authority providing for Luke\u2019s visitation with Angel and the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to order such visitation. (See <em>A.R., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">\n<em>Juvenile Court\u2019s Jurisdiction to Order Visitation with a Nondependent Sibling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Luke argues <em>A.R., supra, 203 </em>Cal.App.4th 1160 is distinguishable because the juvenile court had jurisdiction over mother and therefore, could issue a visitation order against mother. In <em>A.R., </em>the custodial parent no longer was before the juvenile court. This argument misses the point. The <em>A.R. </em>court concluded there was \u201cno statutory authority providing for\u201d a court order compelling a nondependent child to visit a dependent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1171.) The juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over mother (Angel\u2019s custodial parent) does not matter. What matters is that the juvenile court had no statutory authority to enter a visitation order regarding a nondependent sibling.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Luke also attempts to distinguish <em>A.R. </em>because he sought a sibling visitation order pursuant to subdivision (a), not subdivision (b), of former section 388. This distinction does not make a difference in the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over a nondependent child.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Former section 388, subdivision (a), identifies <em>persons who are entitled to petition </em>the juvenile court \u201cto change, modify, or set aside any order of court previously made.\u201d (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>Nothing in the subdivision purports to identify the legal basis upon which the juvenile court order may be changed, modified, or set aside. More specifically, the subdivision does not purport to identify <em>persons who, through the modification process, may be made subject to </em>an order of the court. Thus, while the subdivision authorized Luke, a dependent child, to file a petition to change a court order, it did not authorize the juvenile court to issue an order affecting a child outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Similarly, section 385 allows a juvenile court to \u201cchange, modify or set aside its prior orders sua sponte.\u201d <em>(Nicholas F. v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 92, 116 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 208].) But this procedural provision does not authorize the court to make substantive changes or modifications that otherwise exceed the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Luke argues that various statutory provisions support his contention that the juvenile court had jurisdiction to order visitation with Angel. None of these provisions provides such support. Luke relies on section 202, subdivision (a), which declares that one purpose of the juvenile court law is to \u201cstrengthen the minor\u2019s family ties whenever possible.\u201d However, the Legislature has not provided the juvenile courts with authority to issue orders compelling or directing the behavior of minors who are outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>Luke also relies on section 362, former subdivision (c), which provided: \u201cThe juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of the child who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter <em>as the court deems necessary and proper </em>to carry out the provisions of this section . . . .\u201d (Italics added; Stats. 2000, chs. 908, 910, 911, \u00a7 1.5 pp. 6628, 6682, 6719.) Here, the juvenile court considered Luke\u2019s modification petition but did not deem it necessary or proper. No abuse of discretion is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Luke\u2019s reliance on section 16002 is puzzling. By its terms, this statute applies \u201cwhen siblings have been removed from their home, either as a group on one occurrence or individually on separate occurrences.\u201d (\u00a7 16002, subd. (a).) The statute has no application to this case where only one sibling was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Luke cites section 362.1 and <em>In re Valerie A. </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 987, 1003 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 403] <em>(Valerie A.) </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe dependency statutory scheme allows a juvenile court to make orders that preserve the relationship of dependent and nondependent siblings.\u201d (See <em>In re Valerie A. </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1519 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 734].) The argument is untimely because it is asserted for the first time in the reply brief. <em>(Garcia v. McCutchen </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 482, fn. 10 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 940 P.2d 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">In any event, section 362.1 provides that an order placing a child in foster care shall provide \u201cfor visitation between the child and any siblings,\u201d <em>\u201c\\p]ursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 16002\u201d </em>(\u00a7 362.1, subd. (a)(2), italics added.) As we have noted, section 16002 applies where multiple children have been removed, either together or separately. Thus, section 16002, and by extension section 362.1, has no application where, as here, only one sibling is removed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">\n<em>Constitutional Right to Visitation with Nondependent Sibling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Luke contends the juvenile court\u2019s denial of his request for sibling visitation violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. (U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>Const., 14th Amend.) Relying on various authorities, Luke argues, \u201cthe sibling relationship is among the most important in life\u201d and \u201crecognition of siblings\u2019 fundamental right to visitation is consistent with past United States Supreme Court decisions.\u201d (Citing, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 494 [52 L.Ed.2d 531, 97 S.Ct. 1932] <em>(Moore).) </em>Luke\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>a city housing ordinance limited occupancy of a dwelling unit to members of a single family. \u201cBut the ordinance contains an unusual and complicated definitional section that recognizes as a \u2018family\u2019 only a few categories of related individuals. [Citation.] Because her family, living together in her home, fits none of those categories,\u201d the appellant was convicted of a criminal offense. <em>(Moore, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 496 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 535], fn. omitted.) In a case that garnered no majority opinion, <em>Moore </em>held the ordinance violated the federal due process clause. <em>(Moore, supra, </em>431 U.S. at pp. 495-496, 505-521 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 535, 539-550].)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The salient aspect of <em>Moore </em>is a government policy (housing ordinance) that conflicted with an extended family\u2019s private decision to reside within a single household. In further support of finding a constitutional basis for sibling association, Luke also relies on <em>Aristotle P. v. Johnson </em>(N.D.I11. 1989) 721 F.Supp. 1002, a case involving a government agency (child welfare) practice to place siblings in separate placements without providing visits among them on a reasonable basis. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1005, 1007, 1009-1010.) Here, in contrast, Luke is not challenging a governmental policy or practice that conflicts with a private family decision to allow Luke to visit Angel. Rather, Luke is challenging <em>the private decision of Angel\u2019s custodial parent to not allow the visitation. </em>Contrary to Luke\u2019s arguments and citations to various commentators on the importance of sibling relationships, Luke\u2019s right to sibling visitation in this case is not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Finally, Luke\u2019s reliance on grandparent visitation cases in the family courts is also misplaced. (E.g., <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 57 [147 L.Ed.2d 49, 120 S.Ct. 2054]; <em>In re Marriage of Harris </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 210 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 842, 96 P.3d 141].) Grandparent visitation rights are statutory. There are no statutes providing the juvenile court with authority to grant dependents the right to visit with nondependent siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">\n<em>The Juvenile Court\u2019s Hearing on Luke\u2019s Modification Petition</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The order denying Luke\u2019s Welfare and Institutions Code section 388 modification petition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Blease, Acting P.
