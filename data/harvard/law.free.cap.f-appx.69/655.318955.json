At sentencing, Thompson was found to be a career offender pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2002), and sentenced to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. His counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he raises the sole issue that the district court incorrectly sentenced Thompson, but ultimately concludes there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Thompson has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he asserts that his conviction should be overturned because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutionally vague. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-24\">Thompson first argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. This court has held that a district court may fix a sentence at any point within the guideline range and that its decision is not appeal-able as long as the guideline range is correctly calculated. <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). A review of the record indicates that the district court sentenced Thompson at the low end of a correctly calculated guidelines range, and that his sentence is below the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>statutory maximum penalty; therefore, this court lacks authority to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Next, Thompson contends that his conviction should be overturned because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutionally vague. We have repeatedly, however, found that \u00a7 841 is constitutional. <em>See United States v. </em>Chong, 285 F.3d 343, 346-47 (4th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 232 33 (4th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have considered the entire record on appeal and find that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Thompson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
