Wright\u2019s claim before the district court sought to challenge the judgment of a Maryland state court denying relief on an earlier civil rights complaint filed by Wright in that court. The writ of habeas corpus is available for those alleging they are \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d \u00a7 2254(a). Moreover, the district court does not have jurisdiction over the judgments of state courts. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923) (noting exclusive jurisdiction over state court action is in the Supreme Court of the United States). Accordingly, because the relief sought by Wright was unavailable under \u00a7 2254, and because the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider the claim, we find no error in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal. We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
