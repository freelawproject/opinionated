The district court adopted the findings in the presentence investigation report and sentenced Brown to 135 months of imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Brown\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising five issues: (1) whether the district court erred in denying Brown\u2019s request for a downward adjustment based on his minor role in the offense; (2) whether the district court erred by enhancing his offense level for possession of a firearm; (3) whether the district court erred in declining to compel the Government to move for a substantial assistance departure; (4) whether the district court erred in refusing to depart downward based on Brown\u2019s sentencing entrapment and manipulation theories; and (5) whether the district court erred by refusing to depart downward based on Brown\u2019s post-offense rehabilitation efforts. Brown filed a pro se supplemental brief reiterating issues (1) and (5). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">Both Brown and his counsel have raised the issue of whether the district court clearly erred in denying Brown\u2019s request for a downward adjustment for his minor role in the offense, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2001). Brown admitted to selling drugs on two occasions, and a defendant who sells drugs in a drug conspiracy is generally not a minor participant. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment, (n.5); <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>957 F.2d 1138, 1149 (4th Cir. 1992). We therefore conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying Brown\u2019s request for a downward adjustment for his role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">Next, Brown\u2019s counsel raises the issue of whether the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Brown\u2019s offense level for possessing a firearm during a drug offense, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Brown argues that the Government failed to prove that he possessed the firearm because he was not the owner of the vehicle where the weapon was found, he was not in the vehicle when the weapon was found, and the weapon was not in his actual possession when it was found. Although Brown may not have owned the vehicle where the weapon was found, his possession of the vehicle\u2019s key and the location of the vehicle at the state probation office\u2019s parking lot, where Brown was arrested, demonstrated that he had control of the vehicle. <em>See United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 137 (4th Cir.2001) (defining constructive possession). Further, the handgun was found in the vehicle next to a large amount of marijuana. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly applied the enhancement for possession of a firearm during the drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Brown\u2019s counsel also raises the issue of whether the district court erred in declining to compel the Government to move for a substantial assistance departure, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. There was no evidence (and Brown does not argue) that the Government\u2019s decision not to move for a substantial assistance departure was based on an unconstitutional motive or was unrelated to a legitimate government end. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). We therefore find that the district court properly refused to compel the Government to move for a substantial assistance departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Brown\u2019s counsel directs our attention to whether Brown was entitled to a downward departure because police engaged in sentencing entrapment and sentencing manipulation by specifically demanding crack cocaine in two controlled buys when Brown normally sold marijuana, and by making two controlled buys rather than one. Brown\u2019s sentencing entrapment claim fails because he did not claim that he lacked a predisposition to committing the drug offense. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1152-53 (4th Cir.1994). Further, his sentencing manipulation claim also fails because it is \u201cnot outrageous for the government to continue to purchase narcotics from willing sellers even after a level of narcotics relevant for sentencing purposes has been sold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1155. Despite Brown\u2019s contention that he normally sold marijuana, there was no evidence suggesting that Brown was not a willing seller of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Finally, both Brown and his counsel maintain that Brown\u2019s completion of a drug counseling program prior to sentencing entitled him to a downward departure. A sentencing court\u2019s decision not to depart is not reviewable unless the court\u2019s decision is based on a mistaken view that it lacks authority to do so. <em>United States v. Brock, </em>108 F.3d 31, 33 (4th Cir.1997). In <em>Brock, </em>we held that exceptional post-offense rehabilitation is a possible ground for departure. <em>See id. </em>at 35. In so holding, we recognized that our previous holding in <em>United States v. Van Dyke, </em>895 F.2d 984, 986-87 (4th Cir.1990), that post-offense rehabilitation can never form a proper basis for departure, had been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">In this case, the district court relied on the probation officer\u2019s mistaken belief that the court could not depart downward based on post-offense rehabilitation. Although the district court did not expressly give its reasons for denying Brown\u2019s request to depart downward, it is clear that the court accepted the probation officer\u2019s statement that the court could not depart downward for post-offense rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>due to our decision in <em>Van Dyke. </em>We therefore vacate this portion of Brown\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for consideration of whether Brown\u2019s rehabilitation efforts were exceptional enough to warrant a downward departure. We express no view on the merits of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no other meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Brown\u2019s conviction. We vacate Brown\u2019s sentence with regard to the district court\u2019s refusal to depart based upon post-offense rehabilitation efforts and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, we affirm Brown\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
