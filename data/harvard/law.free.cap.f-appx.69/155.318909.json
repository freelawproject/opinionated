We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release and impose a sentence after revocation. <em>United States v. Wells, </em>163 F.3d 889, 898-99 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000); <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). There was sufficient evidence for the district court to revoke Justice\u2019s term of supervised release and sentence him to six months imprisonment. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
