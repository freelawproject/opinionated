Montgomery alleges the Government violated his constitutional and statutory speedy trial rights. Montgomery also challenges the presentence report\u2019s (\u201cPSR\u201d) imposition of a two-point enhancement for possession of a firearm under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2001) and a two-point adjustment for his role in the offense under USSG \u00a7 3B1.1. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">Montgomery argues the Government violated his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial because they did not indict him within thirty days of his arrest. Montgomery pled guilty. A valid guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictiona! defects, including deprivation of constitutional rights occurring prior to his guilty plea. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 266-67, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993). We therefore find this claim is foreclosed by Montgomery\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Montgomery argues that the district court erred in assessing a two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Although Montgomery initially objected to the PSR\u2019s imposition of the enhancement, he withdrew all pending objections at sentencing. This Court accordingly reviews for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Montgomery argues the PSR does not set forth a nexus between the firearms and the narcotics. We have reviewed the PSR and its addendum and find it related a confidential informant saw Montgomery with cocaine base and firearms in an apartment from which Montgomery conducted his drug distribution. We find Montgomery has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Montgomery argues the district court erred by imposing a two-point enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">A two-level enhancement is applied if the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of any criminal activity that did not involve five or more participants or was not otherwise extensive. USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). The defendant\u2019s role is determined by his relevant conduct, not merely by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Fells, </em>920 F.2d 1179, 1183-84 (4th Cir. 1990). We review this issue for plain error. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732. Contrary to Montgomery\u2019s contentions, the PSR\u2019s statements concerning Montgomery\u2019s use of females to purchase and transport drugs and hold cash for him shows more than a buyer-seller relationship. <em>Cf. United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224-27 (4th Cir.2002). We find Montgomery has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">We therefore affirm Montgomery\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
