This court initially granted a certificate of appealability, affirmed in part, and vacated and remanded in part for a determination of whether West-Bey was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel prior to entry of his guilty plea and at the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. On remand, the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denied relief on West-Bey\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. West-Bey timely appealed. We find that the district court correctly concluded that West-Bey was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (providing standard); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-22\">In light of the remand, in our initial opinion we declined to consider any issue concerning sentencing. Specifically, West-Bey argued in his \u00a7 2255 motion that the district court erred at the sentencing hearing by determining his relevant conduct based on testimony produced at his brother and co-defendant\u2019s trial, thereby depriving him of the opportunity to cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We now hold that the district court properly declined to address this claim because it was raised and rejected on direct appeal. <em>Boeckenhaupt v. United States, 537 </em>F.2d 1182, 1183 (4th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">For these reasons, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The pending motions for appointment of counsel and to compel the district court to provide transcripts are denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b151-17\">The district court granted a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
