His parents were married in the District of Columbia in 1987; his mother became a naturalized United States citizen in 1996. In 1998, Suarez was convicted in Maryland state court of attempted armed carjacking, and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment with six years suspended. The Immigration and Naturalization Service<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> served Suarez with a notice to appear, alleging that he was subject to removal as an aggravated felon pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2000). Suarez filed an application for citizenship, arguing that he had acquired derivative United States citizenship upon his mother\u2019s naturalization, in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3) (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This argument was rejected in administrative proceedings on the ground that there had been no legal separation of Suarez\u2019s parents, as required under the statute. The immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals thus concluded that Suarez was an alien removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Because Suarez is removable as an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii), this court does not have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s ruling. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (2000). However, under <em>Lewis v. INS, </em>194 F.3d 539, 541-42 (4th Cir.1999), we have jurisdiction to determine whether the jurisdictional facts precluding review are present. In doing so, we assess: (1) whether Suarez is an alien; and (2) whether he has committed an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (2000). Suarez admits that he committed a qualifying aggravated felony. Therefore, the only issue before us is whether Suarez is an alien or whether he is a United States citizen, as he claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">We conclude that, under \u00a7 1432(a)(3), the term \u201clegal separation\u201d means a judicial separation. <em>See Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 426 (5th Cir.2001). Suarez\u2019s parents had no judicially sanctioned separation. Thus, we agree with the Attorney General that Suarez did not acquire derivative citizenship upon his mother\u2019s naturalization, and therefore remains an alien. As we find Suarez to be an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, we are without jurisdiction to review the decision of the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\">.

Suarez reached the age of 18 in 1998, before enactment of the 2000 Act, and its provisions do not apply retroactively. <em>See Hughes v. Ashcroft, </em>255 F.3d 752, 758-60 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
