Smith was sentenced to concurrent sixty-month prison terms. Smith appeals, claiming that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the government\u2019s refusal to move for a downward departure pursuant to the plea agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally are not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Instead, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant generally must bring his ineffective assistance claims in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See id.; United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception exists where the record conclusively shows ineffective assistance. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. Because the record does not conclusively show that Smith was denied effective assistance of counsel, Smith\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not cognizable in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
