Edenburn seeks to appeal his conviction and 64-month sentence imposed pursuant to a guilty plea and written plea agreement to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute MDMA (ecstasy), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (2000). The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. We grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss because Edenburn waived his right to appeal his sentence in his written plea agreement, and the only issue raised on appeal is a challenge to Edenburn\u2019s sentence. Further, the brief filed on Edenburn\u2019s behalf pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledges that Edenburn\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Edenburn has failed to file a pro se supplemental brief despite being notified of his opportunity to do so. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
