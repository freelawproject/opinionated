Three counts were charged in one indictment and one count in another indictment. These robberies occurred on four consecutive days; in each case, Smith entered a bank and passed a note to a teller that stated that Smith had a gun and he wanted money. Smith was arrested on the fourth day, made incriminating statements, and later pled guilty. He was sentenced to 180 months imprisonment on each count, to run concurrent with each other, followed by three years supervised release, and a $11,831.70 fine. Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-22\">Before sentencing, Smith filed a motion for downward departure claiming diminished capacity, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.13 (2001). After hearing argument on the motion, the district court concluded that Smith was not entitled to a downward departure and denied the motion. On appeal, Smith challenges his sentence, contending that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in denying the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-23\">As the district court found, Smith did not establish his eligibility for a diminished capacity departure, as the offenses involved violence. We reject, as unsupported by the record, Smith\u2019s argument that the district court relied on the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d standard of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The district court held that, by the terms of USSG \u00a7 5K2.13, Smith was not eligible for relief in view of the serious threat of violence in his crimes. The district court made an adequate \u201cfact-specific investigation of the offense to determine whether it was non-violent.\u201d <em>United States v. Morin, </em>124 F.3d 649, 653 (4th Cir.1997). Its single use of the phrase, \u201ccrime of violence\u201d does not require us to find that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>applied the wrong standard in assessing Smith\u2019s eligibility for the departure. We conclude that the district court\u2019s finding on this issue was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Bowe, 257 </em>F.3d 336, 347 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We affirm Smith\u2019s convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
