Smith and Fleskes specifically allege that the district court erred in calculating their offense levels and in applying a two-level enhancement for leadership roles pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (2001). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Smith\u2019s and Fleskes\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-19\">As a preliminary matter, because Smith and Fleskes both withdrew their objections to their offense level calculations, this court reviews that objection on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>1 F.3d 1430, 1434-35 (4th Cir. 1993). The calculation of the base offense level for an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) conviction requires using the offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived, in this case, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000), unlawful drug trafficking. USSG \u00a7 2S1.1. As set forth in the presentence investigation report, Smith and Fleskes could be held accountable for trafficking at least 1000 pounds of marijuana. Counsel for Smith and Fleskes agreed that this was the proper drug amount, and further agreed that the resultant base offense level of twenty-eight was correct. Under these facts, we find no plain error in the district court\u2019s determination that twenty-eight was the appropriate base offense level for Smith and for Fleskes.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Smith and Fleskes further claim on appeal, as they did below, that they were \u201cmere facilitators or steerers\u201d as opposed to managers or supervisors for purposes of USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), and assert that the district court erred in applying a two-point enhancement to their offense level for leadership roles. We find no error in the district court\u2019s rejection of their claim and find to be properly supported by the record the district court\u2019s factual findings that Smith and Fleskes: (1) made most of the money from the crime; (2) were responsible for, and exercised control over, drug deliveries made, including where drugs were to be delivered; and (3) selected the courier to be used in the conspiracy. We further find that the district court\u2019s determinations that the scope of Smith\u2019s and Fleskes\u2019 illegal activity was the largest of all those involved in the conspiracy and their participation was essential and central to the success of the crime were not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Withers, </em>100 F.3d 1142, 1147 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s and Fleskes\u2019 convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
