He argues that the Government failed to show that the credit union\u2019s insolvency was a direct consequence of the offense because the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) wrote off the loans instead of making an effort to collect on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">A district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed for clear error as to factual findings; legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1996). For a sentencing enhancement to apply, the government must prove the facts underlying the enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>322 F.3d 301, 307 (4th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Loan losses attributed to the offenses of conviction were $463,035.15. This loss exceeds the loan loss reserve and regular reserve by $131,263.15. Lewis failed to show that any of the loans deemed uncollectible by the NCUA were, in fact, collectible. Therefore, we conclude the district court properly found Lewis substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of the credit union and affirm Lewis\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
