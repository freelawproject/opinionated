Blankenship argues his conviction rests on two erroneous evidentiary rulings and that the district court should not have credited the testimony of a cooperating co-conspirator in calculating his sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Blankenship\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s finding that he lacked standing to challenge the admission of cocaine discovered in a FedEx shipment is misplaced. Although the sender and recipient of a package sent by mail each have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the package\u2019s contents, <em>United States v. Jacob-sen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 114, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984), Blankenship was neither the addressee nor the identified sender of the package at issue in this case. <em>Cf United States v. Pitts, </em>322 F.3d 449, 455-57 (7th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Blankenship\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">Nor do we find that the district court abused its discretion in admitting recorded telephone conversations over Blankenship\u2019s objection pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). <em>See United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 995 (4th Cir.1997) (providing standard). While some of Blankenship\u2019s statements may have portrayed him unfavorably, the statements were relevant beyond an examination of his character, as they supported the United States\u2019 showing of intent to purchase cocaine, an element of the crime charged. Further, Blankenship fails to demonstrate that the statements are unreliable or unduly prejudicial under Fed.R.Evid. 403. <em>See id., </em>132 F.3d at 995. Accordingly, we find no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">Likewise, Blankenship\u2019s challenges to the chain of custody for two of the United States\u2019 exhibits are misplaced. Under Fed.R.Evid. 901, the admission of an exhibit must be preceded by \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d This showing is satisfied by \u201csufficient proof that the evidence is what it purports to be and has not been altered in any material respect,\u201d and is not intended as an iron-clad rule that requires exclusion of real evidence based on a missing link in its custody. <em>See United States v. Ricco, </em>52 F.3d 58, 61-62 (4th Cir.1995). Because witnesses at trial provided an adequate basis for authenticating the FedEx shipment and a Crown Royal bag containing a large sum of currency, these assignments of error are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">Finally, Blankenship challenges the calculation and length of his sentence, attacking the credibility of Howard Williamson, a cooperating co-conspirator, and the disparity between their sentences. Giving due regard to the district court\u2019s assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ment of Williamson\u2019s credibility, our review of the record reveals that the district court did not err in crediting Williamson\u2019s testimony despite Blankenship\u2019s attempts to impeach him and point out alleged internal inconsistencies in his testimony. Further, Blankenship did not seek a downward departure based on the sentencing disparity in question, nor could one have been granted. <em>See United States v. Brothers Constr. Co., </em>219 F.3d 300, 319 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, Blankenship fails to demonstrate error in either the district court\u2019s crediting of his cooperating co-conspirator\u2019s testimony or its imposition of a substantially longer sentence than that received by his co-conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Blankenship\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
