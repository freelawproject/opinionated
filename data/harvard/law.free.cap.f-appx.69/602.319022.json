Allen argues his conviction and sentence rest on the district court\u2019s alleged errors in denying his motion for new trial based on the composition of the jury pool, admitting his accomplice's plea agreement, and in applying the relevant Sentencing Guidelines provision regarding use of a firearm. Allen also contends his trial counsel provided inadequate assistance. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">Allen\u2019s objection to the racial composition of the venire from which his jury was selected, which formed the basis for his motion for new trial under Fed. R.Crim.P. 33, is misplaced. This Court reviews the denial of a Rule 33 motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Adam, </em>70 F.3d 776, 779 (4th Cir.1995). However, Allen\u2019s argument is premised almost entirely on the results of the random juror selection process employed in Maryland, which has been judicially approved. <em>See United States v. Meredith, </em>824 F.2d 1418, 1424 (citing <em>United States v. Blair, </em>493 F.Supp. 398, 403 (D.Md.1980)). Because a criminal defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>dant cannot demonstrate a violation of the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1861-868 (2000), by simply alleging that the racial composition of the venire does not match that of the community, and Allen does not demonstrate that the random selection procedure prescribed in the district was manipulated or did not result in substantial proportional representation, we find this assignment of error unpersuasive. <em>See Meredith, </em>824 F.2d at 1424 n. 3; <em>United States v. DiTommaso, </em>405 F.2d 385, 390 (4th Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Allen\u2019s objections to the admission of his accomplice\u2019s plea agreement into evidence and the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewable only for plain error, as Allen did not raise these objections below. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52. As a result, Allen must demonstrate: \u201c(1) whether there was error; (2) whether it was plain; (3) whether it affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) whether, if the first three criteria are met, [this Court] should exercise [its] discretion to notice the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 529 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The Government\u2019s introduction of the plea agreement of Allen\u2019s accomplice into evidence was not error. The Government may introduce a witness\u2019s plea agreement \u201cso that the jury may assess the credibility of the witnesses the government asks them to believe.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>717 F.2d 135, 137 (4th Cir.1983) (internal quotations omitted). Further, the statement of facts contained in the plea agreement was not offered as proof of Allen\u2019s guilt, but to rehabilitate the witness\u2019s credibility. Because the statement of facts in the plea agreement was offered not \u201cfor [its] truth but for the limited purpose of rehabilitation,\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) and its concomitant restrictions do not apply. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>121 F.3d 908, 919-20 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Nor do we find error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancements applicable to carjacking. The Sentencing Guidelines set at twenty-eight the adjusted offense level of a defendant who does not discharge but otherwise uses a firearm in connection with a carjacking. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), (b)(5) (2002). Allen\u2019s contention that the district court should have applied the lesser sentencing guideline for brandishing, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), rather than \u201cuse,\u201d is meritless, as we find the trial testimony concerning Allen\u2019s reliance on the firearm demonstrates he did more than simply brandish a firearm. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(f)) (2002) (cross referenced by \u00a7 2B3.1, comment. (n.l)).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Finally, Allen\u2019s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial is not cognizable on direct appeal. Allen argues his attorney was ineffective because he did not object to the admission of the plea agreement or the district court\u2019s calculation of the sentence. However, in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal, Allen must demonstrate not only that his attorney\u2019s actions were both deficient and prejudicial, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), but that these deficiencies \u201cconclusively appear\u201d from the record before this Court. <em>See United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir.1994) (citing cases). From the record before us, we are unable to conclusively determine that Allen\u2019s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Allen\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
