Norton, Secretary of the Interi- or, appeals from the district court\u2019s order reversing a denial of attorneys\u2019 fees by the Board of Land Appeals (the Board) and remanding for a determination of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Because the Board\u2019s decision to deny attorneys\u2019 fees was based on a reasonable interpretation of the regulations and was supported by substantial evidence, we reverse the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In 1992, West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Inc. and the National Wildlife Federation (collectively, West Virginia Highlands) filed a citizen complaint with the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM). In its citizen complaint, West Virginia Highlands charged that Pittston Coal Company was legally responsible for unabated violations of the surface mining laws at five West Virginia mine sites abandoned by two of its contractors and requested that OSM rescind all permits granted to Pittston until the violations were abated. The Charleston, West Virginia Field Office (CHFO) of OSM informed West Virginia Highlands that the district court in another proceeding had enjoined CHFO from taMng the requested enforcement action. OSM affirmed CHFO\u2019s refusal to take action. West Virginia Highlands filed an appeal to the Board, arguing that OSM\u2019s decision improperly delayed enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1201-1328 (West 1986 &amp; Supp.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">During tMs time, West Virginia Highlands met with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) in an attempt to persuade WVDEP to take action on the issues raised in West Virginia Highlands\u2019 citizen complaint. WVDEP refused to rescind Pittston\u2019s permits, but began negotiating site reclamation with Vandalia Resources, Inc., a Pittston subsidiary. During these negotiations, the WVDEP Director consulted with West Virginia Highlands about proposed provisions for a reclamation agreement. On December 8, 1994, WVDEP and Vandalia executed a Mitigation and Reclamation Agreement (Reclamation Agreement) in wMch Vandalia agreed to reclaim the abandoned sites in exchange for the State not imposing any civil penalties in association with the abandoned sites. On September 15, 1995, the Board granted Pittston\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss West Virginia Highlands\u2019 appeal of its citizen complaint on the basis that the Reclamation Agreement made the action moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">On November 13, 1995, West Virginia Highlands filed a petition for attorneys\u2019 fees expended in connection with its citizen complaint. The Board denied the petition. The Board found that West Virginia Highlands was not entitled to a fee award because, based on the totality of the circumstances, they had not \u201cmade a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues.\u201d (J.A. at 49.) The Board found that \u201cpetitioners obtained no relief from OSM, nor did they establish any error in OSM\u2019s handling of their citizen\u2019s complaint,\u201d nor did discussions between counsel for West Virginia Highlands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>and the State regarding the Reclamation Agreement \u201cestablish a causal link between petitioners\u2019 appeal to this Board on the issue of the proper construction of the Virginia injunction and the settlement negotiations or the reclamation agreement.\u201d (J.A. at 49-50.) The Board went on to find that \u201c[t]he simple pendency of the appeal during the negotiation period does not demonstrate the requisite causal nexus between that appeal and the reclamation agreement reached in that unrelated proceeding to which petitioners and OSM were not parties, and which neither resolved the issue of Pittston\u2019s ownership or control of the [abandoned] mining operations nor arose from the theories advocated by petitioners.\u201d (J.A. at 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">West Virginia Highlands sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision pursuant to 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1276(a)(2) (West 1986). The district court granted summary judgment for West Virginia Highlands and remanded for the Board to determine an appropriate fee award. The Secretary timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Before addressing the merits, there is a jurisdictional question that we must address: whether the district court\u2019s order remanding the case to the Board is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d over which we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 1993). We have held that \u201cif a district court order remanding a case to an administrative agency will be effectively unreviewable after a resolution of the merits, the order is a final decision.\u201d <em>Hanauer v. Reich, </em>82 F.3d 1304, 1306-07 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cA remand order is appealable ... when a court determines that an agency\u2019s statutory or regulatory interpretation is unreasonable or contrary to law, and remands the matter to the agency to implement the court\u2019s alternative interpretation.\u201d <em>Demutiis v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In this case, the district court remanded to the Board for a determination of an appropriate fee award. Section 1276 allows persons aggrieved by the action of the Secretary to petition for judicial review. 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1276(a)(1). The Secretary has delegated to the Board \u201cthe authority to exercise the final decisionmaking power of the Secretary under the act pertaining to ... [petitions for award of costs and expenses.\u201d 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1101(a)(7) (2002). The Secretary, of course, cannot be aggrieved by her own action. Accordingly, the Secretary would not be able to petition for judicial review of any Board decision awarding attorneys\u2019 fees, and thus, would never be able to challenge the district court\u2019s decision. The district court\u2019s order, therefore, is a final decision, and thus reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The Board found that a showing of relief obtained from OSM or error in handling the citizen complaint by OSM is an important, if not dispositive, factor in determining whether fees should be awarded under the regulations implementing the SMCRA. Federal courts \u201cmust give substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994). Thus, the Board\u2019s interpretation must be given \u201ccontrolling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Section 1276 requires us to uphold the Board\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1276(b). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Peninsula Gen. Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>36 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>1262, 1269 (4th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The regulations implementing the SMCRA provide, in pertinent part, that \u201c[appropriate costs and expenses including attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded ... [f]rom OSM to any person ... who initiates or participates in any proceeding under the Act, and who prevails in whole or in part, achieving at least some degree of success on the merits, upon a finding that such person made a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues.\u201d 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1294(b) (2002). Under the Board\u2019s interpretation of the regulation, a showing of relief obtained from OSM or error in handling the citizen complaint by OSM is an important, if not dispositive, factor in determining whether fees should be awarded. This interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation. Given this interpretation, the Board\u2019s finding that the totality of the circumstances did not support a fee award for West Virginia Highlands is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTR UCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(c) (West 1993), all parties consented in writing to a decision by a United States Magistrate Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. We need not and do not address whether there are circumstances where the petitioner could be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees notwithstanding a failure to obtain relief from OSM or show any error in OSM's handling of its citizens complaint. Regardless of whether this factor is dispositive or merely very important, the Board\u2019s interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
