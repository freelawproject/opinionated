We have reviewed the record and find that Sanchez\u2019s claim for relief under \u00a7 2241 is unavailing because he does not meet the test for proceeding under this statute as set forth in <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in denying Sanchez\u2019s \u201cmotion to expurgate\u201d and thus affirm its order denying the motion. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Sanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>No. CR-97-281 (D.S.C. Mar. 21, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal issues are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
