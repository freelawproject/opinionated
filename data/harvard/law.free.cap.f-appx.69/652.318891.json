Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Frye, </em>No. CR-01-167 (E.D.Va. Apr. 22, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-21\">As to Frye\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, the district court\u2019s order denying the motion is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Accordingly, we dismiss this part of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
