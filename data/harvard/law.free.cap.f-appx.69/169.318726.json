Bell, District Attorney of Clark County, Nevada, appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of a permanent injunction under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 105(a) (West 1993), enjoining Nevada\u2019s criminal prosecution of David Arthur Simonini for financial fraud. Because \u00a7 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code does not give the federal courts the authority to enjoin a state criminal proceeding, we vacate the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>On December 12, 2001, Simonini was charged in Clark County, Nevada, with five felony violations of Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 205.130 (West 2003) and \u00a7 205.132 (West 2003). The indictment alleged that Simonini wrote bad checks to the Rio Suite Hotel and Casino, with an intent to defraud. On December 14, 2001, a Nevada court issued a warrant for Simoninfis arrest. On January 7, 2002, Simonini and his wife filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina. Simonini was arrested on the Nevada warrant on April 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On July 31, 2002, Simonini filed a complaint against Rio Suite Hotel and Casino, and Bell, seeking injunctive relief under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 105(a), arguing that the Nevada criminal prosecution was, in essence, a debt collection on behalf of Rio Suite Hotel and Casino. The district court held that the criminal prosecution was not stayed under the automatic stay provision in 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 362 (West 1993). The district court found, however, that \u201c[w]hen a criminal prosecution resembles a debt collection strongly enough, a debtor should be able to avail himself of injunctive relief.\u201d (J.A. at 302-03.) The district court held that an injunction under \u00a7 105(a) was available in such circumstances. On August 9, 2002, the district court entered judgment permanently enjoining under \u00a7 105(a) \u201c[t]he prosecution of Petitioner by the District Attorney of Clark County, Nevada on any matter related to the criminal charges that resulted in Petitioner\u2019s arrest on April 5, 2002.\u201d (J.A. at 292.) Bell filed a timely notice of appeal on August 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u201cWhile decisions pertaining to injunctive relief normally are reviewed solely for abuse of discretion in applying the injunction standard, we review such a decision de novo where it \u2018rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law, and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Va. Carolina Tools, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Tool Supply, Inc., </em>984 F.2d 113, 116 (4th Cir.1993) (internal citation and emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Thornburgh v. Am. Coll. of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, </em>476 U.S. 747, 757, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986)). The district court\u2019s decision rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law, and the facts are established. Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s grant of the permanent injunction de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The district court correctly held that the automatic stay of Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 362(a) does not apply to criminal prosecutions. Section 362(b) provides that \u201c[t]he filing of a [bankruptcy] petition ... does not operate as a stay ... of the commencement or continuation of a criminal action or proceeding against the debt- or.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 362(b)(1). Giving the words of the statute their plain meaning, \u00a7 362(b) applies to all criminal actions, regardless of the underlying aim of the prosecution. <em>See In re Gruntz, </em>202 F.3d 1074, 1085 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (\u201cQuite simply, the Bankruptcy Code declares that \u00a7 362 does not stay \u2018the commencement or continuation of a criminal action or proceeding against the debtor.\u2019 On its face, it does not provide any exception for prosecutorial purpose or bad faith. If the statutory command of the Bankruptcy Code is clear, we need look no further: it must be enforced according to its terms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Although the automatic stay does not apply to criminal prosecutions, the district court held that it had the power under \u00a7 105(a) to enjoin the Nevada prosecution. Section 105(a) grants a court the power to \u201cissue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of [the Bankruptcy Code].\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 105(a). Although the grant of power in \u00a7 105(a) is broad, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>is not unlimited. \u201cIt cannot be invoked, for example, to achieve ends contrary to other specific Code provisions.\u201d <em>Kestell v. Kestell (In re Kestell), </em>99 F.3d 146, 148 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cThe equitable powers of section 105(a) \u2018are not a license for a court to disregard the clear language and meaning of the bankruptcy statutes and rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States, Dep\u2019t of Air Force v. Carolina Parachute Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1469, 1475 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Official Comm. of Equity Sec. Holders v. Mabey, </em>832 F.2d 299, 302 (4th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Given the clear language of \u00a7 362(b) excepting all criminal prosecutions from the automatic stay and \u201c \u2018the fundamental policy against federal interference with state criminal prosecutions,\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Robinson, </em>479 U.S. 36, 47, 107 S.Ct. 353, 93 L.Ed.2d 216 (1986) (quoting <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 46, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971)), we hold that an injunction barring a Nevada state criminal proceeding is not necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or to prevent an abuse of the process. In fact, allowing an injunction of a state criminal proceeding would achieve ends contrary to \u00a7 362(b) and would disregard the clear language and meaning of other bankruptcy rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Accordingly, the district court did not have the power under \u00a7 105(a) to enjoin the Nevada criminal proceeding, and we vacate the injunction. We need not and do not reach the question of whether Simonini\u2019s bankruptcy and subsequent discharge limit in any way the penalties that a Nevada court could impose if Simonini is convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>VACATED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
