Schneider\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which she certifies there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Schneider, informed of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, has not done so. Because we find no plain error in Schneider\u2019s sentence, for the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">Although not asserted by counsel, our review of the record pursuant to <em>Anders </em>indicates Schneider should not have received a sentence for again violating a term of supervised release predicated on his conviction for impersonating a federal officer, which is a Class E felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 912, 3559(a)(5) (2000) (imposing a maximum of three years\u2019 incarceration for impersonating a federal officer and classifying offenses with less than five years maximum incarceration as Class E felonies, respectively). When Schneider violated the initial term of supervised release imposed for that conviction, a ten-month custodial sentence was imposed. His service of that period of confinement limited any subsequent term of supervised release to two months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (2000); <em>see also United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 341 (4th Cir.2002). Consequently, because the activity under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>lying Schneider\u2019s most recent supervised release violation occurred approximately six to eight months after any additional supervised release related to his \u00a7 912 conviction should have concluded, Schneider should not have received an additional eight months\u2019 incarceration with respect to that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Nevertheless, we conclude there was no plain error, as Schneider would have received an eight-month custodial sentence in any event. We find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of a concurrent eight-month post-revocation sentence related to Schneider\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (2000) for mail fraud, as Schneider stipulated to violating the conditions of his supervised release for that conviction, and the district court was apprised of the recommended sentencing ranges in fixing Schneider\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). Because the foregoing error did not in fact increase the term of incarceration imposed, the error did not affect his substantial rights, and thus does not amount to plain error. <em>See United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 937, 122 S.Ct. 309, 151 L.Ed.2d 230 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We have reviewed the entire record in this case in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Schneider\u2019s sentences. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for farther review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
