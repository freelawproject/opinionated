Woodruffs attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the magistrate judge abused his discretion by revoking Woodruffs probation and sentencing her to nine months imprisonment. Counsel states, however, that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We review the magistrate judge\u2019s revocation of probation for an abuse of discretion. Bu<em>rns v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 222-23, 53 S.Ct. 154, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932). The proof required to support a revocation of probation is that the court be \u201creasonably satisfied that a probationer has violated the terms of his release.\u201d <em>United States v. Cates, </em>402 F.2d 473, 474 (4th Cir.1968). Here, Woodruff admitted the charged violations of use of cocaine, new criminal conduct, and failure to submit written reports. Thus, we find that the revocation was supported by sufficient evidence. In addition, Woodruff\u2019s sentence was within the properly calculated guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment. The court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
