Schaefer claims that the district court\u2019s order is plainly unreasonable because the sentencing range of the guidelines was eight to fourteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-21\">This court has previously held that the policy statements of Chapter Seven of the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>are not binding on the courts. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 640 (4th Cir.1995). Schaefer\u2019s five separate and unrelated violations of the terms of his supervised release provide ample support for the action of the district court, and Schaefer\u2019s sentence is statutorily supported. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
