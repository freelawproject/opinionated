We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">The basis of this appeal is that the district court\u2019s October 21, 2002, version of the docket sheet is internally inconsistent with regard to Abdel-Aziz\u2019s sentence on Counts Two and Three. Specifically, the February 5, 2001, docket entry reflecting the original judgment set forth, <em>inter alia, </em>Abdel-Aziz\u2019s imprisonment sentence as 100 months each on Counts Two and Three, while the February 4, 2002, docket entry purportedly reflecting the Amended Judgment<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> set forth Abdel-Aziz\u2019s sentence on Counts Two and Three as 60 months\u2019 imprisonment each. The district court denied the motion for clarification, ordering the clerk of courts to amend the February 4, 2002, docket sheet entry to reflect the imprisonment sentence as 100 months each on Counts Two and Three, which would have made the entries consistent with one another, and consistent -with the prison sentence ordered in both the Judgment and the Amended Judgment. The obvious inference in this case is that the October 21, 2002, docket sheet annotation relative to the Amended Judgment, which incorrectly reflected that the district court ordered 60 month imprisonment sentences on Counts Two and Three when, in fact, it had ordered a 100-month imprisonment sentence on each of those two counts, was a clerical or typographical error. As noted in our opinion in <em>United States v. Abdel-Aziz, </em>Appeal No. 02-7599, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36, the district court has jurisdiction at any time to correct clerical errors. Hence, Abdel-Aziz\u2019s claims are without merit, and we find that the district court properly found that no relief was necessary on the motion for clarification. Moreover, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Abdel-Aziz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>motion for reconsideration, <em>Temkin v. Frederick County Comm\u2019rs, </em>945 F.2d 716, 724 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders denying Abdel-Aziz\u2019s motions for clarification and for reconsideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b158-13\"> While the written judgment and commitment order was amended at the order of this court, the amendment does not affect the analysis of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
