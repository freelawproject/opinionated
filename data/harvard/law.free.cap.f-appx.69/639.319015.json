The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s decision that Gnizako failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The standard for gaining withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Gnizako failed to establish she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Finally, we find Gnizako\u2019s due process challenges to the Board\u2019s use of the streamlined review procedure set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003) to be without merit. <em>See Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Accordingly, we deny Gnizako\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
