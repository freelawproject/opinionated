Kennedy, the Attorney General of the United States for a declaratory judgment and to enjoin the enforcement and execution of two acts of Congress, namely, the Passport Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a and \u00a7 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 190, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185, both of which the plaintiff claims are repugnant to the Constitution. Jurisdiction of this Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>invoked under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243 (1946), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391 and 2201; and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2282 and 2284 a three-judge court was convened to pass upon the constitutional questions in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Cross motions have been filed by the respective parties, pursuant to Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P., for the entry of summary j'udgment based on the representation of both parties that there exists in this case no genuine issue as to any material fact. Having heard the arguments of counsel for the respective parties and having considered their amended pleadings, affidavits, briefs and other papers on file, the Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary j'udgment should be denied and the defendants\u2019 motion for summary j'udgment should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The material facts are undisputed. On March 31, 1962, while the plaintiff was the holder of a valid United States passport of standard form and duration, he applied by letter to the Director of the Passport Office at Washington, D. C., for permission to have his passport validated for travel to Cuba as a tourist. The Passport Office denied him the permission requested, with the explanation that only persons whose travel might be in the best interests of the United States, such as newsmen and businessmen with previously established interests, could be eligible; and specifically that tourist travel was excluded. Thereafter, on May 1, 1962, the petitioner requested a hearing on his application without reciting any new reason, except that he felt justified in wanting to make the trip. He was sent a copy of the current Administrative Procedures of the Passport Office and advised by the acting Deputy Director, citing 22 C.F.R. 51.170 (1958), that in those instances where foreign travel was restricted by geographical limitations, which were generally applicable to everyone, no administrative procedures for review or appeal were provided. Subsequently, on October 11,1962, the petitioner through his attorney advised the Passport Office by letter, that the former had acquired a new passport and renewed petitioner\u2019s request for its validation and a review of any denial. The department advised counsel that in view of the lapse of time, since filing the original application, a new application should be filed, setting forth the purpose of the trip, his expected duration in Cuba, his address while there and assurance of his willingness to register with the Swiss Consulate upon his arrival in Havana.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Thereupon, the petitioner filed a new application for validation, wherein he represented that the purpose of his trip to Cuba was to satisfy his curiosity about the state of affairs in Cuba in order to make him a better informed citizen. He represented further, that he expected to stay at the Havana Libre Hotel for approximately two or three weeks and expressed his willingness to register with the Swiss Consulate upon his arrival in Havana.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On November 5, 1962, the petitioner was notified by the Deputy Director of the Passport Office that his \u201cpresent purpose of visiting Cuba does not meet the standards for validation of your passport.\u201d It should be emphasized that at the time of the Court\u2019s hearing on this motion, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that he was making no claim of illegality on the basis of his client\u2019s not having been afforded an administrative hearing with reference to the denial of the passport validation and this Court will therefore consider that he has abandoned any claim of illegality on this ground, notwithstanding its recitation in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">It is the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the Passport Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a does not authorize the action taken, that said Act and \u00a7 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 190, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185 are unconstitutional, because they interfere with the rights of a citizen, in this instance the plaintiff, to the right to travel under the Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments; to the freedom of speech, belief and association under the First Amendment and that it is an arbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and unreasonable denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment; further, that it is an invalid delegation of legislative power because it does not contain adequate standards and safeguards. The petitioner claims that Executive Order 7856 and Presidential Proclamation 3004, 67 Stat. C. 31 fail to provide adequate standards to guide the Secretary of State in promulgating the regulations and giving proper notice to the American citizen whether said regulations are supported by statute or proclamation; and to the extent that the denial rests upon Executive power over foreign relations, it is still subject to constitutional limitations, and the reasons given by the Secretary do not warrant this abridgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The plaintiff presently prays for a declaratory judgment and an injunction decreeing that \u00a7 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 190, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185 and the Passport Act of July 3, 1926, 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a are unconstitutional and that the Secretary of State\u2019s regulations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> restricting travel to Cuba are thus without any authority in law and are invalid as to the plaintiff. He also requests that the Secretary of State be directed to validate the petitioner\u2019s passport for travel to Cuba, and that he and the Attorney General of the United States be enjoined from interference with his prospective travel or instituting any criminal procedure by reason thereof when consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">THE THREE-JUDGE COURT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The preliminary jurisdictional question is whether this proceeding should be heard by a three-judge District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282. This statute requires such a tribunal as a prerequisite to the granting of any \u201cinterlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any Act of Congress for repugnance to the Constitution * * The necessary elements for the convocation of such a court are three-fold: (1) The complaint must allege a basis for equitable relief, Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963) ; (2) The constitutional question raised must be substantial. Schneider v. Rusk, 372 U.S. 224, 83 S.Ct. 624, 9 L.Ed.2d 695 (1963); and (3) The Complaint must assail an \u2018Act of Congress\u2019, William Jameson &amp; Co. v. Morgenthau, 307 U.S. 171, 59 S.Ct. 804, 83 L.Ed. 1189 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">A judgment for the plaintiff would put the operation of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185 under the restraint of an equity decree. The constitutional claim is plainly substantial, for in Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 130, 78 S.Ct. 1113, 1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 (1957) the Supreme Court said: \u201cwe deal here with a constitutional right of the citizen, a right which we must assume Congress will be faithful to respect.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to grant certiorari in three cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> involving geographic restrictions, all arising subsequent to Kent v. Dulles, supra, does not render the present claim insubstantial. The Court has frequently reiterated that \u201c[t]he denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case * * United States v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482, 490, 43 S.Ct. 181, 182, 67 L.Ed. 361 (1922). See also Stern &amp; Gressman, Supreme Court Practice \u00a7 5-7 (3d ed. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">The plaintiff claims, <em>inter alia, </em>that if \u00a7\u00a7 211a and 1185 authorize the Secretary to place geographic limitations upon the right to travel, they are unconstitutional by reason of an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Executive. He argues that a reading of these sections shows that they are devoid of any stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ards or principles by which the Secretary is guided.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Inasmuch as this plaintiff seeks affirmatively to enjoin the operation of a passport regulatory system, the propriety of empaneling a three-judge tribunal is manifest. The legislative history of \u00a7 2282 indicates that it was enacted to prevent a single federal judge from paralyzing the operation of an entire administrative system by the issuance of a broad injunctive order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201cRepeatedly emphasized during the congressional debates on \u00a7 2282 were the heavy pecuniary costs of the unforeseen and debilitating interruptions in the administration of federal law which could be wrought by a single judge\u2019s order, and the great burdens entailed in coping with harassing actions brought one after another to challenge the operation of an entire statutory scheme, wherever jurisdiction over government officials could be acquired, until a judge was ultimately found who would grant the desired injunction. 81 Cong.Rec. 479-481, 2142-2143 (1937).\u201d Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra, 372 U.S. at 155, 83 S.Ct. at 560, 9 L.Ed.2d 644.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">This is truly a substantial constitutional challenge to the sovereignty of this Nation. This plaintiff\u2019s effort to enjoin the Secretary of State from enforcing the statutory law and its attendant regulations is not merely the simple and seemingly harmless application of a lone tourist; it is in fact a pilot case precedent, which if sustained, would open up an immediate thoroughfare for unrestricted travel between the United States and Cuba. Such an act of judicial audacity would not only defeat the clear intention of Congress as established by law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but also strike down the declared foreign policy of the Executive Branch of the National Government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tial constitutional question is in issue. The fact that the statutes\u2019 validity and their attendant regulations are in this instance being upheld, rather than nullified, does not alter the principle. Bauer v. Acheson, 106 F.Supp. 445, 452 (D.D.C. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">All of the necessary elements are present to require that this matter be heard and determined by a three-judge court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The right of a citizen to travel is a part of the \u201cliberty\u201d of which he cannot be deprived, except by due process of law. This precept is recognized and guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">\u201c * * * (T)he right of exit is a personal right included within the word \u2018liberty\u2019 as used in the Fifth Amendment. If that \u2018liberty\u2019 is to be regulated, it must be pursuant to the law-making functions of the Congress. * * * And if that power is delegated, the standards must be adequate to pass scrutiny by the accepted tests. * * * Where activities or enjoyment, natural and often necessary to the well-being of an American citizen, such as travel, are involved, we will construe narrowly all delegated powers that curtail or dilute them.\u201d Kent v. Dulles, supra, 357 U.S. at 129, 78 S.Ct. at 1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">The issue in this case is whether or not geographical passport restrictions imposed by the Secretary of State in respect to travel to Cuba are authorized by Congressional act and if so are those statutes which purport to grant such authority repugnant to constitutional limitations. It is this Court\u2019s finding that Congress has granted adequate authority to the Executive department to make these regulations, that their application in this instance does not violate due process and the statutes which authorize the regulations, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 211a and 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1185 are valid and constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-20\">In considering this constitutional issue the Court is acutely mindful of the separation of powers and that certain areas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of government are relegated solely to Congress, others to the Executive and some are common to both. The Executive may act in certain fields until legislative action becomes operative and the law-making power then controls. Congress\u2019 right to lay statutory restrictions on the President when he treads such legislative ground is conceded unanimously by the Supreme Court; an ample safeguard is available if Congress chooses to apply it. Until Congress does so choose, \u201c[w]e (the Court) should hesitate long before limiting or embarrassing such powers.\u201d Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U.S. 299, 311, 36 S.Ct. 106, 108, 60 L.Ed. 297 (1915). The President is the active agent of the Nation, not of the Congress; and he derives that status directly from the Executive powers vested in him by the Constitution. U.S.Const. Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and 3. He must, of course, obey and carry out the laws enacted by Congress, not because he is subservient, but because the Constitution directs him to do so. Thus it becomes obvious that in certain areas of government the authority of the Legislative and Executive departments overlap; and a concurrent authority of both is cognizable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">\u201cWhen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\u201d Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637, 72 S.Ct. 863, 871, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1951) (concurring opinion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The field of passport regulation and control cuts across the law-making functions of Congress and the Chief Executive\u2019s responsibility in the field of foreign affairs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201cWe think the designation of certain areas of the world as forbidden to American travelers falls within the power to conduct foreign affairs. The bare determination that certain areas outside this hemisphere are trouble spots, or danger zones, is a phase of \u2018foreign affairs\u2019. Such a determination involves information gleaned through diplomatic sources and channels, and a judgment premised in large part upon foreign policy. The grounds upon which the President would make such a designation are foreign considerations, foreign affairs and policy. Indeed it would seem that such a restriction is in and of itself a foreign policy. It is at least an instrument of foreign policy.\u201d Worthy v. Herter, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 153, 270 F.2d 905, 910 (D.C.Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 918, 80 S.Ct. 255, 4 L.Ed.2d 186 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Passport control was not designed solely as a protection for internal security. To adopt such thinking would be naive and unrealistic. So many phases of internal security are intertwined with foreign affairs in the administration of passport control that the two become inseparable. This area of government requires a joint-control effort of the Congress and the Executive, if the intended results are to be obtained. It is one where Congress legislates broad Ianeways of authority to the Executive, within which he must exercise his discretion in effectively administering that authority in a fast changing climate of world affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Congress has provided that the Executive shall take all necessary steps short of an act of war to protect the rights and liberties of American citizens on foreign soil.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Certainly it is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>with an overall policy that he should exercise that authority granted by law, to prevent incidents occurring in those countries, where normal diplomatic relations are non-existent. Those who would pursue this right of unlimited freedom to travel abroad at will, are those who would not hesitate to criticize their government for failing to protect them, if the need arose. This attitude is not dampened, even when such action could jeopardize the foreign policy of the nation. Personal vigilance to safeguard freedom should never be permitted to become a sword used for the destruction of the edifice it protests it is protecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In this ease the authority of the Secretary of State is founded on two specific acts of the Congress, namely, the Passport Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a and \u00a7 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 190, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 211a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cThe Secretary of State may grant and issue passports, * * * under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe for and on behalf of the United States, and no other person shall grant, issue, or verify such passports.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1185:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u201c(a) When the United States is at war or during the existence of any national emergency proclaimed by the President, * * * and the President shall find that the interests of the United States require that restrictions and prohibitions in addition to those provided otherwise than by this section be imposed upon the departure of persons from and their entry into the United States, and shall make public proclamation thereof, it shall, until otherwise ordered by the President or the Congress, be unlawful * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">\u201cCitizens</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">\u201c(b) After such proclamation as is provided for in subsection (a) of this section has been made and published and while such proclamation is in force, it shall, except as otherwise provided by the President, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe, be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States unless he bears a valid passport.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">On December 16, 1950, the President promulgated Presidential Proclamation 2914,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which declared, for reasons therein set forth, the existence of a national emergency. This executive action preceded and was operative when Congress passed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185. Thereafter, on January 17, 1953, pursuant to the foregoing legislation, the President reiterated the existence of the national emergency and accordingly issued a new Presidential Proclamation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is to be noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that not only did it promulgate the continued existence of the national emergency previously referred to in the earlier proclamation, but it pointed to the authority emanating from the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress, which became law on June 27, 1952, as the basis for executive action. This proclamation has never been rescinded or otherwise terminated. The existence of the national emergency still continues.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The House Judiciary Committee of the Congress had compiled for its use in 1958, all those provisions of law which had been brought into effect by the declaration of a national emergency by the President. It was again revised in 1962 and published as the \u201cReport to the Committee on the Judiciary House of Representatives, \u2018Provisions of Federal Law in Effect in Time of National Emergency\u2019.\u201d The foreword of the report prepared by the Committee\u2019s Chairman states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201cThe emergency proclaimed by the President in 1950 had not yet been terminated and the chronic state of international tensions made it clear that it would not be terminated in the foreseeable future. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\u201cThe heightened international tensions which developed in the latter part of 1961 created a new interest in the legal consequences of the actions which might be taken in the cold war by Congress or the President. In particular, there was substantial concern with knowing exactly what legislation would become effective upon the declaration of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>national emergency by the President or Congress, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">On Page 23, pargaraph 6(c) of this report th'e statute presently in question, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185 appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Presidential Proclamation 3004 specifically incorporated by reference the regulations previously prescribed by the Secretary of State and published under Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7\u00a7 53.1 to 53.9; and in addition it authorized the Secretary to revoke, modify or amend these regulations as he might find the interests of the United States to require.

Dulles, supra. The Court there held that these two statutes, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185 and 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a, did not authorize the Secretary to withhold passports of citizens, because of their beliefs or associations; and that the employment of such a standard could not be used to restrain the citizen\u2019s right of free movement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201cWe, therefore, hesitate to impute to Congress, when in 1952 it made a passport necessary for foreign travel and left its issuance to the discretion of the Secretary of State, a purpose to give him unbridled discretion to grant or withhold a passport from a citizen for any substantive reason he may choose.\u201d Kent v. Dulles, supra, 357 U.S. at 128, 78 S.Ct. at 1119, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201cThe government <em>may </em>have the power to forbid the travel of all citizens to particular geographic areas because of war or national emergency.

Rev. 47, 74 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In the present case, Congress established by law the President\u2019s right to regulate and control passport visas within broad bounds of Executive discretion. There has been no claim of arbitrariness in the administration of these regulations. No passport has been claimed to have been denied, because of the applicant\u2019s personal beliefs, writings, character, race, religion, or the like. It does in fact bar the travel of all Americans to a specific geographical area.

The plaintiff himself conceives that his position in this court is to \u201cproperly sue to protect his constitutional rights by alleging that the statute relied upon by the administrative agency does not support the action taken by it, and that <em>if it does </em>it is unconstitutional.\u201d Brief for Plaintiff, p. 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">This analysis is fairly derived from his specific prayer for relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201c(e) Decreeing that the defendant Secretary of State\u2019s restrictions upon travel to Cuba, as embodied in his public announcement of January 16, 1961, Press Release No. 24, in Public Notice 179, 26 F.R. 492, and in Departmental Regulation 108.456, 26 F.R. 482-483, are invalid, without any authority in law, and are unsupported by the Passport Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. 211a, or by Section 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 190, 8 U.S.C. 1185, or by Proclamation 3004,18 F.R. 489.\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Amended Complaint, p. 7)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The Supreme Court in Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. at 129-130, 78 S.Ct. at 1119-1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 treated \u00a7 1185(b) <em>pari passu </em>with \u00a7 211a, although the defendant expressly disclaims reliance upon it here as a source of authority for the regulation excluding travel to Cuba.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The focal point of the plaintiff\u2019s attack is clearly upon the regulation itself. \u201cBut an attack on lawless exercise of authority in a particular case is not an attack upon the constitutionality of a statute conferring the authority even though a misreading of the statute is invoked as justification. At least, not within the Congressional scheme of \u00a7 266. * * * In other words, it [the plaintiff] seeks a restraint not of a statute but of an executive action.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Phillips v.

In that event, the constitutional question is always reserved for secondary determination. The court\u2019s general doctrine of avoiding constitutional questions whenever possible, see United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 45, 73 S.Ct. 543, 97 L.Ed. 770 (1953), is not without significance in determining whether the special three-judge court procedure should be invoked. The decision in Phillips v. United States that an attack upon a state statute was too remote to be cognizant for the procedural purposes of \u00a7 2281 tested by applying the principles set forth by Mr. Justice Cardozo in Gully v. First Nat. Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 116-118, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936), to differentiate between stages of adjudication at which issues are reached would seem to compel a like determination here. See Kesler v.

Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 76-77, 80 S.Ct. 568, 4 L.Ed.2d 568 (1960), that a three-judge court is required whenever a substantial constitutional question is alleged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statutes identified by the plaintiff, \u00a7 211a and \u00a7 1185, present no more of an immediate clash between the Act and the Constitution here than they did in Kent v. Dulles, where the court in openly failing to reach the question of the constitutionality of the same statutes which the plaintiff claims are involved here, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201cWe would be faced with important constitutional questions were we to hold that Congress by \u00a7 1185 and \u00a7 211a had given the Secretary authority to withhold passports to citizens because of their beliefs or associations.

Dulles, our exercise of jurisdiction as a three-judge court would be to permit the plaintiff in this case to wag the dog of a direct route to review by the Supreme Court simply by grasping the tail of a bare allegation of unconstitutionality of a statute and a prayer for an injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Examination of Flynn v. Rusk, 219 F.Supp. 709 (D.D.C.1963), appeal pending, in which a three-judge district court was convened, cited by the plaintiff, Brief for Plaintiff, p. 10, discloses a challenge to the constitutionality of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 993, 50 U.S.C.'\u00a7 785 (1958), which on its face and in specific terms forbids any member of a communist organization to make application for or use or attempt to use a passport. In Bauer v. Acheson, 106 F.Supp. 445 (D.D.C.1952), a case essentially the same as ours, upon which the plaintiff also relies, the misgivings of Circuit Judge Fahy over the lack of jurisdiction of a three-judge court led him to dissent, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">\u201cIn my view therefore the case is one for the usual district court composed of a single judge, with right in the parties to appeal from his decision to the Court of Appeals, followed by right of petition to the Supreme Court for review on writ of certiorari. This litigation should not be deemed within the special class of cases committed by Congress to a specially constituted three-judge court, properly convened only when a substantial question is raised as to the constitutionality of an Act of Congress the enforcement, operation or execution of which is sought to be enjoined, with right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282, supra. <em>Plaintiff in the end </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>seeks at most to enjoin action of the Secretary which might be invalid because not in conformity with the proper construction of the statute under which he acts. She raises, and there is involved, no substantial question </em>as <em>to the constitutionality of the statute.\u201d </em>(106 F.Supp. at 454) (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">That Kent v. Dulles was considered and decided on the merits by the Supreme Court without suggestion that a three-judge court should have been convened cannot be regarded as an omission by it to notice the route by which the case came before it, for as stated in Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, in Mr. Chief Justice Warren\u2019s dissenting opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cThe question is whether a three-judge court was properly convened for the trial of this case.

Acheson, we now know that the Supreme Court did not deem an action to enjoin the Secretary of State from refusing to grant a passport on the basic of regulations promulgated under \u00a7 211a to require the invocation of a three-judge court. Furthermore, in none of three separately considered appeals from summary judgments for the Secretary of State in cases not distinguishable from this one, rendered by a single judge district court after Kent v. Dulles was decided, did the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> make any suggestion that a three-judge court should have been convened. Worthy v.

Under a claim of authority thus derived from \u00a7 211a, the Secretary imposed a restriction upon travel to Cuba on January 16, 1961, Public Notice 179. Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the purpose of \u00a7 211a was merely to centralize a minis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>terial duty to issue passports solely in the Secretary of State ignores the long standing view \u201cthat the issuance of passports is \u2018a discretionary act\u2019 on the part of the Secretary of State.\u201d Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. at 124-125, 78 S.Ct. at 1117-1118, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204. While the Supreme Court held that the Secretary of State does not have \u201cunbridled discretion to grant or withhold\u201d, Id. at 129, 78 S.Ct. at 1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204, a passport, \u00a7 211a was not given such a restricted construction as that for which the plaintiff contends. When the Supreme Court in Kent v. Dulles rejected the Secretary\u2019s argument that long continued executive construction prior to the 1926 enactment of \u00a7 211a warranted the inference that he had discretion to deny a passport on the ground of personal beliefs and associations of a citizen, it pointed out that the scattered rulings affecting communists were insufficient and that the administrative practices which had \u201cjelled\u201d in two categories relating to allegiance and criminal activity were not relevant. But in rejecting the probative value of some and the relevancy of other prior administrative practices to establish that Congress had adopted an interpretation of discretion that embraced the right to deny a passport on the ground of beliefs of a citizen, the Supreme Court did not decide that the Secretary\u2019s discretion to deny passports was limited to only those categories which had jelled. The Court went no further than to \u201chesitate to impute to Congress, when in 1952 it made a passport necessary for foreign travel and left its issuance to the discretion of the Secretary of State, a purpose to give him <em>unbridled discretion </em>to grant or withhold a passport from a citizen for <em>any </em>substantive reason he may choose.\u201d Id. at 128, 78 S.Ct. at 1119, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 (emphasis added). It was reiterating what it had already said about discretion: \u201cBut the key to that problem, as we shall see, is in the manner in which the Secretary\u2019s discretion was exercised, not in the bare fact that he had discretion.\u201d Id. at 125, 78 S.Ct. at 1118, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204. The point of Kent v. Dulles is that the exercise of discretion by the Secretary is subject to judicial scrutiny. See also Schachtman v. Dulles, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 225 F.2d 938, 940 (D.C.Cir. 1955). Although the criteria for measuring the Secretary\u2019s discretion have not been determined other than that it may not be \u201cunbridled\u201d, the fact that Congress gave it to the Executive indicates that it is to be exercised in relation to his powers to conduct foreign affairs. See Schachtman v. Dulles, 225 F.2d at 941-942. It is plain to see that Congress was thinking primarily of the recognized power of the President to conduct foreign affairs when through \u00a7 211a it placed the exclusive authority to issue passports in <em>the Secretary of State, </em>the arm of the President in conducting foreign affairs, under \u201csuch rules as <em>the President </em>shall designate and prescribe <em>for and on behalf of the United States, </em>* '* (Emphasis added). Travel to other nations is at least one facet of foreign affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u00a7 211a is an unconstitutional delegation of power has no merit. The role of delegation is governed not only by the conditions surrounding the particular problem in this case, but by general premises underlying the conduct of foreign affairs, the critical phases of which have always been entrusted to the President and his Secretary of State. The scope and pace of foreign affairs in the condition of the world today would make it impossible for Congress to act without delegation. Where, as here, Congress seeks to implement presidential power, standards other than a reasonable connection to the conduct o^. foreign affairs are not necessary to constitutionality of the delegating act. Chicago &amp; S. Air Lines v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948); see United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936). There is no need to consider whether it would fall within the scope of the President\u2019s inherent powers. But see Worthy v. Herter, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Although passports are sometimes the subject matter of treaties with other nations, the treaty power may include the power to exclude aliens but not the power to impose travel restrictions upon our own citizens. Treaty powers cannot be used to regulate matters which are purely of domestic concern. See Power Authority of New York v. F. P. C., 101 U.S.App.D.C. 132, 247 F.2d 538 (D.C. Cir.), remanded with direction to dismiss as moot, 355 U.S. 64, 78 S.Ct. 141, 2 L.Ed.2d 107 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The question then is whether the Secretary of State through the exercise of the discretion vested in him by the President pursuant to the power delegated by Congress in \u00a7 211a may restrict travel to a country with which the United States has broken off diplomatic relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The conduct of our relations with other nations is the primary responsibility of the President. United States v. CurtissWright Export Corp., supra. In particular, the President has the exclusive power to determine whether to recognize a foreign government and whether to initiate and maintain diplomatic relations. United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 62 S.Ct. 552, 86 L.Ed. 796 (1942). This is not a case like Kent v. Dulles, where the passports were denied to certain citizens because of their beliefs and associations. Rather it designates certain parts of the world forbidden to all American travelers. This can hardly be regarded as arbitrary or capricious by this plaintiff. Cf. Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 350, 59 S.Ct. 884, 83 L.Ed. 1320 (1939). It relates not to internal security, but to foreign affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The refusal to validate plaintiff\u2019s passport for travel to Cuba relates to an exercise of the power to conduct foreign affairs which the Chief Executive already has and is well within the discretion given to the Secretary by the President. The amply sufficient reasons published by the Secretary for the promulgation of the regulation which curtails the plaintiff\u2019s right to travel to Cuba were starkly emphasized when this government confronted the Soviet Union with a demand to remove the missiles it had previously brought to Cuba only a few weeks before Zemel began this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">I am not inhibited in reaching this result by constitutional considerations, for I believe that the restriction on the right to travel that is involved here is a valid' one. \u201c [T] he gravest imminent danger to' the public safety\u201d is required in order to' justify the exclusion of persons from their homes, Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 218, 65 S.Ct. 193, 195, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944), and perhaps a similar showing must be made in order to justify the confinement of a citizen within the boundaries of this country. Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. at 128, 78 S.Ct. at 1119, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204. But the right to travel is properly subject to a reasonable prohibition on travel to a particular foreign country which our government believes to be so unfriendly to this nation as to require the severance of diplomatic relations with it. I do not regard ihe plaintiff\u2019s right to see for himself what was happening in Cuba to be of so exalted a nature that it cannot be subj^Aed to restraint during a period when the State Department predicts that such travel might provoke international incidents which would necessitate negotiations, see 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732 (1958), with a government whose existence the United States is committed to ignore.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">It remains to consider plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u00a7 1185 does not authorize prosecution for violation of an area restriction contained in a passport. Apart from the fact that the Secretary expressly disclaims reliance upon it, that statute is concerned solely with the imposition of sanctions for passport violations, and does not undertake to create passport disqualification limitations. Briehl v. Dulles, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 248 F.2d 561, 581 (D.C.Cir. 1957) (dissenting opinion of Bazelon, J.), rev\u2019d sub nom. Kent v. Dulles, 359 U.S. 116, 78 S.Ct. 1113, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 (1958). Since the area restriction in question is a reasonable regulation of the plaintiff\u2019s right to travel, the plaintiff\u2019s only interest in having the statute construed is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>determine whether he may violate a valid restriction without risking the sanctions which \u00a7 1185 imposes for entry or departure from the United States contrary to its provisions. This is not a sufficient interest to require a construction of \u00a7 1185 before it is raised in a criminal proceeding. Pauling v. Eastland, 109 U.S. App.D.C. 342, 288 F.2d 126 (D.C.Cir.), cert, denied, 364 U.S. 900, 81 S.Ct. 233, 5 L.Ed.2d 194 (1960) ; See International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v.

That statement was made in a special context to refute a claim that a proper reading of \u00a7 2281 limits the requirement of a three-judge court to cases where the constitutional claim is the <em>sole </em>claim before the court. It would be in point here only if the defendant sought to defeat three-judge court jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiff had destroyed pristine applicability of \u00a7 2282 by alternately raising the question whether the President had a right, apart from an Act of Congress, to impose area restrictions reasonably related to the control of foreign relations inherent in the President\u2019s plenary power over foreign affairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">.

If \u00a7 211a of the Passport Act of 1926, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a (1958), the sole statute citea in the regulations as a statutory basis, is construed at face value as a delegation of discretionary power to the Executive to impose restrictions on the issuance of passports to American citizens, it poses a problem of invalid delegation, for there are no standards in the statutory language legislative history, or administrative practice. Comment, Passport Refusals for Political Reasons: Constitutional Issues and Judicial Review, 61 Yale L.J. 171, 192 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">However, I am unable to find in either \u00a7 211a of the Passport Act of 1926 or in \u00a7 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185 (1958), any basis for the area restrictions in the regulations proclaimed by the State Department. Neither act was designed to meet the present problem. Section 211a is nearly identical with the original passport act, 11 Stat. 60 (1856), which was intended to preserve proper respect for American passports by centralizing their issuance in the Federal Government. A number of foreign governments had refused to recognize American passports that were being issued by local magistrates and officials. At that time no passport was necessary to travel abroad, and Congress hardly intended this Statute to authorize the Executive to restrict travel. See Boudin, The Constitutional Right to Travel, 56 Colum.L.Rev. 47, 52-53 (1956); Comment, Passport Refusals for Political Reasons, supra; Note, 41 Corn.L.Q. 282 (1956). See also, Assoc, of the Bar of the City of N. Y., Freedom to Travel 6-7 (1958). Section 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was designed to control entry and exit over our borders in time of national emergency by preventing arrival or departure without a valid passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Since the right to travel is constitutionally protected, some clear grant of power to curtail it must exist before any infringement of the right to travel is upheld. As the Supreme Court put it in Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 129, 78 S. Ct. 1113, 1119-1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">\u201cSince we start with an exercise by an American citizen of an activity included in constitutional protection, we will not readily infer that Congress gave the Secretary of State unbridled discretion to grant or withhold it. If we were dealing with political questions entrusted to the Chief Executive by the Constitution we would have a different case. But there is more involved here. In part, of course, the issuance of the passport carries some implication of intention to extend the bearer diplomatic protection, though it does no more than \u2018request all whom it may concern to permit safely and freely to pass, and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection\u2019 to this citizen of the United States. But that function of the passport is subordinate. Its crucial function today is control over exit. * * * [T]he right of exit is a personal right included within the word \u2018liberty\u2019 as used in the Fifth Amendment if that \u2018liberty\u2019 is to be regulated, it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>be pursuant to the law-making functions of the Congress. * * * And if that power is [to be] delegated, the standards must be adequate to pass scrutiny by the accepted tests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Where constitutional rights are restrained, Kent v. Dulles requires that we be reluctant to imply a broad grant of power by implication from statutes not clearly designed for the purpose. Hence the Supreme Court construed \u00a7 211a and \u00a7 215 narrowly to grant the Executive the power to deny a passport on only two grounds: (1) lack of proof of citizenship and allegiance to the United States and (2) the participation in illegal conduct. \u201cWe can say*with assurance that whatever may have been the practice after 1926, at the time the Act of July 3, 1926 [211a], was adopted, the administrative practice, so far as relevant here, had jelled only around the two categories mentioned. We, therefore, hesitate to impute to Congress, when in 1952 it made a passport necessary for foreign travel and left its issuance to the discretion of the Secretary of State, a purpose to give him unbridled discretion to grant or withhold a passport from a citizen for any substantive reason he may choose.\u201d 357 U.S. at 128, 78 S.Ct. at 1119, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204. If the statutes are to be construed narrowly to preserve individual. rights and to avoid constitutional doubts, they cannot be read as the majority read them as granting to the Secretary of State the power to restrict travel to certain foreign areas for any substantive reason he may choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Even if one adopts the view of the four dissenters in Kent v. Dulles \u2014 that the legislative history of the predecessors of \u00a7 215 and the administrative practice indicated Congressional intent to permit the Secretary of State to exercise his discretion to deny passports to those whose travel might endanger the internal security of the United States \u2014 there is no finding that travel to Cuba by Zemel or those similarly situated would endanger the internal security of the United States. Moreover, the language of \u00a7 215 says nothing about empowering the Secretary of State to restrict travel to certain foreign areas. Rather it says that no citizen shall attempt to enter or leave the United States in time of national emergency without a valid passport. It requires a truly remarkable feat of judicial gymnastics to construe this statute narrowly as a grant of power to invalidate passports for travel to certain countries. The regulations themselves did not purport to be based on \u00a7 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">I do not understand the majority to adopt the approach of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Worthy v. Herter, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 153, 270 F.2d 905 (1959), cert, denied 361 U.S. 918, 80 S.Ct. 255, 4 L.Ed. 186 (1959), which found the power of the Secretary of State to impose area restrictions inherent in the Executive\u2019s plenary power over foreign affairs. Kent v. Dulles implicitly rejected the notion that the Executive had inherent constitutional power to curtail individual freedom to travel abroad. If such inherent power existed, what would be its bounds ? Could travel to France be curtailed if the Executive decided that foreign policy required such curtailment to impose sanctions because of DeGaulle\u2019s recent recognition of Red China? If so, it is easy to see how \u201csuch executive power could, by increasing the number of nations to which travel is excluded while expanding the excepted class of persons for whom travel to such nations is permitted, approach the absolute discretionary control over travel held without warrant in the Constitution by the Kent decision.\u201d Note, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 1610,1611 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">But the majority seem to suggest that passport control is so intertwined with foreign affairs that Congress must have legislated the Executive \u201cbroad laneways of authority.\u201d Rather dubious support for this proposition is sought from 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732 (1958), which requires the President to take steps short of war to secure the release of Americans imprisoned abroad. Still, the entire approach flies in the teeth of the language of Kent v. Dulles \u2014 Where activities or enjoyment, natural and often necessary to the well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>being of an American citizen, such as travel, are involved, we will construe narrowly all delegated powers that curtail or dilute them\u201d 357 U.S. at 129, 78 S.Ct. at 1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We do not pass here on the desirability of area restrictions on travel. I should think Congress might well be justified in this period of international tensions produced by the Cold War in authorizing curtailment of travel to an actively unfriendly nation such as Cuba. It is entirely unrealistic to pretend that there was an end to emergency because of the Korean armistice. However, it is up to Congress to determine that conditions require a dilution of the freedom to travel through area restrictions on passport. See Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944), where the Supreme Court upheld the use of the war power to restrict the freedom of movement of citizens of Japanese origin after a Congressional determination of \u201cthe gravest imminent danger to the public safety.\u201d Cf. Flynn v. Rusk, 219 F.Supp. \u25a0709 (D.C.D.C.1963); Mayer v. Rusk, 224 F.Supp. 929 (D.C.D.C.1963) (on appeal to the Supreme Court, Dkt. 746). The problem here is that as yet Congress has made no determination that there is .an overriding need for area restrictions. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kent v. Dulles, President Eisenhower made a special request to Congress for legislation authorizing the Secretary of :State, subject to substantive and procedural safeguards, to deny passports to persons whose travel would be inimical to the security or foreign relations of the United States and to impose restrictions \u25a0on the use of passports by Americans for travel to areas where their presence might conflict with foreign policy objectives. Special Message of July 7, 1958, 104 Cong.Rec. 11849, 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 5465, 85th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1958). While legislation making it unlawful for members of Communist organizations to be issued passports has been passed, none of the several bills introduced in recent years to authorize area restrictions on passports has been enacted. E. g., H.R. 13318, 85th Cong., 2nd Sess.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I would hold that such legislation is necessary, for the regulations cannot be supported by the existing statutes, inherent executive power, or by any executive agreement. Even if we assumed that constitutional rights could be overridden by an executive agreement, the Managua Resolution of April 3, 1964 was not an executive agreement. The ministers of the seven nations present agreed only to recommend to their governments the adoption, \u201cwithin the limitations of their respective constitutional provisions\u201d, the restriction and discouragement of the movement of their national to Cuba. Area restrictions may be necessary and desirable, but Congress should take the responsibility for authorizing them after a full fact-finding inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Therefore, I would hold that the present statutes do not authorize area restrictions on travel and that the Executive cannot restrict the right to travel without specific statutory authority. I respectfully dissent from the denial of a declaratory judgment to that effect. I dissent not because I disapprove of the ends sought by the area restrictions imposed thus far, but because these restrictions are based on a claimed power whose limits are vague and undefined and whose source I cannot specify.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">While I disagree, as indicated, with the view that the area restrictions are authorized, and would grant a declaratory judgment that they are not, I would dismiss the action as against the Attorney General as at best premature.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
