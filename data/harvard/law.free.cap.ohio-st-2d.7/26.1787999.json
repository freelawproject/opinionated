It cites in support of this position <em>City of Middletown </em>v. <em>City Commission of Middletown, </em>138 Ohio St. 596, and <em>State, ex rel. Didelius, City Solr., </em>v. <em>City Comm. of Sandusky, </em>131 Ohio St. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">The ordinance in question approved plans, together with a cost estimate and a financing plan for the procurement of land and the necessary funds to carry out the urban renewal project, including public utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>This would appear to be the initial ordinance which would be subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">However, relator has a fundamental weakness in his case. Mandamus will issue only where there is a clear legal duty. For a legal duty to exist to submit an ordinance to a referendum under the provisions of Section 5 of Article XVIII, it must appear from the petition that the ordinance relates to a public utility within the meaning of Section <em>\u00e9 </em>of Article XVIII. The mere declaration by a city council that a project is a public utility does not make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The ordinance in question in the present action is one for an urban renewal project which is clearly not a public utility. It is true that the acquisition or construction of public utilities in general is a part of the plan but it is not the primary purpose thereof, it is merely a part of and incidental to the execution of the plan. Section 5 of Article XVIII relates solely to the acquisition of public utilities; it is not a general referendum section.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Thus, where the primary purpose of an ordinance is urban renewal, a nonutility project, such ordinance is not subject to referendum under the referendum provisions relating solely to public utilities merely because the acquisition of the utilities constitutes an incidental part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Second, the ordinance relates to and the petition alleges only in general terms the acquisition of public utilities in the execution of the plan. Section 5 of Article XVIII relates to the acquisition of a specific public utility. Nowhere in the ordinance or the petition does it appear that any specific public utility is sought to be acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">The petition fails to show any facts which would require this ordinance to be submitted to referendum under the provisions of Section 5 of Article XVIII; thus, it alleges no clear legal duty of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">The demurrer to the amended petition is sustained, and the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-13\">Taet, C. J., Zimmerman, Matthias, 0 \u2019Neill, Herbert, Schneider and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
