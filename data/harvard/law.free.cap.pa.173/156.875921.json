J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">While it is true that the net income of the trust estate is directed to be disposed of in the discretion of testatrix\u2019s husband, it is plain from the whole will that her children were the intended objects of her bounty and he but the trustee. The estate is in the first instance given in trust to be equally divided \u201c among her children,\u201d the trust is then directed to be managed as the trustee shall \u201cconsider most\u201d to their \u201cadvantage,\u201d and when all shall have attained twenty-one years, distribution to be made to them with all convenient speed of the proceeds of the \u201centire estate,\u201d \u201cso that my intentions hereinbefore expressed that my children all share equally .... be fully carried out .... and the objects of my bounty may then have each of them entire control of their several separate estate.\u201d The gift being expressly to them and the management of the trust for their \u201c advantage \u201d alone, the inference is that they were intended to have the benefit of the whole. A gift of the corpus is a gift of the income. True, the disposition of the income is intrusted to the discretion of the father; but this followed the express gift of the whole residuary estate to the \u201cchildren,\u201d and was coupled \u201c with the hope and belief, however, that he will use the same in such manner as will be advantageous \u201d to them, and was limited in duration to their minority. The mere direction that the income should be \u201cpaid\u201d to the father and used in his discretion, was not intended to cut down their beneficial estate, but related simply to the manner of use by the children. The testatrix had already made in express words, and independently, provision for him, and if she had intended to give him any beneficial interest in this, would doubtless have said so. The express gift to the children alone, excludes any implication of an intent to vest a beneficial interest in him. The manifest purpose was to give him as head of the family control of the income, so that he might use it in his discretion as he might deem \u201c advantageous \u201d to the children until the youngest should attain majority. No beneficial interest was given him or intended to be given him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">But concede that a beneficial interest was given Mr. Slemmons, was it such as could pass under a voluntary assignment ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The children are expressely given a right of residence with their father, and impliedly a right of maintenance in the mansion house. Can any one take the place of the father as the head of the family, or in determining the amount of \u201c income \u201d that may be used to the \u201c advantage \u201d of the children, or when the mansion shall be sold ? To ask these questions is to answer them in the negative. These are matters of personal trust as to which there can plainly be no substitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-4\">Concede even that the bequest of income is to the husband with but a precatory trust in favor of the children, would it pass without specific mention in the assignment? The father would in that event be under a moral obligation which he might repudiate, but should he be presumed to have violated his wife\u2019s trust and disappointed her \u201c children\u2019s \u201d just expectations in the interest of his individual creditors ? Is there not as much reason to declare this a question of personal privilege as the plea of usury, coverture, statute of frauds and the like, of which creditors can take no advantage ? What equity have the creditors ? Them demand involves at least a breach of moral duty on the part of their debtor and injury to \u201c children \u201d for whose \u201c advantage \u201d the testatrix expressed her \u201c hope and belief \u201d the income should be used, and ought not in equity and good conscience to be made nor allowed: Shay v. Sessamau, 10 Pa. 432.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">And now, to wit, July 14, 1894, this matter came on to be heard at this term upon petition and answer, and was argued by counsel and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that said petition be dismissed at the cost of petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acq\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-7\"><em>J.

Richardson </em>with him, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtB\">\u2014 The question in expounding a will is not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of his words: Weidman\u2019s App., 42 Leg. Int. 338; Hancock\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 532.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-8\">So far from being a mere trustee, as announced by the court below, the husband is the first taker: McFarland\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 300; Wilson v. McKeehan, 53 Pa. 79; Rewalt v. Ulrich, 23 Pa. 388; Smith\u2019s App., 23 Pa. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>A considerable fund was expected to be in the hands of the trustee intended ultimately for the benefit of the children. This might be impaired or wasted by inconsiderate investments. The children, therefore, had the most at stake; and it was natural that the trustee should be directed to make and change investments \u201c at its discretion and as it shall consider most to the advantage\u201d of the children. Such a direction does not warrant the assumption that the children were the sole objects of the bounty of the testatrix: Paisley\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-4\">Nor is the assumption that the children were the sole objects of the bounty of testatrix helped by the precatory words addressed to the husband \u201c with the hope and belief, however, that he will use the same in such a manner as will be advantageous to her children:\" Pennock\u2019s App., 20 Pa. 268; Bowlby v. Thunder, 105 Pa. 178; Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">Every interest owned by a debtor, whether vested or contingent, may be the subject of assignment for the benefit of creditors, unless the instrument creating it contains a valid restraint upon his power of alienation: Wickersham\u2019s App., 18 <em>W. </em>N.
