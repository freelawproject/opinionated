Fitzpatrick, 171 Pa. 50, cited by the appellant, is not in point, because in that case the defendant denied the contract sued upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-11\">As to the allegation that the statement itself is insufficient, the word \u201c justly \u2019\u2019was held not to be essential in Smith, Kline &amp; French Co. v. Smith, 166 Pa. 563.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Alzn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>January 20, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Akgy\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">While it is averred in the statement that \u201c defendant is indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $116.44 .... for work done and materials supplied in making alterations to\u201d her bouse \u201c as set forth in an itemized statement thereto annexed, marked \u2018 Exhibit A,\u2019 and .... that the said materials were furnished and the work done at her instance and request and upon her promise to pay for the same,\u201d it is nowhere averred that the prices set opposite the respective items of \u201cwork done and materials supplied\u201d \u2014 among which are, \u201c1 laborer day $2.00,\u201d and \u201c 100 feet white pine $10.00 \u201d \u2014 are either correct, just or reasonable, or that defendant agreed to pay said prices. If plaintiff believed, or expected to be able to prove that $2.00 for one laborer half a day, and other prices set opposite the respective items in \u201c Exhibit A,\u201d were either just or reasonable it would have been an easy matter for him to have said so. A claim, such as his, for the value of \u201c work done and materials supplied,\u201d cannot be regarded as complete without an averment of the amount or sum that each item is reasonably worth. In substantiating such a claim before a jury, it would be necessary not only to prove each item of work done and materials furnished, but also how much each was reasonably worth. As was well said in Fritz v. Hathaway, 135 Pa. 274, \u201cAs to all matters of substance, completeness, accuracy and precision are as necessary now to a statement as they were before to a declaration in the settled and time honored forms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">But assuming, for argument\u2019s sake, the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s statement, we have no doubt that the averments contained in the affidavit of defense are quite sufficient to carry the case to a jury. After averring \u201c that she has a just, full, true and legal defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d the defendant, evidently still referring to the \u201c work done and materials supplied,\u201d which constitute the basis of plaintiff\u2019s claim, says in substance that on or about October 1, 1892 (the time named in plaintiff\u2019s statement), she made a verbal contract with plaintiff to do said work and furnish the necessary materials for the sum of $35.00, payable on completion of the work; that ever since the completion of the work she has always been ready and willing to pay him, the said sum agreed upon, but he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>always refused to accept the same. <em>We </em>are of opinion that this is the only construction of which the affidavit of defense is fairly susceptible.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
