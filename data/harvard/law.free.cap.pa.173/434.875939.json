Judgment was entered upon the judgment note. Defendant denied that he was a member of either firm and alleged that plaintiff and M. were partners under both firm names. He claimed that the acceptance by the plaintiff of the judgment note and entry of judgment thereon was a satisfaction of the note upon which suit was brought. <em>Iield </em>(1) that the case was for the jury; (2) that the acceptance of the judgment note was not necessarily a release of defendant on the note in suit; (3) it was not competent for defendant to prove that he and M. made an agreement whereby M. assumed all liabilities and indebtedness incurred in the business, and that plaintiff had possession of the agreement, and knowledge of its contents; (4) that an instruction that plaintiff could not recover unless he proved affirmatively that defendant was a partner of M. was'all that defendant was eutitled to; (5) the findings of fact necessarily implied in the verdict were conclusive of plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b454-7\">Argued January 21, 1896.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axn\">Appeal, No. 60, July T., 1895, by defendant, from judgment of C.

Griffee, who still had it in his possession, and that the plaintiff assured the defendant that he,' the defendant, was released from all liability on the promissory note sued upon; and he offered to prove this agreement by means of parol evidence, having shown that the agreement was not in his possession, but was given to the plaintiff, and having notified the counsel for the plaintiff to produce such agreement, which the counsel for the plaintiff had not done, and having also subpoenaed the plaintiff to bring the paper, which said plaintiff had not done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-13\">Which was objected to by the counsel for the plaintiff, the objection sustained by the court and bill sealed for the defendant.

The acceptance by the plaintiff of the judgment note for $1,750, dated Philadelphia, December 2, 1891, signed \u201c Union Export Trading Company, J. K. Miles &amp; Co.,\u201d is a satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of the original debt sued upon, and your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I refuse that proposition. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">2. The acceptance of the judgment note for $1,750, dated December 2, 1891, signed \u201c Union Export Trading Company, J. K. Miles &amp; Co.,\u201d is evidence from which the jury may infer that it was accepted as payment of the debt sued upon, and if they believe it was accepted in payment, their verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Under the evidence in this case I refuse that point also. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">3. Judgment having been entered against J. K. Miles, trading as J. K. Miles &amp; Co. and the Union Export Trading Company, on the judgment note for $1,750, dated December 2,1891, signed \u201c The Union Export Trading Company, J. K. Miles &amp; Co.,\u201d the plaintiff is estopped from alleging that the defendant is still a partner and liable under this suit, and your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Under the evidence in this ease I refuse that point also. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">4. Judgment having been entered against J. K. Miles, trading as J. K. Miles &amp; Co. and the Union Export Trading Company, on the judgment note for $1,750, dated December 2,1891, signed \u201cThe Union Export Trading'Company, J. K. Miles &amp; Co.,\u201d said judgment is a bar to a judgment against the present defendant for the same cause of action, and your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\">5. As the firm, against one of the members of which this suit is brought, was doing business in this commonwealth and in this county, the present action was therefore not a proper case for the issuance of the foreign attachment, and your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer : </em>That is a point under a decision which has already been made in this controversy by this court, and I refuse it. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-10\">6. The plaintiff must prove affirmatively that the defendant \u25a0 was a member of the firm of J. K. Miles &amp; Co. and the Union Export Trading Company. In default of this plaintiff cannot recover. <em>Answer: </em>I affirm that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-11\">7. In order to recover the amounts of money alleged to have been paid by the plaintiff on account of the defendant firm, plaintiff must prove that such sums were paid at the request of the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Under the evidence in this case I refuse that point. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>8. A judgment having been entered by judgment note dated December 2, 1891, for 11,750, signed \u201c J. K. Miles &amp; Co.,\u201d and \u201cUnion Export Trading Company,\u201d before the plaintiff can recover in this action against the defendant he must show affirmatively that said defendant refused to confess a judgment. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse also. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">9. If the jury believe that the plaintiff was a member of the firm of J. K. Miles &amp; Co., or the Union Export Trading Company, then in the absence of any evidence to show that the accounts of said firm have been settled and a balance struck, the plaintiff cannot recover, and your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Under the evidence in this case I refuse that point also. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-6\">10. If the jury believe that the plaintiff knew at the time he entered judgment against John K. Miles, trading as J. K. Miles <em>&amp; </em>Co. and Union Export Trading Company, that George W. Griffee was also a member of said firm, and failed'to name him as a party defendant or to show by the record that he refused to confess judgment, such omission is fatal, and he cannot recover in this case. <em>Answer: </em>I refuse that point. [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-7\">12. Under all the evidence your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer : </em>I refuse that.

Coleman, 82 Pa. 493.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-5\">The contention of the defendant is that there can be but one judgment for one cause of action against the same parties: King v.

So far as they were material, the questions presented by the testimony were accordingly submitted by the learned trial judge with instructions which appear to be adequate and free from substantial error; and a verdict for plaintiff was rendered. In the absence of error, on the part of the court, the findings of fact necessarily implied in the verdict are conclusive of plaintiff\u2019s right to an affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Twelve points for instructions were presented by the learned counsel for defendant, all of which were refused, except the sixth, in which the jury was instructed, as requested, that \u201cthe plaintiff must prove affirmatively that defendant was' a member of the firm J. K. Miles &amp; Co., and the Union Export Trading Company. In default of this, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>With, a single exception, the remaining points thus refused constitute the subjects of complaint in the first to tenth specifications, respectively. We have considered the questions involved in these specifications and find nothing in any of them that would justify a reversal of the judgment; nor do we think that either of them requires discussion. There was no error in rejecting the offer of evidence recited in the last specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
