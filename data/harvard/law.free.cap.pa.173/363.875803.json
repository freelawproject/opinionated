Upon this judgment a writ of venditioni exponas was issued on November 9, 1894, and under the said writ the interest of said John Klein, Jr., in said real estate was sold and the money paid into court for distribution to judgment creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">On May 12, 1893, a confessed judgment was entered up against the said defendant by Frederick Pelly, the appellee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">After the money produced by plaintiffs\u2019 execution was paid into court, Frederick Pelly, the appellee, filed an affidavit in this case, claiming that the fund in court was payable to him as the first lien creditor, and upon said affidavit the court, on April 24, 1895, granted a rule on the plaintiffs to show cause why security should not be entered for the costs of an audit to distribute the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\">Pending the rule plaintiffs presented a petition to the court as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-9\">That they are judgment creditors of the said defendant in the above case. That a scire facias was issued by them to revive the said judgment on April 29, 1893, but before judgment could be obtained upon such scire facias, the said defendant confessed a judgment in the court of common pleas No. 3 of March term, 1893, No. 1018, for $1,680, which said judgment was entered on May 12, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-10\">That upon an execution issued on said judgments the interest of the said defendant in certain real estate acquired by him subsequently to the original judgment in your petitioners\u2019 favor was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale and the proceeds of such sale have been paid into this court for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-11\">Your petitioners allege that the judgment of the said Frederick Pelly above referred to was confessed by the said defendant in his favor without any consideration, and in fraud of the rights of your petitioners as judgment creditors as aforesaid, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>in fraud of the rights of the other creditors of the said defendant, and but for the existence of said judgment your petitioners would be entitled to the fund in court under their original judgment; that the fraudulent character of the said judgment of the said Frederick Pelly is denied by the said Frederick Pelly, and such fact is a material one and is in dispute between your petitioners and the said Frederick Pelly; and your petitioners further allege that the fraudulent character of said judgment and the fact of said dispute appear by the deposition of the said'Frederick Pelly and the said John Klein, Jr., taken upon a rule entered in this case on your petitioners to show cause why security should not be entered for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">Your petitioners therefore pray that an issue be directed by your Honorable Court to try the said fact as to the fraudulent character of the said judgment of the said Frederick Pelly, so, as aforesaid, in dispute between them and the said Frederick Pelly.
