Before Thayer, P.

The bill of lading or shipping receipt under which the fruit was shipped contained the following provision: \u201c The carrier shall not be liable for loss or damage by causes beyond its reasonable control . . . . or by any of the causes incident to transportation, such as chafing, heating, freezing, leakage, rust, or by any other reason not directly traceable to the negligence of the carrier\u2019s servants.\u201d The goods were injured by the excessive heat of the close box car in which they were carried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">Charles G. Monroe, a witness for plaintiff, who delivered the goods to the railroad company, testified that under instructions given him by Mr. Davenport he told one of defendant\u2019s clerks to ship the goods in a ventilated car. There was no evidence that defendant agreed to ship them in such a car. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>evidence that it was customary for fruit to be carried in ventilated cars only when whole car loads were offered for shipment, and then usually under special contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-3\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit saying: \u201cI shall allow the nonsuit on the ground that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to have shown an obligation or contract on the part of the defendant to ship by a particular kind of a car. I do not think that either has been shown.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\">The court subsequently refused to take off the nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\"><em>JError assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-6\"><em>Horace M. </em>Rumsey, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALnY\">\u2014 On motion for nonsuit, if there be any inference of disputed facts, the case must be submitted to the jury: Hill v.

The shipping receipt contains a clause exempting the carrier from loss or damage by causes beyond its reasonable control .... or by any of the causes incident to transportation, such as chafing, heating, freezing, leakage, .... or any other reason not directly traceable to the negligence of \u201d its servants. We find nothing in the testimony to take the case out of the operation of this exempting clause. There was no error in refusing to take off the judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
