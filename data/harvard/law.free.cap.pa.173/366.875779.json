Before Biddle, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-12\">At the trial plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that defendant agreed to pay plaintiff for any medical services that he might render to defendant\u2019s mother, and that defendant had paid some bills to plaintiff in pursuance of this agreement. This was denied by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">In this ease Dr. Holmes brought suit against Mr. Fitzpatrick to recover for medical services furnished to the mother of Mr. Fitzpatrick at his request. The doctor states that a number of years ago, when he first commenced attending the family, that is to say, ten or eleven years ago, he had an interview with Mr. Fitzpatrick, and he said to him, \u201c Whenever my mother sends for you I want you to attend her and I will pay your bill; \u201d and he contends from that time down to almost the day of this lady\u2019s death he had been in the habit of attending her and sending bills to Mr. Fitzpatrick, which Mr. Fitzpatrick had paid, and therefore in the usual course of business he sent this bill to Mr. Fitzpatrick, but, for reasons he has stated, Mr. Fitzpatrick declined to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">Now, as has been said by the defendant\u2019s counsel, it is true that a promise made ten years ago if you were to sue upon it now you could not recover. It is also true that a promise to pay the debt of another must be in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">Those are both true principles of law, but they are not applicable to this case. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-8\">Now the defendant denies that he made this promise to the doctor originally, and he says he has paid bills of his mother, etc., but his explanation of that is that he has paid the bills whenever his mother requested him to pay, but on this occasion she did not request him to pay it, and therefore he declined to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">These are the main questions that you have to decide in this case. If you believe the doctor\u2019s statement that he was continuously attending her on those terms, there is nothing to prevent you giving a verdict for him. On the other hand, a man is not bound to pay a bill simply because it is owing by his mother. That depends on his having bargained to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">Defendant\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-11\">1. The plaintiff cannot recover unless the defendant promised in writing to pay the account sued for. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-12\">3. Under all the circumstances of this case the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-13\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $75.00. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Frrors assigned </em>were (1, 2) above instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-4\"><em>Charles L. </em>Smyth, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8T\">\u2014 The case is clearly within the statute of frauds: Riegelman v.

That testimony presented a question of fact for the jury, and it was accordingly submitted to them by the learned trial judge in a clear and adequate charge, to which no just exception can be taken. The facts upon which the case hinged were established by the verdict; and, the court below having refused a new trial, litigation should have then and there ended. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires further notice. Neither of them is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
