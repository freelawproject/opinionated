In the application for the charter, defendant appeared as subscribing for twenty shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">Defendant offered to prove that at the time he became president of the corporation plaintiff he was employed at the Commonwealth Title Company of Philadelphia; that the plaintiff made an offer to him that if he would leave his position which he was then occupying, and become president of their company, the plaintiff would give him full paid-up stock of the company to the value of $1,000; that, relying upon this offer, the defendant did leave his position and became president of the corporation plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-9\">Offer overruled by the court.

In any aspect of the case, what was offered amounted to proof either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of payment of the subscription or of a set-off to the extent thereof.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-3\"><em>Irving E. </em>Ziegler, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMD\">\u2014 This offer clearly shows that no labor had been performed by the defendant before the stock was given him, and hence, even if the contention of the defendant were true, viz, that the stock was given to him full paid, this act on the part of the corporation would not be authorized by the statute which is invoked by the counsel for the appellant, because, under their offer, the labor could not have been performed before the stock was given, and secondly, the stock sued upon was original stock and not increased stock: Angier v. Eaton, Cole &amp; Burnham Co., 11 W. N. C. 146; Eister v. Paul, 54 Pa. 196; Maynard v. Lumberman\u2019s National Bank, 20 <em>W. </em>N. C. 272; McCracken v. Roberts, 19 Pa. 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-4\">A case cannot be sent to the jury on a mere scintilla of evidence.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AYN\">February 3, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AWE_\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The offer of evidence by defendant should have been admitted. The suit was for the unpaid balance of a cash subscription to stock, and the offer was to show that no subscription in cash was made by defendant, but on the contrary that paid-up stock was to be given him in compensation for services. There is no inherent incapacity of a corporation to purchase property or labor and pay for it by stock instead of money. If the corporation here had paid defendant $1,000 in cash to leave his former situation and undertake its presidency, on condition that he invest the money in its stock, there could be no question of the validity of the transaction, yet it would in substance have been exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">But in addition to its inherent powers to make such contract, the corporation has express statutory recognition of its authority in sec. 17 of the act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 81. The proviso that no stock shall be issued \u201c except for money, labor done, or money or property actually received \u201d does not prevent payment for labor or services bona fide to be thereafter rendered, any more than it prevents contracts to pay in advance for property to be furnished. A corporation in process of for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>mation and not yet in actual operation may have no other mode of getting the necessary equipment to commence business.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Whether the defendant can prove the contract set up, and whether if he does so he is estopped from asserting it against creditors of the corporation, by his joining in the certificate of subscription, are questions not before us. The case has not yet reached that stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Judgment reversed and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
