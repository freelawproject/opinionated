The Diamond Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>bus was going north; the other bus was going south. There was evidence tending to show that the south bound bus was on the wrong side of the street, and that the accident occurred while the driver of the Diamond Street bus, who was also conductor, was collecting a fare. The night was dark and stormy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-3\">The Diamond Street Omnibus Company made no defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-4\">James A.

I think he made some reply of this kind: \u201cHow in hell could I run into you when I was on the right hand side going north, when I had the right of way ? \u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-16\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-17\">[It is alleged by the plaintiff, and witnesses have been called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>to support the contention, that the Diamond Street bus, in which she was, when it got near Columbia avenue was not far from the curbstone, and was on the eastern side, that is the east of the middle of the street; and that it was run into by the bus of the other company defendant while it was on the eastern side of the street, and you are asked to find from that that the Omnibus Company General, the owner of the big bus, was guilty of negligence in that it at any time drove into the Diamond Street bus while the Diamond Street bus was upon the right side of the street, and while the Omnibus Company General\u2019s bus was on the wrong side of the street.] [8] In other words, that it was a collision caused solely by the act of the owners of the big bus in not observing the law of the road, and so carelessly, recklessly running into the smaller bus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-3\">The exact reverse of that is contended for by the counsel representing the Omnibus Company General. It is argued to you, and witnesses have been called who are intended to support that allegation, that the driver of the small bus drove as well as managed that vehicle, he being both its conductor and driver. He not only stopped and took passengers on, but he had to receive their fares, make change and attend to the opening and closing of the rear door, and, in the performance of this duty, drove into the middle of the street and collided with the bus of the Omnibus Company, and that it was an act of negligence that could not be attributed to the negligence of the servants of the Omnibus Company General.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-4\">That raises a question of fact, and that is a question as to which the court cannot help you, and ought not to undertake to express an opinion upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">As a passenger on the Diamond Street bus, the corporation that owned that bus owed this woman the highest care and skill in carrying her safely to her destination, and, indeed, so far have courts gone that they have held that, when a passenger is injured while being transported by a common carrier, the mere happening of the accident raises the presumption of negligence on the part of the carrier, and in this case the doctrine prevails against the Diamond Street Omnibus Company. They, for hire, agreed to transport this woman safely, and it was their duty to do it. She was injured while in their car, and on one of the busses under their control, and when she shows an injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and shows that she did nothing to bring it about, the burden rests upon the Diamond Street Omnibus Company of showing that it was not negligence or that somebody else was negligent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-3\">Now, as to the other vehicle, the big bus. Its duty was simply the duty imposed upon other citizens who used the highway for driving thereon, to observe the law of the road, to respect equally the co-ordinate rights of everybody else on the highway, for the highways do not belong to anybody in particular, but to all the people of the state, for the free and common and equal transportation of their properties and persons over the highway. And the big bus owed that common duty to all other drivers. It owed that common duty to the driver of the Diamond Street bus to respect the rights of that bus, and not to be indiscreet, inattentive, or reckless in the performance of its duty in the management of its bus upon the highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">The following point was presented by the Omnibus Company General, defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">\u201c 1.

R. R., 161 Pa. 388.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ag_\">January 27, 1896 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b402-8\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">This suit against the two omnibus companies was brought to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff while she was a passenger in an omnibus belonging to the first named defendant, resulting from a collision of one of the other company\u2019s omnibuses with the vehicle in which she was riding. The right of the plaintiff to recover against both or either of the defendants depended on questions of fact which were solely for the consideration of the jury. Testimony was introduced for the purpose of showing, on the one hand, that the collision was brought about by the carelessness of the drivers of both omnibuses, and, on the other hand, that it was due solely to the negligence of the driver of the Diamond Street omnibus. Each of the companies, respectively, endeavored to prove that the collision resulted solely from the negligence of the other company\u2019s driver. The testimony was more or less conflicting, but it was all proper for the consideration of the jury. It was accordingly submitted to them in a clear and adequate charge which appears to be free from substantial error. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>found for tbe plaintiff against both companies, and judgment on tbe verdict was entered against both as joint tort feasors. One of tbe defendants, tbe Omnibus Company General, is bere alone complaining of tbe rulings of tbe learned trial judge. Tbe first subject of complaint is bis refusal to charge that there was no evidence \u201c of negligence on tbe part of tbe Omnibus Company General, and tbe jury are instructed to find a verdict in its favor.\u201d In view of tbe fact that there was evidence of negligence, on its part, quite sufficient for tbe consideration of tbe jury, it would have been plain error to have given tbe instructions requested. There was no error in tbe rubng complained of in tbe second specification; nor in that part of tbe charge recited in tbe third specification. Considered as a whole, tbe charge, \u2014 as we have already said, \u2014 was adequate and free from substantial error. Tbe remaining specifications, complaining of the inadequacy and misleading character of tbe charge, etc., are destitute of merit, and may be dismissed without further notice. If appellant considered it important that tbe jury\u2019s attention should be called to tbe matters referred to in tbe 5th and 6th specifications, be should have requested tbe court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
