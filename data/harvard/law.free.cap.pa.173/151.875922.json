That said deeds were made, acknowledged and tendered to the defendant, who refused to accept the same and pay the said purchase money. The cause of the refusal of said defendant to accept the said deeds and pay the said consideration is this: That he is advised that the title of the said plaintiffs to said lots is not a fee simple title, but is a life estate only, and therefore he is not bound to accept said conveyances and pay the purchase money thereon. The clause in the will of Henry Hahne, which is dated August, 1885, and registered in will book, volume 32, page 594, under which plaintiffs take, title, is as follows (as appears by the devise to Chas. C. Hahne, all the other devises to the several plaintiffs being in precisely the same terms) : \u201c Third, As to my real estate lying near the Methodist burying ground, in'Lower St. Clair Township in the County of Allegheny, I devise and dispose of the same as follows: I give, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>devise and bequeath unto my son, Chas.
