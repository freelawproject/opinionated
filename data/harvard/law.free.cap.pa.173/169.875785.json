Defendant accepted the proposition with the modification that the east wall should be \u201cof the height of the grade as it now is immediately west and next to the trestle.\u201d On the same day that the proposition was accepted, plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing by which plaintiff agreed to do all the necessary excavation for defendant \u201c according to the directions and under the supervision of the engineer in charge of the construction of said incline.\u201d Nothing was said in any of the papers as to any earth excavation. After the work was completed plaintiff gave to defendant a receipt \u201c in full settlement for all stone work and excavation \u201d furnished in connection with the construction of the incline plane. Nearly six years after the road was finished plaintiff brought suit against defendant to recover profits which he would have made by earth excavation if the trestles had been set at the level of the street mentioned in his proposition instead of upon the natural surface of the ground as they had been set in accordance with the instructions of the defendant\u2019s engineer. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff was not entitled to recover such profits.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b189-5\">Argued Nov. 6, 1895.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AA19\">Appeal, No. 225, Oct.

By that modification, which is with reference to the first mud sill, or the sill under the first piers of this incline, they say its location is changed in the acceptance. That is true, gentlemen, it was so modified in the acceptance of the proposition. And they say that by that modification, to construct the plane, in accordance with the proposition made by Mr. Huckestein, and as he claims it should have been done, was impracticable; that they could not, starting with the first pier as it was arranged to be placed in accordance with the modification accepting Mr. Huckestein\u2019s proposition, that they could not reasonably have constructed it in accordance with his proposition,-that that changed the whole character of the construction, and that therefore the whole thing was thrown open to the discretion of the company\u2019s engineer, Mr. Diescher, and hence they insist that in accordance with the terms of this third paper Mr. Huckestein was bound to construct the whole incline in accordance with the directions of the company\u2019s engineer, and that it has been so done. Mr. Huckestein has constructed it as directed by the company\u2019s engineer, and they say that that is an end of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\">But the plaintiff claims, and this I take it, gentleman, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>question for your determination under the evidence, that that modification only applied as to the one pier, and that it was in point of fact not on the Swan property, and that although it did modify the location of the sill of the first trestle, yet they could have constructed the balance of the incline through the Swan property in accordance strictly with this proposition of Mr. Huckestein, and hence I say this is for you to determine. [If you find that this modification, made in accepting Mr. Huckestein\u2019s proposition, so changed the character of the whole construction that it could not reasonably be constructed in accordance with -the proposition as originally made, then Mr. Huckestein cannot recover here because he is remitted then to the direction of the company\u2019s engineer. But if you find that although the location of the first sill or trestle was changed by that acceptance they could still have constructed the balance under the original proposition, then they should have done so, and you will then consider further the questions that will be submitted to you.] [B]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-3\">[The defendant company says not only did this modification change the whole construction of the line, but that as tending to show Mr. Huckestein\u2019s' acceptance of the modification for the construction of the whole line, that this property belonged to him, that he knew its lay, and knew that it would be imprac- \u25a0 ticable to construct the incline in any other way than it was constructed. They further say that the stakes that were placed there by the engineer he saw, and did his work of excavating in accordance with them. They further say that the plans which showed the excavation that was necessary for the plane, as it is constructed, were seen by Mr. Huckestein, and that he accepted the doing of the work under those plans, and knew what they were, and that he is concluded thereby. Now, if you should find that to be the case, and that Mr. Huckestein accepted the modification, and did the work in accordance with the direction of the company\u2019s engineer, knowing where the stakes were placed by him, and knowing the plans, in other words, accepted the modification of the contract, then he is concluded thereby and your verdict should be for the defendant company.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for 6]- cents.

There was no provision in any of the correspondence, or in the contract as signed, or in the annexed specifications that gave .an absolute right to the plaintiff to have any earth excavation whatever. But there was positive provision that all.the work, including excavation, should be done, \u201c according to the directions and under the supervision of the engineer in charge of the-construction of said incline.\u201d As no excavation, for- the loss of which the present action is brought, was directed by the engineer it is difficult to conceive upon what rational basis the claim can be sustained. Then too the receipt in full for' every item of claim made after the work was all completed, and which was \u201c in full settlement for all stone work and excavation, labor, material, etc., furnished in-'connection with the construction, etc., of the Nunnery Hill Incline Plane,\u201d may well have convinced the jury that all demands under the contract were fully adjusted, settled and paid. Nevertheless, notwithstanding this receipt in full, the court left it to the jury to say whether this extraordinary claim for loss of profits was intended to be included within it. This suit was not commenced until nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>six years bad elapsed after the work was all done, and in all that time this claim for alleged loss of profits bad never been beard of. The only wonder is that the verdict was not absolutely in favor of the defendant instead of for six and a quarter cents in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. The claim is very stale, it is unsupported by any reasonable view of the testimony and in our opinion it is entirely devoid of merit. The verdict was a condemnation of it on its merits. We discover no error in the several assignments and they are all dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">\u2022 Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
