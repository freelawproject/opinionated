Deponent rented an instrument from him some three years ago, the date of which he cannot now tell, and entered into the usual bailment agreement with him, the said plaintiff, whereby he was to pay the sum of twenty ($20.00) dollars per quarter in the way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>rental, and whenever he desired to purchase the instrument the amount of the rental together with the value of an old piano, which he at that time gave to plaintiff, was to be allowed to him on account of the purchase; that in the month of April last deponent was indebted to plaintiff in the sum of eighty-two dollars and fifty-four cents (182.54) for the balance of the rent due for the said instrument, and then it was agreed that the remaining value of the instrument was the sum of three hundred and twenty-one dollars and fourteen cents, and deponent then and there entered into an agreement with the said Fischer to give him, the said Fischer, deponent\u2019s promissory note at three months for that sum, when, if deponent could not pay the said note or desired to surrender the instrument, that he, the said plaintiff, would take the same back again and surrender and cancel the note; and thereupon the deponent made his note which is sued upon in this case, and thereafter upon the maturity of the said note deponent told the plaintiff that he could not pay the same, and that he, the plaintiff, could have back the piano whenever he wished the same in accordance with their agreement. Several times subsequent thereto, he, the deponent, tendered the instrument and demanded the return of the promissory note, and the plaintiff declined and refused to take the said instrument and surrender up the said note, and although the plaintiff further agreed to send for the instrument and remove the same when requested so to do, and knows where the same now is and that the same has always been since the maturity of the said note at his disposal, he still persists in the repudiation of his contract and agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">Deponent further saith that the original agreement of bailment is still in the possession of the said plaintiff, and he assumes to own the said instrument by virtue thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">The court discharged the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-8\"><em>Henry J.

If the latter, a copy thereof should be attached to the affidavit of defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-9\">If the rule as to parol evidence to vary writings is to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>any application at all, it should be to such cases as this: Ziegler v. McFarland, 147 Pa. 607.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">Even if good in all other respects, the allegation of tender as set forth in the affidavit of defense is imperfect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-6\"><em>Wm.

If the plaintiff had been disposed to waive his right of appeal to this court and proceed to trial, he might have had his-case finally disposed of long ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Appeal dismissed, at plaintiff\u2019s costs, without prejudice, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
