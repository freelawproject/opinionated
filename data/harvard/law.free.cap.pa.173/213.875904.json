L. 44, and the 16th day of May, 1891, P.

James M. Bailey, one of the heirs, filed an affidavit of defense denying the right of the borough under the law to tax a burial lot not held for private or corporate profit, for street improvements, but raising no other matter of defense not apparent on the face of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">1. The court erred in entering judgment against the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, because under the law of the state of Pennsylvania, the property being a burial ground not kept or owned for private or corporate profit, could not be made the subject of a lien for grading, paving and curbing a street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">2. The court erred in entering judgment against the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, because the plaintiff\u2019s hen as filed does not make out a prima facie case for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">3. The court erred in entering judgment against the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, because the hen shows that the ordinance for the grading and paving of Beltzhoover avenue was passed under the act of April 23,1889, and the assessment for which the hen was entered was made under said act and the act of May 16, 1891, which proceeding, partly under one act and partly under the other, is contrary to law, said acts prescribing radically different methods of making assessments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-10\">4. The court erred in entering judgment against the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, because the record does not disclose that the defendants were served with the writ of scire facias in manner and form as prescribed by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>5. The court erred in entering a general judgment against all the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense because only one of the defendants filed an affidavit of defense, and no legal service which would sustain a judgment was made upon any of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">6. The court erred in entering judgment against the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense because there is no law authorizing the entering of a lien or issuing of a scire facias against defendants as heirs of a decedent or otherwise, except by naming them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-5\"><em>Henry A. </em>Davis, <em>C. </em>Magee, <em>Jr., </em>with him, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-6\"><em>Drank M.

Church\u2019s App., 165 Pa. 475; as to the repeal of the act of 1889, Hand v. Fellows, 148 Pa. 456; Hanover Borough\u2019s App., 150 Pa. 202; as to the entry of lien against \u201c heirs: \u201d Northern Liberties v. Coates Heirs, 15 Pa. 245; Wister v. City of Philadelphia, 86 Pa. 215.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7S\">January 13, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AqXq\">Mr. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In the case of SewicHey M. E. Church\u2019s Appeal, 165 Pa. 475, we decided that church property was not exempted from liability to pay assessments for local improvements. We held that such special assessments were not general taxation and therefore did not come within the operation of the constitutional exemptions from taxation of churches and other properties designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Again, in the case of City of New Castle v. Stone Church Graveyard et al., 172 Pa. 86, we held that a graveyard was not exempt from such assessments for the same reasons expressed in the decision of the former case. The present is the ease o\u2019f a graveyard, and of course comes within both the foregoing decisions. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">There is no force in the objection that the ordinance under which the improvement was made was passed under the act of 1889, and therefore no assessment could have been made under the act of 1891. Tins question was settled by our decision in the case of Hand v. Fellows, 148 Pa. 456, and in Frederick Street, Hanover Borough\u2019s Appeal, 150 Pa. 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The fourth and fifth assignments are not sustained because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>there was a general appearance for all the defendants and a general affidavit of defense for all. The objection that there could be no proceeding against the heirs of Jacob Beltzhoover without naming them is answered by the decision of this court in Wistar v. City, 86 Pa. 215, and Northern Liberties v. Coates\u2019 Heirs, 15 Pa. 245. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"A_3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
