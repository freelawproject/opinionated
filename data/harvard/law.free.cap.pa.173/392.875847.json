The said David S. Cann and George E. Saul were both stockholders of the said Penn Elevator Engineering Company, and the said Saul was a director, and the said Cann was the treasurer of the said company, and it was a part of the consideration for the promise and agreement above set forth, that the plaintiff was to ship the goods mentioned to the said corporation in which the said Cann and Saul were heavily interested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-3\">The plaintiff avers that acting upon the promises and agreements of the said defendants, it shipped the goods above mentioned to the Penn Elevator Engineering Company, and that its account for the same amounted to $4,671.44.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-4\">Afterwards the said Cann &amp; Saul shipped to the plaintiff, upon their contract above mentioned, goods to the amount of $1,170.40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">That afterwards the said Penn Elevator Engineering Company became insolvent, and the plaintiff obtained a judgment against them for $3,630, on December 18, 1894, in C.
