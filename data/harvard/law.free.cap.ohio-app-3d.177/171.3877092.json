J.</author>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Danny Lee Hill, appeals the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas denying his petition for postconviction relief. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">{\u00b6 2} On September 10, 1985, 12-year-old Raymond Fife was found brutalized in a field near his home in Warren, Ohio. Raymond died two days later. In September 1985, Hill and an accomplice, Timothy Combs, were indicted for the crime. In 1986, Hill was found guilty, by a three-judge panel in the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas, of the following charges: aggravated murder with specifications of aggravating circumstances, kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, and felonious sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">{\u00b6 3} On February 26, 1986, a mitigation hearing was held to determine whether the death penalty would be imposed for Raymond\u2019s murder. The three-judge panel \u201cconsidered the following factors in possible mitigation: (1) The age of the defendant; (2) The low intelligence of the defendant; (3) The poor family environment; (4) The failure of the State or society to prevent this crime; (5) The defendant\u2019s impaired judgment; (6) Whether or not he was a leader or follower.\u201d The three-judge panel concluded that \u201cthe aggravating circumstances in this case outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">{\u00b6 4} On March 5, 1986, Hill was sentenced to the following: death for aggravated murder; imprisonment for an indeterminate period of ten to 25 years for kidnapping; imprisonment for determinate period of life for rape; imprisonment for an indeterminate period of ten to 25 years for aggravated arson; and imprisonment for a determinate period of life for felonious sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">{\u00b6 5} Hill\u2019s convictions and sentence were upheld on appeal by this court. <em>State v. Hill </em>(Nov. 27, 1989), 11th Dist. No. 3720, 3745, 1989 WL 142761. In our review of the appropriateness of imposing the death penalty, this court noted: \u201cThe record is replete with competent, credible evidence which states that appellant has a diminished mental capacity. He is essentially illiterate, displays poor word and concept recognition and, allegedly, has deficient motor skills. Appellant is characterized as being mildly to moderately retarded. There is some suggestion that appellant\u2019s \u2018mental age\u2019 is that of a seven to nine year old boy. Testimony places appellant\u2019s I.Q. between 55 and 71, which would cause him to be categorized as mildly to moderately retarded.\u201d Id. at *32. This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>affirmed the conclusion that the evidence of low intelligence and impaired judgment were not significant mitigating factors. \u201cConsideration of evidence delineating appellant\u2019s mental retardation is more properly applied when evaluating his ability to knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive his constitutional rights. There is no evidence presented that requires the conclusion that this crime was committed because a mental defect precluded appellant from making the correct moral or legal choice.\u201d Id. at *32.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">{\u00b6 6} Hill appealed his case to the Ohio Supreme Court, which, in accordance with R.C. 2929.05(A), independently reviewed the record to determine that the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors present in the case and that the sentence of death is the appropriate sentence in the case. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 335, 595 N.E.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">{\u00b6 7} The Supreme Court acknowledged that Hill\u2019s \u201cmental retardation is a possible mitigating factor.\u201d Id. The court summarized the testimony of the psychologists who testified during the mitigation phase of Hill\u2019s trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">{\u00b6 8} Dr. Douglas Darnall, a psychologist, testified that defendant had an I.Q. of 55 and that his intelligence level according to testing fluctuates between mild retarded and borderline intellectual functioning, and that he is of limited intellectual ability. Dr. Darnall did state, however, that defendant was able to intellectually understand right from wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">{\u00b6 9} Dr. Nancy Schmidtgoessling, a clinical psychologist, testified that defendant had a full scale I.Q. of 68, which is in the mild range of mental retardation, and that the defendant\u2019s mother was also mildly retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">{\u00b6 10} Dr. Schmidtgoessling also testified that defendant\u2019s moral development level was \u201cprimitive,\u201d a level at which \u201cone do[es] things based on whether you think you\u2019ll get caught or whether it feels good. [Tjhat\u2019s essentially whereabout <em>[sic </em>] a 2-year old is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Douglas Crush, another psychologist, testified that defendant had a fullscale I.Q. of 64, and that his upper level cortical functioning indicated very poor efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">{\u00b6 12} Having reviewed this testimony, the Supreme Court found \u201ca very tenuous relationship between the acts he committed and his level of mental retardation.\u201d Id. at 335, 595 N.E.2d 884. \u201cWhen considering the manner in which the victim was kidnapped and killed; the rape, burning, strangulation and torture the victim endured,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthese aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and affirmed the sentence of death. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>{\u00b6 13} In 2002, the United States Supreme Court held that the execution of mentally retarded criminals violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishments. <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. In <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the implications of the <em>Atkins </em>decision on the execution of capital punishment in Ohio. The court adopted three criteria for establishing mental retardation, based on clinical definitions approved in <em>Atkins: </em>\u201c(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3) onset before the age of 18.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12. The court further held that \u201c[w]hile IQ tests are one of the many factors that need to be considered, they alone are not sufficient to make a final determination on this issue,\u201d and \u201cthere is a rebuttable presumption that a defendant is not mentally retarded if his or her IQ is above 70.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">{\u00b6 14} On January 17, 2003, Hill filed a petition to vacate Danny Hill\u2019s death sentence pursuant to <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, and R.C. 2953.21. Hill asserted that his mental retardation is \u201ca fact of record in his case\u201d and that the state is thereby \u201cbarred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from any attempt to relitigate the proven fact that [Hill] is a person with mental retardation.\u201d In the alternative, Hill argued the trial court should take judicial notice of the fact that he is a person with mental retardation and/or hold a hearing on the issue of his mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">{\u00b6 15} On April 4, 2003, the trial court ruled that Hill\u2019s petition stated \u201csubstantive ground for relief sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing.\u201d The court granted the state\u2019s and Hill\u2019s requests to retain their own experts in the field of mental retardation. Over Hill\u2019s objection, the court determined to retain its own expert to evaluate Hill \u201cpursuant to his <em>Atkins </em>claim.\u201d The court denied Hill\u2019s request to have a jury empanelled to adjudicate his <em>Atkins </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">{\u00b6 16} The state retained as its expert Dr. J. Gregory Olley, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a director of the university\u2019s Center for the Study of Development and Learning. Hill retained as his expert Dr. David Hammer, a professor at the Ohio State University and the director of psychology services at the university\u2019s Nisonger Center. The court, through the Forensic Center of Northeast Ohio, retained Dr. Nancy Huntsman, of the Court Psychiatric Clinic of Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">{\u00b6 17} In April 2004, Drs. Olley, Hammer, and Huntsman evaluated Hill at the Mansfield Correctional Institution for the purposes of preparing for the <em>Atkins </em>hearing. At this time, Hill was administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (\u201cWAIS-III\u201d) IQ test, the Test of Mental Malingering, the Street Survival <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Skills Questionnaire, and the Woodcock-Johnson-III. The doctors concurred that Hill was either \u201cfaking bad\u201d and/or malingering in the performance of these tests. As a result, the full scale IQ score of 58 obtained on this occasion was deemed unreliable, and no psychometric assessment of Hill\u2019s current adaptive functioning was possible. Thus, the doctors were forced to rely on collateral sources in reaching their conclusions, such as Hill\u2019s school records containing evaluations of his intellectual functioning, evaluations performed at the time of Hill\u2019s sentencing and while Hill was on death row, institutional records from the Southern Ohio Correctional Institution and the Mansfield Correctional Institution, interviews with Hill, corrections officers, and case workers, and prior court records and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">{\u00b6 18} The evidentiary hearing on Hill\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>petition was held on October 4 through 8 and 26 through 29, 2004, and on March 23 through 24, 2005. Doctors Olley and Huntsman testified that in their opinion, Hill is not mentally retarded. Doctor Hammer concluded that Hill qualifies for a diagnosis of mild mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 19} In the course of the trial, an issue arose regarding the interpretation of the results of the Vineland Social Maturity Scale test, a test designed to measure adaptive functioning and performed on Hill four times prior to the age of 18. Hill presented the testimony of Sara S. Sparrow, Ph.D., professor emerita of Yale University, to rebut certain opinions expressed by Dr. Olley. In turn, the state called Timothy Hancock, Ph.D., executive director of the Parrish Street Clinic, in Durham, North Carolina, as a surrebuttal witness to Dr. Sparrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 20} The following lay persons also testified at the hearing regarding Hill\u2019s functional abilities: corrections officer John Glenn, death row case manager Greg Morrow, death row unit manager Jennifer Sue Risinger, and corrections officer Steven Black.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">{\u00b6 21} On November 30, 2005, Hill filed a petitioner\u2019s supplemental authority and renewed double jeopardy motion, in which he asserted that the state is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and the Double Jeopardy Clause from relitigating the issue of his mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">{\u00b6 22} On February 15, 2006, the trial court issued its judgment entry denying Hill\u2019s petition for postconviction relief in which he claimed to be a person with mental retardation and rejecting his arguments regarding double jeopardy/collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">{\u00b6 23} On March 15, 2006, Hill filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">{\u00b6 24} On August 21, 2006, Hill, acting pro se, filed a motion to withdraw the merit brief filed by counsel and a request that this court would order a competency hearing to determine whether Hill is competent to waive all appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and proceedings in this matter. The basis for the motion is that appointed counsel had filed a merit brief in this appeal without properly investigating Hill\u2019s \u201c \u2018Atkins\u2019 claims and/or constitutional violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 25} On October 27, 2006, this court issued the following judgment entry: \u201cThe trial court is directed to promptly hold an evidentiary hearing to determine Appellant\u2019s competency to make decisions regarding his counsel and possible waiver of the right to appeal. Depending upon the outcome of that determination, the trial court shall further determine whether Appellant has actually decided to waive his right to proceed in the appeal; and whether that decision has been made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{\u00b626} The trial court appointed Thomas Gazley, Ph.D., with the Forensic Psychiatric Center of Northeast Ohio, to evaluate Hill. Dr. Gazley interviewed Hill on two occasions in November 2006. On December 7, 2006, a hearing was held on the competency issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">{\u00b6 27} On December 8, 2006, the trial court issued a judgment entry finding that Hill is \u201ccompetent to make a decision whether or not to pursue an appeal\u201d and has, \u201cin open court,\u201d expressed his desire to pursue an appeal from the adverse decision of the trial court on the issue of mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">{\u00b6 28} On February 1, 2007, this court overruled Hill\u2019s motion to withdraw the merit brief filed by counsel, and request that this court would order a competency hearing as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">{\u00b6 29} On appeal, Hill raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[1.] The Trial Court Erred in failing to Apply Double Jeopardy and <em>Res Judicata </em>Doctrines to Prevent Renewed Litigation of Mr. Hill\u2019s Status as a Person with Mental Retardation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[2.] The Trial Court Erred in Denying Mr. Hill a Jury Determination of his Mental Retardation Status and Not Imposing the Burden of Proof on the State of Ohio to Prove the Absence of Mental Retardation Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[3.] The Trial Court Erred in Finding that Mr. Hill Was Not a Person with Mental Retardation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[4.] The Trial Court Erred in Determining Mr. Hill was Competent to Proceed with this Appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">{\u00b6 34} Under the first assignment of error, Hill argues that relitigation of the issue of his mental retardation is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and by the doctrine of res judicata/collateral estoppel. Hill cites several cases in which the fact of his mental retardation has allegedly been judicially determined. <em>Hill, </em>11th Dist. Nos. 3720, 3745, 1989 WL 142761 (\u201c[a]p<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>pellant, in the case at bar, admittedly suffers from some mental retardation\u201d); <em>Hill, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 335, 595 N.E.2d 884 (\u201cwe find that defendant\u2019s mental retardation is a possible mitigating factor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 35} Collateral estoppel is one aspect of the doctrine of res judicata and precludes the relitigation in a second action of an issue or issues that have been \u201cactually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.\u201d <em>Goodson v. McDonough Power Equip., Inc. </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 193, 195, 2 OBR 732, 443 N. E.2d 978, citing <em>Whitehead v. Gen. Tel. Co. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 112, 49 O.O.2d 435, 254 N.E.2d 10; <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 381, 653 N.E.2d 226. Cf. <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (collateral estoppel \u201cmeans simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cCollateral estoppel applies when the fact or issue (1) was actually and directly litigated in the prior action, (2) was passed upon and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (3) when the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party in privity with a party to the prior action.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Wing </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 176, 183, 637 N.E.2d 917, citing <em>Whitehead, </em>20 Ohio St.2d 108, 49 O.O.2d 435, 254 N.E.2d 10, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">{\u00b6 37} Application of the doctrine of res judicata/collateral estoppel to a particular issue is a question of law. <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>174 Ohio App.3d 135, 2007-Ohio-6594, 881 N.E.2d 294, at \u00b6 41. Accordingly, it is reviewed under a de novo standard of review, i.e. without deference to the lower court\u2019s decision. <em>Rossow v. Ravenna </em>(Mar. 29, 2002), 11th Dist. No. 2001-P-0036, 2002 WL 480061.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">{\u00b6 38} The lower court, in considering this issue, began with the premise that <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Lott </em>created a new standard and a new procedure for determining whether a capital offender\u2019s mental retardation barred his execution. The court observed that Hill\u2019s \u201cearlier claims of mental retardation (during the pre-trial and trial phases of the underlying case) related to voluntariness of statements, waiver of counsel at an investigatory stage, and waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d With respect to the Eighth Amendment, however, the issue of mental retardation has \u201cconstitutional dimensions and constitutional imperatives\u201d distinguish it from the myriad contexts in which it has previously been considered. Thus, mental retardation \u201chas been scientifically, psychologically, and artfully (in the legal sense) defined in fresh light.\u201d Cf. <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 17 <em>(\u201cAtkins </em>established the new standard for mental retardation\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>On this basis, the lower court concluded that, for Hill, the issue of mental retardation is being litigated for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 39} Our analysis focuses on the first element of collateral estoppel: whether the issue of Hill\u2019s mental retardation \u201cwas actually and directly litigated in the prior action.\u201d We hold that the issue of Hill\u2019s mental retardation was not \u201cactually and directly litigated\u201d at his sentencing hearing because the finding that he was mentally retarded was not essential to the imposition of the death penalty in the same way that it is essential in the <em>Atkins/Lott </em>context.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 40} Hill maintains that \u201cthe issue of mental retardation was essential to his argument against the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d Hill relies on the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Bies v. Bagley </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 519 F.3d 324, decided during the pendency of this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 41} In <em>Bies, </em>the Sixth Circuit concluded the determination that an offender is mentally retarded during the penalty phase is a \u201cnecessary\u201d finding because, under Ohio law, \u201ca sentencing court may not impose the death penalty unless that court has first considered any mitigating factors weighing against a death sentence, * * * and found those mitigating factors proven by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Id. at 336; R.C. 2929.04(B). \u201c[B]ecause a sentencing court\u2019s inquiry is open-ended, determining which mitigating factors are actually present in a case is a necessary first step to determining whether those factors outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>Bies, </em>519 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 42} We disagree. The fact that the sentencing court in a capital case must weigh potential mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances does not mean that a finding that an offender is, or is not, mentally retarded constitutes a necessary finding for the imposition of the death penalty. Rather, the contrary is true under Ohio law. Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes do not require that any express finding be made regarding an offender\u2019s mental retardation. Moreover, at the time Hill was sentenced, an offender\u2019s retardation was not a bar to the imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 43} The \u201cCriteria for Imposing Death or Imprisonment for a Capital Offense\u201d statute provides that the trier of fact in the penalty phase \u201cshall consider, and weigh against the aggravating circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character, and background of the offender, and all of the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>{\u00b6 44} \u201cWhether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cWhether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed, but for the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cWhether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct' or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct to the requirements of the law;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cThe youth of the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe offender\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cIf the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender, the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cAny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">{\u00b6 51} Two observations should be made wi;th respect to the statute. The first is that the statute does not require any express finding regarding an offender\u2019s mental retardation. In <em>pre-Atkins </em>capital cases, an offender\u2019s mental retardation was typically considered as a factor, under subsection (7), potentially affecting the offender\u2019s moral culpability for his or her actions. See, e.g., <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 328, 658 N.E.2d 754; <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 432-433, 653 N.E.2d 253; <em>Hill, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 335, 595 N.E.2d 884; cf. <em>State v. Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, at \u00b6267 (an offender\u2019s \u201climited intellectual abilities are entitled to significant weight in mitigation under the catchall provision of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7)\u201d). Thus, the three-judge panel that sentenced Hill to death did not expressly find or even acknowledge Hill\u2019s retardation. Rather, the sentencing entry noted that Hill\u2019s \u201clow intelligence,\u201d \u201cimpaired judgment,\u201d and \u201cwhether or not he was a leader or a follower\u201d were considered as mitigating factors. An express finding that Hill was mentally retarded was neither required nor necessary to sentence him to death under Ohio law at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">{\u00b6 52} The second observation is that no particular mitigating factor precludes the imposition of the death penalty. The statute is \u201copen-ended\u201d in that the trier of fact must consider any relevant factor. Simply because all relevant factors must be considered does not mean that all relevant factors are material to the imposition of the death penalty. The determination that particular mitigating factors exist is necessary only in the sense that these factors must be weighed against the aggravating circumstances, which, in contrast, must be found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt for the death penalty to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>{\u00b6 53} Beyond consideration of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statute, under the federal law in effect at the time of Hill\u2019s sentencing, the determination that an offender was mentally retarded was not necessary to the outcome of a capital sentencing hearing. In other words, at the time of his original sentencing, Hill was eligible for the imposition of the death penalty regardless of whether he was found to be mentally retarded. As stated by the United States Supreme Court, \u201cmental retardation is a factor that may well lessen a defendant\u2019s culpability for a capital offense,\u201d but it could not be said \u201cthat the Eighth Amendment precludes the execution of any mentally retarded person * * * convicted of a capital offense simply by virtue of his or her mental retardation alone.\u201d <em>Penry v. Lynaugh </em>(1989), 492 U.S. 302, 340, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 54} Because mental retardation did not preclude the imposition of the death penalty at the time of Hill\u2019s sentencing, the state did not have \u201ca full and fair opportunity to litigate\u201d the issue during the penalty phase of Hill\u2019s trial, as is necessary before collateral estoppel may be applied. <em>Bies, </em>519 F.3d at 338, citing <em>N.A.AC.P. Detroit Branch v. Detroit Police Officers Assn. </em>(C.A.6, 1987), 821 F.2d 328, 330; <em>Goodson, </em>2 Ohio St.3d at 201, 2 OBR 732, 443 N.E.2d 978 (\u201can absolute due process prerequisite to the application of collateral estoppel is that the party asserting the preclusion must prove that the identical issue was actually litigated, directly determined, and essential to the judgment in the prior action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cCollaterally estopping a party from relitigating an issue previously decided against it violates due process where it could not be foreseen that the issue would subsequently be utilized collaterally, and where the party had little knowledge or incentive to litigate fully and vigorously in the first action due to the procedural and/or factual circumstances presented therein.\u201d <em>Goodson, </em>2 Ohio St.3d at 201, 2 OBR 732, 443 N.E.2d 978; <em>State ex rel. Westchester Estates, Inc. v.

There was no reason for the state to contest the evidence of retardation introduced at the mitigation hearing because that evidence did not link Hill\u2019s alleged retardation with his culpability for the murder of Raymond Fife. Without this connection, the fact that Hill might be mentally retarded was not particularly relevant to whether Hill could be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>{\u00b6 57} This conclusion is well supported by the remarks of this court and of the Ohio Supreme Court in the direct appeals of Hill\u2019s case. This court observed that Hill\u2019s own expert witness, Dr. Darnall, \u201ctestified that [Hill] possessed an intellectual understanding of right and wrong and further stated that [Hill\u2019s] crimes cannot be attributed to the fact that he was mentally retarded.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>11th Dist. Nos. 3720, 3745, 1989 WL 142761. Thus, \u201c[consideration of evidence delineating appellant\u2019s mental retardation is more properly applied when evaluating his ability to knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive his constitutional rights.\u201d Id. at *32. Likewise, the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed the evidence of Hill\u2019s retardation because it found, \u201c[u]pon a careful review of the expert testimony proffered with respect to defendant\u2019s mental retardation, * * * a very tenuous relationship between the acts he committed and his level of mental retardation. As several of the experts pointed out, defendant did not suffer from any psychosis, and he knew right from wrong.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 335, 595 N.E.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 58} In sum, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Atkins </em>changed the law with respect to capital punishment, making an offender\u2019s mental retardation a material fact as to whether the death penalty could be imposed. <em>State v. Lorraine, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-T-0159, 2005-Ohio-2529, 2005 WL 1208119, at \u00b6 27, citing <em>State v. Bays, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 469, 2005-Ohio-47, 824 N.E.2d 167, at \u00b6 23 (\u201c[t]here is a significant difference between expert testimony offered for mitigation purposes and expert testimony offered for <em>Atkins </em>purposes\u201d). Previously, an offender\u2019s retardation was merely a consideration relative to the degree of moral culpability that may be imputed to an offender for his or her actions. Post-<em>Atkins, </em>the fact of an offender\u2019s retardation constitutes an absolute bar to the imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 59} Additionally, there has been no prior judicial determination that Hill is retarded in accordance with the standards and procedures established by <em>Lott. Hill v. Anderson </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 300 F.3d 679. In a prior habeas petition regarding Hill\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim in the Sixth Circuit, the court ordered the petition to be dismissed and Hill\u2019s case remanded for consideration of his <em>Atkins </em>claims in state court. The court explained that \u201cthe state of Ohio has not formally conceded that [Hill] is retarded,\u201d although several Ohio courts have reached this conclusion, and there is testimony to support it. Id. at 682. \u201cHill\u2019s retardation claim has not been exhausted or conceded. Ohio should have the opportunity to develop its own procedures for determining whether a particular claimant is retarded and ineligible for death.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 60} As noted above, the three-judge panel did not make any express finding regarding Hill\u2019s retardation, but merely noted that his \u201clow intelligence\u201d and \u201cimpaired judgment\u201d were considered as mitigating factors. The statements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>subsequent reviewing courts regarding Hill\u2019s retardation were made without reference to any particular standard or definition of retardation. Thus, Hill\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Bies, </em>wherein the Sixth Circuit noted that \u201cthe state supreme court applied the same clinical definition of mental retardation in its determination that [Bies] is mentally retarded as it did in deciding <em>Lott.\u201d </em>519 F.3d at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">{\u00b6 61} For the foregoing reasons, the question of whether Hill is mentally retarded was not necessary for or particularly relevant to Hill\u2019s sentencing and, therefore, not \u201cactually and directly litigated.\u201d Similarly, under the trial court\u2019s analysis, <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Lott </em>established a new standard for determining what constitutes mental retardation within the context of the Eighth Amendment. Thus, under either analysis, collateral estoppel does not bar the relitigation of this issue. Hill\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 62} Under the second assignment of error, Hill asserts that the burden of proving that he is not mentally retarded is on the state. Hill further argues the state must meet its burden by proving that he is not retarded beyond a reasonable doubt and that he is entitled to have this determination made by a jury of his peers.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 63} Hill relies upon a line of United States Supreme Court cases beginning with <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, and which stand for the proposition that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. In <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556, the United States Supreme Court applied its holding in <em>Apprendi </em>capital sentencing statutes, such as Ohio\u2019s, which require the finding of certain aggravating factors before the death penalty may be imposed. In <em>Ring, </em>the Supreme Court held that the existence of such aggravating factors must be determined by a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 602, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 64} When the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment forbade the execution of the mentally retarded, it left to the individual states the task of developing the appropriate procedures for enforcing the prohibition. <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 317, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335; <em>Hill, </em>300 F.3d at 682 (\u201cOhio should have the opportunity to develop its own procedures for determining whether a particular claimant is retarded and ineligible for death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">(\u00b6 65} In <em>Lott, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he procedures for postconviction relief outlined in R.C. 2953.21 et seq. provide a suitable statutory framework for reviewing\u201d <em>Atkins </em>claims raised by offenders sentenced to death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>before <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, at \u00b6 13. The Ohio Supreme Court further held that \u201cthe trial court,\u201d authorized by R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) to determine the merits of postconviction relief petitions, \u201cshall decide whether the petitioner is mentally retarded by using the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard\u201d and that the petitioner bears the burden of establishing that he or she is mentally retarded. Id. at \u00b6 17 and 21. The Ohio Supreme Court expressly stated that \u201cthese matters should be decided by the court and do not represent a jury question\u201d and that \u201cplacing this burden on a criminal defendant does not violate due process.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18 and 22. The court relied upon decisions of the United States Supreme Court that sanity and competence may be presumed, and the offender bears the burden of rebutting the presumption. Id. at \u00b6 22, citing <em>Medina v. California </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 437, 445-446, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">{\u00b6 66} Hill responds that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lott </em>does not override \u201cthe clear mandate\u201d the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 67} Initially, we note that this court is bound to follow the precedent established by <em>Lott </em>on the issues of procedure and burden of proof for addressing postconviction claims of mental retardation. <em>Lorraine, </em>2005-Ohio-2529, 2005 WL 1208119, at \u00b6 57; <em>State v.

These cases apply to factors <em>enhancing </em>an offender\u2019s punishment beyond what is authorized by statute. \u201c[T]he absence of mental retardation,\u201d however, is not \u201cthe functional equivalent of an element of capital murder which the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re Johnson </em>(C.A.5, 2003), 334 F.3d 403, 405. The determination that an offender is not mentally retarded \u201csimply mean[s] that there [i]s nothing to prevent the court from imposing the maximum penalty of death.\u201d <em>State v. Were, </em>2005-Ohio-376, 2005 WL 267671, at \u00b6 59. \u201cThe issue of retardation can affect a sentence only by mitigating it. It can never enhance it.\u201d Id. See also <em>Walker v.

Gondor, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, at \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 74} With respect to the first criterion, significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is clinically defined as an IQ below 70.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 75} Hill\u2019s IQ was measured nine times between 1973, when he was six years old, and 2000, when he was 33 years old. The scores range from 48 to 71, with the mean being 61.12. In April 2004, Hill scored a 58 on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Drs. Hammer, Olley, and Huntsman all agreed that this result was unreliable due to Hill\u2019s intentionally trying to obtain a low score.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>{\u00b6 76} The trial court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Hill satisfied the first criterion, a conclusion supported by the opinions of Drs. Hammer and Olley. Hill does not challenge the court\u2019s finding that he demonstrates significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 77} The second criterion under <em>Lott </em>for mental retardation requires the offender to demonstrate significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Like intellectual functioning, a person\u2019s adaptive skills are subject to standardized measurement, properly known as psychometric analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 78} In the present case, Drs. Hammer, Olley, and Huntsman attempted to administer various adaptive behavior tests, including the Street Survival Skills Questionnaire (\u201cSSSQ\u201d), the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement, and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (\u201cABAS-II\u201d). No reliable results could be obtained, again on account of Hill\u2019s lack of effort. In several instances, Hill denied being able to perform certain skills that it could be determined from independent observation or collateral information sources that he was able to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 79} On four occasions, between 1980 and 1984, the Vineland Social Maturity Scale (\u201cVineland I\u201d), a measure of adaptive behavior, was administered to Hill. Vineland I yields two types of scores. The first is a \u201csocial age\u201d or \u201cage-equivalent\u201d score. The second is a \u201csocial quotient\u201d or SQ, similar to an IQ in that the score is scaled according to an average score of 100 for the general population. An SQ score of 70, representing two standard deviations below the mean, is necessary for a diagnosis of mental retardation. Only three social age scores are recorded from the results of the Vineland I tests. When Hill was 13 years old, it was reported that his social age was 14. When Hill was 15 and 17 years old, his reported social age was 12. In only one instance was an SQ score calculated. When Hill was 17, Dr. Darnall determined his SQ to be 82.9, which would place Hill in the \u201cborderline\u201d category of mental development, but would not support a diagnosis of mental retardation. Dr. Darnall testified at the mitigation hearing that there was room for \u201cpotential bias\u201d in the results of the Vineland I SQ score, however, because the source of the information was Hill\u2019s mother, and she might have overstated Hill\u2019s abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>{\u00b6 80} At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Olley calculated approximate SQ scores for Hill based on the reported social age scores and obtained results that placed Hill in the borderline range of social/adaptive development.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 81} In rebuttal, Hill presented the testimony of Dr. Sparrow, who helped to revise the Vineland I test in 1984, renaming it the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (\u201cVineland II\u201d). Dr. Sparrow testified that at the time the Vineland II test was being developed, a \u201clinkage study\u201d was conducted by administering both Vineland tests to a sample population of 389 persons to determine what correlation existed between the tests. Based on the study\u2019s results, Dr. Sparrow developed a method of predicting what Vineland II scores would be obtained based on Vineland I scores. In this way, she was able to recalculate Hill\u2019s Vineland I scores to reflect what he would have obtained under the Vineland II test. Hill\u2019s recalculated Vineland scores placed him in the mentally retarded range of scores with respect to adaptive functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 82} In response to Dr. Sparrow\u2019s testimony, the state presented Dr. Hancock as a surrebuttal witness. Dr. Hancock opined that, based on the degree of correlation between the two Vineland tests testified to by Dr. Sparrow, her recalculation of Hill\u2019s adaptive skills was only 27 percent reliable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Dr. Hancock concluded that Hill\u2019s recalculated Vineland scores were not scientifically reliable. Based on Dr. Hancock\u2019s testimony, the state objected to the admission of Dr. Sparrow\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 83} The Ohio Rules of Evidence provide that a witness may testify as an expert when \u201c[t]he witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information\u201d and \u201c[t]he particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a way that will yield an accurate result.\u201d Evid.R. 702(C)(3). \u201cIn evaluating the reliability of scientific evidence, several factors are to be considered: (1) whether the theory or technique has been tested, (2) whether it has been subjected to peer review, (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error, and (4) whether the methodology has gained general acceptance.\u201d <em>Miller v.

The trial court\u2019s conclusion regarding Dr. Sparrow\u2019s testimony does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 86} Alternatively, the trial court stated that it would reject Dr. Sparrow\u2019s testimony in favor of the more credible testimony of the other experts who concluded that Hill\u2019s adaptive capabilities are greater than those of a person with mental retardation. The trial court noted that Drs. Hammer, Olley, and Huntsman all testified that the Vineland tests were not the most accurate measurement of adaptive behavior available and that other tests are preferable, such as the Scales of Independent Behavior, Revised (\u201cSIB-R\u201d). Cf. <em>White, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 12, 2008-Ohio-1623, 885 N.E.2d 905, at \u00b6 49-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 87} Apart from the problematic standardized measurements of Hill\u2019s adaptive skills, the trial court and the expert witnesses had to rely on collateral, largely anecdotal evidence to determine the level of Hill\u2019s adaptive functioning. The trial court acknowledged that such evidence constituted a \u201cthin reed\u201d on which to make conclusions about Hill\u2019s diagnosis, but also recognized that this situation was the result of Hill\u2019s failure to cooperate with the experts retained to evaluate him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court further emphasizes that the burden was on Hill to demonstrate that he is mentally retarded, not on the state to prove that he is not mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 88} The anecdotal evidence before the trial court consisted of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>{\u00b6 89} <em>Public School Records. </em>Hill\u2019s public school records amply demonstrate a history of academic underachievement and behavioral problems.

Although there are references to Hill\u2019s being easily led or influenced by others, the trial court noted that much of Hill\u2019s serious misconduct, including two rapes committed prior to Fife\u2019s murder, occurred when he was acting alone. Hill knew how to write and was described by at least one of his special education teachers as \u201ca bright, perceptive boy with high reasoning ability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 90} <em>Hill\u2019s Trial for the Murder of Raymond Fife. </em>The trial court observed that the record of Hill\u2019s murder trial provided evidence of Hill\u2019s ability concerning self-direction and self-preservation. In particular, the court noted Hill\u2019s initiative in coming to the police in order to misdirect the focus of the investigation by implicating others and Hill\u2019s ability to adapt his alibi to changing circumstances in the course of police interrogation. This last point was also noted by Dr. Olley in his hearing testimony: Hill \u201cstood his ground during that interrogation very, very strongly. * * * He not only modified his story a little bit when he was faced with evidence that couldn\u2019t possibly have avoided. * * * That to me is a kind of thinking and planning and integrating complex information that is a higher level than I have seen people with mental retardation able to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 91} <em>Death Row Records. </em>At the time of the evidentiary hearing, Hill had been incarcerated on death row for 20 years. From this period of time, the trial court considered audiotaped interviews of Hill by Warren\u2019s Tribune Chronicle reporter Andrew Gray in the year 2000. These interviews were arranged on Hill\u2019s initiative in order to generate publicity for his case. The trial court found Hill\u2019s performance on these tapes demonstrated a high level of functional ability with respect to Hill\u2019s use of language and vocabulary, understanding of legal processes, ability to read and write, and ability to reason independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 92} The trial court considered the evidence of the various prison officials who testified at the evidentiary hearing. These witnesses consistently testified that Hill was an \u201caverage\u201d prisoner with respect to his abilities in comparison with other death row inmates. They testified that Hill interacted with the other inmates, played games, maintained a prison job, kept a record of the money in his commissary account, and obeyed prison rules. Prison officials offered further testimony in their interviews with the expert psychologists. One official opined that Hill began to behave differently after <em>Atkins </em>was decided, and he believed that Hill was \u201cplaying a game\u201d to make others think he is retarded. Another official reported that Hill\u2019s self-care was \u201cpoor but not terrible\u201d and that Hill had to be reminded sometimes about his hygiene.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>{\u00b6 93} <em>Hill\u2019s Appearances in Court. </em>The trial court stated that it had \u201cmany opportunities\u201d to observe Hill over an extended period of time and, as a lay observer, did not perceive anything about Hill\u2019s conduct or demeanor suggesting that he suffers from mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 94} Finally, the trial court relied on the expert opinions of Drs. Olley and Huntsman that, with reasonable psychological certainty, Hill\u2019s adaptive skill deficiencies do not meet the second criterion for mental retardation set forth in <em>Lott. </em>Both doctors relied, in part, on the same anecdotal evidence considered by the trial court. The doctors also conducted interviews with Hill and particularly noted Hill\u2019s memory of events surrounding Fife\u2019s murder 20 years before and his ability to recount the narrative of the events and the complex legal history of his case since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 95} It is important to note that the trial court\u2019s use of anecdotal evidence in the present case is distinguishable from the use of such evidence in <em>White, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 12, 2008-Ohio-1623, 885 N.E.2d 905. In <em>White, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court reversed a trial court\u2019s finding that an <em>Atkins </em>petitioner is not mentally retarded where the trial court had relied on anecdotal evidence, such as the fact that the petitioner had a driver\u2019s license and could play video games, to support its finding that the petitioner did not demonstrate significant deficits in adaptive skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 96} In the present case and in <em>White, </em>the trial court relied upon its own perceptions and other lay testimony that the petitioner appeared to function normally. The Supreme Court held that this reliance constituted an abuse of discretion in light of expert testimony that \u201cretarded individuals <em>\u2018may look relatively normal in some areas </em>and have * * * significant limitations in other areas.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 97} The difference between the two cases lies in the fact that in the present case, two of the expert psychologists considered the same anecdotal evidence as the trial court and concluded that Hill was not mentally retarded. The trial court\u2019s conclusions were consistent with and supported by the expert opinion testimony. In <em>White, </em>the two psychologists who examined the petitioner concluded that there were significant deficiencies in two or more areas of adaptive functioning. Id. at \u00b6 21. Thus, the trial court in <em>White </em>had substituted its judgment for that of the qualified experts. \u201cWhile the trial court is the trier of fact, it may not disregard credible and uncontradicted expert testimony in favor of either the perceptions of law witnesses or of the court\u2019s own expectations of how a mentally retarded person would behave. Doing so takes an arbitrary, unreasonable attitude to the evidence before the court and [results] in an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>{\u00b6 98} Another difference is that in <em>White, </em>the experts were able to administer the SIB-R to the petitioner and obtain a psychometrically reliable measurement of his adaptive functioning. Id. at \u00b6 14-20. In the present case, the only qualitative measurement of Hill\u2019s adaptive functioning, the Vineland I test administered when Hill was 17, indicated that Hill functioned at a level above that of the mentally retarded. Apart from this test, the trial court in the present case had no choice but to rely on anecdotal evidence and/or Drs. Olley and Sparrow\u2019s doubtful extrapolations of Hill\u2019s adaptive ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 99} In light of the foregoing, there is abundant competent and credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Hill does not meet the second criterion for mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 100} With respect to the third criterion, the trial court found that Hill had failed to demonstrate the onset of mental retardation before the age of 18. The trial court\u2019s conclusion mirrors its findings under the first two criteria: Hill demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, significantly subaverage intellectual functioning prior to the age of 18, but failed to demonstrate significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills. The evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s conclusions is discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 101} The third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 102} In the fourth and final assignment of error, Hill argues that he was not properly evaluated to determine his competency to proceed with this appeal. Hill asserts that Dr. Gazley did not perform any psychological testing in his evaluation and that the trial court failed to provide Hill with the resources to conduct an independent competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cThere is no requirement that [an offender] be competent in order for his appeal to proceed * * * in the court of appeals.\u201d <em>State v. Brooks </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 537, 539, 751 N.E.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">{\u00b6 104} After the filing of Hill\u2019s appeal, however, this court remanded this case with orders for the trial court to determine his competency \u201cto make decisions regarding his counsel and possible waiver of the right to appeal.\u201d Cf. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 27 (discussing the standard of competence necessary to waive counsel); <em>State v. Berry </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 375-376, 686 N.E.2d 1097 (discussing the standard of competence necessary to waive collateral proceedings in a capital case).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">{\u00b6 105} The trial court appointed Dr. Gazley through the Forensic Psychiatric Center of Northeast Ohio, who interviewed Hill on two occasions. Dr. Gazley also reviewed a court-ordered psychological evaluation of Hill performed by Dr. Huntsman from June 2004. Dr. Gazley concluded, with reasonable psychological certainty, that Hill\u2019s \u201ccurrent statements regarding the appeal process, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>his legal representation, are indicative of adequate mental capacity and a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary reasoning ability, having chosen means which relate logically to his stated end.\u201d The trial court conducted a competency hearing at which Dr. Gazley testified and found Hill competent to proceed with his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 106} Hill cites no authority for the proposition that Dr. Gazley\u2019s evaluation of his competency was inadequate or that he is entitled to an independent evaluation. On the contrary, it has been held that \u201c[a] defendant in a criminal case has no absolute right to an independent psychiatric evaluation\u201d to determine competency. <em>State v.

More precisely, significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is defined as two standard deviations below the mean for the general population, i.e. an adjusted score of 100 on a standardized test.

Appellant entered kindergarten in the Warren city schools and was referred by his teacher, as she had questions and concerns \u201cregarding his present level of intellectual functioning.\u201d As a result of his first evaluation on March 20, 1973, appellant was placed in special education, specifically an educably mentally retarded (\u201cEMR\u201d) class, due to his score on the Stanford-Binet test. Appellant, at age six, did not know his age and thought he was nine. He was immature, did not know his address, and possessed functioning in the visual motor category at the three year, six month level. His reading and verbal skills were at the five-year-old level, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>had a mental age of four years, six months. He was placed on medication, as he was also hyperactive. His intellectual functioning was in the third percentile as compared to the general population. Appellant was tested again on September 10, 1975. He was chronologically eight years and eight months. He tested at an overall 62, which at the time was categorized as educably mentally retarded. Appellant earned a mental age on the Stanford-Binet test of five years and six months. He was placed in the first stanine group or in the first percentile in comparison to the general population. He was deficient in reading at a 1.2 grade level, and his spelling was at a .6 grade-level equivalent. He indicated weakness in verbal reasoning and abstract thinking. He could not spell his last name correctly. It is noted in the evaluation that appellant \u201cwill be limited to his ability to generalize, to transfer learning from one situation to another, to do abstract reasoning or to do much self evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 118} Dr. Hammer testified that appellant tested in the mild mentally retarded range. Appellant\u2019s score of 48 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at age 18 years and four months taken in May 1980 established him in the moderately mentally retarded range. His \u201crelative weaknesses lie in not being able to recall everyday information, do abstract thinking, perform mental arithmetic, perceive a total social situation, perceive patterns and to reproduce symbols using psychomotor speed and coordination.\u201d He frequently engaged in behaviors such as making noises and faces when talking, rolling eyes to the back of his head, being restless and tired, working with pencil hanging out of mouth. He exhibits weaknesses in reasoning ability, originality, verbal interaction, and lack of intellectual independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 119} Appellant was tested again at his school on August 22, 1982. At 15 years old, his reading and math were at a third-grade level. The next psychological evaluation was performed by the juvenile court\u2019s psychologist at the request of Judge Norton for a bind-over proceeding on or about January 10, 1984. Appellant was accused of and later pleaded guilty to two rapes. In two years\u2019 time, he had amassed 13 juvenile felony charges. At age 17 and in ninth grade with a score of 55, Dr. Douglas Darnall, a psychologist for the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas, opined that appellant was mildly mentally retarded and possessed \u201csignificant [deficiency] in his verbal functioning, possessed poor judgment, does not think of consequences, is highly suggestible.\u201d He also opined that appellant requires long-term structured rehabilitation, \u201cBecause of his passivity and limited intellectual ability he can easily be swayed.\u201d He also stated, \u201cDanny does not comprehend the seriousness of his offenses.\u201d Dr. Darnall further opined in his report that \u201chis level of adaptive functioning is poor. And he needs a highly structured facility that can provide programming for mentally retarded youth.\u201d Further, he stated that unfortunately, the record shows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>his family cannot provide such an environment. The probation department agreed and requested, due to his mental retardation and the risk of exploitation if placed in an adult facility, that the request for the bind over should be denied and that he should be placed in a group home and that \u201cDanny will in time need to live in an adult halfway house which would be able to provide both social as well as vocational habilitation.\u201d The bind over was denied, and appellant was sentenced to TCY. On April 25, 1984, the chief psychologist at TCY, Dr. R.W. Jackson, opined in regard to retesting appellant as part of the intake procedure that he tested at a 65 IQ and described appellant as \u201cintellectually limited, socially constricted youth with very few interpersonal coping skills, rather immature and self centered with needs of attention and approval of others.\u201d He also stated that \u201cit appears that Danny will adjust himself to a well structured program. He is so easily led and willing to do what he is instructed to do.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cIn a structured program Danny could no doubt function quite well.\u201d Appellant\u2019s sentence was concluded after his 18th birthday. He was discharged in 1985 and was returned home to his mother, who is also mentally retarded, and reenrolled in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 120} Shortly after his arrest on the charges for which he has been convicted and sentenced to death, appellant, at the age of 18, scored a 68 on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised test. As part of the mitigation preparation, appellant was administered another test in which he scored a 64. At age 33, appellant submitted to an IQ test in prison on which he scored a 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 121} In the instant case, pursuant to the foregoing, appellant was found to be mentally retarded. The record establishes that appellant met the first prong of <em>Atkins/Lott </em>as evidenced by IQ scores below 70. The trial court properly found that appellant satisfied that prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 122} With regard to adaptive skills, the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>White, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 12, 2008-Ohio-1623, 885 N.E.2d 905, at \u00b6 13, recently stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 123} \u201c \u2018[CJlinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills * * * that became manifest before age 18.\u2019 <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 318, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335.

Adaptive behavior tests are designed to assess how a person applies those skills in the tasks of everyday life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 124} The Supreme Court in <em>White </em>continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">{\u00b6 125} \u201cThe mentally retarded are not necessarily devoid of all adaptive skills. Indeed, \u2018they may look relatively normal in some areas and have certain significant limitations in other areas.\u2019 Mildly retarded persons can play sports, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>-write, hold jobs, and drive. * * * [I]n determining whether a person is mentally-retarded, one must focus on those adaptive skills the person lacks, not on those he possesses.\u201d <em>White, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 12, 2008-Ohio-1623, 885 N.E.2d 905, at \u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 126} Drs. Hammer, Olley, and Huntsman all agreed on a protocol for testing appellant in April 2004, and administered various tests, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Ill, the Test of Memory Malingering, Street Survival Skills Questionnaire, Woodcock-Jo'hnson Tests of Achievement, and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II. All three experts agreed, after testing appellant, that the results were unreliable. Thus, it became necessary to look at other sources, including historical data, to make a determination regarding appellant\u2019s mental retardation. The historical data indicated substantial deficits in adaptive skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 127} The trial court, however, found that appellant is not mentally retarded, based upon his superior adaptive behavior. The trial court stressed appellant\u2019s fluency with the language and his articulate presentations in interviews. However, throughout his life, various examiners, including Risinger, have found that appellant had poor hygiene, was easily led, and was unable to provide his address and phone number. All of the examiners who tested appellant before age 33, in preparation for the hearing, found him lacking in multiple adaptive areas. Dr. Sparrow testified that although appellant may have a good vocabulary, adaptive-behavior communications do not measure level of vocabulary in any way. Anyone who talks to him is \u201cleft in the dust\u201d trying to figure out what he is talking about. This shows a deficit in the adaptive behavior of language.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 128} The trial court compared appellant to other death row inmates. However, pursuant to the AAMR, the diagnosis of mental retardation is relative to the general population. Although appellant may be manipulative and a malingerer, he can still be and is mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 129} Appellant introduced the rebuttal testimony of Dr. Sparrow, one of the three authors of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, which was a revision of the Vineland Social Maturity Scale, and administered to appellant four times. Although her credentials are very impressive, the trial court determined that Dr. Sparrow\u2019s rate of error in recasting the old Vineland scores was so high as to render her testimony inadmissible under <em>Daubert, </em>or alternatively, her testimony was rejected outright in favor of Dr. Hancock\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 130} In <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 592-593, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, the court held that the trial court must make \u201ca preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid\u201d and can be applied to the facts at issue properly. The court said that many considerations will bear on the inquiry, including whether the theory can be tested, whether it has been subjected to peer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>review and publication, what its known or potential error rate is and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation, and whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientific community. The inquiry is flexible, and its focus must be on principles and methodology, not on the resulting conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 131} Here, Dr. Sparrow testified about a linkage between the two tests. She indicated that within the control group of people taking both the old and new Vineland, she used a straight correlation between the scores. Dr. Sparrow stated that when two tests target the same areas, one can use this method to link and make a comparison of the scores. The technique at issue has been tested. The linkage data is included in the testing manual, so the methodology has gained general acceptance. Dr. Sparrow\u2019s testimony should not have been excluded. However, the error is harmless. Even without her testimony, the historical evidence is overwhelming in regard to adaptive deficits and mental retardation as observed and documented by both the juvenile court and the multiple evaluators at the Warren city schools and Brickhaven residential placement and the juvenile department of corrections TCY.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 132} The prior testing and independent observations demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant\u2019s scores prior to the age of 18 satisfy the criteria for deficits in adaptive behavior with respect to the second standard under <em>Lott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 133} With regard to the onset before age 18, the trial court found that although appellant had an IQ in the mildly mentally retarded range, there was no evidence to show that he met the criteria of deficits in adaptive functioning. This is dehors the record. The trial court concluded this despite overwhelming evidence and evaluations to the contrary from a multitude of sources that he spent virtually all of his school years in programs for the mentally retarded. Appellant\u2019s IQ scores ranged from 48 to 70, during the time period when he was first tested at six years and two months, up to the age of 18. The record establishes that appellant had poor personal hygiene, was immature, behaved inappropriately, had difficulty making friends, lagged behind intellectually, and was consistently developmentally slow. Appellant committed serious crimes at the age of 17. However, the fact that he engaged in criminal conduct does not negate a diagnosis of mental retardation. The record supports the fact that appellant experienced the onset of mental retardation prior to the age of 18, thereby satisfying the third standard under <em>Lott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 134} Based on <em>Atkins, </em>executing a person with mental retardation status, regardless of context, violates the Eighth Amendment. Here, I believe the trial court abused its discretion in finding that appellant was not a person with mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>retardation, because he met the three <em>Lott </em>criteria for classification as mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">{\u00b6 135} Accordingly, I would affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the matter for resentencing under the statutory guidelines for noncapital cases of aggravated murder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
