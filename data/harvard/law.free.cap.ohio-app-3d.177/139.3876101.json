In return, Eye Specialists promised to pay Porteo $320,178. Because Eye Specialists wanted to open its Portsmouth office as soon as possible, the contract called for \u201csubstantial completion\u201d of the building no later than November 27, 2003. The contract defined \u201csubstantial completion\u201d to mean possession of an \u201coccupancy permit.\u201d If the renovation was not substantially completed by that time, Porteo agreed to pay a $200 per day penalty. In the end, Porteo did not obtain the required \u201coccupancy permit\u201d until several months after the targeted completion date.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">{\u00b6 4} Porteo commenced the instant action on September 28, 2004 and alleged that the contract was completed, but Eye Specialists owed an additional $31,061.13 for extra construction (change orders) that it had requested. Eye Specialists denied liability, counterclaimed for various alleged breaches of the contract, and requested compensatory damages in excess of $25,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Porteo denied any liability on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 5} At the November bench trial, the parties focused on the change orders and their impact on the overall contract. Gary Cunningham, owner of Porteo, testified at length about numerous change orders Eye Specialists requested during construction. John Kendall, a carpenter and inspector, testified that roof leaks in the budding were caused by faulty installation of a generator. The witness explained it would take $8,000 to $10,000 to repair the roof. Likewise, Terry Lee Shultz, the clinic director for Eye Specialists, testified that he was quoted $10,000 to repair the roof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court entered judgment for Porteo on December 1, 2006. The court concluded that due to the various change orders, Porteo was not at fault for the delay in completing the construction project. Further, the court ruled' that Porteo was due and owing $17,885.13 for additional work that it had performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 7} An appeal was taken from that judgment, but we dismissed it for lack of a final order due to an unresolved counterclaim. See <em>Portco, Inc. v. Eye Specialists, Inc., </em>173 Ohio App.3d 108, 2007-Ohio-4403, 877 N.E.2d 709. On January 16, 2008, the trial court found that Eye Specialists failed to present any credible evidence in support of its counterclaim and, thus, entered judgment against them. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error involves the issue of monies owed to a materialman. West Virginia Electric, Inc. (\u201cWVE\u201d) was to supply an \u201cemergency generator\u201d to be used in operating rooms. A dispute arose between WVE and Porteo prompting WVE to file a mechanic\u2019s lien against the property. That lien was released in this action when WVE defaulted on answer to Eye Specialists\u2019 third-party complaint against them. Eye Specialists argues that because the hen was vacated, Porteo had no legal obligation to pay WVE for the generator and, thus, has been unjustly enriched by that amount. Eye Specialists therefore concludes that the amount of damages it was ordered to pay Porteo should be credited by the amount of the generator. We disagree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">{\u00b6 9} We believe that appellant fails to distinguish the mechanic\u2019s lien and the contractual obligation (or debt) that underlies it. See <em>Schlueter v. Shaheen </em>(Nov. 8, 1989), Hancock App. No. 5-88-27, 1989 WL 138133 (courts consistently recognize separate enforcement of the lien and the underlying contract); <em>Thrush v. Thrush </em>(Apr. 26, 1988), Union App. No. 14-86-17, 1988 WL 40427 (distinction between mechanic\u2019s lien and underlying debt). A mechanic\u2019s lien (1) gives a materialman an interest in the property to secure payment for materials and (2) fixes the order of priority for that payment. The debt underlying the lien is completely separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 10} Here, the trial court\u2019s order voiding the mechanic\u2019s lien on Eye Specialists\u2019 property removed WVE\u2019s security in that property for payment of the generator. It did not affect the underlying debt Porteo owed WVE for that material.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, and it is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant asserts in its second assignment of error that the trial court erred by failing to award damages under the contract due to Portco\u2019s failure to complete all construction by the specified date.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">{\u00b6 13} In its December 1, 2006 judgment, the trial court found that \u201cit would be inappropriate to assess\u201d a penalty for the failure to timely complete the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>construction because the delay resulted from Eye Specialists\u2019 change orders. Generally, an appellate court should not reverse a trial court\u2019s factual finding if that finding is supported by some competent, credible evidence. <em>Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 7, 10, 722 N.E.2d 1018; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, at the syllabus. This standard of review is highly deferential and even \u201csome\u201d evidence is enough to support a court\u2019s judgment and prevent a reversal. See <em>Barkley v. Barkley </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 155, 159, 694 N.E.2d 989; <em>Willman v. Cole, </em>Adams App. No. 01CA725, 2002-Ohio-3596, 2002 WL 1560888, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">{\u00b6 14} Gary Cunningham, the owner of Porteo, testified about the numerous change orders that Eye Specialists requested. He also stated that, but for those change orders, the construction would have been completed by the November 27, 2003 deadline. This is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 16} In its third assignment of error, Eye Specialists objects to the trial court\u2019s determination that it failed to adduce credible evidence to show that Porteo performed in an unworkmanlike manner. In particular, Eye Specialists argues that the court ignored testimony of its expert witness that Portco\u2019s work caused the roof to leak. Eye Specialists also points out that Porteo offered no evidence to rebut the testimony of its expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 17} As trier of fact, questions of weight and credibility generally rest with the trier of fact. See <em>Cole v. Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 771, 777-778, 696 N.E.2d 289; <em>Jacobs v. Jacobs, Scioto </em>App. No. 02CA2846, 2003-Ohio-3466, 2003 WL 21500026, at \u00b6 31. The rationale for deferring to the trier of fact on those issues is because it is best situated to view the various witnesses and to observe their demeanor, gestures and voice inflections and to use those observations to weigh credibility. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 615, 614 N.E.2d 742; <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. A trier of fact may choose to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it. <em>Rogers v. Hill </em>(1998), 124 Ohio App.3d 468, 470, 706 N.E.2d 438; <em>Stewart v. B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 35, 42, 623 N.E.2d 591. It is important to recognize that a trier of fact is not required to accept the testimony of a witness simply because that testimony was uncontroverted. See <em>GTE N., Inc. v. Carr </em>(1993), 84 Ohio App.3d 776, 780, 618 N.E.2d 249, 251, at fn. 3; see also <em>State v. Caldwell </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 667, 680, 607 N.E.2d 1096, 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>{\u00b6 18} In the case sub judice, the trial court stated that it did not find the expert\u2019s testimony to be credible. Because this appellate court is not in a position to view that witness, or hear his testimony, we should not \u201csecond-guess\u201d the trial court on the issues of evidence weight and witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 20} Having reviewed all errors assigned and argued by appellant in its brief, and finding merit in none of them, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-8\">McFarland, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b183-9\">Kline, J., concurs in assignments of error II and III, and dissents as to assignment of error I.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. Eye Specialists also filed a third party complaint against West Virginia Electric, Inc., on a mechanics lien that it had against the property. That matter was ultimately resolved on a default judgment. The trial court ruled that the lien was \u201cnull and void\u201d and ordered the Scioto County Recorder to cancel it of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">. It is unclear whether Shultz was referring to Kendall\u2019s estimate or to another quote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-11\">. We note that after release of the lien, Porteo paid $6,500 to settle the claim for the generator. Gary Cunningham agreed during his testimony that the difference between the original cost of the generator and the amount for which he settled with WVE should be deducted from the amount of damages to which his company was entitled from Eye Specialists. Because this issue is irrelevant to the legal principles involved, however, we need not consider the settlement in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b183-10\">Kline, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-P\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">{\u00b6 21} I respectfully dissent as to the first assignment of error and concur in judgment and opinion as to the second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">{\u00b6 22} With regard to the first assignment of error, I agree with the majority\u2019s opinion insofar as it finds the underlying debt owed to WVE pursuant to contract remained despite the dismissal of the mechanics\u2019 lien. As a result, I agree that there is no merit to Eye Specialists\u2019 contention that Portco\u2019s payment to WVE was voluntary. Thus, the trial court did not err in awarding Porteo the $6,500 it paid to WVE in settlement of the underlying debt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">{\u00b6 23} However, Eye Specialists\u2019 alternative argument is that the trial court erroneously stated that the amount owed to WVE was $11,000, rather than the actual $11,789.53 originally owed to WVE. Eye Specialists contends that it should have been credited $5,289.53 ($11,789.53 minus the $6,500 amount paid by Porteo), rather than the $4,500 actually credited ($11,000 minus the $6,500 amount paid by Porteo). I agree, and would sustain Eye Specialists\u2019 assignment of error in this regard. Thus, in my view, Portco\u2019s award should be reduced from $17,885.13 to $17,095.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, I dissent, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b183-15\">. Although not totally clear, it appears that Eye Specialists argues that the court awarded Porteo the entire $11,789.53 owed to WVE. This is not the case. The trial court found that WVE was owed $11,000 but was paid $6,500 by Porteo in full settlement of the debt. The court only awarded Porteo the $6,500 it paid, and credited Eye Specialists $4,500.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
