Gabbard argues that in finding her \u201cunsuitable,\u201d the court simply rejected her lifestyle and parenting decisions based upon its own paternalistic view of \u201csocietal norms,\u201d rather than determining the issue upon the proper basis of whether her behavior had an adverse effect on her son. She also argues that the evidence does not support the court\u2019s finding that her retention of custody would be detrimental to her son. However, our review of the record shows that Gabbard failed to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision with the trial court and thus forfeited all but plain error relating to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 2} Nonetheless, the juvenile court applied the proper legal standard when it considered both Gabbard\u2019s lifestyle (living in squalor, the lack of a structured and stable environment, and the presence of unsavory live-in companions) and the negative effects it had upon Z.A.P. Likewise, it properly considered Z.A.P.\u2019s happiness and the vast improvement in his behavior and medical conditions that have resulted from his placement with Wingrove. Because these facts support a finding that Gabbard\u2019s retention of custody would be detrimental to Z.A.P., we find no error, plain or otherwise, and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">I. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 3} Z.A.P. was born on February 24, 1995, and is the natural son of Gabbard and Jeffrey Pike. In March 2007, Wingrove, Z.A.P.\u2019s maternal step-grandmother, filed for legal custody with the Washington County Juvenile Court and received a temporary order placing Z.A.P. in her care. She later filed an amended complaint, and the matter was referred to a magistrate for a hearing. On February 7, 2008, the magistrate issued his decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law. The following facts are based on the magistrate\u2019s decision, which was adopted by the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Z.A.P. was born in North Carolina, where he lived with his mother and father. Gabbard lived at several residences in North Carolina before eventually relocating to Ohio after the child\u2019s father was incarcerated. Z.A.P. lived with Gabbard at two residences in Belpre, Ohio, and then several residences in Hamilton County, Ohio. In 2001, she married Kenneth Gabbard, who became a father-figure to Z.A.P., and later she and Gabbard had a son, Alex.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 5} During the summer of 2005, Gabbard sent Z.A.P. to live with Wingrove. After the summer, Z.A.P. returned to live with his mother in Hamilton County, Ohio. In August 2006, Gabbard again sent Z.A.P. to live with Wingrove. This time it was supposed to be for a year. Gabbard signed a \u201cgrandparent power of attorney\u201d and enabled Wingrove to get Z.A.P.\u2019s Social Security disability money, which he was apparently receiving as a result of a disability involving his father. Because she was having marital problems and was busy attending nursing school, Gabbard sent Z.A.P. to live with Wingrove for a year. She also sent Z.A.P.\u2019s half-brother, Alex, to live with Wingrove for a substantial part of 2006 and 2007. Wingrove placed Alex with her sister because she did not think that she could handle both children. In March 2007, after Wingrove made it known that she was planning on seeking custody, Gabbard tried to physically recover Z.A.P. However, Wingrove immediately filed for custody and obtained a temporary order.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 6} While Z.A.P. resided with his mother, he did not have a \u201cstable and secure home life.\u201d Gabbard usually kept the house dirty and in disarray and at different times she had several unrelated people living in the house with her, one of which was described by the local police as a \u201cdruggie.\u201d The police were called several times to Gabbard\u2019s residence; she called the police four times to complain about Z.A.P.\u2019s behavior, and Z.A.P. called the police to complain about Dean Chase, Gabbard\u2019s live-in boyfriend. Z.A.P. did not have any real structure within the home, and he was fed fast-food and did not have anyone to help him with his homework. Despite the instability, however, Z.A.P. did have a good relationship with his mother before she sent him away in August 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 7} Gabbard still resides with Chase, and Z.A.P. is concerned about having to live with him. Z.A.P. accuses Chase of physically hurting him in the past, including punching him, throwing him against a wall, and purposely dropping a heavy toolbox on his leg. The mother\u2019s ex-husband is also concerned about leaving his son Alex with Chase and is looking into obtaining child care for Alex so that he does not have to leave him alone with Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 8} While Z.A.P. was living with his mother, he did not have a good attitude and had serious behavior problems. He was the class clown, a bully at school, and he got into numerous fights. Due to his behavior, Z.A.P. took several medications, including methylphenidate, Adderall, Strattera, Ritalin, Focalin, and Concerta, as well as medications to help him sleep. Since moving in with Wingrove, he has \u201ctransformed into a completely different person.\u201d He has gone from a \u201cskinny-looking kid into a solidly built young man,\u201d but it is not clear if this was caused by better nutrition or if the child had simply hit a growth spurt. His behavior has also undergone a substantial positive change; his grades, attendance, and behavior have dramatically improved, and he no longer requires any medication to help him with his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 9} Z.A.P. is concerned about having to live with his mother again. He is afraid that if he goes back into that unstable environment he will lose everything positive that he has gained, his behavior will regress, and he will again require medication to control his behavior. Gabbard agrees that Z.A.P. will require a substantial amount of counseling to get him to want to live with her again. Z.A.P. has a very close relationship with Wingrove and his grandfather, Rod Wingrove. Rod Wingrove participates in lots of activities with the child, including helping him with his homework, Boy Scouts, hunting, four-wheeling and spending time at the farm. Z.A.P. has bonded with a group of friends who live near Wingrove\u2019s residence and enjoys going to school from her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 10} Z.A.P. indicated that he wants to live in Wingrove\u2019s home, where he has thrived in the structure and attention that he has received there. Finally, Z.A.P.\u2019s guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) performed an extensive investigation in this case and concluded that it was in Z.A.P.\u2019s best interest that he be placed with Wingrove.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 11} After considering all of the evidence, the magistrate concluded that Z.A.P. will be \u201cemotionally devastated\u201d if he is returned to his mother\u2019s custody. The magistrate specifically found that the GAL\u2019s report notes that Z.A.P. \u201ctotally broke down\u201d crying in front of his principal because he is worried about the court making him live with his mother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The magistrate also concluded that Gabbard has failed to provide her son with a stable and structured environment, noting that she had lived in numerous different locations with him and twice sent him away for long periods of time. The magistrate contrasted Gabbard\u2019s unstable environment with the fact that Z.A.P. is currently \u201cthriving physically, mentally and emotionally in the stable environment that [Wingrove] has provided.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>magistrate also noted that witnesses described Gabbard as \u201cthe world\u2019s worst housekeeper\u201d and that Z.A.P. did not have a clean home in the mother\u2019s house, contrasting that with the fact that Z.A.P. now \u201ctakes pride in keeping his room at [Wingrove\u2019s] house clean.\u201d Finally, the magistrate concluded that Z.A.P. does not feel safe living in his mother\u2019s home with Chase, who he has accused of committing several acts of violence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">{\u00b6 12} Therefore, the magistrate concluded that Wingrove proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it would be detrimental to Z.A.P. to remain with Gabbard because she is an unsuitable parent. The decision granting Wingrove\u2019s request for custody stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">A party may, pursuant to Rule 40(E)(3)(a) of the Ohio Rules of Juvenile Procedure, file written objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision within fourteen days of the filing of the decision, regardless of whether the court has adopted the decision pursuant to Juv.R. 40(E)(4)(c). Objections shall be specific and state with particularity the grounds of the objection. A party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any finding of fact or conclusion of law unless the party timely and specifically objects to that finding or conclusion as required by Juv.R.(40)(E)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 13} In an entry dated that same day, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision and granted Wingrove legal custody of Z.A.P. The trial court did not issue separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, but rather adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision in its entirety. Neither party filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 14} Gabbard now appeals and contends that the trial court erred in granting Wingrove\u2019s motion for custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">II. Lack of Objections/Plain Error</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 15} Initially, we must address Wingrove\u2019s contention that Gabbard failed to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and thus waived all errors relating to that decision, except plain error. Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(i) requires a party to file written objections to the magistrates decision within 14 days. If no one files objections, the court may adopt a magistrates decision, unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>determines that there is an error of law or other defect evident on the face of the magistrates decision. See Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(c). Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(e)\u00ae allows the court to enter judgment within the 14-day period, but the timely filing of objections operates as an automatic\" stay until the court disposes of those objections. Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(iv) provides that \u201c[ejxcept for plain error, a party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any finding of fact or legal conclusion, whether or not specifically designated as a finding of fact or conclusion of law under Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(a)(n), unless the party has objected to that finding or conclusion as required by Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b).\u201d Thus, the failure to file written objections challenging a finding of fact or conclusion of law precludes a party from assigning as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of that finding or conclusion, absent plain error. \u201cThe waiver under [former] Juv.R. 40(E)(3)(b) embodies the long-recognized principle that the failure to draw the trial court\u2019s attention to possible error, by objection or otherwise, when the error could have been corrected, results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>In re Etter </em>(1998), 134 Ohio App.3d 484, 492, 731 N.E.2d 694. The plain-error doctrine is applicable in civil cases only where the error \u201cseriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 122-123, 679 N.E.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 16} Our review of the record shows that the magistrate issued his decision, and the trial court adopted the decision that same day. Thereafter, neither party filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Accordingly, Gabbard\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate\u2019s decision prevents her from raising assignments of error related to that decision, other than as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">III. Is Gabbard \u201cUnsuitable\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 17} In her sole assignment of error, Gabbard contends that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that she is an unsuitable parent and that it would be detrimental to her son to allow her to retain custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">{\u00b6 18} A trial court has broad discretion in determining custody matters. <em>Reynolds v. Goll </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 121, 124, 661 N.E.2d 1008. Consequently, we can sustain a challenge to a trial court\u2019s custody decision only upon a finding that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; rather, it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, we are not free to merely substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 137-138, 566 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>1181. A deferential review in a child-custody case is appropriate because much may be evident in the parties\u2019 demeanor and attitude that does not translate to the record well. <em>Davis, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 419, 674 N.E.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">B. Custody Disputes Involving a Nonparent</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 19} It is undisputed that the right of a parent to raise her own child is an essential and basic civil right. <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169, citing <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551. Thus, natural parents have a paramount right, as against third parties, to custody of their children. <em>Murray, </em>supra; <em>Clark v. Bayer </em>(1877), 32 Ohio St. 299, 310. This right, however, is not absolute. See <em>In re Kovaleski, </em>Washington App. No. 05CA12, 2006-Ohio-317, 2006 WL 199549, at \u00b6 14, citing <em>In re Johnson </em>(Mar. 29, 1995), Ross App. No. 94CA2003, 1995 WL 146064. In a custody proceeding under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) between a parent and a nonparent, the court may not award custody to the nonparent without first determining that the parent is unsuitable to raise the child, i.e., without determining by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent abandoned the child or contractually relinquished custody of the child, that the parent has become totally incapable of supporting or caring for the child, or that an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child. <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047, at syllabus. If a trial court\u2019s \u201cunsuitability\u201d finding is based on detriment to the child, the court must measure suitability in terms of the harmful effect on the child, not in terms of society\u2019s judgment of the parent. <em>In re Dunn </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 268, 271, 607 N.E.2d 81, citing <em>Perales </em>at \u00b6 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">C. Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 20} Gabbard challenges the accuracy of certain factual findings. For example, she argues that the \u201cyear\u201d that she sent Z.A.P. to live with Wingrove was actually only seven months because she attempted to take him from Wingrove upon learning that she was filing for custody. She also argues that the magistrate\u2019s finding that Kenneth Gabbard does not want to leave his son, Alex, alone with Chase ignores Kenneth Gabbard\u2019s testimony that despite his apparent dislike of Chase, he has in fact dropped off Alex to Gabbard\u2019s house for visitation for over a year. And she argues that the magistrate\u2019s finding that the child had a bad attitude while living with her, including being \u201cthe class clown, a bully at school, and getting into numerous fights,\u201d is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 21} Under Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(iii), a party objecting to a magistrate\u2019s factual finding is required to support the objection with a transcript of all the evidence submitted to the magistrate relevant to that finding. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>may properly adopt a magistrate\u2019s factual findings without further consideration when the objecting party fails to provide the court with a transcript of the magistrate\u2019s hearing or other relevant material to support their objections. <em>In re Maxwell, </em>Ross App. No. 05CA2863, 2006-Ohio-527, 2006 WL 290292, at \u00b627, citing <em>Proctor v. Proctor </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 55, 60, 548 N.E.2d 287, in turn citing <em>Purpura v. Purpura </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 237, 515 N.E.2d 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"> {\u00b6 22} The fact that Gabbard failed to file objections at the trial level and failed to provide the trial court with a transcript or affidavit precludes us from considering the transcript she has submitted in this appeal. See <em>Maxwell, </em>2006-Ohio-527, 2006 WL 290292, at \u00b6 28, citing <em>Lincoln S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Damron, </em>Lawrence App. No. 02CA4, 2003-Ohio-2596, 2003 WL 21152844. See also <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Chippewa Twp. Trustees </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 728, 730, 654 N.E.2d 1254. \u201cThis is because appellate courts will not take into consideration evidence not presented before the trial court.\u201d <em>Maxwell, </em>citing <em>Unger v. Reams </em>(Aug. 6,1993), Lake App. No. 92-L-116, 1993 WL 317448. Furthermore, \u201c[w]hen portions of the record necessary for the determination of an assigned error are absent, the reviewing court has nothing to pass on and has no choice but to presume the validity of the trial court\u2019s proceedings.\u201d <em>Lincoln </em>at \u00b6 27, citing <em>Metzger v. Metzger </em>(Aug. 21 1989), Crawford App. No. 3-87-39, 1989 WL 94813.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 23} Without the transcript properly before us, we simply have no basis to conclude that the trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s factual findings. To the extent that Gabbard\u2019s assignment of error is based on challenges to the factual findings, we must presume the validity of the trial court\u2019s proceeding and reject her contention that the trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we will limit our review to determining whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was based on the correct legal standard and whether the factual conclusions in the magistrate\u2019s decision supported the trial court\u2019s judgment that she was unsuitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">D. Application of <em>In re Perales</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 24} Here, the trial court found that Gabbard is an unsuitable parent because her retention of custody would be detrimental to the child. Gabbard now contends that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard when it determined that she is an unsuitable parent. She acknowledges that \u201con its face\u201d the magistrate\u2019s decision set forth the proper standard; yet, she claims that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s reasoning demonstrates it engaged in a judgment of [Gabbard] based upon societal norms.\u201d She refers us to portions of the magistrate\u2019s decision that comment upon her poor housekeeping, her decision to temporarily place her children with Wingrove, and her relationship with Chase as indicators of the magistrate\u2019s use of an improper analysis. Specifically, she points to the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>trate\u2019s findings that she \u201chas a history of sending her children to live with others for long periods of time when it is convenient for her\u201d and that \u201c[w]hile it may have been beneficial for the mother not to have to deal with her children for a year, it certainly creates bonding and stability problems for the child to be moved between caretakers.\u201d She also points to the magistrate\u2019s finding that she was described by the witnesses at trial as \u201cthe world\u2019s worst housekeeper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">1. Societal Norms or Adverse Impacts?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 25} Our review of the magistrate\u2019s decision shows that the magistrate cited the proper legal standard set forth in <em>Perales </em>and also specifically stated: \u201cWhen courts determine parental unsuitability based upon detriment to the child, the courts must measure unsuitability in terms of the harmful effect on the child, not in terms of society\u2019s judgment of the parent. <em>In re Dunn </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 268, 271, 607 N.E.2d 81; <em>In re Perales, </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 98, 369 N.E.2d 1047.\u201d In support of the conclusion that the mother had failed to provide Z.A.P. with a stable and structured environment, the magistrate made several findings, including the findings that Gabbard now contends reflect a judgment based on societal norms. However, we conclude that the magistrate applied the correct legal standard, i.e., analyzing \u201cunsuitability\u201d in terms of the harmful effects that Gabbard\u2019s behavior and the environment she provided had on Z.A.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 26} There are several factual findings supporting the conclusion that the magistrate considered the effect of the conditions he noted, rather than simply concluding that Gabbard is an unsuitable parent because he did not approve of her lifestyle. The magistrate found that Z.A.P. would be \u201cemotionally devastated\u201d if he was required to live with Gabbard. While living with Gabbard, Z.A.P. had \u201cserious behavior problems\u201d and was required to take several medications to control his behavior and to help him sleep. The magistrate also found that now that Z.A.P. is no longer living with Gabbard, he is \u201cthriving physically, mentally and emotionally.\u201d The magistrate concluded that Z.A.P. \u201ctransformed into a completely different person\u201d after leaving Gabbard\u2019s home; his behavior \u201cdramatically improved,\u201d and he no longer requires any medication to help him with his behavior. He also noted that Z.A.P. does not want to live with Gabbard and is in fact afraid to go back into the unstable environment she provided; Z.A.P. actually \u201ctotally broke down\u201d crying in front of his school principal because he is worried about the court making him live with his mother. And the magistrate found that Gabbard had lived at several different locations and at different times had several unrelated individuals living with her; and she had twice sent Z.A.P. to live with Wingrove for extended periods of time. These findings are relevant in determining the harmful effects that her failure to provide a stable home environment had on Z.A.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 27} While the mere existence of an unclean home or other lifestyle choices may not in isolation form the basis for finding unsuitability, the court could nonetheless consider the harmful effects that constantly moving, living in squalor, and the absence of structure or attention had on Z.A.P. While the magistrate may have offered his own editorial comments about Gabbard\u2019s decision to place Z.A.P. with Wingrove, stating that she did so \u201cwhen it [was] convenient\u201d or \u201cbeneficial\u201d to her, the underlying considerations were nonetheless proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">2. Gabbard\u2019s Custody Is Detrimental</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 28} Gabbard contends that the evidence fails to show that her retaining custody would be detrimental to the child. She argues that the trial court simply determined that Wingrove provided a better environment for Z.A.P. Notwithstanding Z.A.P.\u2019s desire to live with Wingrove, Gabbard contends that the evidence was insufficient to deprive her of her fundamental interest in raising her son. In support of this contention, she challenges the weight to be afforded certain factual findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 29} Gabbard has failed to provide Z.A.P. with a \u201cstable and structured environment\u201d or a \u201csecure home life.\u201d While living with his mother, Z.A.P. lived at numerous locations, including several in North Carolina, two in Belpre, Ohio, and then several in Hamilton County, Ohio. At different times while Z.A.P. resided with her, Gabbard had several unrelated people living in the house with her, including one person who police described as a \u201cdruggie.\u201d And the police had to respond numerous times to Gabbard\u2019s residence when Z.A.P. was living with her. Moreover, Z.A.P. does not feel safe living in his mother\u2019s home with Chase, whom Z.A.P. accuses of physically hurting him several times in the past. While in Gabbard\u2019s care Z.A.P. had no stability, no structure, and lacked proper guidance. He suffered from various medical disorders, which have disappeared after his placement with Wingrove.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 30} These facts support the trial court\u2019s judgment that it would be detrimental to Z.A.P. for Gabbard to retain custody and that she is therefore an unsuitable parent. Contrary to Gabbard\u2019s contentions, we do not believe that the facts merely demonstrate that Wingrov\u00e9 has provided a better environment for the child; nor do they demonstrate that the trial court gave undue consideration to Z.A.P.\u2019s wishes to remain in Wingrove\u2019s home. Rather, we believe that they sufficiently demonstrate the harmful effects her custody would have on Z.A.P. Specifically, the factual findings demonstrate the negative physical, mental, and emotional effects that Gabbard\u2019s custody previously had on Z.A.P., and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>further show that since leaving Gabbard\u2019s home, Z.A.P. has undergone dramatic positive changes concerning his behavior, health, happiness, attitude, social skills, and school grades and attendance. He is now \u201cthriving physically, mentally and emotionally\u201d and no longer requires medication to control his behavior. The record clearly contains a rational basis to support the finding that retention of custody by Gabbard would have harmful effects on Z.A.P. This is especially so where his desire to remain in Wingrove\u2019s home is based in part on that fact that he is afraid to live in that unstable environment and does not feel safe living with Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 31} Because the trial court\u2019s judgment was based on the proper legal standard and because the magistrate\u2019s factual findings provide an evidentiary basis for the trial court\u2019s finding that it would be detrimental to Z.A.P. for Gabbard to retain custody, there is no error, plain or otherwise. We overrule Gabbard\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-7\">Abele, P.J., and McFarland, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\">. As noted below, we do not have a transcript properly before us due to Gabbard\u2019s failure to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Thus, the magistrate's factual findings are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>presumptively correct and we use them here rather than presenting testimony in a narrative form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">. Neither side has contested the court\u2019s apparent substantive use of the GAL's report. But see <em>In re Hilyard, </em>Vinton App. No. 05CA630 through 05CA639, 2006-Ohio-1977, 2006 WL 1045504, \u00b6 53 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\">. Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(a)(iii) requires that a magistrate\u2019s decision include conspicuous language informing the parties that \"a party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any factual finding or legal conclusion, whether or not specifically designated as a finding of fact or conclusion of law under Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(a)(ii), unless the party timely and specifically objects to that factual finding or legal conclusion as required by Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b).\u201d The magistrate\u2019s decision actually cites Juv.R. 40(E)(3), the former rule concerning waiver, which was superseded by Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(iv), effective July 1, 2006. We note, however, that Gabbard does not claim on appeal that she was not properly apprised, as required under the rules, of the procedural rules for filing objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\">. To the extent she would challenge the accuracy of these factual findings, we have already rejected that contention above. See \u00a7 III. C.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
