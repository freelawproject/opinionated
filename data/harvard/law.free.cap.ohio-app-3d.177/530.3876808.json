After a careful review of the pertinent constitutional provisions, statutes, and case law authority, this court concludes that R.C. 9.481 is constitutionally enacted pursuant to Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution, and therefore we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 3} Mindful of the presumption of constitutionality afforded the General Assembly\u2019s legislative enactments, we have concluded that R.C. 9.481 is a valid exercise of the legislature\u2019s broad authority to regulate public employees\u2019 right to collectively bargain the terms and conditions of their employment pursuant to Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution. We hold that the statute regulates a matter of statewide concern and therefore does not unconstitutionally infringe on the city\u2019s home rule powers, and we have also determined that the statute offends neither the Uniformity Clause nor the Contract Clause of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 4} We recognize that many economically depressed cities sought to either maintain or regain a stable, economically productive workforce through enactment of residency requirements for their public employees, but if a municipality such as the city of Warren wishes to challenge the wisdom of the General Assembly in enacting R.C. 9.481, its resort is to the political process and not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 5} <em>Substantive and Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 6} The parties in this case are (1) the city of Warren, a municipal corporation organized under the laws of the state of Ohio, and (2) the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local # 74, and Warren Management Association (\u201cunions\u201d), two labor organizations representing various employees of Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">{\u00b6 7} On May 29, 1991, Warren City Council passed City Ordinance No. 10262/91, which enacted Section 155.05 of the city\u2019s Codified Ordinances. Section 155.05 requires, as a condition of employment, that any person appointed as a nonelected official or employee of the city become a resident of the city and remain a resident throughout his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">{\u00b6 8} On May 1, 2006, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 9.481, which prohibits municipalities from imposing a residency requirement as a condition of employment on their employees. The statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(B)(1) Except as otherwise provided in division (B)(2) of this section, no political subdivision shall require any of its employees, as a condition of employment, to reside in any specific area of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201c(2)(a) Division (B)(1) of this section does not apply to a volunteer.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(b) To ensure adequate response times by certain employees of political subdivisions to emergencies or disasters while ensuring that those employees generally are free to reside throughout the state, the electors of any political subdivision may file an initiative petition to submit a local law to the electorate, or the legislative authority of the political subdivision may adopt an ordinance or resolution, that requires any individual employed by that political subdivision, as a condition of employment, to reside either in the county where the political subdivision is located or in any adjacent county in this state. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 12} Senate Bill 82, which enacted R.C. 9.481, contains two uncodified sections declaring the legislative intent in the enactment of R.C. 9.481. Section 2 of Senate Bill 82 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIn enacting section 9.481 of the Revised Code in this act, the General Assembly hereby declares its intent to recognize both of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(A) The inalienable and fundamental right of an individual to choose where to live pursuant to Section 1 of Article I, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(B) Section 34 of Article II, Ohio Constitution, specifies that laws may be passed providing for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of all employees, and that no other provision of the Ohio Constitution impairs or limits this power, including Section 3 of Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 16} Furthermore, Section 3 of Senate Bill 82 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe General Assembly finds, in enacting section 9.481 of the Revised Code in this act, that it is a matter of statewide concern to generally allow the employees of Ohio\u2019s political subdivisions to choose where to live, and that it is necessary to generally prohibit political subdivisions from requiring their employees, as a condition of employment, to reside in any specific area of the state in order to provide for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of those public employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">{\u00b6 18} Also, in connection with the enactment of R.C. 9.481, the Ohio Legislative Service Commission stated its finding that there are 125 cities and 13 villages throughout the state of Ohio that have some form of residency requirements in their charters. \u201cIn some cases these requirements pertain to management employees of the city (city manager, finance director, treasurer, etc.). Many of the larger cities in the state such as Cleveland, Akron, Toledo, Dayton, and Youngstown (by ordinance) have residency requirements for virtually all city employees to live within city limits.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>{\u00b6 19} On June 14, 2006, the unions filed a complaint in the Trumbull County Common Pleas Court against Warren and its mayor, Michael J. O\u2019Brien, seeking a judgment declaring that (1) Section 155.05 of Codified Ordinances of Warren is in conflict with R.C. 9.481; (2) R.C. 9.481 preempts Section 155.05 of the Codified Ordinances of Warren; and (8) Section 155.05 of the Codified Ordinances of Warren is of no force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">{\u00b6 20} Warren filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that the enactment of R.C. 9.481 is an infringement of its power pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution, and also a violation of (1) Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution (the Contract Clause), (2) Section 26, Article II, Ohio Constitution (the Uniformity Clause), and (3) the separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 21} On October 23, 2006, the Ohio Attorney General filed a motion to intervene, which the trial court granted. All three parties subsequently filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 22} On September 14, 2007, the trial court granted the unions\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Warren\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court found R.C. 9.481 to have been enacted constitutionally pursuant to the authority granted to the General Assembly in Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution. Therefore, the trial court struck down Section 155.05 of the Warren Codified Ordinances as having been superseded by R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 23} Warren now appeals, raising four assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred in concluding that section 9.481 of the Ohio Revised Code was a valid enactment pursuant to Article II, Section 34 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred in striking down Section 155.05 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Warren by concluding that Section 155.05 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Warren was superseded by Section 9.481 of the Ohio Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred in not finding Section 9.481 of the Ohio Revised Code to be in violation of Article II, Section 26 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[4.] The trial court erred in not finding Section 9.481 of the Ohio Revised Code to be in violation of Article II, Section 28 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">{\u00b6 29} Summary judgment is appropriate under Civ.R. 56(C) when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion favors the moving party. <em>Temple </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267. An appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 N.E.2d 712, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, whether a statute is constitutional is a question of law reviewed de novo by an appellate court. <em>Wilson v. AC&amp;S, Inc., </em>169 Ohio App.3d 720, 2006-Ohio-6704, 864 N.E.2d 682, \u00b6 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 31} <em>Presumption of Constitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 32} We begin our review with the recognition that all statutes have a strong presumption of constitutionality. See <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 633 N.E.2d 504. Before a court may declare unconstitutional an enactment of the legislative branch, \u201c \u2018it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doyle v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 46, 47, 554 N.E.2d 97, quoting <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus. A party raising a facial challenge, as Warren does in the instant appeal, must demonstrate that there is no set of circumstances in which the statute would be valid. <em>Harrold v. Collier, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 44, 2005-Ohio-5334, 836 N.E.2d 1165, \u00b6 37. Courts have a duty to liberally construe statutes to avoid constitutional infirmities. <em>Hughes v. Registrar, Ohio BMV </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 305, 307, 681 N.E.2d 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 33} With those considerations in mind, we begin our analysis of the constitutionality of R.C. 9.481. The General Assembly has declared that it enacted R.C. 9.481 pursuant to the power conferred by Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution. That constitutional provision states:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cLaws may be passed fixing and regulating the hours of labor, establishing a minimum wage, and providing for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees; and no other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 35} On the other hand, Section 155.05 of the Warren Codified Ordinances was enacted purportedly pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution (the \u201cHome Rule Amendment\u201d), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cMunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 37} <em>Whether R.C. 9.481 was Validly Enacted Pursuant to Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 38} In the first assignment of error, Warren claims that the enactment of R.C. 9.481 is not a proper exercise of the authority granted in Section 34, Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>II, Ohio Constitution, but rather an unconstitutional infringement of Warren\u2019s home-rule power. The unions contend that the statute was properly enacted pursuant to the broad grant of authority conferred by Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution, and therefore supersedes Warren\u2019s residency requirement codified in Section 155.05 of its Codified Ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 39} Because of the supremacy clause in Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution, if R.C. 9.481 is a valid exercise of the legislature\u2019s power conferred in this constitutional provision, the statute trumps Section 155.05 of the Warren Codified Ordinances, despite Warren\u2019s home-rule power granted in Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. See also <em>State ex rel. Mun. Constr. Equip. Operators\u2019 Labor Council v. Cleveland, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 183, 2007-Ohio-3831, 870 N.E.2d 1174 (the legislative authority under Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution to pass laws concerning the general welfare of employees takes precedence over municipal home-rule authority). Therefore, the first issue for our consideration is whether the General Assembly properly exercised its Section 34 power in enacting R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 40} We first note that although the General Assembly declared in the uncodified portion of Senate Bill 82 that it was its intent to enact R.C. 9.481 pursuant to Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution, a judicial review is still necessary to determine whether the General Assembly acted within its constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 41} Because the matter of an employee\u2019s residency obviously does not relate to the hours of labor or minimum wage specifically enumerated in Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution, the question for our determination is whether an employee\u2019s residency is a matter relating to \u201cthe comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees\u201d and therefore appropriate for legislation as contemplated by Section 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 42} After reviewing the case law authority pertaining to the General Assembly\u2019s legislative authority pursuant to Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution, we believe the residency question is best considered in the context of the line of cases in which the Supreme Court of Ohio has interpreted this constitutional provision to confer upon the General Assembly broad authority to regulate public employees\u2019 right to collectively bargain the terms and conditions of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 43} <em>Constitutionality of Legislation Governing Collective Bargaining Pursuant to Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">{\u00b6 44} On April 1, 1984, the General Assembly enacted the Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Act (\u201cAct\u201d), codified in R.C. Chapter 4117, in order to establish a legal framework for public-sector labor relations. <em>Local 4501 v. Ohio </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>State Univ. </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 191, 195, 24 OBR 420, 494 N.E.2d 1082. The Act established a comprehensive collective bargaining law for Ohio\u2019s public employees. <em>State ex rel. Williams v. Belpre City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 1, 6, 534 N.E.2d 96. The Act permits public employers and their employees to negotiate employment terms for the purposes of minimizing the possibility of public-sector disputes and facilitate the determination of the rights and obligations of government employees and employers. <em>Cincinnati Metro. Hous. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 221, 560 N.E.2d 179. The Supreme Court of Ohio, furthermore, has held that the provisions in the Act are constitutionally enacted within the General Assembly\u2019s authority to enact \u201cemployee welfare legislation\u201d pursuant to Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution. <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 20, 539 N.E.2d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 45} Since the enactment of the Act, however, the Supreme Court of Ohio has been called upon on several occasions to resolve the potential conflicts between the Act\u2019s provisions and the home-rule power enjoyed by municipalities pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. The court has determined on these occasions that the legislative authority conferred by Section 34 is broad enough to prevail over the home-rule power in the public-employee collective bargaining context.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Kettering v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 50, 26 OBR 42, 496 N.E.2d 983, the court upheld the constitutionality of R.C. 4117.01(F)(2), which requires a public employer to bargain collectively with a union representing its police command officers. In his concurring opinion, Justice Douglas explained the historical context of Section 34, Article II enacted at the time of the Home Rule Amendment, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cSection 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, the so-called Home Rule Amendment, was drafted and recommended for adoption at the Ohio Constitutional Convention of 1912. However, that is not all that was forthcoming from that convention. A number of measures, dealing with the welfare and rights of employees, also emerged. Among those provisions was Section 33, Article II, dealing with mechanics\u2019 liens; Section 35, Article II, authorizing a workers\u2019 compensation system; Section 37, Article II, providing for an eight-hour day for employees engaged in public works; and Section 41, Article II, setting forth restraints upon the exploitation of prison labor for competitive advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cProbably the most comprehensive of the provisions was Section 34, Article II, which <em>manifested the broad purpose of proclaiming and securing to the General Assembly the power to enact legislation establishing employee rights and protections.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 57, 26 OBR 42, 496 N.E.2d 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>{\u00b6 49} In <em>Rocky River, </em>43 Ohio St.3d 1, 539 N.E.2d 103, the court upheld the constitutionality of R.C. 4117.14(1), a provision in the Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Act mandating binding arbitration between a city and its safety force. The Supreme Court of Ohio held that Chapter 4117, and in particular R.C. 4117.14(1), is constitutional, as it falls within the General Assembly\u2019s authority to enact \u201cemployee welfare legislation\u201d pursuant to Section 34, Article II, and therefore the home-rale provision may not be interposed to impair, limit, or negate the Act. Id. at 20, 539 N.E.2d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 50} In that case, appellant Rocky River cited the debates taking place in the 1912 constitutional convention surrounding the enactment of Section 34, Article II to support its argument that the constitutional provision had been intended to apply only to matters involving the minimum wage and similar matters. The Supreme Court of Ohio disagreed with this narrow interpretation of Section 34, explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cSection 34, as it was ultimately adopted, transcends the limitations urged by appellant. If the framers of our Constitution had intended this section to apply only to minimum wage, almost half of the forty-one words contained in this section must be regarded as mere surplusage, since it further provides that laws may be passed \u2018fixing and regulating the hours of labor * * * and providing for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees * * *.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 15-16, 539 N.E.2d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 52} The court in <em>Rocky River </em>determined that Section 34, Article II \u201cconstitutes a broad grant of authority to the legislature to provide for the welfare of all working persons, including local safety forces. The provision expressly states in \u2018clear, certain and unambiguous language\u2019 that no other provision of the Constitution may impair the legislature\u2019s power under Section 34. This prohibition, of course, includes the \u2018home rule\u2019 provision contained in Section 3, Article XVIII.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 13, 539 N.E.2d 103. See also <em>Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors v. Cent. State Univ. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 55, 61, 717 N.E.2d 286 (\u201c[t]his court has repeatedly interpreted Section 34, Article II as a broad grant of authority to the General Assembly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 53} <em>Kettering </em>and <em>Rocky River </em>both concerned statutes regulating public employees\u2019 collective-bargaining rights, which the court determined to be constitutional pursuant to the broad power granted to the General Assembly by Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution to enact \u201cemployee welfare legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 54} Given this line of case law, we believe matters that fall within public employees\u2019 collective-bargaining rights, such as wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment are matters proper for legislation for the purpose of \u201cproviding for the general welfare of all employees\u201d pursuant to Section 34, Article II.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>{\u00b6 55} Warren argues that the \u201cemployee welfare legislation\u201d authorized by Section 34, Article II can relate only to matters affecting employees\u2019 \u201cworking environment conditions.\u201d The city argues that the ordinance addresses merely \u201cqualifications for appointment\u201d and \u201cwhere employees reside while not working.\u201d This narrow interpretation of the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d clause in Section 34 is contrary to the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s mandate in <em>Rocky River, Kettering, </em>and <em>Am. Assn, of Univ. Professors </em>to broadly construe Section 34 as authorizing the General Assembly to regulate employment matters to provide for the general welfare of employees, in particular those subject to collective bargaining. It is difficult to conceive of a matter more vital to the general welfare of an employee than a freedom to choose the community or neighborhood in which to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 56} In order to qualify for public-sector employment, the worker must either live in or move into the city. Should the need arise to move outside of the city limits to care for an ailing parent in another city, the worker is forced to choose between his family and his job. This Hobson\u2019s Choice offered by the city illustrates the incredulities of the city\u2019s argument and harkens back to the day of the company town.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 57} Our view that an employee\u2019s residency is a matter relating to terms and conditions of employment subject to collective bargaining is shared by other appellate districts that have had the occasion to consider this question. In <em>St. Bernard v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 3, 598 N.E.2d 15, the First Appellate District was confronted with the issue of whether a residency requirement for public employees was \u201cterms or conditions of employment\u201d subject to mandatory collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 58} In answering the question in the affirmative, the First Appellate District provided the following well-reasoned analysis, citing Ohio\u2019s collective-bargaining statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cMandatory subjects of collective bargaining are deemed to be matters of immediate concern that vitally affect the terms and conditions of employment of the bargaining-unit employees. <em>Allied Chem. &amp; Alkali Workers of Am. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 157, 179-180 [92 S.Ct. 383, 30 L.Ed.2d 341]. R.C. 4117.08(A) provides that the following are subjects of mandatory bargaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c \u2018All matters pertaining to wages, hours, or terms and other conditions of employment and the continuation, modification, or deletion of an existing provision of a collective bargaining agreement are subject to collective bargaining between the public employer and the exclusive representative, except as otherwise specified.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>{\u00b6 61} \u201cAs further required by R.C. 4117.08(C), public employers must also bargain in areas that are subjects of management rights and direction of the governmental unit if they \u2018affect wages, hours, terms and conditions of employment * * *.\u2019 <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Rel. Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 262 [533 N.E.2d 264]. Therefore, a public employer\u2019s decision to exercise a management right which affects the terms and conditions of the unit\u2019s employment becomes a mandatory subject for bargaining. <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. </em>[at 262, 533 N.E.2d 264].\u201d <em>St. Bernard, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 5-6, 598 N.E.2d 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 62} The court in <em>St. Bernard </em>went on to note that \u201c[h]ad [the General Assembly] intended to exclude residency requirements as a subject of collective bargaining, the legislature would have specifically included residency in R.C. 4117.08(B) or (C). * * * [T]he value of bargaining the residency issue is like any of the other \u2018terms and conditions of employment,\u2019 within the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. </em>[at 269, 533 N.E.2d 264].\u201d <em>St. Bernard, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 6-7, 598 N.E.2d 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 63} This view is also adopted by the Sixth Appellate District, in <em>Santiago v. Toledo </em>(Feb. 13, 1998), 6th Dist. No. L-97-1219, 1998 WL 78788 (\u201cR.C. 4117.08(A) mandates that matters related to \u2018wages, hours, or terms and other conditions of employment\u2019 are subject to collective bargaining. Residency requirements are a \u2018condition of employment\u2019 and are, therefore, subject to collective bargaining\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 64} We agree with these appellate districts and likewise view an employee\u2019s residency as a matter within the \u201cterms or conditions of employment\u201d subject to collective bargaining. Residency requirements such as Section 155.05 of the Warren Codified Ordinances undercut public employees\u2019 right to collectively bargain all of the terms and conditions of their employment, and therefore, the General Assembly\u2019s prohibition of municipalities\u2019 impairing of the employees\u2019 rights to bargain is a proper exercise of its authority derived from Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 65} Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that R.C. 9.481 was constitutionally enacted. In accordance with the Supremacy Clause in Section 34, therefore, R.C. 9.481 prevails over Section 155.05 of the Warren Codified Ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 66} Warren\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 67} <em>The Home Rule Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">{\u00b6 68} In Warren\u2019s second assignment of error, it asserts that Section 155.05 is an exercise of its home-rule power pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution, and therefore it supersedes R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">{\u00b6 69} Because of the supremacy clause in Section 34, our determination that R.C. 9.481 is constitutionally enacted pursuant to that section renders unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sary a \u201chome-rule analysis\u201d traditionally undertaken by the courts to resolve a potential conflict between a statute and a municipal ordinance enacted pursuant to its home-rule power. However, we \"will address Warren\u2019s second assignment of error and examine R.C. 9.481 under the \u201chome-rule analysis\u201d as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 70} Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution, provides that municipalities \u201cshall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d Under a \u201chome-rule analysis,\u201d the threshold question is \u201c \u2018whether the matter in question involves an exercise of local selfgovernment or an exercise of local police power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn. v. Cleveland, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 71} If a local ordinance is purported to be an exercise of a municipality\u2019s police power, the ordinance is subject to the \u201cgeneral law\u201d test, adopted by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Canton v. Ohio, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cA state statute takes precedence over a local ordinance when (1) the ordinance is in conflict with the statute, (2) the ordinance is an exercise of the police power, rather than of local self-government, and (3) the statute is a general law.\u201d Id. at 151, 766 N.E.2d 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 73} If, on the other hand, an ordinance is purported to be an exercise of the power of local self-government, the Supreme Court of Ohio has applied the \u201cstatewide concern doctrine\u201d when the exercise of that power conflicts with a state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 74} In this case, Warren asserts that it enacted Section 155.05 pursuant to its power of local self-government; therefore, we review the ordinance under the statewide concern doctrine, rather than applying the \u201cgeneral law\u201d test adopted in Canton.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">{\u00b6 75} The court explained the doctrine of statewide concern as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c[T]he cities\u2019 power of local self-government are not completely unfettered. This court has previously acknowledged that, in matters of statewide concern, municipal powers of local self-government may be subordinate to the exercise of the state\u2019s police powers.\u201d <em>Kettering, </em>26 Ohio St.3d at 53, 26 OBR 42, 496 N.E.2d 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">{\u00b6 77} The court in <em>Kettering </em>reiterated its holding in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Painesville </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 125, 129, 44 O.O.2d 121, 239 N.E.2d 75 that \u201c[t]he power granted under Section 3 of Article XVIII relates to local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>matters and even in the regulation of such local matters a municipality may not infringe on matters of general and statewide concern.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b678} See also <em>Reading v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 193, 2006-Ohio-2181, 846 N.E.2d 840, \u00b6 32-33 (this court has never held that powers of local self-government under Section 3 are unlimited; it is a fundamental principle of Ohio law that, pursuant to the \u201cstatewide concern\u201d doctrine, a municipality may not, in the regulation of local matters, infringe on matters of general and statewide concern). <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, at \u00b6 27 and 29 (where matters of statewide concern are at issue, the state retains the power \u2014 despite the Home Rule Amendment \u2014 to address those matters; the courts must decide as a preliminary matter whether a particular issue is not a matter of merely local concern, but is of statewide concern, and therefore not included within the power of local self-government).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 79} The test to distinguish matters of local self-government from matters of statewide concern was first set forth in <em>Beachwood v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 369, 5 O.O.2d 6, 148 N.E.2d 921:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cTo determine whether legislation is such as falls within the area of local self-government, the result of such legislation or the result of the proceedings thereunder must be considered. If the result affects only the municipality itself, with no extraterritorial effects, the subject is clearly within the power of local self-government and is a matter for the determination of the municipality. However, if the result is not so confined it becomes a matter for the General Assembly.\u201d Id. at 371, 5 O.O.2d 6, 148 N.E.2d 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cThus, even if there is a matter of local concern involved, if the regulation of the subject matter affects the general public of the state as a whole more than it does the local inhabitants the matter passes from what was a matter for local government to a matter of general state interest.\u201d <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>15 Ohio St.2d at 129, 44 O.O.2d 121, 239 N.E.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 82} As the court observed in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>\u201c[d]ue to our changing society, many things which were once considered a matter of purely local concern and subject strictly to local regulation, if any, have now become a matter of statewide concern, creating the necessity for statewide control.\u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. McElroy v. Akron </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 189, 192, 19 O.O.2d 3, 181 N.E.2d 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 83} Here, we are aided by case law in which the court applied the statewide-concern doctrine to permit state laws regulating matters relating to terms and conditions of public-sector employment. For example, in <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Moore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d, 88, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311, the Supreme Court of Ohio applied this doctrine to hold that the prevailing-wage law supersed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ed local wage regulation. In <em>State ex rel. Villari v. Bedford Hts. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 222, 11 OBR 537, 465 N.E.2d 64, overruled on other grounds, the court similarly upheld a state law governing the calculation of employee benefits. In <em>State ex rel. Adkins v. Sobb </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 46, 26 OBR 39, 496 N.E.2d 994, the court validated a state law calculating vacation-leave credits. This line of cases establishes that matters relating to terms and conditions of public-sector labor relations are matters of statewide concern appropriate for statewide control by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 84} The residency requirement likewise relates to terms and conditions of employment and therefore is a matter more appropriate for uniform statewide legislation rather than patchwork regulations by hundreds of municipalities. As to potential extraterritorial effects, a residency requirement such as Warren\u2019s affects not only the municipality itself, but clearly has impact beyond its borders. The requirement impairs competition among the municipalities for residents; it affects the tax revenue, housing market, and school systems of all surrounding communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 85} Therefore, in our view, a residency requirement is not purely local in nature; it goes beyond the administration of internal local affairs of a municipality. It is therefore more appropriate for statewide control by the legislature pursuant to the doctrine of statewide concern. Accordingly, Section 155.05 must yield to R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 86} Warren\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 87} In its third and fourth assignments of error, Warren contends that R.C. 9.481 violates the Uniformity Clause and the Contract Clause of the Ohio Constitution, respectively. Because of the supremacy clause in Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution and our determination that R.C. 9.481 is a proper exercise of the Legislature\u2019s Section 34 power, these assignments of error are moot. However, we undertake the following analysis to express our view that R.C. 9.481 offends neither constitutional clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 88} <em>The Uniformity Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 89} In its third assignment of error, Warren claims that R.C. 9.481 violates the Uniformity Clause in Sec. 26, Article II, Ohio Constitution. That provision states: \u201cAll laws, of a general nature, shall have a uniform operation throughout the state * * The constitutionality of such legislation is determined through a two-part analysis: (1) whether the statute is a law of a general or special nature and (2) whether the statute operates uniformly throughout the state. (Citations omitted.) <em>Desenco, Inc. v. Akron </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 535, 541, 706 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>{\u00b6 90} A statute\u2019s subject matter is \u201cgeneral\u201d in compliance with the Uniformity Clause \u201cif the subject does or may exist in, and affect the people of, every county, in the state.\u201d <em>Desenco </em>at 542, 706 N.E.2d 323, quoting <em>Hixson v. Burson </em>(1896), 54 Ohio St. 470, 481, 43 N.E. 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 91} Here, Warren does not challenge the general nature of R.C. 9.481, but argues only that it lacks uniform operation, on the ground that it is applicable only to full-time employees but not to other categories of employees such as part-time employees or volunteers. Warren argues that this distinction is arbitrary and illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 92} The court in <em>State ex rel. Stanton v. Powell </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 383, 142 N.E. 401, set forth the test for the uniform operation of a statute as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cSection 26, Art. II of the Constitution, was not intended to render invalid every law which does not operate upon all persons, property or political subdivisions within the state. It is sufficient if a law operates upon every person included within its operative provisions, provided such operative provisions are not arbitrarily and unnecessarily restricted. And the law is equally valid if it contains provisions which permit it to operate upon every locality where certain specified conditions prevail. A law operates as an unreasonable classification where it seeks to create artificial distinctions where no real distinction exists.\u201d Id. at 385, 142 N.E. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 94} In <em>Beachwood, </em>the court further explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cThis court has held many times that, to comply with this section, legislation need not affect every person in the state but that a reasonable classification may be made, and it is sufficient if the legislation operates equally upon every person and locality within such classification.\u201d Id. at 372, 148 N.E.2d 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">{\u00b6 96} In this connection, R.C. 9.481 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">{\u00b6 97} \u201c(A) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">{\u00b6 98} \u201c * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">{\u00b6 99} \u201c(2) \u2018Volunteer\u2019 means a person who is not paid for service or who is employed on less than a permanent full-time basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">{\u00b6 100} \u201c(B)(1) Except as otherwise provided in division (B)(2) of this section, no political subdivision shall require any of its employees, as a condition of employment, to reside in any specific area of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">{\u00b6 101} Thus, \u201cevery person included within [the] operative provisions\u201d for the purpose of Uniformity Clause is all employees of political subdivision in the state employed on less than a permanent full-time basis. The issue is therefore whether the provision is \u201carbitrarily and unnecessarily restricted\u201d or whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>reasonable classification was made by applying only to permanent full-time employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">{\u00b6 102} It is axiomatic that full-time permanent employees enjoy more rights, privileges, and protections in law than part-time or temporary employees. Therefore, in our view, the legislature\u2019s protection of public employees\u2019 right to reside wherever they wish is reasonably extended only to full-time permanent public employees. The distinction between full-time permanent employees and less than full-time permanent employees is not arbitrary or unnecessarily restricted in the instant employee welfare legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 103} Warren\u2019s third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 104} <em>The Contract Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 105} In its fourth assignment of error, Warren asserts that R.C. 9.481 violates Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. That constitutional provision states:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cThe general assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws, or laws impairing the obligation of contracts * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 107} In particular, Warren asserts that the General Assembly cannot pass a law that would limit the city of Warren\u2019s right to contract with its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">{\u00b6 108} Section 28, Article II, of the Ohio Constitution prohibits laws impairing <em>existing </em>contractual obligations. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Youngstown v. Jones </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 130, 136, 16 O.O. 73, 24 N.E.2d 442 (the General Assembly had power to enact an amended section and repeal the prior law, but in doing so could not interfere with vested rights or impair the obligations of existing contracts in violation of Section 28, Article II of the state constitution); <em>Goodale v. Fennell </em>(1875), 27 Ohio St. 426, 432, 1875 WL 189 (when the contract is once made, the law then in force defines the duties and rights of the parties under it. Any change that impairs the rights of either party, or amounts to a denial or obstruction of the rights accruing by a contract, is obnoxious to [Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution]). Warren is misguided in relying on this constitutional provision as it asserts that the General Assembly cannot pass a law limiting the city\u2019s right enter into a contract with its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">{\u00b6 109} Furthermore, \u201c[th]e provision[ ] against impairment of contracts * * * must bow to valid police power legislation designed to protect public health, safety and welfare as long as the exercise of that police power \u2018bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public and if it is not unreasonable or arbitrary.\u2019 Moreover, * * * the courts * * * will not invalidate that legislation unless the legislating body\u2019s initial determination that the law bears a real and substantial relationship to public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>health, safety and welfare appears to be clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Power Siting Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 212, 218, 10 O.O.3d 371, 383 N.E.2d 588. See also <em>Middletown v. Ferguson </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 71, 77, 25 OBR 125, 495 N.E.2d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">{\u00b6 110} Here, the General Assembly declared in the uncodified section of Senate Bill 82 that \u201cit is a matter of statewide concern to generally allow the employees of Ohio\u2019s political subdivisions to choose where to live, and that it is necessary to generally prohibit political subdivisions from requiring their employees, as a condition of employment, to reside in any specific area of the state in order to provide for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of those public employees.\u201d This declaration evinces the legislating body\u2019s initial determination that the law bears a real and substantial relationship to public health, safety, and welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 111} A residency requirement places an onerous burden on the lives of public employees and their families, as it severely limits their choice of housing, schools, medical services, or places of worship, undoubtedly affecting their \u201chealth, safety, morals or general welfare.\u201d We cannot say that the legislature\u2019s affording the state\u2019s public employees the ability to choose where to live is unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 112} Therefore, we do not find the legislature\u2019s determination that R.C. 9.481 bears a real and substantial relationship to public health, safety, and welfare to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 113} Moreover, as we discussed in our earlier analysis, a residency requirement is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining. The residency ordinance undercuts the right to collectively bargain all of the terms and conditions of public-sector employment and thus actually impairs the right to contract by imposing a condition of employment rather than allowing the parties to negotiate the condition as part of the collective-bargaining agreement. Simply put, R.C. 9.481 does not impair contractual rights; it ensures a level playing field when public-sector employees negotiate a collective-bargaining agreement with a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">{\u00b6 114} Warren\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">{\u00b6 115} As Justice Blackmun wrote in his dissent in <em>United Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council of Camden Cty. &amp; Vicinity v.

Neither the state legislature nor any political subdivision may pass legislation that is contrary to the Ohio Constitution. Section 34, Article II contains a specific provision authorizing laws that regulate the hours of labor and establish a minimum wage. In addition, Section 34, Article II contains a more general provision, which authorizes the passing of laws that provide \u201cfor the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees.\u201d The last clause of Section 34, Article II, which is critical in the instant case, states, \u201cno other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 118} Appellants contend that R.C. 9.481, which became effective on May 1, 2006, is a statute that is specifically authorized by Section 34, Article II, and cannot be limited or impaired by any other section of the Ohio Constitution. Warren\u2019s residency requirement, Section 155.05 of Warren\u2019s Codified Ordinances, passed by the Council of the City of Warren on May 29,1991, is clearly in conflict with R.C. 9.481. Warren believes that Section 155.05 is a valid exercise under, and permitted by, Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution \u2014 \u201cthe Home Rule Amendment.\u201d Essentially, Warren argues that the restrictions contained in R.C. 9.481 exceed the scope of Section 34, Article II, because they do not provide for the \u201ccomfort, health, safety and general welfare\u201d of employees while they are physically present for work; therefore, the prohibition on any other constitutional limitation does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">{\u00b6 119} In interpreting the Ohio constitutional provision applicable to this issue, certain rules of construction apply. \u201c \u2018The first step in determining the meaning of a constitutional provision is to look at the language of the provision itself. * * * Words used in the Constitution that are not defined therein must be taken in their usual, normal, or customary meaning.\u2019 * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State ex rel. King v. Summit Cty. Council, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 172, 2003-Ohio-3050, 789 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>N.E.2d 1108, at \u00b6 35. \u201cIf the meaning of a provision cannot be ascertained by its plain language, a court may look to the purpose of the [constitutional] provision to determine its meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 380, 2004-Ohio-3206, 811 N.E.2d 68, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">{\u00b6 120} Warren, together with the Third, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Appellate Districts, has suggested that this constitutional provision should be read to limit the phrase \u201ccomfort, health, safety, and general welfare\u201d to only those circumstances in which the employee is physically present for work. See <em>Lima v. State, </em>177 Ohio App.3d 744, 2007-Ohio-6419, 896 N.E.2d 149; <em>Toledo v. State, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1261, 2008-Ohio-1957, 2008 WL 1837256; <em>Cleveland v. State, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 89486 and 89565, 2008-Ohio-2655, 2008 WL 2252542; <em>State v. Akron, </em>9th Dist. No. 23660, 2008-Ohio-38, 2008 WL 81506. However, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Ohio, \u201c[t]he language of Section 34 is so clear and unequivocal that resort to secondary sources, such as the constitutional debates, is actually unnecessary.\u201d <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 15, 539 N.E.2d 103. The plain language of Section 34, Article II clearly grants the General Assembly broad authority to legislate for the \u201ccomfort, health, safety, and <em>general welfare of all employees.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) If this section were intended to apply only to the period of time when one is physically present at work, it could have been simply stated as such by providing for the \u201ccomfort, health, safety, and general welfare of all employees <em>during working hours.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 121} I agree with the writing judge that the Supreme Court of Ohio has interpreted this constitutional provision as encompassing more than just the time period when one is at work. See generally <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 539 N.E.2d 103. We are bound to follow the precedent as set forth by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Rocky River, </em>which determined that Section 34, Article II \u201cconstitutes a broad grant of authority to the legislature to provide for the welfare of all working persons, including local safety forces. * * * The provision expressly states in \u2018clear, certain and unambiguous language\u2019 that <em>no other provision </em>of the Constitution may impair the legislature\u2019s power under Section 34. * * * This prohibition, of course, includes the \u2018home rule\u2019 provision contained in Section 3, Article XVIII. * * *.\u201d (Citations omitted and emphasis sic.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 122} In the area of labor law, where a collective-bargaining agreement is in place, any change in terms and conditions of employment must be bargained. Warren argues that Section 155.05 is a \u201cqualification\u201d for employment and, thus, is outside the scope of Section 34, Article II. However, Section 155.05 is clearly a term and condition of employment; an employee\u2019s residence within the city is required to be eligible for continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>{\u00b6 123} Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the ordinance in question is the lack of any exception to the residency requirements for particular circumstances. Living within the city limits affects all facets of an employee\u2019s life, including where the employee\u2019s children attend school, what local government services he will be able to obtain, what type of safety forces he will have, and where his spouse must live, regardless of how far away the spouse may work. If an employee wanted to live in a rural setting with acreage, the residency requirement would limit that ability. Likewise, a residency requirement also affects an employee when a change of circumstances occurs, such as a transfer of a spouse to a location where it is impractical to continue to work in the area or when a child\u2019s special needs cannot be accommodated by the educational services available within the city. Clearly, this ordinance has an influence on an employee not just while he or she is \u201con the clock.\u201d The ordinance has the clear effect of impacting the \u201ccomfort, health, safety, and general welfare of all employees.\u201d It certainly requires much less interpretation to find that these considerations are within the purview of Section 34, Article II, rather than to suggest that it applies only while the employee is physically \u201cat work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 124} Based on the foregoing, I would concur that R.C. 9.481 is a valid legislative enactment contemplated by Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, because it clearly affects the \u201ccomfort, health, safety, and general welfare of all employees.\u201d This is supported by our rules of construction and the precedent of <em>Rocky River, </em>43 Ohio St.3d 1, 539 N.E.2d 103.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b587-6\">Cynthia Wescott Rice, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUj\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 125} While I agree with the writing judge\u2019s resolution of the case, I do not believe R.C. 9.481 necessarily conflicts with home-rule ordinances that make residency a precondition of employment. Rather, such a pre-employment criterion affects the interests of <em>prospective </em>employees. In order to clarify my position, I write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 126} While Section 155.05 of the Warren Codified Ordinances affects all employees hired subsequent to its enactment, it has a built-in \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d for those employees who did not reside in the city prior to its enactment. However, until prospective employees become actual employees, they will be unaffected by the ordinance. By becoming employees, individuals will have voluntarily agreed to the pre-employment condition of their specific job. Individuals have the freedom to choose where to live. Likewise, in making an employment decision, they may waive this option in order to obtain employment with a municipality that has a residency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">{\u00b6 127} The unions assert that R.C. 9.481 represents a proper exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s authority under Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tion. They further argue that Section 155.05 directly conflicts with the statute and is rendered invalid by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Ohio Constitution. I agree that R.C. 9.481 is a valid legislative enactment. Moreover, I agree with the unions\u2019 argument as it pertains to the ordinance at issue. However, I believe that the unions\u2019 position is persuasive only to the extent that the ordinance fails to provide an exception to the residency requirement for unpredictable changes in circumstances, emergencies, and hardships that might require the employee to move from the city yet nevertheless keep his or her job, e.g., an ailing parent or a spouse\u2019s change in employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 128} Because Section 155.05 does not have such an exception or create a process by which an employee could be exempted from the residency requirement, it makes residency in Warren a fundamental condition of actual employment. In this regard, R.C. 9.481 is valid and must necessarily supersede Section 155.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 129} However, I do not think that home-rule ordinances that incorporate residency requirements will always conflict with R.C. 9.481. For instance, where a political subdivision enacts an ordinance that makes residency a precondition of employment, such a condition affects only potential employees. Potential employees are nonemployees, nonunion members, and, by implication, have no cognizable collective-bargaining rights. R.C. 9.481 has no application to potential employees or scenarios in which actual employees are unaffected. Thus, home-rule ordinances that impact the welfare of nonemployees are in no conflict -with the mandates of R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 130} If Section 155.05 were rewritten to include an exception, it is unclear how the Unions can assert that the ordinance runs afoul of R.C. 9.481 when the only individuals it would actually affect are nonemployees who find the provision unnecessarily burdensome. Because nonemployees will suffer no concrete injury by operation of Section 155.05, they have no personal stake in the controversy. For a party to have standing, he, she, or it must have a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy, a concrete injury that will be resolved by the court, not a mere hypothetical or conjectural matter. See <em>Bourke v. Carnahan, </em>163 Ohio App.3d 818, 2005-Ohio-5422, 840 N.E.2d 1101, at \u00b6 10; see also <em>Middletown v. Ferguson </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 71, 75, 25 OBR 125, 495 N.E.2d 380. In this regard, the unions have no standing to assert their argument insofar as it is directed at the burdens the ordinance places upon those who have yet to accept employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 131} With this in mind, if the exception discussed above were built into Section 155.05,1 do not think it would stand in conflict with R.C. 9.481. I believe Section 155.05 incorporates a valid pre-employment condition that prospective employees must agree to before being hired. By entering into this pre-employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ment condition, they waive their right to collectively-bargain the issue. However, because the ordinance does not provide a limited exception for emergencies that might require an employee to suddenly or even temporarily change residences, it also requires its new hires to reside in Warren irrespective of the potential changes in their personal circumstances. Hence, as it is written, I agree that the ordinance conflicts with R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 132} To summarize, it is foreseeable that nonelected public employees who have accepted the pre-employment residency condition may encounter changes in their lives necessitating a relocation of their residence. However, the inability to relocate outside the municipality could have a negative impact'on these employees and affect their general welfare. With no exception to accommodate for these changes, I believe Section 155.05 requires employees, as a condition of their employment, to reside in Warren. This is an employment condition that, due to its inflexibility, directly violates R.C. 9.481. I consequently concur with the conclusion that the ordinance must yield to R.C. 9.481, a law deriving its validity from the proper exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s authority under Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
