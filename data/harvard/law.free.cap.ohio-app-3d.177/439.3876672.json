Craigmyle alleged that he sold Dailey a used John Deere tractor and later, after the express warranty expired, he paid to repair it, but Dailey then refused to reimburse him. He contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment on his counterclaim, which apparently was based on the theory of detrimental reliance. Specifically, he contends that because the undisputed facts show that he paid to repair the tractor after the warranty expired and Dailey then refused to reimburse him, he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Because Craigmyle failed to meet his initial burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Dailey agreed to pay for half of the repairs, he was not entitled to summary judgment on his counterclaim. Accordingly, we overrule his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 2} Craigmyle also contends that the trial court erred in failing to address the issue of damages. Because the trial court found in Dailey\u2019s favor on his counterclaim, Craigmyle was not entitled to an award of damages. Therefore, his second assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">I. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">{\u00b6 3} The parties do not dispute the underlying facts. In December 2004, Monty Craigmyle sold Larry Dailey a used John Deere tractor for $27,500 and gave him a verbal warranty: \u201cgood for 30 days after the purchase to pay for 50 percent of parts and labor if the work was done in his shop.\u201d After the tractor was delivered a few days later, Dailey initially put very little time on it; he pulled it in and out of the barn to make way for a load of hay and drove it to a tire shop for some tire maintenance, for a total running time of about three to four hours. In April 2005, Dailey first put the tractor under a load when he began plowing. Within an hour, the transmission warning light and buzzer started coming on intermittently. He continued to plow, but later stopped and called a local John Deere dealer, Five Points Implement Co., Inc. (\u201cFive Points\u201d) to discuss the tractor\u2019s condition. Over the next three days, he plowed and disked with the tractor for a total of approximately 12 hours, and he continued to communicate with Five Points about the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Dailey then called Craigmyle and told him of the tractor\u2019s problems. Dailey acknowledged that the 30-day warranty period was up, but indicated that he felt the \u201ctrouble was with the tractor when I purchased it.\u201d Craigmyle denied that anything was wrong with the tractor when he sold it. He offered suggestions about possible causes, and they had a few subsequent telephone conversations. In the meantime, Dailey had representatives from Five Points come to his farm to look at it. They did some work on the tractor, including removing and rebuilding the \u201cvalve body,\u201d but determined there was a serious leak in the transmission and did not repair it. Dailey paid $1,841.28 for their work. Dailey then called Craigmyle again and told him of the tractor\u2019s transmission problem. During their conversation, Craigmyle indicated that he would \u201chelp\u201d him out. However, there was no discussion concerning where the tractor would be repaired or who was going to pay for it. Neither party made any statements to the other that he would pay for half of the repair costs. However, according to Dailey, he believed that Craigmyle would \u201ctake care of it\u201d because the tractor had problems with it when he bought it. Craigmyle, however, apparently intended Dailey to pay for half the repairs. Nevertheless, there was no express agreement at that time concerning the repairs and no express understanding about whether the expired warranty would be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">{\u00b6 5} Craigmyle sent his truck to pick up the tractor from Dailey\u2019s farm and took it to Foust Equipment in Hagerstown, Indiana for repair. When the driver returned to Dailey\u2019s farm to deliver the repaired tractor, he requested Dailey to pay half of the repair cost from Foust Equipment. According to Craigmyle, he did not feel he had any responsibility to Dailey at that time, but he did not intend for Dailey to pay the entire bill because he wanted to \u201cmake a customer happy.\u201d Initially, Dailey stated that he wanted to test out the tractor, and then after the tractor was unloaded, he asked, \u201cWell, how about if I just pay him in two weeks?\u201d After the driver stated, \u201c[T]hat won\u2019t be okay,\u201d Dailey refused to pay anything. Craigmyle ultimately paid Foust Equipment the full amount of $3,762.14 for the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 6} In June 2005, Dailey filed a complaint against Craigmyle, Craigmyle &amp; Son Farms, L.L.C., and its agent, Rita Craigmyle, alleging that he had detrimentally relied on misrepresentations that Craigmyle had made about the quality and condition of the tractor. Dailey\u2019s complaint sought damages in the amount of $1,841.28, the amount he paid Five Points, plus costs and attorney fees. Craigmyle ultimately filed an answer and a counterclaim, which alleged that Craigmyle incurred $400 in transportation costs and $3,762.14 in repair costs for the tractor after the 30-day warranty had expired. He sought judgment in the amount of $4,162.14, plus costs. The trial court denied Craigmyle\u2019s motion to challenge venue, granted the motion to dismiss Craigmyle &amp; Son Farms, L.L.C., and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>agent, but concluded that the allegations against Craigmyle \u201cshall be taken under consideration by the court pending further development of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 7} After some procedural wrangling, the parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment. Each party sought judgment on their own cause of action and on their opponents. Craigmyle sought summary judgment in his favor on his counterclaim and on Dailey\u2019s complaint. In the alternative, he requested that the trial court either grant summary judgment on all liability issues, leaving the issue of the amount of damages to be determined or rule on his motion to dismiss previously taken under advisement. Dailey opposed Craigmyle\u2019s motion and requested summary judgment in his favor on his complaint and on Craigmyle\u2019s counterclaim. However, Craigmyle did not file a response to Dailey\u2019s motion. In a judgment entry dated October 23, 2007, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">This matter came before the Court on Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiffs response to the Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">The Court finds in favor of Defendant on Plaintiffs Motion of Summary Judgment on the issue of Plaintiffs Complaint for monies expended to repair the tractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">The Court finds on behalf of Plaintiff, on Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on Defendant\u2019s Counterclaim for repairs made by Defendant on Plaintiffs tractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">The costs of this action shall be taxed to the deposit. Any additional Court costs shall be split equally between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">{\u00b6 8} While the wording of the entry is somewhat confusing, given the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment on the complaint and the counterclaim, we conclude that the trial court essentially granted Craigmyle\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Dailey\u2019s complaint and granted Dailey\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Craigmyle\u2019s counterclaim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment entry did not specify the grounds for the trial court\u2019s judgment. Craigmyle now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">{\u00b6 9} Craigmyle raises the following assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">I. The trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on appellant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>II. The trial court erred by not addressing damages in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 10} In reviewing a summary judgment, the lower court and the appellate court utilize the same standard; we review the judgment independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243, 1245. Summary judgment is appropriate only when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, and (3) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. See also <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 146, 524 N.E.2d 881, and Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 11} The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 120, 570 N.E.2d 1108; <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 526 N.E.2d 798. The moving party must inform the trial court of the basis of the motion and must identify those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a material fact. <em>Dresher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. To meet its burden, the moving party must specifically refer to the \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, * * * written stipulations of fact, if any,\u201d that affirmatively demonstrate that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. Civ.R. 56(C); Id. If the moving party satisfies its initial burden, the nonmoving party then has the reciprocal burden outlined in Civ. R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the nonmovant does not satisfy this evidentiary burden and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the court should enter a summary judgment accordingly. <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 145, 677 N.E.2d 308, citing <em>Dresher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 295, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">IV. The Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">{\u00b6 12} In his first assignment of error, Craigmyle contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment on his counterclaim, which apparently is based upon the theory of detrimental reliance. He contends that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the undisputed facts show that Dailey contacted him after the warranty had expired to do repairs to the tractor, that he paid for the repairs, and that Dailey then refused to reimburse him. Dailey contends that the trial court properly denied Craigmyle judgment on the counterclaim because the evidence shows that Craigmyle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>breached an implied warranty of merchantability and then exercised his right to repair the tractor as Dailey demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">[2,3] {\u00b6 13} Craigmyle, as the moving party, had the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We have reviewed Craigmyle\u2019s counterclaim and his motion and find that he failed to carry that burden below. His counterclaim does not specifically identify the specific legal theory or basis on which he sought relief. His motion for summary judgment asserts, \u201cDefendant is the one entitled to relief for reasonable detrimental reliance in this case. Defendant\u2019s actions in transporting and repairing Plaintiffs tractor are reasonable business practices justified upon reliance that Plaintiff would at least abide by the original express warranty. Here, Plaintiff did not abide by his own bargain.\u201d Thus, it appears that the theory of recovery was promissory estoppel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 14} Promissory estoppel is a quasicontractual or equitable doctrine. See <em>Worthington v. Speedway SuperAmerica L.L.C., </em>Scioto App. No. 04CA2938, 2004-Ohio-5077, 2004 WL 2260501. The elements of promissory estoppel require \u201c[a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\u201d <em>McCroskey v. State </em>(1983), 8 Ohio St.3d 29, 30, 8 OBR 339, 456 N.E.2d 1204, citing Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d (1973), Section 90. In order to prevail on a claim of promissory estoppel, Craigmyle must show a clear and unambiguous promise and reliance by the party to whom the promise is made. The reliance must be reasonable and foreseeable, and the party relying on the promise must have been injured by the reliance. See <em>Doe v. Adkins </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 427, 437, 674 N.E.2d 731, citing <em>Healey v. Republic Powdered Metals, Inc. </em>(1992), 85 Ohio App.3d 281, 284, 619 N.E.2d 1035. A promise is defined as \u201ca manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.\u201d <em>Stull v. Combustion Engineering, Inc. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 553, 557, 595 N.E.2d 504, citing Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d (1981) 8, Section 2(1). Furthermore, the party who asserts the promissoryestoppel claim bears the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>elements of the claim. <em>In re Estate of Popov, </em>Lawrence App. No. 02CA26, 2003-Ohio-4556, 2003 WL 22017299, at \u00b6 30. Whether Dailey made \u201ca clear and unambiguous promise\u201d is a question of fact. See, e.g., <em>McCroskey, </em>supra; see also <em>Miller v. Lindsay-Green, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-848, 2005-Ohio-6366, 2005 WL 3220215.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">{\u00b6 15} Based on our review of the evidence, we conclude that Craigmyle failed to meet his initial burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Dailey made a clear and unambiguous promise to Craigmyle that he would pay for half of the repairs. In fact, all of the evidence establishes that Dailey never made any promise to Craigmyle regarding the repair costs. Because Craigmyle failed to meet his initial burden on the threshold element of a promise, we need not consider the additional elements needed for promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 16} According to Dailey\u2019s deposition testimony, when Craigmyle indicated that he would he would \u201chelp him out,\u201d he thought Craigmyle was going to \u201ctake care of it.\u201d Dailey made no promise that he would pay for the repairs and specifically made no promise that he would pay half of the repair bill from Foust Equipment. In fact, he did not even know that Craigmyle was going to take the tractor to Indiana for repairs until Craigmyle\u2019s delivery driver came to pick up the tractor. Specifically, Dailey testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Q. Okay. And what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">A. He said at that time, he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll help you out on it.\u201d He said, \u201cHave you got and [sic] way of getting here?\u201d He said, \u201cMy mechanics are a little slow on work right now,\u201d you know, \u201cthey\u2019ve got time that they could take a look at it.\u201d I said, \u201cMonty, I don\u2019t have no way of hauling this thing. This is too heavy for me.\u201d I\u2019ve got a small trailer and, you know, I don\u2019t haul it. And at that time, he told me, he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll come pick it up.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">The next day I think it was, he sent a truck to pick the tractor up. And when they loaded it, the driver told me, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re taking this to Hagerstown, Indiana, to have it worked on.\u201d I said, \u2018Well, I thought Monty said he was going to take it back to his shop.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re taking it to a guy, Mark Foust, In Hagerstown, Indiana, to have it worked on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 17} Furthermore, Craigmyle\u2019s own deposition testimony shows that when he told Dailey that he would \u201chelp him out,\u201d there was no express understanding at that time concerning who was going to make the repairs and no discussion concerning who was going to pay for the repairs. Craigmyle testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Q. Okay. Did you indicate to Mr. Dailey that you would be taking the tractor to Foust Equipment during your conversation with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">A. When he called for the repair work and said there was something wrong with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">A. I don\u2019t know if I ever told him what we were going to do with it. If I ever told him if we was going to take it? And I might have told him we was going to take it to our place and then I might have changed my mind and decided to take it to Foust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">After we come to the conclusion that it had problems, we just decided then. I told him that I would help him out and find someplace to get it fixed. I don\u2019t remember if I told him I would have it done to be honest with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">Q. Did Mr. Dailey make any statements to you that he would pay for half of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">A. No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">Q. Did you make any statements to him that you would pay for half of the bill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">A. No ma\u2019am, not at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">Q. So your conversation essentially involved Mr. Dailey stating there is a huge problem with the transmission. It\u2019s going to cost a lot of money. I feel like you ought to take care of this situation. You said you\u2019d help out. Is that a correct statement of the conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-15\">Q. No discussions were had about where it would go, where the tractor would go for repairs, or who would pay the bill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-16\">A. No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">{\u00b6 18} Craigmyle\u2019s testimony also shows that the first conversation with Dailey concerning his expectation that Dailey would pay half of the Foust Equipment bill was after the repaired tractor was delivered. Craigmyle testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-18\">Q. And when did you have a conversation with Mr. Dailey expecting him to pay half of the Foust bill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-19\">A. When the tractor was delivered, I think is actually the first time we ever had a conversation about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-20\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-21\">Q. What did [the delivery driver] tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-22\">A. That Mr. Dailey \u2014 when we unloaded the tractor, he \u2014 first, when we gave him the bill, he first looked at the bill and then said, \u201cWell,\u201d you know, \u201cI would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>like time to try this tractor out.\u201d And Larry said, \u201cWell, I was instructed to get half the payment when I brought the tractor.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, how about if I just pay him in two weeks?\u201d And Larry said, \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be okay.\u201d And then he said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I should owe anything at all.\u201d He first acted as if he was going to pay the bill. And then later after instructing to pay it then, said he would not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, the evidence fails to show that Dailey made a clear and unambiguous promise to Craigmyle to pay for the repairs and specifically, he made no promise to pay half of the Foust Equipment repair bill. He made no statements prior to the tractor being repaired that could be construed as a manifestation of intention to pay for the repairs, and in fact he did not even know that Craigmyle was taking the truck to Indiana until after they came to pick up the truck. Craigmyle admits that the first conversation about expecting Dailey to pay half of the Foust Equipment bill occurred when they delivered the truck after the repairs. And the only statement by Dailey about paying the bill, i.e., \u201cWell, how about if I just pay him in two weeks,\u201d was made after the tractor was delivered. Because it was made after the tractor had already been repaired, Craigmyle could not have possibly relied upon that statement when he decided to take the tractor to Indiana for repairs. Therefore, we conclude that Craigmyle was not entitled to summary judgment on a promissory estoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b620} While it appears based on Craigmyle\u2019s motion for summary judgment that the theory of recovery was promissory estoppel, given the allegations in his counterclaim, another possible theory of recovery was unjust enrichment. Like promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment is a quasicontractual theory of recovery. <em>Hummel v. Hummel </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 520, 11 O.O. 221, 14 N.E.2d 923, paragraph one of the syllabus. Unjust enrichment occurs \u201c \u2018when a party retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. Smith, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 218, 2003-Ohio-6083, 800 N.E.2d 372, at \u00b6 30, citing <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 109, 111, 532 N.E.2d 124; <em>Dixon v. Smith </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 308, 317, 695 N.E.2d 284. \u201cUnder the doctrine of unjust enrichment (i.e., quantum meruit), a party may recover the reasonable value of services rendered in the absence of an express contract if denying such recovery would unjustly enrich the opposing party.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Popov, </em>Lawrence App. No. 02CA26, 2003-Ohio-4556, 2003 WL 22017299, at \u00b6 26. In order to recover on a claim of unjust enrichment, the party asserting the claim must demonstrate \u201c(1) a benefit conferred by a plaintiff upon a defendant; (2) knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment.\u201d <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 183, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298. Quantum meruit is the measure of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>afforded in an action for quasicontract. <em>Barkan &amp; Robon, Ltd. v. Wise, </em>Lucas App. No. L-05-1259, 2006-Ohio-2918, 2006 WL 1580044, at \u00b6 16, citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1981) 1119; see also <em>Myers v. Good, </em>Ross App. No. 06CA2939, 2007-Ohio-5361, 2007 WL 2897753, at \u00b6 12 (\u2018When a contract fails for a lack of \u2018meeting of the minds,\u2019 equity should be imposed to prevent an unjust enrichment. * * * The proper remedy is quantum meruit, or the value of the benefit conferred on the other party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">{\u00b6 21} Even if we assume that Craigmyle\u2019s counterclaim sets forth a valid claim for unjust enrichment, he has failed to carry his initial burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether he conferred a benefit upon Dailey under circumstances where it would be unjust and inequitable for Dailey to retain the benefit without making payments. Specifically, he failed to show that there was no genuine issue concerning whether under the circumstances it would be unjust and inequitable for Dailey not to reimburse Craigmyle for the costs he incurred in repairing the tractor. Thus, Craigmyle was not entitled to summary judgment on an unjust-enrichment claim. Accordingly, we overrule his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">V. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 22} In his second assignment of error, Craigmyle contends that the trial court erred by not addressing the issue of damages. Again, he contends that it is undisputed that he paid for repairs to the tractor after the warranty had expired and that because the invoice amount was never in question, he is entitled to an award against Dailey for $3,762.14. He refers us to comments made by the trial court during a hearing suggesting that he had a quantum meruit argument: \u201cI realize you\u2019ve got a quantum [meruit] argument, but I\u2019m overruling that also.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 23} It is axiomatic in Ohio that a court speaks only through its judgment entries. <em>State ex rel. Indus. Comm. v. Day </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 477, 17 O.O. 86, 26 N.E.2d 1014, paragraph one of the syllabus. While the trial court referred to a possible quantum meruit argument, it also stated that it was rejecting that claim. More important, however, in its judgment entry dated October 23, 2007, the trial court granted judgment in Dailey\u2019s favor on the counterclaim. Because we hold that the trial court properly found in Dailey\u2019s favor on the counterclaim, Craigmyle was not entitled to an award of damages. Therefore, we overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-9\">McFarland, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ax0N\">Kline, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-14\">. Craigmyle's motion sought \"summary judgment or in the alternative, * * * summary judgment on all liability issues * * His request for relief sought \u201csummary judgment against Plaintiff and in favor of Defendant for $3,762.14.\u201d We construe his motion to seek summary judgment in his favor in Dailey's complaint and also in his favor on his own counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. As a matter of law, Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for \"detrimental reliance.\u201d <em>Carpenter v. Scherer-Mountain Ins. Agency </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 316, 733 N.E.2d 1196, fn. 3, citing <em>Gottfried-Smith v. Gottfried </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 646, 650, 695 N.E.2d 1229. Detrimental reliance arises as an element of various causes of action (e.g., promissory estoppel, misrepresentation) but is not a cause of action unto itself. Id. However, based upon the allegations set forth in Craigmyle's counterclaim and the arguments in his motion, it appears that his claim of \"detrimental reliance\u201d is actually a cause of action for promissory estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Kline, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">{\u00b6 24} I respectfully dissent. I would dismiss this appeal for lack of a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 25} Defendant-appellant Monty Craigmyle moved for summary judgment on his counterclaim only. The court denied his motion. Plaintiff-appellee Larry Dailey moved for summary judgment on both his complaint and Craigmyle\u2019s counterclaim. The court denied his motion relative to the complaint only and did not dispose of the motion as it related to the counterclaim. Hence, in my view, the complaint and the counterclaim remain pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
