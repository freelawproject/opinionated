Roberts appeals from a judgment of the Champaign County Court of Common Pleas, which held that Roberts\u2019s home encroached on the property of Luther and Helen Jacks by two feet, that Roberts acquired title to the land upon which the house was built by adverse possession, and that Roberts had otherwise failed to establish that she owned the property west of the property line by adverse possession. For the following reasons, the order that Roberts remove or alter the improvements to her property to the extent that the improvements encroach upon the Jackses\u2019 property will be vacated, and the matter will be remanded to the trial court to determine whether an encroachment exists and, if so found, to determine its extent and order an appropriate remedy. In all other respects, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">{\u00b6 2} Luther and Helen Jacks own real property, commonly known as 6483 Crowl Road, in the village of Springhills in Champaign County. They have resided on the property since 1958. Judy Brewington is the Jackses\u2019 neighbor to the west, residing at 6493 Crowl Road. Brewington purchased the property in 1987. Since 1995, Leona Roberts has been the Jackses\u2019 neighbor to the east, residing at 6473 Crowl Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">{\u00b6 3} After Roberts constructed a wooden deck, wooden walkway, and \u201cfence deck\u201d on the back of her house, the Jackses had a survey of the properties conducted by Wallace Lynn Geuy, a professional surveyor. The survey indicated that the property lines were east of what the parties had previously believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">{\u00b6 4} Following the survey, the Jackses filed this action against Roberts, claiming that the deck extended <em>&amp;k </em>feet onto their land and the fence extended three feet onto their land. The Jackses also alleged that Roberts\u2019s home encroached on their property by two feet. Roberts answered that she owned the residential real estate by adverse possession, and she denied that the deck encroached on the Jackses\u2019 property. The Jackses also brought suit against Brewington, alleging that she had wrongfully removed an old wire fence and built a new six-foot privacy fence that encroached on the Jackses\u2019 property by two feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>{\u00b6 5} After a bench trial, the trial court concluded that the Jackses had acquired the property between Brewington\u2019s new fence line and the line demarcated by the old wire fence by adverse possession. Brewington was ordered to remove the fence. As to Roberts, the trial court determined that she had acquired title to the property on which her house sat by adverse possession. The court found, however, that Roberts did not demonstrate that she had adversely possessed any other area of disputed property. The court noted that the deck did not extend as far west as the house, and it stated in a footnote that \u201cit is possible that the recent improvements do not actually encroach on the Plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d The court ordered Roberts to remove her improvements \u201c[t]o the extent improvements (with the exception of the house) encroach upon Plaintiffs\u2019 land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">{\u00b6 6} Roberts appeals, raising two assignments of error. Brewington has not appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">{\u00b6 7} Roberts\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cPlaintiffs failed to meet the requisite burden of proof to show that defendant Roberts\u2019 improvements, including the wooden deck, encroach upon their property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">{\u00b6 9} In her first assignment, Roberts claims that the trial court made no finding that her improvements encroached on the Jackses\u2019 property and that the trial court cannot create a conditional obligation on Roberts to remove any improvements that encroach. Roberts asserts that the trial court determined only that the house encroached by two feet and that the deck did not extend as far as the house. She emphasizes that the court stated in a footnote that \u201cit is possible that the recent improvements do not actually encroach on the Plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">{\u00b6 10} The Jackses respond that \u201c[t]he trial court made an equitable determination of the parties\u2019 rights to the contested strip of real property and that determination, barring clear evidence of error in the record of the proceedings, should not be disturbed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">{\u00b6 11} In addressing the property dispute between the Jackses and Roberts, the trial court made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c37. See items one and two, above [stating that the Jackses have owned their property since 1958].</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c38. Defendant Roberts is the owner of certain real property (abutting the eastern property line of Plaintiffs\u2019 property), described by deed as \u2018the west <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>one-half of Lots Number 29 and 30 as the same are known and designated on the recorded plat of the Village of Springhills, Champaign County, Ohio.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c39. Defendant Roberts has owned said property since 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c40. According to the Geuy survey, the accuracy of which has not been disputed by the parties, Defendant Roberts\u2019 house encroaches onto Plaintiffs\u2019 property by approximately two feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c41. Plaintiffs contend that Defendant Roberts\u2019s recent improvements, such as the wooden deck, also encroach upon Plaintiffs [sic] property.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">(\u00b6 17} \u201c42. The Court notes that the deck does not extend as far west as the home. [fn4]</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c43. The Court finds the Geuy survey accurately depicts the properties\u2019 boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c44. To the extent that Defendant Roberts claims ownership of any property to the west of the Jacks-Roberts property line as demonstrated in the Geuy survey, Defendant Roberts bears the burden of proof in her adverse possession claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c48. In the present case, Defendant Roberts\u2019 home was built approximately 100 years ago. The Court does not find that said construction was allowed under a contract or license or that permission therefor was otherwise granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c49. Pursuant to Rader, the Court finds that Defendant Roberts and her predecessors have adversely possessed the part of the land encroached by the home\u2019s placement thereon and, therefore, Defendant Roberts possesses title thereto. [Citation omitted]</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c50. The Court finds that Defendant Roberts has not demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that she or her predecessors in title have adversely possessed any area other than that upon which the house was built.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b886-16\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c55. To the extent improvements made by Defendant Roberts encroach upon Plaintiffs\u2019 property, Defendant Roberts is hereby ordered to remove or alter said improvements so as to remove them from Plaintiffs\u2019 land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-17\">{\u00b6 26} Footnote four in paragraph 42 states: \u201cThe Court notes it is possible that the recent improvements do not actually encroach on the Plaintiffs\u2019 property. Although the house, apparently, encroaches by two feet, it appears from the photographs and other evidence that the other improvements do not extend as far west.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Although the Jackses apparently read the trial court\u2019s ruling as stating that the wooden deck encroaches on their property and the encroaching portion must be removed, we find no such finding. The trial court established the property line between the Jackses\u2019 and Roberts\u2019s property, and expressly found that Roberts\u2019s house encroached by two feet. However, the court made no finding about the location of Roberts\u2019s improvements relative to the property line, other than a general statement that the improvements were west of the edge of the house (away from the property line). There is no express finding that Roberts\u2019s improvements encroached on the Jackses\u2019 property, nor did the trial court state the extent of any encroachment. To the contrary, the trial court indicated that it appeared possible that no encroachment existed. Without a finding that Roberts\u2019s improvements encroached upon the Jackses\u2019 property, the trial court erred in ordering Roberts to remove or alter her improvements \u201cto the extent improvements * * * encroach upon Plaintiffs\u2019 land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">{\u00b6 28} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">{\u00b6 29} Roberts\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cPlaintiff owned up to the fence, which was the boundary line between her property and plaintiffs\u2019 property by adverse possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">{\u00b6 31} In her second assignment of error, Roberts claims that the trial court should have found that she owned the two-foot wide area along the property line that the Geuy survey indicated was owned by the Jackses but was located on Roberts\u2019s side of the wire fence between the properties. Roberts notes that the Jackses obtained ownership of a similar area along the property line between the Jackses and the Brewingtons by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">{\u00b6 32} Adverse possession is established when a party proves by clear and convincing evidence exclusive possession that is open, notorious, continuous, and adverse for a period of 21 years. <em>Houck v. Bd. of Park Commrs. of the Huron Cty. Park Disk, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210, at \u00b6 10; <em>Grace v. Koch </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 577, 579, 692 N.E.2d 1009. In order to establish the 21-year possession, an individual may \u201ctack\u201d to his period of adverse use the adverse use by previous owners in privity with him. <em>Lyman v. Ferrari </em>(1979), 66 Ohio App.2d 72, 76, 20 O.O.3d 138, 419 N.E.2d 1112, citing <em>Zipf v. Dalgarn </em>(1926), 114 Ohio St. 291, 296, 151 N.E. 174. Adverse use can be any use that is inconsistent with the rights of the title owner. <em>Vanasdal v. Brinker </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 298, 27 OBR 343, 500 N.E.2d 876, citing <em>Kimball v. Anderson </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 241, 244, 181 N.E. 17. Moreover, it is irrelevant if everyone believes the owner of the strip of land in question to be the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>claiming adverse possession. <em>Vanasdal, </em>27 Ohio App.3d at 299, 27 OBR 343, 500 N.E.2d 876. This is true because adverse possession protects not only those who knowingly appropriate others\u2019 land but also individuals who honestly enter and possess land in the belief that it is their own. <em>Raymond v. Cary </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 342, 343, 578 N.E.2d 865; see also <em>Vanasdal, </em>27 Ohio App.3d at 299, 27 OBR 343, 500 N.E.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">{\u00b6 33} At the trial, Roberts testified that she purchased her property on August 21, 1995 at an auction conducted by Bob and Ruby Barthauer. Roberts indicated that the wire fence between the Jackses\u2019 and Roberts\u2019s properties existed at the time of the auction, and the auctioneer indicated that he was selling \u201ceverything within the fence.\u201d Roberts testified that the Jackses never told her that their property extended past the fence, even though they attended the auction. Since the auction, the Jackses have not come onto the property on Roberts\u2019s side of the fence. Although the Jackses complimented Roberts on her improvements to her home, including new siding, they did not mention that the house sat on their side of the property line. Although a gate existed in the wire fence, Roberts stated that no one has used the gate in the last 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">{\u00b6 34} Stephen Snapp, Roberts\u2019s brother, also testified that the auctioneer informed Roberts that she owned \u201ceverything inside the fence.\u201d Robert Snapp, Ann Snapp (Roberts\u2019s mother), and Mark Organ all testified that Roberts has maintained the property on her side of the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">{\u00b6 35} Lloyd Stotler, who has lived at 6464 Crowl Road since 1978, testified that Frank Mohr and his daughter, Helen Fitzsimmons, used to live in the house owned by Roberts. Fitzsimmons owned the property after her father died, and Roberts purchased it from Fitzsimmons at an auction. Stotler testified that the Jackses put the fence between the properties onto their property when Mohr needed to put in a dry well, and the Jackses installed a gate so they could maintain both sides of fence. Stotler indicated that he had seen the Jackses mowing Roberts\u2019s side of the fence. The Jackses mowed Fitzsimmons\u2019s (now Roberts\u2019s) entire yard since 1980 or earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">{\u00b6 36} Helen Jacks testified that she and her husband had an arrangement with Mohr where Mohr would install T posts that indicated the property line, but the fence would be installed on the Jackses\u2019 property. She stated: \u201c[W]e\u2019d maintain the 5 feet over on the other side [of the fence] and he had the T post up, and he said that would be the lot. He put the T post up and said that would be the line but he wanted no fence on it.\u201d Jacks stated that they had maintained the 5 feet on Roberts\u2019s side of the fence, and Mohr asked permission whenever he wanted to do something to the house. Jacks indicated that Mohr died in 1961. The Jackses started mowing Fitzsimmons\u2019s entire yard in 1970 due to Fitzsimmons\u2019s failing health. The T posts were pulled out when Roberts bought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>property. However, the Jackses continued to mow the 5 feet until Roberts installed the wooden deck. Jacks acknowledged that she never informed Roberts that the fence was not on the property line until Roberts installed her deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">[63 {\u00b6 37} Upon review of the evidence, we find no fault with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Roberts did not establish ownership by adverse possession. Although Roberts\u2019s testimony indicated that she had adversely possessed the property on her side of the fence since her purchase in 1995, the Jackses presented evidence that Mohr and Fitzsimmons did not adversely possess the property. Jacks\u2019s and Stotler\u2019s testimonies indicated that Mohr and the Jackses understood that the fence was not on the property line and that the Jackses maintained the property on Roberts\u2019s side of the fence during Mohr\u2019s and Fitzsimmons\u2019s ownership. Although Jacks acknowledged that they had maintained all of Fitzsimmons\u2019s property for a long period of time due to Fitzsimmons\u2019s failing health, there is no evidence that the Jackses had stopped maintaining the disputed property as their own property. In short, accepting Jacks\u2019s and Stotler\u2019s testimonies, the trial court reasonably concluded that Roberts had not established that the disputed property had been adversely possessed by Roberts and her predecessors for a period of 21 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">{\u00b6 38} The fact that the Jackses successfully obtained the property up to the old fence line between their property and the Brewingtons\u2019 property is irrelevant to Roberts\u2019s claim. The Jackses presented evidence that they had continuously mowed and maintained the property up to the former fence line until 2002, i.e., for more than 21 years. Roberts did not present similar evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">{\u00b6 39} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">{\u00b6 40} Having sustained Roberts\u2019s first assignment of error, the order that Roberts remove or alter the improvements to her property to the extent that the improvements encroach upon the Jackses\u2019 property will be vacated, and the matter will be remanded to the trial court to determine whether an encroachment exists and, if so found, to determine its extent and order an appropriate remedy. In all other respects, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Judgment affirmed in part, and vacated in part and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b889-11\">Wolff, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
