Neither the driver nor Kingsland owned the vehicle, and Kingsland appeared \u201csomewhat very nervous.\u201d After walking around the back of the truck several times, the officer smelled what he believed was ether, a precursor used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. When the officer asked what was in the back of the truck, Kingsland said, \u201c[I]t ain\u2019t mine\u201d even though the officer had not told Kingsland what he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 2} Based on these facts, a jury found Kingsland guilty of illegal possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs. On appeal, Kingsland argues that insufficient evidence supports his conviction and that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Because the only evidence linking Kingsland to the material in the back of the truck is his presence as a passenger in the truck, his nervousness, and his denial of ownership of any items in the truck\u2019s bed, we agree that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that, if believed, would convince the average mind of Kingsland\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">{\u00b6 3} Around 11:20 p.m. in April 2007, Officer Jeremy Caldwell of the Winchester Police Department stopped a 1993 Chevy S-10 pickup truck because it had a cracked windshield and lacked a bumper. After stopping the pickup, Officer Caldwell checked the bed of the pickup to make sure no one was lying down in it. He then determined that the driver was Paul Black, that Kingsland was the sole passenger, and that the truck belonged to Mark Koller. An identity check of Kingsland disclosed an outstanding warrant for his arrest. However, Kingsland complained that he was no longer wanted by the police because he had already served his jail time, and Officer Caldwell soon verified that the warrant for Kingsland\u2019s arrest was no longer in force. Nonetheless, Officer Caldwell believed that Kingsland was acting \u201csomewhat very nervous\u201d and jittery.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">{\u00b6 4} After passing beside the back of the pickup several times, Officer Caldwell sensed an \u201coverwhelming\u201d smell of what he thought was ether coming from the bed of the truck. Ether is a precursor used in the production of methamphetamine. Looking more closely at the contents in the bed of the truck, Officer Caldwell discovered a capped mason jar with a rubber tube in it wrapped in a plastic bag, and he immediately suspected that he had found a meth lab. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Officer Caldwell approached Kingsland and asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the back of the truck?\u201d According to Officer Caldwell, Kingsland replied, \u201cIt ain\u2019t mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 5} Deputy Sheriff Jeff McCarty arrived on the scene and believed from the smell that there was ether in the mason jar and that the jar contained a \u201csludge or residue left over from * * * a methamphetamine cook.\u201d An inventory search of the truck disclosed a new pack of lithium batteries and a glass bottle with milky residue between the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s seats in the cab of the truck. In the rear of the truck, police found lithium battery shells and plastic bottles and jars with a milky residue. Because these items were typical of a meth lab, the officers placed Kingsland and the driver under arrest. Kingsland asked the officers to fingerprint all of the alleged contraband and denied owning it. However, no scientific tests were performed on these objects before a hazardous-materials crew destroyed everything except the unopened box of batteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 6} The state indicted Kingsland on one count of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, a violation of R.C. 2925.041(A) and a third-degree felony. Both Officer Caldwell and Deputy McCarty testified at trial. The state offered Deputy McCarty as an expert witness on meth labs, and he testified that the mason jar contained ether and that ether was a precursor used in the production of methamphetamine. He also identified the residue on the bottles and jars as a by-product from the production of methamphetamine. The defense presented no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 7} The jury found Kingsland guilty of the illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of methamphetamine, and the trial court sentenced him to a term of two years in prison. Kingsland filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">{\u00b6 8} Kingsland presents two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">1. The trial court violated Joshua Kingsland\u2019s rights to due process and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, the trial court found Mr. Kingsland guilty of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. (Tr. 460; September 26, 2007, Sentencing Entry.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">2. The trial court violated Joshua Kingsland\u2019s rights to due process and a fair trial when it entered a judgment of convictions for illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, when that judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. (Tr. 460; September 26, 2007, Sentencing Entry.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 9} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court examines the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether that evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. This is a test of legal adequacy, not rational persuasiveness. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 10} Our function when reviewing the weight of the evidence, on the other hand, is to determine whether the greater amount of credible evidence supports the verdict. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. In order to undertake this review, we must sit as a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d and review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. Id., citing <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. We will order a new trial only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction. <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, at \u00b6 100, citing <em>Martin, </em>at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. We will not reverse a conviction so long as the prosecution presented substantial evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that all of the essential elements of the offense were established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 193-194, 702 N.E.2d 866; <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 10 O.O.3d 340, 383 N.E.2d 132, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">TV. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 11} In his first assignment of error, Kingsland argues that insufficient evidence supports his conviction for illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2925.041(A) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly assemble or possess one or more chemicals that may be used to manufacture a controlled substance in schedule I or II with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance in schedule I or II in violation of section 2925.04 of the Revised Code.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury that methamphetamine is a schedule II drug. On appeal, Kingsland argues that the state presented insufficient evidence proving that he knowingly possessed the precursors of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Possession may be actual or constructive. <em>State v. Butler </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 174, 176, 538 N.E.2d 98; <em>State v. Fry, </em>Jackson App. No. 03CA26, 2004-Ohio-5747, 2004 WL 2428439, at \u00b6 39. \u201cActual possession exists when the circumstances indicate that an individual has or had an item within his immediate physical possession. Constructive possession exists when an individual is able to exercise dominion or control of an item, even if the individual does not have the item within his immediate physical possession.\u201d <em>Fry </em>at \u00b6 39, citing <em>State v. Hankerson </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 87, 24 O.O.3d 155, 434 N.E.2d 1362, syllabus, and <em>State v. Wolery </em>(1976) 46 Ohio St.2d 316, 329, 75 O.O.2d 366, 348 N.E.2d 351. \u201c \u2018[F]or constructive possession to exist, \u201c[i]t must also be shown that the person was conscious of the presence of the object.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Huckleberry, </em>Scioto App. No. 07CA3142, 2008-Ohio-1007, 2008 WL 623342, at \u00b6 34, quoting <em>State v. Harrington, </em>Scioto App. No. 05CA3038, 2006-Ohio-4388, 2006 WL 2457218, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Hankerson, </em>70 Ohio St.2d at 91, 24 O.O.3d 155, 434 N.E.2d 1362. Although a defendant\u2019s mere proximity is in itself insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object may constitute some evidence of constructive possession. <em>Fry </em>at \u00b6 40. Thus, presence in the vicinity of contraband, coupled with another factor or factors probative of dominion or control over the contraband, may establish constructive possession. <em>State v. Riggs </em>(Sept. 13, 1999), Washington App. No. 98CA39, 1999 WL 727952.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 14} Initially, Kingsland argues that we cannot consider whether the evidence supports a finding that he constructively possessed the precursors to methamphetamine because the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to instruct the jury on constructive possession. He relies on the principle that \u201cthe Constitution protects every criminal defendant \u2018against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Booker </em>(2005), 543 U.S. 220, 230, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, quoting <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368; see also <em>State v. Peterson, </em>Columbiana App. No. 06C050, 2007-Ohio-4979, 2007 WL 2758670, at \u00b6 23 (\u201c[CJourts cannot base a conviction or increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum on any fact, other than the fact of a prior conviction, which has not been submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). In its jury instructions, the trial court defined \u201cpossess\u201d to mean \u201chaving control over a thing or substance, * * * but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises on which the thing or the substance is found.\u201d As we have already noted, constructive possession is present when an individual exercises dominion or control over an item. <em>Fry, </em>2004-Ohio-5747, 2004 WL 2428439, at \u00b6 39. Thus, the trial court\u2019s instructions sufficiently informed the jury that it could find Kingsland guilty even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>if he did not have actual possession of the chemicals, so long as it found that he had exercised control over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 15} We must now determine whether the state presented sufficient evidence to allow the jury to decide whether Kingsland knowingly exercised control over the chemicals found in the pickup truck. Officer Caldwell testified that when he initially approached the pickup, he looked into the truck\u2019s bed to make sure no one was there. At that time, he did not notice any of the bottles and jars containing the milky residue. The state presented 11 photographs depicting the items found in the back of the truck, and each of the items containing residue was partially concealed within plastic bags, a bucket, or a bowl. The glass bottle found in the cab of the pickup was also partially concealed in a cardboard box and covered with the unopened package of lithium batteries. Officer Caldwell testified that he walked around the rear and sides of the pickup several times before he smelled what he believed- \u2014 but could not say for a fact\u2014 was ether. Even though Officer Caldwell testified that he had received specialized training in the detection of meth labs and the chemicals associated with the illegal production of methamphetamine, and even though the jars and bottles were in plain view and lit by the lights from his cruiser, he did not discover the contraband until he had almost concluded the traffic stop. Officer Caldwell admitted that the objects in the truck would not have been readily apparent if someone approached the truck in the dark. He also admitted that Kingsland had denied knowing about the contraband, that Kingsland had requested that the police fingerprint the objects, and that no fingerprints had been collected before the objects were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 16} Officer Caldwell\u2019s testimony and the exhibits admitted at trial make clear that Kingsland could be a passenger in this truck and not be aware of the bottles, jars, and chemicals. The state presented no evidence showing that Kingsland had any specialized knowledge regarding methamphetamine production or that he should have recognized these objects as components in the production of methamphetamine. There is no evidence regarding what time of day Kingsland got in the truck or how long he had been in it. Thus, all the state showed was mere proximity to the illegal chemicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 17} The only other evidence purportedly connecting Kingsland to these chemicals is Officer Caldwell\u2019s testimony that Kingsland had acted \u201csomewhat very nervous and shaky, and uh, was kind of irate, jittery maybe, in \u2014 in somewhat of a hurry * * * um, but nervous.\u201d Although Officer Caldwell testified that Kingsland appeared more nervous than the average person stopped for a traffic violation, he also admitted that his inquiry about a warrant that was mistakenly in force \u201c[would] make a lot of people nervous.\u201d On redirect, Officer Caldwell testified that \u201cwhen I was approaching the vehicle he kept looking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>through the back glass at me. That\u2019s actually what made me actually go to the post-to-head position, to where I could be in front of him, to where I can see through the windshield to see hands.\u201d On recross, however, Officer Caldwell admitted that at the time he approached the vehicle, \u201c[Kingsland] was in a very animated conversation with whoever was on that cell phone * * * [a]nd when we\u2019re in a very animated telephone conversation on a cell phone a lot of times we do move around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 18} It is not clear from the record whether any of this nervous behavior observed by Officer Caldwell occurred before or after he informed Kingsland that he was wanted on a warrant. Thus, an examination of the record shows that the cause of and the extent of Kingsland\u2019s nervousness is not clear. In any case, we do not believe that Kingsland\u2019s being \u201csomewhat very nervous\u201d in itself suffices to prove that he was in the conscious possession of the illegal chemicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 19} Officer Caldwell also testified that Kingsland\u2019s initial reaction \u201cwhen I asked * * * what\u2019s in the back of the truck [was] it ain\u2019t mine. * * * I didn\u2019t even tell \u2019em what it was yet.\u201d The state argues that Kingsland\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]t ain\u2019t mine\u201d shows guilty knowledge. However, nothing in Kingsland statement shows that he knew what was in the back of the truck. It is not the case that Kingsland denied owning a particular object in a way that would show he was aware it was in the back of the truck. For instance, had Kingsland responded that \u201cthose lithium battery shells are not mine\u201d or \u201cthat mason jar is not mine,\u201d his statement would help to show that he was in the conscious presence of contraband. However, the only inference that the jury could draw from his statement that \u201c[i]t ain\u2019t mine\u201d is that he denied owning whatever it was that Officer Caldwell had found.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 20} Here, we cannot say that the state presented sufficient evidence that, if believed, would convince the average mind of Kingsland\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The state\u2019s evidence showed that the drugs were found in the pickup, that neither the driver nor Kingsland owned the pickup, and that Kingsland was a passenger in the pickup for some unknown duration. The driver did not testify. None of the state\u2019s evidence indicates that Kingsland should have or could have known that he was in close proximity to illegal chemicals based upon their appearance and location in the truck. In order to conclude that it was Kingsland who was in control of the chemicals, jars, and bottles rather than the driver or the owner of the truck, the jury would have to speculate. Officer Caldwell testified that Kingsland appeared \u201csomewhat very nervous,\u201d but we do not believe that an individual acting \u201csomewhat very nervous\u201d in itself suffices to show guilt in the absence of any other evidence. See <em>State v. Bush, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81959, 2003-Ohio-4054, 2003 WL 21757516, at \u00b6 12-14 (holding that insufficient evidence proved constructive possession when the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>merely in the vicinity of PCP, the smell of PCP was in the air, the defendant had 34 one-dollar bills, and there was no evidence that the defendant knew what PCP smelled like); <em>State v. Mayer, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80168, 2003-Ohio-1, 2003 WL 23108, at \u00b6 6-12 (concluding that insufficient evidence supported driver\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine when driver sped up after a police cruiser pulled behind him, the packet of crack cocaine was not in driver\u2019s reach or line of sight, no one saw driver duck down, it was dark outside and inside the truck, and the state merely speculated that the defendant rather than the passenger placed the packet on the floor beside the transmission hump); see also <em>State v. Smith, </em>Logan App. No. 8-04-40, 2005-Ohio-3233, 2005 WL 1503954, at \u00b6 7 (holding that insufficient evidence supported the defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine when officers executed a warrant on a small one-room apartment and found \u201clarge quantities of crack-cocaine\u201d in plain view; although the defendant supplied police with a false name when they questioned him at the apartment, there was no evidence that the defendant had drugs on his person or that he had ever used cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{\u00b6 21} Likewise, we do not believe that the greater amount of credible evidence supports the verdict. Thus, Kingsland\u2019s conviction is also against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-6\">Abele, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b701-7\">Kline, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b701-8\">Kline, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AsI\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b6 22} I concur in judgment and opinion. I agree that Kingsland\u2019s mere presence as a passenger in the truck is not enough to conclude that he had constructive possession of any item found in the bed of the truck. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>Logan App. No. 8-04-40, 2005-Ohio-3233, 2005 WL 1503954, \u00b6 7 (evidence of mere presence in a small room where drugs were located in plain view was not sufficient to prove possession). See also <em>State v. Hairston, </em>Summit App. Nos. 23663 and 23680, 2008-Ohio-891, 2008 WL 583787, \u00b6 11-12. Further, I agree with the majority that Kingsland\u2019s general response (\u201cIt ain\u2019t mine * * * it ain\u2019t mine\u201d) to the officer\u2019s question is not enough to reasonably conclude that he knew what was in the back of the truck. For example, one reasonable inference is that the word \u201cit\u201d referred to the truck, i.e., \u201c[The truck] ain\u2019t mine * * * [The truck] ain\u2019t mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">{\u00b6 23} I write separately to discuss what an officer found stuffed between the two front seats in a box, i.e., lithium batteries (items used in the manufacture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>methamphetamine) and a mason jar with white residue in it (a by-product of methamphetamine manufacture). The evidence did not show that these items were in plain view or that Kingsland was conscious of their presence inside the truck. Thus, just as the evidence was insufficient to show Kingsland\u2019s possession of the items in the bed of the truck, the evidence was also insufficient to show that Kingsland possessed the items inside the truck. Consequently, I agree that insufficient evidence supports Kingsland\u2019s conviction of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, I concur in judgment and opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
