Briarfield of Cortland (\u201cConcord\u201d), appeals the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Charlene A. Sehroeder, was attorney-in-fact for Lucy A. Bonaquist. In September 2003, Sehroeder entered into a financial agreement with Concord for Bonaquist\u2019s long-term care, an agreement under which Schroeder agreed to pay Concord the amount of $1,600 per month for the care of Bonaquist \u2014 the combined amount that Bonaquist was receiving from a pension and Social Security. Sehroeder failed to make timely payments on behalf of Bonaquist. In March 2004, Sehroeder signed, as Bonaquist\u2019s attorney-in-fact, a promissory note for the amount due on Concord\u2019s account for services rendered to Bonaquist. Despite numerous attempts by Concord, Sehroeder did not tender the amount due on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">{\u00b6 3} A complaint was filed by Concord against Sehroeder on July 17, 2006. Count one of the complaint alleged that Sehroeder, as the attorney-in-fact of Bonaquist, \u201cfailed to fulfill her obligation to Bonaquist by either misappropriating the monthly funds intended for [Concord] or by allowing an unauthorized person to misappropriate the funds.\u201d Count two of the complaint referred to the promissory note executed by Sehroeder and alleged that she had \u201cmaterially breached the terms of the contract with [Concord] by failing to submit payment to [Concord] for said services of Ms. Bonaquist\u201d and that she had \u201cbreached her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>fiduciary obligations as attorney-in-fact for Ms. Bonaquist by failing to pay for the care and services provided by [Concord] to Ms. Bonaquist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 4} Schroeder filed her answer to the complaint on September 16, 2006, admitting that she was the attorney-in-fact for Bonaquist and that she had executed certain documents as Bonaquist\u2019s attorney-in-fact. Schroeder, however, denied personal liability for the amount owed to Concord because she had executed the promissory note in the capacity of Bonaquist\u2019s attorney-in-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 5} On January 17, 2007, Schroeder filed a motion to dismiss Concord\u2019s complaint as a result of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Concord, on March 2, 2007, filed a response to Schroeder\u2019s motion to dismiss, arguing that Concord\u2019s claim was not discharged as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding because (1) Schroeder failed to list the debt of Concord and to allow Concord an opportunity to make a claim in the bankruptcy court and (2) the debt was incurred by Schroeder\u2019s fraudulent activity. Thereafter, the trial court issued a judgment entry interpreting Schroeder\u2019s January 17, 2007 motion as a \u201cmotion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\u201d In its entry, the trial court determined that relief could not be granted based on the causes of action asserted by Concord in its complaint and, therefore, the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 6} Concord timely appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment entry, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 8} Concord asserts that the trial court erred when it granted Schroeder\u2019s motion to dismiss based on Civ.R. 12(B)(6), because such a motion was not pending before the court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">{\u00b6 9} An appellate court will review a judgment involving a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss de novo. <em>Goss v. Kmart Corp., </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-T-0117, 2007-Ohio-3200, 2007 WL 1810523, at \u00b6 17. Generally, \u201c[a] motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605 N.E.2d 378. In conducting a de novo review, this court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Byg v. Lynch, </em>5th Dist. Nos. 03CA45 and 03CA48, 2003-Ohio-7290, at \u00b6 25, citing <em>Byrd v. Faber </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 56, 565 N.E.2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u2018(A)s long as there is a set of facts, consistent with the plaintiffs complaint, which would allow the plaintiff to recover, the court may not grant a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u2019 <em>York </em>[v. <em>Ohio State Hwy. Patrol </em>(1991) ], 60 Ohio St.3d [143, 145], 573 N.E.2d 1063. Accordingly, \u2018(t)his court must analyze <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>whether or not there is a set of facts which would allow (the plaintiff) to recover.\u2019 <em>Sinoff v. Ohio Permanente Med Group, Inc., </em>146 Ohio App.3d 732, 2001-Ohio-4186, 767 N.E.2d 1251, at \u00b6 20.\u201d <em>Goss, </em>2007-Ohio-3200, 2007 WL 1810523, at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">{\u00b6 11} Generally, a trial court may not dismiss a complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) sua sponte without first giving the parties notice of the court\u2019s intention to dismiss on this basis and an opportunity to be heard. <em>McMullian v. Borean, </em>6th Dist. No. OT-05-017, 2006-Ohio-861, 2006 WL 456771, at \u00b6 15. \u201cA sua sponte dismissal without notice or an opportunity to respond is fundamentally unfair to litigants. * * * It places the court in the role of a proponent rather than an independent entity. * * * Sua sponte dismissals also prejudice appellants as they deny any opportunity to respond to the alleged insufficiencies. * * Id. at \u00b6 16. Sua sponte dismissal without notice is appropriate, however, when the complaint is either frivolous or the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts as stated in the complaint. <em>MBNA Am. Bank v. Canfora, </em>9th Dist. No. 23588, 2007-Ohio-4137, 2007 WL 2318095, at \u00b6 7, citing <em>Dunn v. Marthers, </em>9th Dist. No. 05CA008838, 2006-Ohio-4923, 2006 WL 2714682, at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 12} Initially, we must note that although the trial court stated in its entry that Schroeder had filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), it appears from the docket that no such motion was ever pending before the trial court. Schroeder\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint was based solely on her Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Thus, Concord\u2019s response to the motion to dismiss refuted those allegations by attaching a list of the creditors having secured and unsecured priority claims, a list that that did not include Concord. Further, Concord argued that its debt was nondischargeable, because \u201cany debt incurred by fraudulent means cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d Because a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) was not pending before the trial court, we must determine whether it acted properly in dismissing Concord\u2019s complaint sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 13} Because the record is void of any evidence that would indicate that the parties received notice of the trial court\u2019s intent to dismiss the action based on Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we must ascertain whether Concord\u2019s complaint is frivolous or whether it cannot prevail on the alleged facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 14} With respect to count one, the trial court determined that Concord could not impose personal liability on Schroeder based upon her relationship as attorney-in-fact for Bonaquist. However, before the trial court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of the complaint, Concord should have been given an opportunity to demonstrate how the duty to Bonaquist may have extended to it as a third party to the relationship. See, e.g., <em>Aristocrat Lakewood Nursing Home v. Mayne </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 651, 674, 729 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Then, in dismissing count two of Concord\u2019s complaint, the trial court relied upon R.C. 1337.092(A), determining that since Schroeder signed the promissory note as Bonaquist\u2019s attorney-in-fact, she was not personally liable on the contract. However, it is important to recognize that Concord\u2019s complaint alleged that Schroeder \u201cmisappropriated [Bonaquist\u2019s] monthly funds\u201d or \u201callowed] an unauthorized person to misappropriate the funds.\u201d Even though one signs a promissory note as attorney-in-fact, they may still be personally liable for the debt under R.C. 1337.092(B)(1) through (5). Further, the trial court failed to address the allegation by Concord that Schroeder was misappropriating funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">{\u00b6 16} Consequently, after construing the allegations of Concord\u2019s complaint most strongly in its favor, the trial court erred in sua sponte dismissing the claims without notice, since they are not frivolous, nor does it appear that Concord cannot prevail on the facts alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 17} Concord\u2019s assignment of error is sustained, and this matter is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-7\">Rice and Trapp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
