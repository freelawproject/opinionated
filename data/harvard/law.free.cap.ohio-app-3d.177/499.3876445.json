Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">{\u00b6 1} The contemnor, Edward A. Heffernan, appeals from a common pleas court order finding him in contempt and fining him $500. Appellant argues that the court erred by finding him in direct contempt and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the contempt conviction. We find that appellant\u2019s conduct was not a direct contempt that the court could summarily punish. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 2} The contempt order at issue here arises out of a criminal proceeding in the case of <em>State v. Landers, </em>Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Case No. CR-497284. The portions of the record relevant to this appeal are extremely limited. The criminal case was scheduled for trial on October 23, 2007. Two motions to suppress were pending. The transcript of proceedings on October 23, 2007, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Heffernan [appellant], what time is it now?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cMR. HEFFERNAN: Quarter to three.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cTHE COURT: You were told to be here at what time?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cMR. HEFFERNAN: 2:00.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll fine you $500 for being in contempt of court. Pay that to the clerk of courts by Friday at noon, do you understand?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cMR. HEFFERNAN: Thank you. Your Honor, I was here this morning for trial and I was able to speak to the prosecutor and spoke to her because she was handling a number of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cI\u2019ve been in, so far today, four other courts and your bailiff told me that we would not be going in the morning, he told me that about 1:00.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cI had a 1:00 hearing with Judge Weiler, at which time I went to Judge Weiler\u2019s, and I brought for you the time-stamped journal entry that I was. That is the reason I was late.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cI asked the bailiff to call in regards to your court, knowing the difficulty I may have in regards to being back here by 2:00.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE COURT: This case was set for trial, I expect you to be available for trial throughout the course of the day. I don\u2019t care what else you have.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe cases are set for 9:00, you\u2019re to be here the day of trial at 9:00, you wait for the Court, the Court does not wait for you.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c$500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 17} The court subsequently entered a written order fining appellant $500 for being late.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 18} Even though both parties requested a continuance of the matter, a short time later, the court dismissed the charges against Mr. Landers, without prejudice, because the state\u2019s witnesses (who had been present earlier in the day) had not returned to the court, so the state was not prepared to proceed on the motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 19} Findings of contempt are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Kilbane </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 201, 15 O.O.3d 221, 400 N.E.2d 386, paragraph one of the syllabus. An abuse of discretion suggests that the court\u2019s order was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">{\u00b6 20} Contempt may be civil or criminal in nature and may be direct or indirect. A criminal contempt order serves the purpose of punishing the offender and vindicating the court\u2019s authority, while a civil contempt order attempts to coerce compliance with the court\u2019s directives. <em>Brown v. Executive 200, Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 250, 254, 18 O.O.3d 446, 416 N.E.2d 610. Indirect contempt occurs outside the court\u2019s presence. Direct contempt is misbehavior that occurs in the court\u2019s presence and that obstructs the due and orderly administration of justice. R.C. 2705.01 and 2705.02; <em>State v. Webster, </em>Hamilton App. Nos. C-070027 and C-070028, 2008-Ohio-1636, 2008 WL 901454, \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">{\u00b6 21} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the court abused its discretion by finding him in direct contempt,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the allegedly contemptuous conduct did not occur in the court\u2019s presence. This court has consistently held that being late for a hearing or not appearing at all is at best an indirect contempt. See, e.g., <em>State v. Belcastro </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 498, 501, 744 N.E.2d 271; see also <em>Weiland v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 62, 66, 1 O.O.2d 198, 139 N.E.2d 36. Accordingly, we agree with appellant that his conduct was not a direct contempt and could not be summarily punished.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>{\u00b622} The common pleas court abused its discretion by summarily finding appellant in contempt and fining him $500. Therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-5\">Calabrese, P.J., and Blackmon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-12\">. The court did not expressly state whether it considered appellant's contempt to be direct or indirect, but the fact that it summarily punished appellant\u2019s conduct implies that it found a direct contempt. Indirect contempts always require the court to afford the contemnor notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-13\">. To punish appellant for lateness as an indirect contempt, the court should have afforded appellant the procedural protections of R.C. 2705.03, including written notice of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and an opportunity to be heard by himself or through counsel. The court allowed appellant to explain why he was late, but this limited opportunity to be heard was not sufficient to meet the requirements of R.C. 2705.03.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
