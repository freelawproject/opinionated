Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, the city of Lima, appeals the Allen County Court of Common Pleas grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, the state of Ohio.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the trial court erred in finding that R.C. 9.481 was validly enacted pursuant to Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and meets the test of <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">{\u00b6 2} On November 2, 1920, Lima voters adopted a city charter pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. In 1974, section 72 of the Lima City Charter was amended to permit Lima City Council to determine by ordinance whether to establish a residency requirement for city employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">{\u00b6 3} On October 23, 2000, Lima City Council passed Ordinance 201-00 pursuant to section 72 of the Lima City Charter, which \u201cestablished a requirement for persons appointed by the Mayor as employees of the city on or after the date of passage of this ordinance, that as a condition of employment with the city all such employees shall live in a primary permanent residency within the corporate boundaries of the municipality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On May 1, 2006, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 9.481 pursuant to Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution (hereinafter \u201cSection 34\u201d), which, except in specified circumstances, limited the ability of political subdivisions throughout Ohio to condition employment upon residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">{\u00b6 5} On May 22, 2006, Lima filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in the Allen County Court of Common Pleas against the state arguing that R.C. 9.481 is unconstitutional on several grounds. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed on December 15, 2006, with both parties responding on January 12, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">{\u00b6 6} On February 16, 2007, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment upholding the constitutionality of R.C. 9.481 and denied Lima\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On April 19, 2007, Lima appealed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to this court, asserting three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">{\u00b6 7} We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Sharonville v. Am. Employers Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 5, citing <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 N.E.2d 712, \u00b6 8. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201c(1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241, citing <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 631 N.E.2d 150; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">{\u00b6 8} Whether a statute is constitutional is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>Wilson v.

De novo review is independent and without deference to the trial courts determination. <em>Wilson, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 720, 2006-Ohio-6704, 864 N.E.2d 682, at \u00b6 61. \u201c[A]ll statutes are presumed constitutional, and the party challenging [has] the burden of proving otherwise\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v.

Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 159, 38 O.O.2d 404, 224 N.E.2d 906, 908-909 (\u201c[W]hen an enactment of the General Assembly is challenged, the challenger must overcome a strong presumption of constitutionality\u201d). All presumptions and applicable rules of statutory construction are applied to uphold a statute from constitutional attack. <em>State v.

Bd. of Trustees v. Tracy </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 353, 356, 667 N.E.2d 1174, citing <em>State ex rel. Bishop v. Mt.

Tyler </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 195, 72 O.O.2d 112, 331 N.E.2d 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.\u201d The Federalist No. 78 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter Ed.1961) 468-469. \u201cThe principle that courts are not the creators of public policy and should not decide cases based on disagreement with a legislature has guided courts since the creation of the American judicial system.\u201d <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(1992), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 135, 748 N.E.2d 1111 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">III. Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">{\u00b6 11} Although we review constitutional questions de novo, for clarification purposes and an otherwise thorough review we set forth the essential findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">{\u00b6 12} This appeal follows the Allen County Court of Common Pleas grant of summary judgment in favor of the state of Ohio. The trial court set forth the following issue for its review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">[Wjhether * * * O.R.C. 9.481 as enacted by the General Assembly which provides employees of Ohio\u2019s political subdivisions with freedom to choose where they want to live, is unconstitutional because it conflicts with Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-13\"><em>Lima v. Ohio </em>(Feb. 15, 2007), Allen C.P. No. CV2006-0518, at 4. The trial court first considered the relevance of the <em>Canton </em>test and a traditional home-rule analysis. Id. at 6. The trial court concluded that laws validly passed pursuant to Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution cannot be impaired by the Home Rule Amendment; and therefore, a traditional home-rule analysis was unnecessary. Id. at 10, citing <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 539 N.E.2d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court then concluded that R.C. 9.481 was validly enacted pursuant to Section 34. The trial court decided that Lima\u2019s residency requirement is a condition of employment. Id. at 11, citing <em>St. Bernard v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 3, 6, 598 N.E.2d 15. As a condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>employment, the trial court reasoned, R.C. 9.481\u2019s regulation of residency requirements concerned the general welfare of public employees; and therefore, the law was validly enacted pursuant to Section 34. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">{\u00b6 14} After it concluded that R.C. 9.481 was validly enacted pursuant to Section 34 and superseded the Home Rule Amendment, the trial court examined R.C. 9.481 under the traditional <em>Canton </em>home-rule analysis in the alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">{\u00b6 15} Prior to conducting a <em>Canton </em>analysis, the trial court found that residency requirements are an issue of statewide concern due to the extraterritorial effects that such requirements have on other Ohio communities. Id. at 12. The court then concluded that since residency requirements are a matter of statewide concern, the state\u2019s power to regulate superseded the municipality\u2019s right to home rule. Id. at 12-13, citing <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Painesville </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 125, 129, 44 O.O.2d 121, 239 N.E.2d 75; <em>Uniformed Firefighters Assn. v. New York </em>(1980), 50 N.Y.2d 85, 428 N.Y.S.2d 197, 405 N.E.2d 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, the trial court concluded that even if it applied the <em>Canton </em>test, the state of Ohio still prevailed. Id. at 13. Applying the four-part <em>Canton </em>test, the trial court reached the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">1. Generally permitting employees of political subdivisions through [sic] the State of Ohio to live where they choose to live while providing political subdivisions with a process for enacting specific exceptions, constitutes a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment in and of itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">2. O.R.C. 9.481 operates uniformly throughout the State of Ohio because the statute applies across the State to all included within the statute\u2019s operative provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">3. Subject of providing employees of political subdivisions throughout the State of Ohio with the freedom to choose where they want to live is of a general nature for all of these employees. Specifically, the law\u2019s subject not only affects employees of the City of Lima by providing them with the freedom to choose where they want to live, but it also affects employees of every other political subdivision within the State of Ohio in the same manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-11\">4. O.R.C. 9.481 qualifies as an exercise of police power. State\u2019s police power embraces regulations designed to promote public convenience or the general prosperity or welfare, as well as those specifically intended to promote the public safety or public health. (Quoted from <em>Wessel[l] v. Timberlake </em>(1916), 95 Ohio St. 21, 34 [116 N.E. 43])</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-12\">5. O.R.C. 9.481 proscribes a rule of conduct on citizens generally. As noted by the State, the statute applies to political subdivisions, but \u201cthe practical effect of the legislation and common sense tells us \u2018that O.R.C. 9.481 has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>direct impact on the conduct of employees of political subdivisions generally\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Canton, </em>supra, at 155, 766 N.E.2d 963.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">For these reasons, the trial court concluded that R.C. 9.481 was constitutional under both <em>Canton </em>and the doctrine of statewide concern in addition to its earlier conclusion that R.C. 9.481 superseded Lima\u2019s ordinance under Section 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">{\u00b6 17} Several other trial courts throughout the state have concluded that R.C. 9.481 is constitutional and supersedes municipal ordinances to the contrary for similar reasons. <em>Toledo v. State </em>(July 27, 2007), Lucas C.P. No. CI06-3235; <em>Dayton v. State </em>(June 6, 2007), Montgomery C.P. No. 06-3507; <em>Akron v. State </em>(Mar. 30, 2007), Summit C.P. No. CV 2006-05-2759; <em>Cleveland v. State </em>(Feb. 23, 2007), Cuyahoga C.P. No. 06-590463; <em>Am. Fedn. of State, Cty., &amp; Mun. Emps. Local </em># <em>74 v. Warren </em>(Sept. 14, 2007), Trumbull C.P. No. 2006 CV 01489. The Ohio courts of appeals have not decided the constitutionality of R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">IV. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">{\u00b6 18} Lima asserts three assignments of error for our review. Since assignment of error two must be resolved before assignment of error one becomes relevant, we will analyze it first. Our disposition of assignments of error one and two renders assignment of error three moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">{\u00b6 19} In its first assignment of error, Lima argues that the trial court incorrectly determined that R.C. 9.481 is constitutional pursuant to the doctrine of statewide concern. Lima contends that the trial court did not apply the doctrine of statewide concern within the context of the <em>Canton </em>test. 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963. Under a proper formulation of the <em>Canton </em>test, argues Lima, R.C. 9.481 is not a \u201cgeneral law\u201d; and therefore does not supersede Lima\u2019s home-rule authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">{\u00b6 20} The state argues that the proper analysis for determining whether R.C. 9.481 is constitutional is not Canton\u2019s home-rule analysis, but rather the analysis outlined in <em>Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors v. Cent. State Univ. </em>and <em>Rocky River IV. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 55, 717 N.E.2d 286, 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 539 N.E.2d 103. The state claims that <em>Cent. State Univ. </em>and <em>Rocky River TV, </em>like this case and unlike <em>Canton, </em>involved laws enacted pursuant to Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">{\u00b6 21} Lima agrees with the state that laws validly enacted pursuant to Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution supersede local ordinances passed pursuant to Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, the home-rule authority. However, Lima alleges in its second assignment of error that R.C. 9.481 was not validly enacted pursuant to Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Therefore, the first issue before this court is whether R.C. 9.481 was validly enacted pursuant to Article II, Section 34 of the Ohio Constitution. If the answer to this inquiry is \u201cyes,\u201d the parties agree that R.C. 9.481 supersedes Lima Ordinance No. 201-00; if the answer is \u201cno,\u201d then the <em>Canton </em>traditional home-rule analysis applies, and Lima\u2019s first assignment of error becomes relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Assignment of Error No. II</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The trial court erred in concluding R.C. 9.481 was a valid enactment pursuant to Article II, Section 34 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">{\u00b6 23} In its second assignment of error, Lima argues that R.C. 9.481 was not validly enacted pursuant to Article II, Section 34, because \u201cSection 34 * * * address[es] employment issues directly related to the working environment.\u201d The state counters that Section 34\u2019s general welfare clause applies to \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d and since residency is one such condition, R.C. 9.481 is within Section 34\u2019s grant of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">{\u00b6 24} At oral argument, Lima asserted that \u201cconditions of employment\u201d and \u201cconditions for employment\u201d are distinct issues, because the former means conditions within the working environment, whereas the later means qualifications for employment. Lima concedes that Section 34\u2019s grant of authority covers working environment conditions, but disagrees that it extends to qualifications for employment. We agree with Lima that Section 34\u2019s language, legislative history, and case law support a more limited grant of legislative authority than the state presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">A. Section 34\u2019s Plain Language</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cGenerally speaking, in construing the Constitution, we apply the same rules of construction that we apply in construing statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 380, 2004-Ohio-3206, 811 N.E.2d 68, \u00b6 14. \u201c \u2018[O]ur inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 70, 2005-Ohio-3807, 831 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 38, quoting <em>BedRoc Ltd., L.L.C. v. United States </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 176, 183, 124 S.Ct. 1587, 158 L.Ed.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">{\u00b6 26} Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-12\">Laws may be passed fixing and regulating the hours of labor, establishing a minimum wage, and providing for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees; and no other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">Section 34\u2019s plain text provides four clauses. The first three are grants of legislative authority; the fourth is a supremacy clause. First, Section 34 grants the General Assembly the authority to pass laws \u201cfixing and regulating the hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>of labor\u201d (\u201chours clause\u201d). Second, Section 34 grants the General Assembly authority to pass laws \u201cestablishing a minimum wage\u201d (\u201cminimum-wage clause\u201d). Third, Section 34 grants the General Assembly authority to pass laws \u201cproviding for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of all employes\u201d (\u201cgeneral-welfare clause\u201d). Fourth, Section 34 provides that \u201cno other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power\u201d (\u201csupremacy clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">{\u00b6 27} Lima argues that the general-welfare clause grants the General Assembly authority to pass laws addressing \u201cemployment issues directly related to the working environment.\u201d The general-welfare clause states laws may be passed \u201cproviding for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of employees.\u201d The general-welfare clause, thus, provides that the General Assembly may pass laws providing for the \u201cgeneral welfare.\u201d General welfare means \u201c[t]he public\u2019s health, peace, morals, and safety.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1625; <em>Mirick v. Gims </em>(1908), 79 Ohio St. 174, 179, 86 N.E. 880. Usually, the term \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d is associated with the state\u2019s police powers, which are broad and discretionary. <em>Gims, </em>79 Ohio St. at 179, 86 N.E. 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">{\u00b6 28} The general-welfare clause\u2019s language is, however, limited by subject matter. The general-welfare clause\u2019s plain language requires that the General Assembly enact laws providing for the general welfare \u201cof all employes.\u201d Lima\u2019s assignment of error, thus, raises the issue of whether the term \u201cemployes\u201d in Section 34 means employees acting within the scope of their employment (i.e. within the working environment) or whether \u201cemployes\u201d refers to the status of being an employee, which transcends any particular locus. In other words, does the term \u201cemployes\u201d refer to the status of being an employee 24 hours per day, which attaches at hiring and sheds at firing (\u201cemployee\u201d in its broadest sense), or does the term have a more limited meaning, which is intricately tied to a particular locus; here, the work environment? If the later interpretation is correct, the plain language would support finding that laws passed pursuant to Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause must address issues related to the employees\u2019 working environment as Lima argues. If the former interpretation is correct, then the plain language would support finding that laws passed pursuant to Section 34 <em>can </em>address issues beyond the employees\u2019 working environment as the state argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">{\u00b6 29} The common law already recognizes the status-conduct distinction of an employee, for example, in tort law. The doctrine of respondeat superior<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires that an employer answer for torts committed by an employee. However, it is a settled tort law rule that an employer is only liable for the torts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>committed by an employee under the doctrine if the employee commits the tort while acting within the scope of his or her duties. See, e.g., <em>Byrd v. Faber </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 56, 58, 565 N.E.2d 584. Consequently, the law recognizes that one may be an employee in status, but not by conduct. Since other areas of law draw this distinction, the scope of the term \u201cemployees\u201d in Section 34 should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 30} Since the meaning of the term \u201cemployes\u201d is not defined within the text of the Section 34, we must interpret it consistent with common usage. R.C. 1.42; <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b6 23. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cemployee\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">[\u0430] person who works in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">(8th Ed.2004) 564. The American Heritage Dictionary defines \u201cemployee\u201d as: \u201c[a] person who works for another in return for financial or other compensation.\u201d (2nd College Ed.1985) 250. Neither definition provides a definitive conclusion regarding the scope of the term \u201cemployee.\u201d Both definitions refer to the status of being an employee, but Black\u2019s Law definition also emphasizes employer control over work performance, which generally applies when an employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">{\u00b6 31} Since the common definition of \u201cemployee\u201d does not satisfactorily resolve its scope and, thus, the extent of the General Assembly\u2019s general welfare authority under Section 34, we must utilize other rules of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">B. Section 34 &amp; Noscitur a Sociis</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">[\u0431] {\u00b6 32} As the Ohio Supreme Court has noted, \u201c \u2018the natural meaning of words is not always conclusive as to the construction of statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 70, 2005-Ohio-3807, 831 N.E.2d 987, at \u00b6 40. When the meaning of a word or phrase is unclear, the statutory doctrine of noscitur a sociis instructs a reviewing court to determine its meaning by the words immediately surrounding it. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1087. See also <em>Wilson v. Stark Cty. Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 450, 453, 639 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">{\u00b6 33} The meaning of the Section 34\u2019s third clause, then, must be interpreted consistent with Section 34\u2019s first and second clauses, which, like the general-welfare clause, provide grants of legislative authority. We agree with Lima that if the general welfare clause\u2019s grant of authority is read consistent with the hours clause and the minimum wage clause, as the doctrine of noscitur a sociis instructs, then the general welfare clause grants the General Assembly authority to pass laws regulating work environment conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>{\u00b6 34} The general-welfare clause of Section 34 grants the General Assembly authority to pass laws \u201cproviding for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of all employes.\u201d As we noted above, Section 34\u2019s first clause grants the General Assembly the authority to pass laws \u201cfixing and regulating the hours of labor,\u201d and Section 34\u2019s second clause grants the General Assembly authority to pass laws \u201cestablishing a minimum wage.\u201d The hours and minimum-wage clauses address working terms and conditions within the working environment context; they do not address qualifications for employment, nor do they address issues outside of the working environment. Therefore, noscitur a sociis instructs that the general-welfare clause should, likewise, be interpreted to address working environment conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 35} Not only should we interpret the scope of the general-welfare clause in the same context as the hours and minimum-wage clauses, we should also interpret the term \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d <em>within </em>the third clause in relation to the words directly preceding and following it. Common sense dictates that the words \u201ccomfort,\u201d \u201chealth,\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d relate to working environment conditions. Moreover, these terms, like \u201cgeneral welfare,\u201d are followed by the limiting term \u201cemployees.\u201d We, should therefore interpret \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d to be a grant of legislative authority for laws affecting the employees\u2019 work environment conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 36} Thus, the doctrine of noscitur a sociis applied to the general-welfare clause as a whole and to its components supports Lima\u2019s argument that the clause grants legislative authority for the purpose of passing laws that affect the employees\u2019 working environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">C. Section 34 Legislative History<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cIf the meaning of a provision cannot be ascertained by its plain language, a court may look to the purpose of the provision to determine its meaning.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 380, 2004-Ohio-3206, 811 N.E.2d 68, at \u00b6 14, citing <em>Castleberry v. Evatt </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 30, 33 O.O. 197, 67 N.E.2d 861, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cIn determining legislative intent when faced with an ambiguous statute, the court may consider several factors [such as] circumstances under which the statute was enacted, the [objective of the statute], and the consequences of a particular construction.\u201d <em>Bailey v.

Since we have determined that the term \u201cemployees\u201d is ambiguous, and we cannot ascertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>scope of authority granted under Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause by looking at its plain language, we turn to the legislative history for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">1. Historical Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 38} The early 1900s were difficult times for American factory workers. The working environment often included long hours, low wages, and dangerous working conditions. Murlo, Priscilla A.B. Chitty, From the Folks Who Brought You the Weekend (New Press 2001) 145. See also, generally, Derks, Scott, Working Americans 1880-1999, Volume 1: The working Class (Grey House Pub.2000). Legislative efforts to remedy these woes were stifled by both state and federal courts striking down laws for violating the freedom to contract, which courts found as a substantive due process right. <em>Rocky River, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 26, 539 N.E.2d 103, fn. 31-32 (Wright, J., dissenting). One of the most infamous of this line of cases was <em>Lochner v. New York, </em>wherein the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a New York law setting a sixty-hour-per-week maximum for work in bakeries. (1905), 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 39} The Ohio Constitutional delegates were aware of both factory working conditions and the legal climate when Section 34 was passed. Several delegates recognized the working conditions at factories. Mr. Farrell commented at length about the intolerable working conditions in American factories when debating Section 34\u2019s minimum-wage language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">But, gentleman of the Convention, I have been compelled to change my position on th[e] question [of minimum wage] in the last few years. When one considers the relentless war that has been waged against the trade union movement in this country, and the war of extermination that is now going on, and, in some instances, meeting with success, in putting some unions out of business, and the general application of \u201cblack list,\u201d all for no other reason than the piling up of capitalistic profits without any regard for justice in the premises, when we see the attempts making to build up industries on the foundations of <em>wages too low to admit of decent standards of family life, and hours of labor too long to admit of sufficient rest and relaxation for even moderate health, we are driven to the knowledge that it is time that a decent humane effort should be made to remedy this un-American condition.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">(Emphasis added). 2 Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Ohio (1912) 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">{\u00b6 40} The delegates were also aware of the courts\u2019 hostile attitude toward progressive labor reform. Mr. Lampson asked Section 34\u2019s reporting committee, \u201cDid you investigate the question as to whether that provision in the constitution relating to the passage of laws violating the obligation of contract has any bearing on this proposal?\u201d Id. at 1335. In response, Mr. Dwyer answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The courts have been deciding cases. Take that bake-shop case in New York [i.e. <em>Lochner </em>]. The supreme court there decided it was a question of private contract about the hours of labor. Our courts are becoming more progressive. They are catching the spirit of the time and we should put a clause in the constitution that will give the courts an opportunity to more liberally construe these matters than they have done in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Id. Thus, it is evident from Section 34\u2019s debates that the constitutional delegates were well aware of both the working conditions in American factories and the legal climate with respect to labor reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">2. Section 34\u2019s Objective</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 41} On January 24, 1912, what is now Section 34 was introduced to the Ohio Constitutional Convention by Mr. Farrell, a delegate from Cuyahoga County, as Proposal No. 122, entitled \u201cRelative to employment of women, children and persons engaged in hazardous employment.\u201d 1 Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Ohio (1912) 106. On January 25, 1912, Proposal No. 122 was sent to the committee on labor. Id. at 118. On March 19, 1912, Proposal No. 122 was reported to the convention with an amendment to insert</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">Laws may be passed fixing and regulating the hours of labor, establishing a minimum wage and providing for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employes; and no other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Id. at 755. The report was agreed to and the language amended. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">{\u00b6 42} On April 22, 1912, Proposal No. 122 was brought before the convention and read a second time, whereupon some debate was heard. 2 Proceedings and Debates, supra, at 1328. Mr. Farrell began his remarks noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-11\">Since this proposal has been on the calendar I have heard some little objection to it, <em>especially with reference to </em>the clause which would permit the legislature to pass minimum wage legislation, and to that clause I intend to direct my remarks exclusively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">(Emphasis added). Id. On the other hand, Mr. Crites began his remarks noting that: \u201c[f]irst, you will note that this proposal is for the <em>sole purpose </em>of limiting the number of hours of labor; second, to establish a minimum wage for the wageworker.\u201d Id. at 1331. (Emphasis added). During his remarks in support of the proposal, Mr. Dwyer commented that employers ought to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbU\">give your employees fair living wages, good sanitary surroundings <em>during hours of labor, </em>protection as far as possible against danger, a fair working day. Make bis life as pleasant for him as you can consistent with his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>(Emphasis added). Id. at 1332. Mr. Elson commented, \u201cIt seems to me that the kernel of this proposal is a minimum wage.\u201d Id. at 1336. On the other hand, Mr. Harris offered his support for Proposal No. 122, except the minimum-wage language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">I am very anxious to support the remainder of the proposal, and if the authors will strike the words \u201cminimum wage,\u201d the proposal will receive not only the united support of this Convention but of the people of Ohio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Id. at 1337. Following this debate, the question was called and the proposal passed for the first time with eighty yeas and thirteen nays. Id. at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">{\u00b6 43} On May 22, 1912, Proposal No. 122 was reported from the committee on Arrangement and Phraseology with an amendment to \u201c[s]trike out the title and insert: \u2018To submit an amendment by adding section 34, Article II of the constitution. \u2014 Welfare of employes\u2019\u201d and make other grammatical corrections. Id. at 1742.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">{\u00b6 44} On May 23, 1912, Proposal No. 122 was read for the third time whereupon Mr. Harris offered an amendment to strike the words \u201cminimum wage.\u201d Id. at 1784. Debate on the amendment proceeded, but, ultimately, the amendment was tabled and the proposal passed for the second time with 96 yeas and five nays. Id. at 1786. Proposal No. 122\u2019s language at that time read the same as Section 34 now reads. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">{\u00b6 45} On May 31, 1912, Proposal No. 122 was reported from the committee on Arrangement and Phraseology without amendment and passed a third and final time<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with 87 yeas and eight nays. Id. at 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">{\u00b6 46} Reviewing the constitutional debates in light of the historical context preceding Proposal No. 122 (now Section 34), it is obvious that its purpose was to empower the General Assembly with legislative authority over (1) the hours of labor, (2) a minimum wage, and (3) working environment. Although the debates surrounding Proposal No. 122 focused on its minimum wage provision, it is clear from our own review of the debates that the minimum wage provision was not Section 34\u2019s only subject. See also <em>Rocky River, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 14-16, 539 N.E.2d 103. Mr. Dwyer and Mr. Harris\u2019s remarks demonstrate that Proposal No. 122\u2019s supporting delegates were also concerned with working environment conditions within Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 9.481 does not fall within Section 34\u2019s original intent as evidenced by the historical context and the Convention proceedings. Rather, R.C. 9.481 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>attempts to regulate aspects of employment having nothing to do with the working environment \u2014 namely, where an employee resides after leaving work.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">3. Interpretative Consequences</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">{\u00b6 48} We must also consider the affect of interpreting Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause beyond the working environment. <em>Bailey, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 40, 741 N.E.2d 121, citing R.C. 1.49; <em>Jordan, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 492, 733 N.E.2d 601. If the general-welfare clause extends to issues outside the working environment, then what topic affecting employees would ever exceed its scope?</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">{\u00b6 49} Consider, for example, a law that would require employers to provide paid transportation to and from the workplace. Although the law does not concern the hours of labor or a minimum wage, it certainly affects the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d of employees. With soaring gas prices, congested traffic, and never-ceasing road construction, such a law would bring peace of mind to many employees across the state. If we agree with the state\u2019s interpretation of the general-welfare clause (i.e., beyond the working environment) this proposed law must also prevail. Like R.C. 9.481, the law would affect employees if we simply mean employees in status, as discussed above in Section IV A, but it would not affect employees within the scope of their employment. We simply cannot agree that Proposal No. 122\u2019s supporting delegates intended its language to extend beyond the working environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">D. Section 34 Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">{\u00b6 50} The state argues that case law supports a broad interpretation of the General Assembly\u2019s authority under Section 34. The state further argues that the cases relied upon by Lima for its argument that Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause is limited to issues directly related to the working environment expressly contradict this narrow interpretation. We agree, in part, and disagree, in part, with the state\u2019s interpretation of Section 34 general-welfare case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">{\u00b6 51} We agree with the state that Section 34 is a broad grant of legislative authority. <em>Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors v. Cent. State Univ. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 55, 61, 717 N.E.2d 286 (\u201cThis court has repeatedly interpreted Section 34, Article II as a broad <em>grant </em>of authority to the General Assembly, not as a limitation on its power to enact legislation\u201d); <em>Rocky River, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 13, 539 N.E.2d 103 (Section 34 \u201cconstitutes a broad grant of authority to the legislature to provide for the welfare of all working persons, including local safety forces,\u201d citing <em>State ex rel. Bd. of Trustees of Police Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund v. Bd. of Trustees of Police Relief &amp; Pension Fund of Martins Ferry </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St.2d 105, 41 O.O.2d 410, 233 N.E.2d 135). However, the fact that the legislative grant of power is broad does not mean that the power exceeds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>amendment\u2019s language or original intent; therefore, a further analysis is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">{\u00b6 52} An example of an appropriate analysis is found in <em>Cent. State, </em>supra. In that case, the American Association of University Professors (\u201cAAUP\u201d) challenged R.C. 3345.45, which required a mandatory ten percent increase in faculty classroom instruction at state universities. 87 Ohio St.3d at 56, 717 N.E.2d 286. In addition to its equal-protection claims, AAUP argued that R.C. 3345.45 was outside the General Assembly\u2019s authority under Section 34. Id. at 60, 717 N.E.2d 286. AAUP argued that only laws <em>benefiting </em>employees could be passed pursuant to Section 34, and since R.C. 3345.45 <em>burdened </em>employees by increasing work hours, it was invalid. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">(\u00b6 53} The Ohio Supreme Court first noted that Section 34 powers are broad, as pointed out by the state. Id. at 61, 717 N.E.2d 286. However, the analysis did not stop there; instead, the court then went back to Section 34\u2019s plain language and reasoned that, in effect, AAUP was adding limiting language that did not exist in Section 34:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">AAUP\u2019s position would require Section 34 to be read as a limitation, in effect stating: \u201cNo law shall be passed on the subject of employee working conditions <em>unless it furthers </em>the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Id. Beyond the plain language analysis, the court also examined the practical effect of AAUP\u2019s interpretation and found that it was problematic in the context of many existing laws other than R.C. 3345.45. Id. Therefore, the state\u2019s emphasis on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 34 powers as \u201cbroad,\u201d although relevant, is not dispositive to the issue raised in this case; a further analysis is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">{\u00b6 54} To begin with, we disagree with the state that <em>Pension Fund </em>or <em>Rocky River </em>\u201cexpressly contradict\u201d Lima\u2019s argument that Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause is limited to the working environment. On the contrary, these cases, read in their totality with an understanding of the laws at issue therein, lend support to Lima\u2019s argument that Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause is more limited in scope than the state alleges. Furthermore, consistent with the amendment\u2019s primary concern, Section 34 general-welfare case law is limited to employee economic welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">{\u00b6 55} In <em>Pension Fund, </em>the municipality challenged several sections of R.C. Chapter 742 and specifically R.C. 742.26, which required that municipalities transfer their firefighter and police pension and relief fund assets into a state-controlled disability and pension fund. 12 Ohio St.2d at 106, 41 O.O.2d 410, 233 N.E.2d 135. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld R.C. 742.26 apparently under Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>{\u00b6 56} The state of Ohio argues that pensions and disability benefits, the subject of <em>Pension Fund, </em>are not directly related to the work environment; and therefore, the General Assembly\u2019s Section 34 general-welfare authority extends beyond the work environment. The state reasons that pensions are received after retirement; and therefore, R.C. Chapter 742 is not related to the employee\u2019s working environment. Although pensions are received after retirement and, therefore, the effects of R.C Chapter 742 are realized after the employee is no longer in the working environment, R.C. Chapter 742 pension and disability benefits are calculated based on an employee\u2019s wages and years of service. R.C. 742.3716 and 742.39; Ohio Adm.Code 742-3-02. Consequently, R.C. Chapter 742 pension and disability benefits, upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court, are related to the working environment, since they are calculated with respect to time and wages earned in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">{\u00b6 57} Furthermore, pensions and disability benefits are nothing more than additional wages and compensation.- Section 34\u2019s minimum-wage clause was enacted to give the state the authority to establish a wage foundation, but certainly the state is free to go beyond that foundation. The state, as employer, is also able to contract with its employees regarding wages and compensation, and does so regularly. Nothing in Section 34 was meant to limit this preexisting state power.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Act, R.C. Chapter 4117, which provided for binding arbitration, addressed the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d of employees; and therefore, was a valid exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s Section 34 powers. 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 539 N.E.2d 103. Like <em>Pension Fund, </em>R.C. Chapter 4117\u2019s legislative end was related to the work environment and the worker as an \u201cemployee\u201d working within the scope of his or her duties. The purpose of a collective bargaining agreement is to provide for agreed-upon wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment, and the binding arbitration provided by R.C. Chapter 4117 was enacted to reach such an agreement. R.C. 4117.10. Wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment impact the worker in the work place.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">{\u00b6 59} Contrary to the state\u2019s arguments, both <em>Pension Fund </em>and <em>Rocky River </em>do suggest that laws enacted pursuant to Section 34\u2019s general-welfare language must have, at minimum, <em>some </em>nexus between their legislative end and the working environment. R.C. 9.481, unlike the laws in <em>Pension Fund </em>and <em>Rocky River, </em>lacks any nexus between its legislative end and the working environment. Rather, R.C. 9.481 attempts to regulate where an employee may reside <em>outside </em>of the work place.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>{\u00b6 60} More important, like <em>Rocky River </em>and <em>Pension Fund, </em>other cases interpreting Section 34\u2019s general-welfare language are limited to legislation providing for the economic welfare of employees. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Mun. Const. Equip. Operator\u2019s Labor Council v. Cleveland, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 183, 2007-Ohio-3831, 870 N.E.2d 1174 (sick-leave benefits); <em>State ex rel. Horvath v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 67, 697 N.E.2d 644 (teacher\u2019s savings plans); <em>Cincinnati v. Ohio Council 8, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty., &amp; Mun. Emp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 658, 576 N.E.2d 745 (collective bargaining). In fact, Justice Cook has noted that \u201c[ejconomic legislation related to the welfare of employees, including pension funds for public employees, is granted favored status under Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Horvath, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 74, 697 N.E.2d 644, fn. 2. One of the main purposes behind Section 34 was to address the economic welfare of employees who were earning meager wages during the 1900\u2019s. Consistent with Section 34\u2019s genesis, the Ohio Supreme Court has limited the scope of Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause to economic legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">{\u00b6 61} R.C. 9.481, unlike the laws upheld under Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause, is not economic legislation. Consequently, upholding R.C. 9.481 under Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause would expand its scope beyond that recognized by the Ohio Supreme Court; and this, we decline to do. Furthermore, if the laws passed under Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause do not have <em>some </em>nexus between their legislative end and the working environment, we see no boundary to the state\u2019s power over the employee and employer. We cannot agree that the 1912 Constitutional delegates intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">E. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">{\u00b6 62} First, we determined that Section 34\u2019s plain language provides that laws may be passed providing for the \u201cgeneral welfare of all employes.\u201d Second, since the plain meaning of the term \u201cemployes\u201d can be more limited than simply signifying a status and is, therefore, ambiguous, we applied the statutory doctrine of noscitur a sociis and determined that the general-welfare clause should be limited to the working environment. Third, we analyzed the legislative history, including the historical context in which Section 34 was passed and the debates, and again determined that Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause should be limited to the working environment. Fourth and finally, we analyzed Section 34 general welfare case law and determined that although Section 34 general-welfare powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>are broad, they are broad within the context of the working environment. Further, we noted that cases interpreting Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause are limited to laws affecting employee economic welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">{\u00b6 63} For all these reasons, we conclude that laws enacted pursuant to Section 34\u2019s general-welfare clause must, at minimum, have <em>some </em>nexus between their legislative end and the working environment. Since R.C. 9.481 lacks any nexus between its legislative end \u2014 restricting political subdivisions from requiring residency as condition of employment \u2014 and the working environment, we hold that R.C. 9.481 was not validly enacted pursuant to Article II, Section 34 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">{\u00b6 64} Lima\u2019s assignment of error two is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Assignment of Error No. I</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The trial court erred in finding R.C. 9.481 is a general law of statewide concern</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">{\u00b6 65} Lima\u2019s second assignment of error having been sustained, Lima\u2019s first assignment of error is now relevant and dispositive to this case. In its first assignment of error, Lima argues that the trial court incorrectly determined that R.C. 9.481 is constitutional pursuant to the doctrine of statewide concern. Lima contends that the trial court did not apply the doctrine of statewide concern within the context of the <em>Canton </em>test. Under a proper formulation of the <em>Canton </em>test, argues Lima, R.C.. 9.481 is not a \u201cgeneral law\u201d; and therefore, does not supersede Lima\u2019s home-rule authority. In addition, Lima argues that its residency requirement is a matter of local self-government; and therefore, prevails under the <em>Canton </em>test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">{\u00b6 66} The state argues that regulation of residency requirements has transformed into a matter of statewide concern due to the extraterritorial effects that such requirements have on other communities. Further, the state argues that since Lima enacted its residency pursuant to its local self-government power and not its police power, the <em>Canton </em>test does not apply. We disagree with the state\u2019s interpretation of the applicable case law and therefore find that the state\u2019s arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">{\u00b6 67} First, the state\u2019s argument that <em>Canton </em>does not apply when a municipality acts pursuant to its local self-government power is correct, but it certainly does not mean that the state prevails.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>The first step in a home-rule analysis is to determine \u201cwhether the matter in question involves an exercise of local self-government or an exercise of local police power.\u201d If an allegedly conflicting city ordinance relates solely to self-government, the analysis stops, because the Constitution authorizes a municipality to exercise all powers of local self-government within its jurisdiction. On the other hand, if, as is more likely, the ordinance pertains to concurrent police power rather than the right to self-government, the ordinance that is in conflict must yield in the face of a general state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">(Citations omitted.) <em>Am.

On the contrary, if Lima enacted its residency requirement pursuant to its local self-government power, the \u201canalysis stops, because the Constitution authorizes a municipality to exercise all powers of local self-government within its jurisdiction,\u201d and Lima prevails. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">{\u00b6 68} This result is also supported from the fact that the <em>Canton </em>three-prong preemption test was developed in order to determine whether a municipal ordinance must yield to the provisions of a state statute. <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, \u00b6 9; <em>Ohio Assn. of Private Detective Agencies, Inc. v. N. Olmsted, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 242, 244, 602 N.E.2d 1147. <em>Canton </em>prong two requires that: \u201cthe ordinance is an exercise of the police power, rather than local self-government.\u201d Therefore, if (1) the <em>Canton </em>test determines whether a municipal ordinance must yield to the provisions of a state statute, (2) <em>Canton </em>prong two requires that Lima enacted its residency requirement pursuant to the police power, and (3) Lima enacted its residency requirement as an act of local self-government as the state argues, then Lima\u2019s ordinance need not yield to R.C. 9.481.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">{\u00b6 69} Second, the state is appealing to the doctrine of statewide concern as an independent ground for preemption. That argument, however, was rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Am. Fin. Servs., </em>supra. The Ohio Supreme Court explained, \u201cWe recognize, however, that the application of \u2018statewide concern\u2019 as a separate doctrine has caused confusion, because some courts have considered the doctrine a separate ground upon which the state may regulate.\u201d 112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, at \u00b6 29, citing <em>Dayton, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 736, 2004-Ohio-3141, 813 N.E.2d 707, \u00b6 32-76. The court in <em>Am. Fin. Servs. </em>clarified that the statewide-concern doctrine is <em>part of </em>the <em>Canton </em>three-prong preemption test and used to determine whether \u201cthe ordinance is an exercise of the police power, rather than local self-government\u201d <em>(Canton </em>prong two). <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>{\u00b6 70} Since we do not believe that the state intended to admit that <em>Canton </em>prong two is lacking, we will proceed with the <em>Canton </em>analysis, beginning with Lima\u2019s first argument that R.C. 9.481 is not a \u201cgeneral law\u201d as required by <em>Canton </em>prong three. If <em>Canton </em>prong three is met, we must determine whether <em>Canton </em>prong two is met; however, if prong three is not met, then the <em>Canton </em>test fails and the inquiry is over.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">{\u00b6 71} Prong three of <em>Canton\u2019s </em>preemption test requires that the state statute be a \u201cgeneral law.\u201d 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 9. Whether the state statute is a general law is, itself, determined by a separate four-prong test. Id. at \u00b6 21. To be a general law under prong three of <em>Canton\u2019s </em>preemption test, the statute must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">(l)be part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment, (2) apply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly throughout the state, (3) set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, and (4) prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Id. Lima argues that R.C. 9.481 does not meet prongs three and four of the <em>Canton </em>general-law test. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">A. Police, Sanitary, or Similar Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">{\u00b6 72} The court in <em>Canton </em>explained that \u201cgeneral laws\u201d within Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution means \u201cstatutes setting forth police, sanitary or similar regulations and not statutes which purport only to grant or to limit the legislative powers of a municipal corporation to adopt or enforce police, sanitary or other similar regulations.\u201d 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 31, citing <em>W. Jefferson v. Robinson, </em>1 Ohio St.2d 113, 30 O.O.2d 474, 205 N.E.2d 382, at paragraph three of the syllabus. R.C. 9.481 provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in division (B)(2) of this section, no political subdivision shall require any of its employees, as a condition of employment, to reside in any specific area of the state.\u201d Thus, on its face, R.C. 9.481 clearly purports \u201cto limit the legislative powers of a municipal corporation to adopt or enforce police, sanitary or other similar regulations.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">{\u00b6 73} However, in <em>Canton </em>the court determined that paragraph three of <em>Robinson, </em>supra, really meant \u201cthat a statute which prohibits the exercise by a municipality of its home rule powers <em>without such statute serving an overriding statewide interest </em>would directly contravene the constitutional grant of municipal power.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., citing <em>Clermont Environmental Reclamation Co. v. Wiederhold </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 44, 48, 2 OBR 587, 442 N.E.2d 1278. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the critical inquiry in this case is whether allowing political subdivision employees to reside in any part of the state is an \u201coverriding state interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">{\u00b6 74} The court in <em>Canton </em>did not explain what it meant by \u201coverriding state interest,\u201d nor did it definitely conclude that the law at issue in that case was one such \u201coverriding state interest.\u201d Rather, the court in <em>Canton </em>merely concluded that \u201cR.C. 3781.184(C), on its face, <em>appears </em>to serve an overriding state interest in providing more affordable housing options across the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 33. The court in <em>Clermont, </em>on the other hand, concluded that the issue of \u201cwhether there will be safe and properly operated hazardous waste disposal facilities within this state to receive the potentially dangerous wastes from Ohio industry and, by so doing, prevent such wastes from fouling our water and countryside\u201d was an overriding state interest. 2 Ohio St.3d at 49, 2 OBR 587, 442 N.E.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">{\u00b6 75} Even if there may be a state interest at stake in this case, it is not an \u201coverriding\u201d one. When passing R.C. 9.481, the General Assembly declared its intent to recognize \u201c[t]he inalienable and fundamental right of an individual to choose where to live pursuant to Section 1 of Article I, Ohio Constitution.\u201d Sub.S.B. No. 82, 2. However, \u201c[interpretation of the state and federal Constitutions is a role exclusive to the judicial branch.\u201d <em>Beagle v. Walden </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 59, 62, 676 N.E.2d 506. Although the citizens of Ohio may have a right to determine where they live under Article 1, Section 1, citizens do not have a right to live where they want <em>and </em>demand employment with a particular employer. See <em>Smeltzer v. Smeltzer </em>(Nov. 24, 1993), 7th Dist. No. 92-C-50, 1993 WL 488235, at *1, citing <em>Allison v. Akron </em>(1974), 45 Ohio App.2d 227, 343 N.E.2d 128; <em>Cutshall v. Sundquist </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 193 F.3d 466, 479; <em>Morgan v. Cianciola </em>(Dec. 28,1987) 7th Dist. No. 87 C.A. 130, 1987 WL 31935, at *1 (\u201cThe constitution does not guarantee the right to hold a specific job with a particular employer, but, rather, the right \u2018to follow a chosen trade or occupation, and to earn a livelihood for oneself * * *\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">{\u00b6 76} Certainly the preservation of a constitutional right would be an \u201coverriding state interest\u201d on the same scale as the state\u2019s interest in protecting the water supply from hazardous waste. However, there is no constitutional right to choose where one lives and, at the same time, demand employment from an unwilling employer. So, the state\u2019s interest in prohibiting political subdivisions from passing residency restrictions is not an \u201coverriding\u201d one, like the state\u2019s interest was in <em>Clermont, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">{\u00b6 77} On the other hand, Lima\u2019s interest in establishing residency as a qualification of employment is substantial. The mayor of Lima gave several important reasons for the residency requirement; specifically, that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>(1) promotes the City\u2019s interest in the employment of individuals who are highly committed to the betterment of the City where they both live and work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">(2) enhances the quality of work performance by employing individuals who are knowledgeable about and aware of issues and conditions in the City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">(3) promotes the employment of individuals with a greater empathy for the real and long term concerns and problems of the people of Lima;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">(4) promotes the development and maintenance of a workforce with a greater personal stake in working to ensure the City of Lima\u2019s improvement and progress over the long term;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">(5) promotes the availability of resident employees who are easily available for emergency situations and who can respond promptly if on-call for certain duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">(6) promotes the ability of the City to maintain a workforce that reflects the racial and ethnic diversity of its population and its absence would undermine those efforts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-10\">(7) produces economic 'benefits that flow to a city from having resident employees which are of a particular importance in an economically depressed city such as Lima;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-11\">(8) promotes the value of real estate in the City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-12\">(9) promotes the development and maintenance of strong neighborhoods anchored by stable, wage-earning City employees and their families; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-13\">(10) promotes numerous other benefits to the City of Lima and helps avoid other harms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">(Mayor of Lima Affidavit at 8). In addition to these reasons, the qualification, duties, and selection of municipal officers has traditionally been within a municipality\u2019s home-rule authority. <em>State ex rel. Lentz, v.

Lima has a similar interest in the qualifications of its other employees as well, and exercising legislative authority in furtherance of this interest should be within the home-rule authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">{\u00b6 78} Even if the state had an \u201coverriding\u201d interest in this case, R.C. 9.481 has several exceptions similar to the law in <em>Canton, </em>which defeats the state\u2019s proposed interest. The court in <em>Canton </em>recognized that the state\u2019s proposed interest in passing R.C. 3781.184(C) was to provide affordable housing options across the state; however, the law had an exception for restrictive covenants in private deeds. 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 33, citing R.C. 3781.184(D). The court in <em>Canton </em>found that this exception actually defeated the state\u2019s purpose; and therefore, the law failed to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations and only served to limit the legislative authority of municipalities. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">{\u00b6 79} The General Assembly\u2019s purpose in passing R.C. 9.481 was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3o\">to generally allow the employees of Ohio\u2019s political subdivisions to choose where to live, and that it is necessary to generally prohibit political subdivisions from requiring their employees, as a condition of employment, to reside in any specific area of the state in order to provide for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of those public employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Sub.S.B. No. 82, Section 3. First, R.C. 9.481, like R.C. 3781.184(C), on its face exempts private parties and the state, itself. R.C. 9.481(C). Second, like R.C. 3781.184(C), R.C. 9.481 has two further exemptions for \u201cvolunteers\u201d and for employees required to respond to \u201cemergencies\u201d or \u201cdisasters.\u201d R.C. 9.481(B)(2)(a) and (B)(2)(b). Thus, R.C. 9.481 has exemptions that defeat its purpose of generally prohibiting residency restrictions and, like the law at issue in <em>Canton, </em>fails to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">{\u00b6 80} We, therefore, find that R.C. 9.481 does not set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations but merely limits the municipality\u2019s power to do the same, and prohibiting political subdivisions from requiring residency as a condition of employment is not an overriding state interest sufficient to meet prong three of Canton\u2019s general-law test.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">B.

The court in <em>Canton </em>explained that a general law \u201c \u2018is [not] a limitation upon law making by municipal legislative bodies\u2019 \u201d and has \u201c \u2018no special relation to any of the political subdivisions of the state.\u2019 \u201d 95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 34, 38, citing <em>Youngstown v.

R.C. 9.481\u2019s plain language states: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in division (B)(2) of this section, no political subdivision shall require any of its employees, as a condition of employment, to reside in any specific area of the state.\u201d R.C. 9.481 is, on its face, a limitation of local legislative power and applies only to political subdivisions. As such, it fails prong four of Canton\u2019s general-law test.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">C. Conclusion of <em>Canton\u2019s </em>General-Law and Preemption Tests</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">{\u00b6 84} R.C. 9.481 fails prongs three and four of <em>Canton\u2019s </em>general-law test; therefore, R.C. 9.481 does not preempt Lima Ordinance No. 201-00 since it fails <em>Canton\u2019s </em>three-part preemption test. 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 9, 21. Because we have determined that R.C. 9.481 fails prong three of <em>Canton\u2019s </em>preemption test and all three prongs must be met, we need not consider the parties\u2019 arguments on whether R.C. 9.481 also fails prong two of <em>Canton\u2019s </em>preemption test. Id., at \u00b6 9. Since R.C. 9.481 fails <em>Canton\u2019s </em>preemption test, it violates Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. Id., 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">{\u00b6 85} Lima\u2019s second assignment of error is, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Assignment of Error No. Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The trial court erred in not finding R.C. 9.481 violates Article II, Section 26 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">{\u00b6 86} In its third assignment of error, Lima argues that the trial court erred in not finding that R.C. 9.481 violates Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution (the Uniformity Clause). Since we have decided that R.C. 9.481 violates Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, we need not decide whether it also violates the Uniformity Clause. <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 39; <em>Linndale, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 55, 706 N.E.2d 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">{\u00b6 87} A few closing remarks are appropriate before we conclude. We understand that residency requirements have a real impact on Ohio citizens and are often felt most by working families. Were we members of the Ohio legislature, our decision might be different than that required of us today. We, however, are judicial officers and have taken an oath to uphold the Ohio Constitution and the laws of this state \u2014 and to that oath we hope to be found faithful by those who have so entrusted us. Thus constrained, we summarize our conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">{\u00b6 88} R.C. 9.481 was not validly enacted pursuant to Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, because Section 34\u2019s language, legislative history, and case law support finding that laws providing for the \u201cgeneral welfare of all employes\u201d must have, at minimum, some nexus between their legislative end and the working environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">{\u00b6 89} R.C. 9.481 is not a general law under <em>Canton </em>that would preempt Lima Ordinance No. 201-00; therefore, R.C. 9.481 violates Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. Lima Ordinance No. 201-00 is a valid exercise of local self-government pursuant to Section 3, Article XWIII of the Ohio Constitution and prevails, R.C. 9.481 notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">{\u00b6 90} Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b808-12\">Rogers, P.J., and Willamowski, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-13\">. Amicus curiae, Local 334 of the International Association of Fire Fighters, has also submitted a brief in support of the state of Ohio in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">. \"Respondeat superior\u201d is defined as \"The doctrine holding an employer or principal liable for the employee's or agent's wrongful acts committed within the scope of the employment or agency.\u201d Black's Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1338.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-9\">. Much of the information herein was explained by the court in <em>Rocky River; </em>however, a fresh look at the legislative history is prudent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-14\">. Proposal No. 122 was passed three times, twice for committee report changes/amendments and one final time with all the amendments incorporated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">. That is not to say that Section 34's <em>only </em>purpose was to address economic concerns or only minimum wages. As we have explained, the plain language of Section 34 also provides for (1) hours of labor, (2) minimum wages, (3) health, (4) comfort, and (5) safety. See <em>Rocky River, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 14-16, 539 N.E.2d 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\">. Both the state and Lima concede that <em>Canton </em>prong one is met. The disagreement is whether prongs two and three are met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b801-13\">. In fact, Lima is arguing that its residency requirement was passed pursuant to its local self-government power and therefore <em>Canton </em>prong two fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
