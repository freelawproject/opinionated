Thomas, appeals from an entry of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, granting directed verdict to defendant-appellee, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company on her claim of underinsured-motorist coverage (\u201cUIM\u201d). For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>{\u00b6 2} This is the second time Thomas has filed an appeal in this case. See <em>Thomas v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 86579, 2006-Ohio-4487, 2006 WL 2507570 <em>(\u201cThomas I </em>\u201d). The procedural and factual background, as set forth below, remain the same. See id. at \u00b6 2-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">{\u00b6 3} In December 1998, Thomas was involved in a motor vehicle accident where she was rear-ended by the tortfeasor, Chris Romanin. Romanin was 16 at the time of the accident and insured under his father\u2019s insurance policy with State Farm Insurance Company. Thomas was insured by Nationwide and had an automobile policy carrying $300,000 of UIM coverage. After settling with the tortfeasor for his insurance policy limits of $100,000, Thomas presented a UIM claim to Nationwide, which it denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 4} On December 23, 2002, Thomas filed her complaint against Nationwide for (1) breach of contract, (2) fraud, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, (4) bad faith, and (5) declaratory judgment to establish whether she was entitled to UIM coverage under the terms of her insurance policy. Nationwide answered the complaint and denied all of Thomas\u2019s allegations relative to the coverage issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 5} On May 12, 2003, the trial court granted Nationwide\u2019s motion to bifurcate the proceedings. The trial court stayed Thomas\u2019s tort claims, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, and all her claims for compensatory damages, and ordered that discovery in the case was \u201cto proceed on the issue of coverage\u201d alone. Just before trial, the trial court further bifurcated and stayed Thomas\u2019s claims for bad faith and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 6} Also before trial, both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the coverage question. The trial court denied both motions because \u201c[wjhether plaintiff can rebut the presumption of prejudice that was created when the subrogation issues of the defendant were destroyed is a material issue of fact to be determined by the finder of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 7} In May 2005, the case proceeded to a jury trial on Thomas\u2019s claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment. The sole issue at trial was whether Thomas was entitled to UIM coverage under her policy. Nationwide claimed that Thomas was not entitled to coverage because she failed to abide by the express terms of her insurance policy. According to Nationwide, Thomas destroyed Nationwide\u2019s subrogation rights when she failed to provide proper notice that she settled with and released the tortfeasor and did not first obtain Nationwide\u2019s consent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 8} Following Thomas\u2019s case-in-chief, Nationwide moved for a directed verdict, which the trial court granted on June 1, 2005. In granting Nationwide\u2019s motion for directed verdict, the trial court provided the following judgment entry:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cAfter reviewing current Ohio law with respect to notice and prejudice regarding subrogation rights in [UIM] claims motion of [Nationwide] for directed verdict having been timely and properly made, and the court having construed the evidence most strongly in favor of [Thomas], finding that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion and conclusion is adverse to [Thomas], the motion is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court denied Thomas\u2019s request for a written opinion explaining its order. Thomas appealed and presented four assignments of error for <em>review </em>\u2014 the <em>exact assignments of error that she raises in the instant appeal:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[1] The trial court committed reversible error in denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment where there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and appellant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[2] The trial court committed reversible error in granting appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict where, after construing the evidence most strongly in appellant\u2019s favor, reasonable minds could conclude that: appellant did not materially breach the insurance contract; even if there had been a material breach, appellee waived any such breach; and that appellee either suffered no prejudice or was responsible for any act or omission that resulted in any prejudice that it may have sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[3] The trial court committed reversible error in failing to construe the parties\u2019 insurance contract and define the parties\u2019 respective rights and duties, including express determinations that appellant did not breach any provisions of the policy relating to notice or written consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[4] The trial court committed reversible error in bifurcating the trial of this matter, curtailing appellant\u2019s discovery and limiting appellant\u2019s evidentiary presentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Thomas I, </em>we only addressed Thomas\u2019s third assignment of error\u2014 that the trial court erred when it failed to state the basis for granting the motion for directed verdict \u2014 because we found it to be dispositive. 2006-Ohio-4487, at \u00b6 6. We then dismissed the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order. We determined that the trial court\u2019s judgment granting directed verdict to Nationwide was not a final, appealable order because it did not declare the rights of the parties and was too vague to satisfy Civ.R. 50. Id. at \u00b6 10-11 and 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">{\u00b6 16} Upon remand <em>(Thomas I </em>was released on August 31, 2006), and upon Thomas\u2019s motion to vacate or, in the alternative, to journalize a final, appealable order, the trial court issued the following order on October 24, 2006:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cPlaintiffs motion to vacate judgment or in the alternative to journalize a final appealable order, filed 09/27/2006, is granted in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe court hereby modifies its prior order * * * filed on 06/01/05 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cUpon [Nationwide\u2019s] motion for directed verdict which was timely and properly made, and having construed the evidence most strongly in favor of [Thomas], the court finds that:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">(\u00b6 20} \u201c[Thomas] failed to comply with the express terms of her insurance policy requiring proper notice to the insurer of settlement of her personal injury claims and release of the tortfeasor, resulting in a determination of prejudice to the insurer pursuant to <em>Ferrando v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 186, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cFinding that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, the court orders that [Thomas] is not entitled to [UIM] coverage under her policy. [Nationwide\u2019s] motion for directed verdict is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 22} It is from this judgment that Thomas now appeals, raising the same four assignments of error that she did in her first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 23} Before we get to the merits of this appeal, we note that the trial court\u2019s judgment up <em>on remand, </em>essentially adding one sentence to its entry granting directed verdict in favor of Nationwide, is marginal as to whether it adequately declares the \u201crights and obligations\u201d of the parties under the insurance contract in order to be a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Am. Family Ins. Co. v. Johnson, </em>8th Dist. No. 90062, 2008-Ohio-2181, <em>2008 WL </em>1974137, this court recently found that the trial court\u2019s revised judgment entry upon remand was still not a final, appealable order. Id. at \u00b6 12. In the first appeal of that case, we had dismissed for lack of a final, appealable order after determining that the trial court did not adequately declare the rights and obligations of the parties under the contract. We emphasized that the trial court \u201cdid not even mention the insurance contract, let alone construe the policy at issue.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">{\u00b6 25} Upon remand, the trial court in <em>Am. Family </em>\u201creissued the same findings of facts and conclusions of law, but added one sentence to its judgment.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11. The trial court\u2019s one sentence simply stated that American Family \u201chas the duty to pay for any and all damages as a result of the fire.\u201d Id. In dismissing the case again for want of a final, appealable order, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s one sentence still did not declare the rights of the parties. Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">{\u00b6 26} Here, however, the trial court\u2019s revised entry, while marginal, did at least address the contract and determine that Thomas \u201cfailed to comply with the express terms of her insurance policy requiring proper notice to the insurer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>settlement * * * and release of the tortfeasor.\u201d The trial court also made a determination that Thomas\u2019s breach resulted in prejudice to Nationwide. While this finding is certainly not \u201ctextbook,\u201d it is adequate for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">{\u00b6 27} Moreover, the accident in this case took place almost ten years ago. Thomas filed her complaint for declaratory action nearly six years ago. A jury trial was held in May 2005, over three years ago. Thus, the facts in this ease compel us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s entry, while a close call, did adequately declare the \u201crights and obligations\u201d of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT AFTER TRIAL ON MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 28} In her first assignment of error, Thomas claims that the trial court erred when it denied her motion for summary judgment. Relying on <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Whittington </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 150, 642 N.E.2d 615, Nationwide contends that Thomas cannot appeal the denial of her summary motion \u201cat this stage of the litigation\u201d because there was a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>Balson v. Dodds </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 287, 16 O.O.3d 329, 405 N.E.2d 293, paragraph one of the syllabus, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for summary judgment is reviewable on appeal by the movant from a subsequent adverse judgment.\u201d In <em>Whittington, </em>however, the Supreme Court held that \u201cany error by a trial court in denying a motion for summary judgment is rendered moot or harmless if a subsequent trial on the same issues raised in the motion demonstrates that there were genuine issues of material fact supporting the judgment in favor of the party against whom the motion was made.\u201d 71 Ohio St.3d at 156, 642 N.E.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 30} While the holdings in <em>Bals\u00f3n </em>and <em>Whittington </em>appear incongruous at first glance, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected that notion in <em>Whittington. </em>See <em>Evans v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co., </em>4th Dist. No. 03CA763, 2004-Ohio-2183, 2004 WL 928297, \u00b6 16. In <em>Whittington, </em>although the Supreme Court recognized that its decision \u201cmight be cited as having some impact\u201d on <em>Bals\u00f3n, </em>it distinguished it. <em>Whittington, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 158, 642 N.E.2d 615. The court explained, <em>\u201cBals\u00f3n </em>did not address the question whether the harmless error doctrine applies to determinations denying summary judgment motions. Further, the denial of the motion for summary judgment in <em>Bals\u00f3n </em>could not have been harmless since the denial was predicated upon a pure question of law, <em>i.e., </em>the legal conclusiveness of a party\u2019s failure to timely respond to requests for admissions.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 31} In deciding <em>Whittington, </em>the Supreme Court recognized the inherent injustice in denying judgment to a party whose motion for summary judgment was wrongfully denied, because that party could not immediately appeal because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>orders denying summary judgment are not final, appealable orders. 71 Ohio St.3d at 157, 642 N.E.2d 615. But the court concluded that it would also be unjust to reverse a judgment in favor of the \u201cparty that was victorious at the trial, which won judgment after the evidence was more completely presented, where cross-examination played its part and where witnesses were seen and appraised.\u201d Id., citing <em>Home Indemn. Co. v. Reynolds &amp; Co. </em>(1962), 38 Ill.App.2d 358, 187 N.E.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 32} The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the greater injustice would be to the party deprived of the jury verdict because \u201c[ojtherwise, a decision based on less evidence would prevail over a verdict reached on more evidence and judgment would be taken away from the victor and given to the loser despite the victor having the greater weight of evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 33} Therefore, while the <em>Whittington </em>decision limited the circumstances under which an appellate court can reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of a summary judgment motion, it did not completely eliminate this ability. <em>Evans, </em>2004-Ohio-2183, 2004 WL 928297, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 34} In the case sub judice, the sole issue addressed in the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions was the same issue at trial, i.e., coverage. Because we determine that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions supporting a judgment in favor of Thomas at trial, we conclude here that even if the trial court erred in denying the earlier motion for summary judgment, that error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 35} Accordingly, Thomas\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">DXRECTED-VERDXCT STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 36} In her second assignment of error, Thomas argues that the trial court erred when it granted Nationwide\u2019s motion for directed verdict because she presented sufficient evidence from which, if believed, reasonable minds could find that she did not materially breach the policy provisions, or, alternatively, if she did, Nationwide was not prejudiced by that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 37} According to Civ.R. 50(A)(4), a motion for directed verdict should be granted when, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, \u201creasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">{\u00b6 38} A motion for a directed verdict tests the legal sufficiency of the evidence, presenting a question of law for review. <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 219, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896. It \u201cdoes not present a question of fact or raise factual issues * * *, even though in deciding such a motion it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>necessary to review and consider the evidence.\u201d <em>Ruta v. Breckenridge-Remy Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 66, 23 O.O.3d 115, 430 N.E.2d 935, paragraph one of the syllabus. Since we are presented with a question of law, we apply a de novo standard of review. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 521, 523, 668 N.E.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">{\u00b6 39} In <em>O\u2019Day, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u201cit is uncontestably the duty of a trial court to submit an essential issue to the jury when there is sufficient evidence, if believed, relating to that issue to permit reasonable minds to reach different conclusions on that issue. * * * Conversely, it is also the duty of a trial court to withhold an essential issue from the jury when there is not sufficient evidence relating to that issue to permit reasonable minds to reach different conclusions on that issue. * * * Naturally, if the finding on that one issue disposes of the whole case, a duty arises to grant judgment upon the whole case.\u201d 29 Ohio St.2d at 220, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896. Thus, the question a court of appeals must consider \u201cis whether the trial judge should have submitted the issue * * * to the jury.\u201d Id. at 221, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">THE POLICY PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 40} The relevant UIM provisions of Thomas\u2019s insurance policy with Nationwide sets forth the \u201cINSURED PERSON\u2019S DUTIES\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201c1.

Also, we may require reimbursement from the insured out of any settlement or judgment that duplicates our payments. These provisions will be applied in accordance with state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">JURY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">{\u00b6 41} Thomas presented the following evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">{\u00b6 42} Thomas had been a customer at Nationwide for over 20 years. Richard Prokopius had been Thomas\u2019s Nationwide agent since he began, approximately 24 years ago. Thomas explained that when she got married, she made her husband switch to Nationwide because she trusted Prokopius. She and her husband purchased life, home, and automobile insurance for four cars from Prokopius.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">{\u00b6 43} Thomas said that she had a great relationship with Prokopius and that when she had \u201ca problem or issue,\u201d she \u201cpick[ed] up the phone and call[ed] him.\u201d She further explained that she always asked Prokopius what she should do, \u201cand he tells [her] what to do, and [she] does it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">{\u00b6 44} On December 18, 1998, the day after she had been in the accident, Thomas called Prokopius to tell him about it and to ask him what she should do. Prokopius told her to pursue a claim through State Farm, which she did. Thomas claims that Prokopius also told her to call Nationwide\u2019s claims center to report the accident, which she claims she did, but Nationwide has no record of that call.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">(\u00b6 45} State Farm fixed Thomas\u2019s car but would not pay her medical bills because she would not sign a release. \u25a0 State Farm refused to tell her what the policy limits were. Thomas said she called Prokopius to tell him of the problems she was having with State Farm. Prokopius remembered Thomas calling him at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>some point to tell him that she was going to sue State Farm and he told her to <em>\u201cgo </em>ahead.\u201d She filed suit against the Romanins in December 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">{\u00b6 46} In December 2001, State Farm received its medical reports regarding Thomas\u2019s injuries. Immediately after, State Farm offered Thomas the policy limits of $100,000. Thomas said she was aware that if she had gone to trial, which was set in January 2002, it would cost \u201c20,000 or more dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 47} Thomas testified that she called Prokopius the day she received the offer, on December 28, 2001, and told him about it. Thomas said she told him that she \u201cwanted to take it,\u201d but that she did not know if $100,000 would be sufficient to fully compensate her. She wanted to know if she was entitled to any money under her policy with Nationwide. She said that Prokopius told her to call \u201cclaims and open a claim,\u201d which she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 48} Prokopius remembered Thomas calling him in December 2001 regarding her settlement offer from State Farm. He did not recall discussing a settlement amount but said that if she had told him that the offer would not be sufficient to cover her costs, then he would have told her to call Nationwide to \u201cturn in a claim.\u201d He also remembered Thomas calling him in January 2002 to ask him to send her a copy of her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 49} Thomas called Nationwide\u2019s claim center on December 28, 2001. She said that she told someone at the claim center that she had a settlement offer from State Farm \u201cto settle a claim for policy limits from the other person: and that [she] needed to know if [she] could take the settlement.\u201d She remembers emphasizing to the person \u201cthat [she] needed someone to get back to her right away because [she] needed to know if [she] could take the settlement.\u201d Thomas said she was told that someone would get back to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 50} Nationwide does not dispute that Thomas called the call center on December 28, 2001. But it does dispute that Thomas reported in that call that she had a settlement offer from State Farm and that she was requesting UIM coverage under her policy. Nationwide claims that the only evidence it has regarding the December 28, 2001 call is a fax from the Columbus Service Center to an office in Canton, with a \u201cPending \u2014 Personal Auto Notice of Loss\u201d attached to the fax. The subject line of the fax indicates, \u201cPending Claim, [policy number] 12/17/1998.\u201d (Thomas argues that this proves that she had a claim pending since December 17, 1998. But Nationwide explained that is only the date of the accident, not the date the claim began pending.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 51} Richard Gemperline, an attorney for Nationwide, testified that the notice of loss attached to the fax showed that Thomas only requested to open a medical claim because under \u201cwitness/comments,\u201d it indicated, \u201cmedical only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>claim.\u201d The notice of loss also provided, \u201creserve code open,\u201d which Gemperline explained meant that the insurance company \u201csets aside money\u201d to pay a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 52} Penny Newman, an adjuster for Nationwide, contacted Thomas on January 7, 2002. Thomas said that she told Newman she had an offer for policy limits from State Farm, she wanted to accept the offer, and she wanted to know what she was entitled to under her policy at Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 53} Thomas stated that she asked Newman several times during the conversation if she could accept the offer, \u201cto make sure it was okay for me to do that.\u201d Thomas said that Newman \u201ctold me that I could accept it, that I was still entitled to the coverage from Nationwide.\u201d Thomas also stated that Newman then told her that she would \u201crefer her claim to the field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 54} Newman testified that in 2002, she had the authority to \u201cmake liability decisions\u201d but could not \u201cwrite the check.\u201d Newman stated that she could not personally recall her conversation with Thomas, but she knew that she had talked to her on January 7, 2002, because of the printout of the activity log (a \u201clog that chronicles the activities of a particular claim\u201d) regarding Thomas\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 55} The activity log regarding Thomas\u2019s claim began on December 28, 2001, when Thomas called the call center. Newman read an entry from the log that she entered into Nationwide\u2019s system regarding her first contact with Thomas: \u201cPH [policy holder] called this date stating that CC [claimant carrier] offered her the CL [claimant] BI [bodily injury] limits of 100K. PH feels her claim is worth more than this as she has been suffering for 3 years. PH feels there is BIUM [bodily injury underinsured motorist] exposure. However, PH is atty rpd [attorney represented].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">{\u00b6 56} Thomas testified that when Newman called her, she already knew that Thomas was represented by an attorney because Newman told her, \u201cshe would have to check with my attorney.\u201d Thomas said that she explained to Newman that she was represented by an attorney in her case against State Farm but not regarding her UIM claim with Nationwide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">{\u00b6 57} Gemperline agreed that there was nothing recorded in the activity log that showed that Thomas was being represented by an attorney for her UIM claim. The activity log showed that Thomas was represented for the underlying claim against the tortfeasor but not for her UIM claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">{\u00b6 58} Thomas accepted State Farm\u2019s offer and released the Romanins on January 8, 2002. She said that she did so based on Newman\u2019s statement to her (the day before) that she could. Thomas explained that if at any time Prokopius, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the person at Nationwide\u2019s call center, or Newman would have told her not to sign the release or warned her that she could lose her rights to UIM coverage, she would not have signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 59} On January 10, 2002, Sandra Robinson, another Nationwide adjuster, called Thomas. Thomas said that she thought the call was to investigate her claim, but Robinson \u201cimmediately told [her] that she was denying [her] claim with Nationwide.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 60} Thomas testified she told Robinson that based on the information she received from Newman, she believed that she could accept the offer, so she did. Thomas said that Robinson told her, \u201cWe have freshman adjusters who don\u2019t give out proper information,\u201d and that Newman was \u201cprobably a young adjuster and didn\u2019t know all the info.\u201d Thomas testified, \u201cI was * * * hysterical, because I relied, apparently to my detriment, according to Sandra Robinson, on a Nationwide adjuster telling me that I could accept this settlement and that I would be covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 61} Robinson wrote in a January 10, 2002 activity log entry that \u201c[l]iability was determined to be 100 clear against clmt. driver for failure to maintain assured clear distance striking the rear of insured vehicle. Clmt carrier State Farm handled the damages to insured vehicle and they have also paid out their [bodily injury] limits of 100K.\u201d Robinson further stated in the log that she had informed Thomas that she received a fax from Thomas\u2019s attorney of the release that she had signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 62} Robinson sent an email to Gemperline and her supervisor that same day regarding the denial of the claim. She wrote, \u201c[P]lease review log notes and letter that is saved as a draft under documents, and let me know if you agree with my denial of this claim.\u201d Gemperline replied, \u201cI will need to see a copy of the release signed by the insured and the court\u2019s dismissal entry.\u201d Robinson responded, \u201cI can fax you a copy of the release but I do not have a copy of the dismissal as of yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 63} On January 16, 2002, Gemperline emailed Robinson that he would have someone check the court\u2019s docket to see if the case had been dismissed and further stated, \u201cI will have a [Reservation of Rights] letter for you as soon as I get that information.\u201d Gemperline said that he received a copy of the docket on January 17, 2002, and saw that the case against the Romanins had not yet been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">{\u00b6 64} Gemperline then had Robinson send the reservation-of-rights letter to Thomas on January 17, 2002, with a copy to her attorney. Gemperline explained that the purpose of a reservation-of-rights letter is to advise people that Nationwide needs to investigate the UIM claim. Robinson sent the letter and told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Gemperline that she would follow up \u201cin a couple of weeks\u201d to see if Thomas or her attorney had responded to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">(\u00b6 65} Thomas said that when she received the reservation-of-rights letter from Robinson, she thought that the letter meant Nationwide had changed its mind and that it was going to \u201clook into\u201d the claim. Thomas responded with a letter to Robinson on January 28, explaining the reasons why she believed she was entitled to UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 66} On February 13, 2002, Gemperline received a copy of the dismissal, which had been \u201creceived for filing\u201d in the clerk\u2019s office on January 24, 2002. He said that a decision was made to formally deny Thomas\u2019s UIM coverage on March 1, 2002. Gemperline wrote the March 4, 2002 letter denying coverage, which Robinson signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 67} The letter stated that Nationwide was denying Thomas UIM coverage because she \u201cdid not give Nationwide the reasonable opportunity to protect its subrogation rights before settling [the] claim with the at fault parties.\u201d The letter further indicated, \u201c[0]ur investigation revealed that your accident occurred on December 17, 1998 and that you never reported the claim to our call center until January 7, 2002. * * * Our investigation has also shown that you notified Nationwide of your intent to settle your claim with the liability insurance carrier for the Romanins, State Farm Insurance, on January 7, 2002. You then signed a Full and Final Release * * * the next day, January 8, 2002. * * * Nationwide does not consider the one day\u2019s notice of your intent to settle your claim a reasonable opportunity to protect its subrogation rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 68} Gemperline agreed that no one at Nationwide attempted to find out if Thomas could get out of the release prior to the case being dismissed, nor did anyone at Nationwide tell Thomas that she should not sign the release before getting Nationwide\u2019s consent. Gemperline explained several times that it was stated in her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 69} Gemperline agreed that \u201c[o]ne of the issues in pursuing subrogation is to put a value on what it is you will get\u201d in the subrogation. And he agreed that from the time Thomas reported that she had a settlement offer, on December 28, 2001, Nationwide did not do any investigation into the potential value of the subrogation claim, nor was there anything in Nationwide\u2019s records that showed that Robinson had reviewed Thomas\u2019s medical records before deciding to deny her coverage. Gemperline admitted that he did not consider the economic viability of the subrogation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 70} Gemperline further agreed that he testified at his deposition that if Thomas had told Nationwide in December 2001 \u201cof her intentions to resolve the underlying lawsuit with the Romanins for policy limits that she provided appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>priate and timely notice\u201d of her intent to settle. But Nationwide contends that nothing in the record shows that Thomas did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">{\u00b6 71} Gemperline also agreed that Nationwide \u201chas a potential exposure of $200,000 in a situation where there are policy limits of a hundred thousand for the tort-feasor and underinsured benefits of $300,000 from Nationwide.\u201d He agreed that before Nationwide would decide to pursue a subrogation claim, it would also consider if it \u201cwas economically worth it to hire lawyers.\u201d If Nationwide pursued the suit, it would have a right to recover \u201cwhat [it] paid out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 72} On cross-examination, Thomas said that she could not remember if she ever gave a copy of her complaint against the Romanins to any representative at Nationwide. She also stated that she did not submit \u201canything in writing\u201d to Nationwide about \u201cproof of her claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 73} Thomas agreed that in her letter to Robinson stating her reasons why she believed she was still entitled to UIM benefits, she stated, \u201cPenny Newman never told me I couldn\u2019t accept the money,\u201d not that Newman told her to accept the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 74} Thomas said that she had a copy of her declarations, but she never had a copy of her insurance policy until she called Prokopius and got it in January 2002. She further agreed that she never sent a letter to Nationwide telling them that State Farm had offered its policy limits, nor did she ask for Nationwide\u2019s written consent to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 75} The last witness to testify for Thomas was William Yiscomi, an expert witness who had defended insurance companies for over 30 years. He opined that Thomas did not breach the prompt-notice provision or the consent-to-settle provision, nor did she prejudice Nationwide\u2019s subrogation rights. He also testified that Nationwide breached its duty to Thomas by not guiding her through the policy so that Thomas did not forfeit her right to UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\"><em>FERRANDO </em>ANALYSIS: TWO-STEP INQUIRY</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">{\u00b6 76} In <em>Ferrando, </em>the Supreme Court explained that there are two types of notice that should not be confused. 98 Ohio St.3d 186, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927, at \u00b6 70. \u201cOne of those inquiries focuses on a \u2018prompt notice\u2019 clause specifically contained in an insurance policy that requires that an insured promptly give notice of an accident or claim to the UIM insurer. The other type of notice at issue is the notice inquiry that can be an inherent part of the question whether a consent-to-settle clause was complied with. For an insured to obtain consent from a UIM insurer to a proposed settlement, the insured first must give notice to the insurer that a settlement is being contemplated.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>{\u00b6 77} The Supreme Court further explained the purpose behind notice provisions in an insurance contract. Id. at \u00b6 77. \u201c \u2018Notice provisions allow the insurer to become aware of occurrences early enough that it can have a meaningful opportunity to investigate. <em>Ruby v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 159, 161, 532 N.E.2d 730. In addition, it provides the insurer the ability to determine whether the allegations state a claim that is covered by the policy. It allows the insurer to step in and control the potential litigation, protect its own interests, maintain the proper reserves in its accounts, and pursue possible subrogation claims. Further, it allows insurers to make timely investigations of occurrences in order to evaluate claims and to defend against fraudulent, invalid, or excessive claims.\u2019 (Citations omitted.)\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">{\u00b6 78} The Supreme Court outlined an analysis in <em>Ferrando </em>for cases involving an alleged breach of a prompt-notice condition and breach of a consent-to-settle or other subrogation-related provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 79} The court held, \u201c[W]hen an insurer\u2019s denial of [uninsured or] underinsured motorist coverage is premised on the insured\u2019s breach of a prompt-notice provision in a policy of insurance, the insurer is relieved of the obligation to provide coverage if it is prejudiced by the insured\u2019s unreasonable delay in giving notice.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 80} It further concluded, \u201c[W]hen an insurer\u2019s denial of underinsured motorist coverage is premised on the insured\u2019s breach of a consent-to-settle or other subrogation-related provision in a policy of insurance, the insurer is relieved of the obligation to provide coverage if it is prejudiced by the failure to protect its subrogation rights.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 81} In either a breach of a prompt-notice provision or a consent-to-settle or other subrogation provision, the Supreme Court held that the breach is \u201cpresumed prejudicial to the insurer absent evidence to the contrary.\u201d Id. at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Accordingly, the determination as to whether a breach of either provision relieves the insurer of its obligation to provide UM/UIM coverage involves a two-step inquiry. Id. at \u00b6 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 82} The court must first ascertain whether a breach did in fact occur. Id. at \u00b6 90-91. If a court decides there was no breach, then the inquiry \u201cis at an end, and UIM coverage must be provided.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 83} But if the court concludes that a breach occurred, then it must determine whether the insurer suffered prejudice such that UM/UIM coverage must be forfeited. Id. A presumption arises that the breach was prejudicial to the insurer, and the insured party bears the burden of presenting evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>APPLICATION OF <em>FERRANDO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 84} The trial court granted a directed verdict to Nationwide because it determined that Thomas breached the notice provisions and subrogation-related provisions of her policy. Civ.R. 50(A)(4) provides that the trial court may grant a directed verdict \u201cupon any determinative issue.\u201d Thus, we must determine whether Thomas presented sufficient evidence on each issue, such that this issue should have been submitted to the jury. The three issues under Thomas\u2019s second assignment of error are (1) prompt notice; (2) consent-to-settle and other subrogation related provisions; and (3) prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">A. Prompt-Notice Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 85} The \u201cGeneral Policy Considerations\u201d under Thomas\u2019s policy with Nationwide required an insured to \u201cgive us or our agent prompt notice of all losses and provide written proof of claim if required.\u201d The \u201cUninsured Motorist\u201d provision further specified that an insured \u201cmust submit written proof of claim to us,\u201d including, inter aha, the nature and extent of injuries and treatment and provide all facts of the accident and the names of all witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 86} Thomas contends that she gave proper notice of the loss to Nationwide because she called Prokopius and the Nationwide claim center within 24 hours of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 87} Under <em>Ferrando, </em>a court must consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the notice to determine whether the insurance company received it within a reasonable time. Id. at \u00b6 100, citing <em>Ruby v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 159, 532 N.E.2d 730, syllabus. \u201cAs a general rule, if an insurance agent acting with apparent authority receives proper notice of a claim * * *, the notice is considered to have been received by the insurance company.\u201d <em>Helman v.

The policy did not require written notice of the loss. The policy did, however, require written notice of the claim. Thus, we must determine whether Thomas produced sufficient evidence, such that the trial court should have submitted this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">{\u00b6 89} Thomas testified that she called Prokopius, as well as Nationwide\u2019s claim center, on December 28, 2001, to inform Nationwide of the settlement offer of policy limits, to tell them that it was not sufficient to fully compensate her, and to inquire about her UIM benefits. Thomas admitted at trial, however, that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>never submitted written proof of her claim to Nationwide but contends that Nationwide waived its written-claim defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 90} In <em>Sweeney v.

She called him almost immediately after the accident to tell him about it. He advised her to pursue a claim through State Farm, which she did. When she was having problems with State Farm revealing its policy limits, she called him again. He told her that insurance carriers typically did not reveal limits and told her that she might have to sue them. She called Prokopius to tell them that she was going to file suit against State Farm. He agreed that she should. And when State Farm finally made its settlement offer, she called him to find out about her UIM coverage with Nationwide. As in <em>Woyma, </em>Prokopius never advised her of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the UIM benefits that might potentially be available to her under her policy or the conditions that must be met in order to recover these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">{\u00b6 101} Moreover, at no time did Prokopius advise her that she needed to submit written proof of her claim to Nationwide. In fact, Prokopius told her to <em>call </em>the claim center to file a claim. And when she did, the person who took her information did not inform her that she needed to submit written proof of her claim. That person entered Thomas\u2019s claim information into Nationwide\u2019s computerized notice-of-loss form, which was then faxed to the Canton office. Thomas was then told that someone would contact her. Approximately one week later, Penny Newman called Thomas. Again, she never asked Thomas to submit anything in writing regarding her claim. Thomas did everything her agent, a person at the claims center, and a Nationwide adjuster, told her do.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 102} After reviewing the facts presented at trial, we conclude that Thomas presented sufficient evidence, <em>if believed, </em>that would permit reasonable minds to reach different conclusions on the issue of whether Nationwide, by its words, actions, and conduct, waived the strict compliance of requiring Thomas to submit written proof of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 103} Thomas\u2019s second assignment of error, with respect to \u201cprompt notice,\u201d has merit, and thus she is entitled to a new trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">B. Consent-to-Settle and Other Subrogation Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 104} The policy at question here required an insured to \u201cpromptly deliver to us all papers dealing with any claims or suits\u201d and to obtain Nationwide\u2019s written consent to \u201csettle any legal action brought against any liable party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 105} Thomas testified that she could not recall whether she had sent a copy of the suit to Nationwide, but Nationwide claims it did not receive one. It is undisputed, however, that Thomas did not obtain written consent from Nationwide to settle her suit against the Romanins. Thomas argues that Nationwide also waived its written-consent defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 106} Thomas informed Prokopius of the problems that she was having with State Farm and eventually told him that she was going to sue the Romanins. Again, he did not advise her at that time \u2014 before she filed the action \u2014 that she needed to send Nationwide a copy of the suit. Then, when she called Prokopius in December 2001 to tell him about the settlement offer, he did not tell her to send a copy of the suit or warn her that if she settled the suit without Nationwide\u2019s written consent, she would forfeit her UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>{\u00b6 107} Not only did Prokopius fail to advise Thomas in any way of what she needed to do to protect her UIM benefits, neither did the person at the claim center, nor did the adjusters, Newman or Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">{\u00b6 108} In addition, Thomas testified that Newman orally told her that she could accept the offer from State Farm and that she relied on that information to her detriment. Newman could not recall the conversation. Thomas further testified that she told Robinson that Newman told her that she could accept the settlement, and she said that Robinson replied that Newman must be a new adjuster who did not know what she was talking about.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 109} Nationwide agrees with Thomas that it had a duty to aid her in the preservation of its subrogation rights but disputes that it had to assist her with her policy. Nationwide contends that mere silence does not amount to waiver and claims that Thomas should have just read her policy to know what she needed to do to protect her UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 110} We agree that mere silence does not amount to waiver and that Thomas had a duty to examine her policy. Under the facts of this case, however, we agree with Thomas that \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 the evidence presented is sufficient, <em>if believed, </em>such that it should have gone to the jury. A fact-finder, as a matter of law, could reach different conclusions on the issue of whether Nationwide waived its written-consent requirements under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 111} Thus, the trial court erred by granting a directed verdict to Nationwide and as such, Thomas is entitled to a new trial. Thomas\u2019s second assignment of error, with respect to consent-to-settle and written-proof-of-claim provisions, is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">C. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 112} Nationwide contends that Thomas did not present any evidence to rebut the presumption of prejudice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 113} Gemperline testified that when he found out that Thomas had settled with State Farm, he knew that the suit had not yet been dismissed. He said that no one attempted to find out if Thomas could still get out of the release since the case had not yet been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">{\u00b6 114} Gemperline agreed that Nationwide was possibly facing $200,000 of UIM benefits exposure, since Thomas had $300,000 worth of coverage and she had received $100,000 from State Farm. He agreed that before it could pursue a subrogation claim, it had to consider many issues, such as the costs of \u201cfronting\u201d the settlement money to Thomas, and hiring lawyers to defend the suit to recover what it paid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>{\u00b6 115} Thomas\u2019s expert witness testified that Thomas did not prejudice Nationwide\u2019s subrogation rights by signing the release. He explained that since the dismissal entry had not been filed yet, Nationwide still could have made an attempt to protect its subrogation rights. In his 30 years of experience, he said that he has \u201cseen releases voided because of circumstances,\u201d and \u201cuntil the case is over, it is not dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 116} The expert further testified that in order for Nationwide to pursue its subrogation rights, it would have had to \u201cgo after the father of the young man who struck Ms. Thomas\u2019s vehicle. That is a negligent entrustment claim. * * * That opportunity was really nonexistent.\u201d First, he explained that \u201c[a] negligent entrustment claim * * * is extremely difficult,\u201d and stated, \u201c[A]s I understand the facts of this case, there was no evidence of negligent entrustment, so that action would have been fruitless, would have been costly.\u201d He explained that Nationwide would have been taking \u201ca great chance, because the claim against the father is \u2014 is so thin that they would realize it\u2019s not something that they would pursue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 117} And the expert stated that before Nationwide could pursue the wrongdoer, it would have to take over Thomas\u2019s suit, pay Thomas $100,000, and then pay her legal fees. Therefore, he opined that a negligent-entrustment claim \u201cwould have been fruitless [and] costly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 118} After reviewing the record, it is our view that Thomas did present sufficient evidence, <em>if believed, </em>that would permit reasonable fact-finders to reach different conclusions as to whether Nationwide was actually prejudiced by her accepting the settlement and releasing the Romanins. Thus, the trial court erred by granting directed verdict to Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 119} Accordingly, Thomas\u2019s second assignment of error is also sustained with respect to the issue of prejudice under a <em>Ferrando </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 120} Thomas\u2019s third assignment of error is rendered moot by our disposition of the second assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">BIFURCATION</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">{\u00b6 121} In her fourth assignment of error, Thomas maintains that the trial court erred when it bifurcated the coverage issue and when it made erroneous evidentiary rulings unrelated to the bifurcation. Although Thomas does not cite any authority for her arguments, we will address them briefly as they are likely to arise during retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">{\u00b6 122} Thomas contends that by bifurcating her bad-faith claims, it limited her ability to discover evidence on the coverage issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 123} Civ.R. 42(B) provides that a \u201ccourt, after a hearing, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, or third-party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate the right to trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cThe decision of whether or not to bifurcate the proceedings * * * is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Sheets v. Norfolk S. Corp. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 278, 288, 671 N.E.2d 1364, citing <em>Heidbreder v. Trustees </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 95, 100, 18 O.O.3d 78, 411 N.E.2d 825. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision to bifurcate the trial, pursuant to Civ.R. 42(B), absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Clark v. Univ. Hosps. of Cleveland </em>[(2001)], 8th Dist. No. 78854, 2001 WL 995104.\u201d <em>Fraysure v. A-Best Products Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 83017, 2003-Ohio-6882, 2003 WL 22971024, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 125} \u201cThe trial court is free to order separate trials of separate issues whenever it will further convenience, avoid prejudice, or be conductive to expedition and economy. A trial court is in the best position to ascertain whether a bifurcation of the issues is necessary and that court, therefore, has broad discretion in doing so. <em>Fairfield Commons Condominium </em>[Asm] <em>v. Stasa </em>(1985), 30 Ohio App.3d 11, 506 N.E.2d 237.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 126} In bifurcating the claims, the trial court relied on <em>Garg v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>155 Ohio App.3d 258, 800 N.E.2d 757, 2003-Ohio-5960. In that case, the Second District held that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to bifurcate the bad-faith insurance claims \u2014 because not bifurcating the claims would have been \u201cgrossly prejudicial\u201d to the insurance company. Id. at \u00b6 29. Thus, we cannot say the trial court here abused its discretion when it bifurcated the bad-faith and tort-related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">USE OF CIV.R. 30(B)(5) DEPOSITION AT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 127} As for Thomas\u2019s arguments regarding the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, evidentiary rulings are within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and are not reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Kozak v. Jackson, </em>8th Dist. No. 88851, 2008-Ohio-50, at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">{\u00b6 128} Thomas argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to allow her to play Gemperline\u2019s Civ.R. 30(B)(5) video deposition for the jury. Nationwide identified Gemperline as the person who would testify on its behalf pursuant to Civ.R. 30(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 129} Civ.R. 30(B)(5) provides that a party may name a corporation as the deponent and \u201cdesignate with reasonable particularity the matters on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>examination is requested.\u201d The corporation \u201cso named shall choose one or more of its proper employees, officers, agents, or other persons duly authorized to testify on its behalf. The persons so designated shall testify as to matters known or available to the organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">{\u00b6 130} Thomas conducted the deposition and filed it timely, as required by Civ.R. 32(A) if it is going to be used at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 131} Under Civ.R. 32(A)(2), a deposition taken pursuant to Civ.R. 30(B)(5) may be used at trial for <em>any purpose. </em>It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 132} \u201cThe deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person designated under Rule 30(B)(5) or Rule 31(A) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership or association which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 133} The 1970 staff notes to Civ.R. 32(A)(2) indicate that \u201ca party may use the deposition of an adverse party or the persons enumerated in Rule 30(B)(5) not only for impeachment purposes, but also as-substantive evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 134} Since the trial court would not permit the deposition to be played, Thomas was forced to question Gemperline as the corporation <em>and </em>as an employee of the corporation. Thomas argues that \u201cNationwide received the benefit of having Gemperline [be] able to avoid adverse admissions by framing his testimony in terms of what he personally knew, rather than what his employer knew as a corporate entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 135} The trial court stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to allow Mr. Gemperline to testify and be called as a witness. He can be cross-examined or impeached with respect to the deposition that was given, but I\u2019m not going to allow under [Civ.R.]30(B)(5) Mr. Gemperline\u2019s video deposition.\u201d The trial court reasoned, \u201c[M]y ruling is really based in conjunction with two things. One is the prejudicial value of being placed in front of a jury where there\u2019s 70-plus objections, ruling on those objections, and having that before a jury and skipping through the objections, I believe is prejudicial in the fact that you have listed Mr. Gemperline already as a witness. * * * I\u2019ll let him speak to both the issue individually as well as his corporate capacity in his testimony provided by yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 136} Thus, the trial court permitted Thomas to use the deposition for impeachment purposes, which she did, but not as \u201csubstantive evidence,\u201d as the rule allows. It appears that the trial court relied on Civ.R. 32(A)(3), which addresses the use of a witness\u2019s deposition at trial when a witness is not available to testify (because, for example, the witness has passed away or is not within the subpoena power of the court). We agree with Thomas that under Civ.R. 32(A)(2), \u201cunavailability or impeachment is not the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>{\u00b6 137} In addition, the trial court cannot make a determination as to whether the \u201c70-plus objections\u201d are prejudicial \u2014 until the trial court actually hears those objections and rules upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 138} Therefore, we agree that the trial court abused its discretion by not allowing Thomas to play Gemperline\u2019s video deposition to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">CALLING A WITNESS AS IF ON CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 139} Thomas also argues that the trial court abused its discretion by not allowing her to call Prokopius as if on cross-examination. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 140} \u201cWhether a party may ask leading questions and examine its own witness as if on cross-examination is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Ramage v. Central Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 592 N.E.2d 828, paragraph six of the syllabus, citing <em>Seley v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 192, 204, 21 O.O.3d 121, 423 N.E.2d 831.\u201d <em>Sidenstricker v. Miller Pavement Maintenance, Inc., </em>158 Ohio App.3d 356, 2004-Ohio-4653, 815 N.E.2d 736, at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 141} In <em>Smith v. Mitchell </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 237, 239, 520 N.E.2d 213, the Ohio Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 142} \u201cOne of the oldest and most fundamental rights in the Anglo-American system of evidence is the right of a party to cross-examine an adverse witness. The value of the right of cross-examination is well-settled in Ohio jurisprudence. \u2018 * * * The importance of the <em>right </em>of full cross-examination, of an adverse witness, can scarcely be overestimated. As a test of the accuracy, truthfulness, and credibility of testimony, it is invaluable.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>Martin v. Elden </em>(1877), 32 Ohio St. 282, 287. \u2018The term cross-examination would not perhaps strictly import any thing more than a leading and searching inquiry of the witness for further disclosures touching the particular matters detailed by him in his examination in chief. This, however, is said to be one of the principal and most efficacious tests which the law has devised for the discovery of truth. And inasmuch as it has for its object the disclosure of not merely the extent and degree of accuracy of the witness\u2019 knowledge, as well as the means of his knowledge, but also his motives, inclinations, powers of memory and relative situation in respect to the parties, and the subject matter of the investigation, it becomes an important test of the credibility of the witness.\u2019 <em>Legg v. Drake </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 286, 291.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">{\u00b6 143} R.C. 2317.52 sets forth when agents or employees may be cross-examined:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>{\u00b6 144} \u201cWhen the action or proceeding relates to a transaction or occurrence in which it has been shown or it is admitted that the adverse party acted either in whole or in part through an agent or employee, such agent or employee of the adverse party may be called as a witness and examined as if under cross-examination upon any matters at issue between the parties which are shown or admitted to have been within the scope of such agent\u2019s or employee\u2019s authority or employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 145} Evid.R. 611 mandates that courts must \u201cexercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 146} Evid.R. 611(C) further provides that \u201c[ljeading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness\u2019 testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 147} There is no question that Prokopius was an agent for Nationwide. He testified that he had been an agent for Nationwide for 24 years. Prokopius stated that if Nationwide sold a product, he had to sell it. His business card indicated that he was a principal agent for Nationwide. Thomas had been his customer from the beginning and had purchased life, home, and automobile insurance for four cars from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 148} After reviewing the record in its entirety, it is clear that Prokopius was an adverse or hostile witness to Thomas. The trial court refused to permit Thomas to delve into Prokopius\u2019s biases in favor of Nationwide, his pecuniary interests gained from working as a Nationwide agent for 24 years, and his knowledge and understanding of the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 149} By not allowing Thomas to call him as if on cross-examination, the trial court prejudiced her ability to fully discover the truth, the extent and degree of accuracy of his knowledge, \u201cbut also his motives, inclinations, powers of memory and relative situation in respect to the parties, and the subject matter of the investigation, it becomes an important test of the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 239, 520 N.E.2d 213. Therefore, it is our view that the trial court abused its discretion by not permitting Thomas to call Prokopius as if on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 150} Thomas\u2019s fourth assignment of error has merit with respect to the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow her to use Gemperline\u2019s video deposition at trial and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>refusal to allow her to call Prokopius as if on cross-examination, but not regarding the bifurcation of claims or her other various evidentiary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">{\u00b6 151} Accordingly, Thomas\u2019s first, third, and fourth (in part) assignments of error are not well taken. Thomas\u2019s second and fourth (in part) assignments are sustained. The judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded. The trial court is instructed to conduct a new trial on the issue of coverage and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b567-6\">McMonagle, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b567-7\">Rocco, P.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-12\">. Thomas admitted on cross-examination that she testified in her deposition that she told Newman she was represented by an attorney, not that Newman told her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b567-8\">Rocco, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak3f\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 152} The sole basis for the court\u2019s decision was stated in its October 24, 2006 order: \u201cPlaintiff failed to comply with the express terms of her insurance policy requiring proper notice to the insurer of settlement of her personal injury claims and release of the tortfeasor, resulting in a determination of prejudice to the insurer * * *.\u201d In my opinion, this is not a declaration of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under their contract. Therefore, I would dismiss this appeal for lack of a final, appealable order. See <em>Am. Family Ins. Co. v. Johnson, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90062, 2008-Ohio-2181, 2008 WL 1974137, \u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 153} Even if I agreed that there was a final order here, large portions of the majority\u2019s analysis are devoted to issues not decided by the common pleas court or necessary to this appeal. First, the majority addresses whether Thomas provided Nationwide with prompt notice of her loss. The trial court did not even decide this issue. Second, while the trial court did determine that plaintiff had not complied with the consent-to-settle provisions of her contract, analysis of this issue is not necessary to decide this appeal. Even if Thomas failed to comply with either the notice of claim or the consent-to-settle provisions of her contract, Thomas presented evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Nationwide was not prejudiced. This fact alone made the trial court\u2019s decision erroneous and requires a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
