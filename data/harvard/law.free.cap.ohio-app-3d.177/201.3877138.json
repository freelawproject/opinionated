Penn, plaintiff below and appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant assigns the following errors for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">First Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">The trial court erred granting summary judgment in favor defendantsappellees and dismissing plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint where there remained genuine issues of material fact and reasonable minds could come to more than one conclusion concerning those facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">Second Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">The trial court erred in finding that as a matter of law an owner of landlocked real estate would not under any circumstances abandon a right of way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">Third Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">The trial court erred in finding that the location of the right of way is a now existing roadway that begins on Tick Ridge \u2014 Koenig Hill Road and enters the plaintiffs property beside her residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">Fourth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">The trial court erred in dismissing plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint when her cause of action for adverse possession was not an issue raised on summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-18\">Fifth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The trial court erred in finding that as a matter of law the defendant[s]appellee[s] possess a valid and expressed [sic] recorded easement across the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 3} The parties are contiguous property owners in Bush Creek Township of Scioto County. Appellant owns a parcel with frontage on Tick Ridge-Koenig Hill Road. Appellees own land that has no frontage on a public road, but claims to have an easement through appellant\u2019s property to that road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed the instant action and alleged that appellees did not acquire an express easement over her property and, even if such an express easement did exist in their chain of title, that easement had been abandoned. She later filed an amended complaint and averred that she had reacquired through adverse possession title to the easement over her property. Appellant asked that title to the alleged right of way be quieted in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellees (1) denied any liability on her complaint, (2) counterclaimed and alleged that an express easement over appellant\u2019s property had been part of their chain of title since 1912, (3) in the alternative, claimed an easement by prescription over appellant\u2019s land, and (4) alleged that appellant had erected a gate across the right of way and thereby blocked access to the easement. Appellees requested judgment quieting title to the easement in their favor and for damages for the trespass to their interests in the servient estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 6} Both sides requested summary judgment, and on July 6, 2007, the trial court ruled in favor of the appellees. The court agreed that in 1912, appellant\u2019s predecessors in title granted to appellees\u2019 predecessors in title an express easement over the servient estate. Further, the court rejected appellant\u2019s claims that the easement had been abandoned because, the court reasoned, no property owner would purposely and deliberately landlock their property. The trial court thus concluded that appellees have a valid easement across appellant\u2019s property and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint. No judgment was entered on appellees\u2019 counterclaim for trespass, but the court did make a Civ.R. 54(B) finding of \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d Although a notice of appeal was filed from that judgment, we dismissed the appeal for lack of a final order. See <em>Penn v. Esham, </em>Scioto App. No. 07CA3170, 2008-Ohio-434, 2008 WL 314849. The matter is now before us for a review on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">{\u00b6 7} Before we address the merits of the appeal, we pause to outline our standard of review. Appellate courts review summary judgments de novo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>Broadnax v. Greene Credit Serv. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 881, 887, 694 N.E.2d 167; <em>Coventry Twp. v. Ecker </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 38, 41, 654 N.E.2d 1327. In other words, appellate courts afford no deference to trial court decisions, <em>Hicks v. Leffler </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 424, 427, 695 N.E.2d 777; <em>Dillon v. Med. Ctr. Hosp. </em>(1993), 98 Ohio App.3d 510, 514-515, 648 N.E.2d 1375, and conduct an independent review to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Woods v. Dutta </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 228, 233-234, 695 N.E.2d 18; <em>Phillips v. Rayburn </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 374, 377, 680 N.E.2d 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 8} Summary judgment under Civ. R. 56(C) is appropriate when a movant shows that (1) no genuine issues of material fact exist, (2) he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) after the evidence is construed most strongly in favor of the nonmovant, reasonable minds can come to one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201; <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197. The moving party bears the initial burden to show that no genuine issue of material facts exist and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164; <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. If that burden is satisfied, the onus shifts to the nonmoving party to provide rebuttal evidentiary materials. See <em>Trout v. Parker </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 720, 723, 595 N.E.2d 1015; <em>Campco Distribs., Inc. v. Fries </em>(1987), 42 Ohio App.3d 200, 201, 537 N.E.2d 661. With these principles in mind, we turn our attention to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 9} We jointly consider appellant\u2019s first, second, third, and fifth assignments of error because they are interrelated. Appellant argues that the trial court erred in determining (1) that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that appellees have a valid easement across her property and (2) that an existing roadway across her property is the location of that easement. We disagree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 10} Appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion included several deeds from the parties\u2019 chains of title. One deed purports to convey an easement over another property. Although the location of both the servient and the dominant estate are somewhat difficult to discern from these deeds, not to mention the absence of survey maps, an affidavit from Walter Applegate attested that he examined the chains of title for each property and determined that appellees are the current owners of the dominant estate and appellant is the owner of the servient estate. This was sufficient to carry appellees\u2019 initial burden on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The burden of rebuttal then shifted to appellant. Appellant\u2019s rebuttal evidence consists of appellant\u2019s own affidavit that states that her deceased mother-in-law once told her that the claimed easement was \u201cfurther away \u2018over the hill.\u2019 \u201d Civ.R. 56(E) states that affidavits opposing summary judgment must be based on \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d Here, this affidavit was apparently based on appellant\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s knowledge, not appellant\u2019s personal knowledge. Appellant, therefore, did not carry her burden of rebuttal and the trial court correctly entered judgment in appellees\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant offers several additional arguments in her brief, but we find none persuasive. First, she contends that the deed that conveyed the easement to appellees\u2019 predecessors in title fails to set out the marital status of the grantors. Thus, appellant argues, that marital status remains a genuine issue of material fact. We disagree. A failure to set forth the marital status of a grantor in a deed does not render the deed invalid. Moreover, even if it did, appellant is challenging the validity of the conveyance, not appellees, and appellant has the burden to show marital status. Even if the grantors of the 1912 easement were married, and their wives failed to sign those instruments, this may indicate that the deed failed to convey all interests in the property. To the extent that a dower interest remained, as appellant argues in her brief, that interest is \u201can estate for life\u201d and would have terminated with the death of the grantors\u2019 wives. See R.C. 2103.02. Appellant has not shown that the grantors\u2019 wives, if they did indeed exist, are currently living.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant also argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether appellees\u2019 predecessors in title abandoned the easement. Again, we are not persuaded. To show that the owner of a dominant estate has abandoned an easement, the owner of the servient estate must establish (1) nonuse of the easement and (2) an intent to abandon the easement. See <em>Crane Hollow, Inc. v. Marathon Ashland Pipe Line, L.L.C. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 57, 72, 740 N.E.2d 328; <em>Snyder v. Monroe Twp. Trustees </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 443, 457, 674 N.E.2d 741. Intent to abandon an easement must be established by unequivocal and decisive acts inconsistent with the continued use and enjoyment of the easement. <em>Bauerbach v. LWR Ents., Inc., </em>169 Ohio App.3d 20, 861 N.E.2d 864, 2006-Ohio-4991, at \u00b6 19; <em>Crane Hollow Inc. </em>at 72, 740 N.E.2d 328. Mere nonuse of an easement is generally insufficient to establish abandonment. Id.; <em>Snyder, </em>supra, at 457, 674 N.E.2d 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellees\u2019 reply memorandum states, \u201cThere is simply no evidence that [their] predecessors ever intended to abandon the easement.\u201d Admittedly, no Civ.R. 56(C) evidentiary material substantiates that claim. However, the Ohio Supreme Court recently held that none are necessary insofar as rebutting a nonmoving party\u2019s affirmative defenses. <em>Todd Dev. Co., Inc. v. Morgan, </em>116 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>St.3d 461, 880 N.E.2d 88, 2008-Ohio-87, at the syllabus. Thus, the onus was on appellant to come forward with some evidence to show an unequivocal and decisive act on the part of appellees\u2019 predecessors in title to abandon the easement. She did not. Thus, the trial court correctly entered judgment against appellant on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, appellant contends that the easement\u2019s precise location remains a genuine issue of material fact. We readily acknowledge that the failure to include surveyor\u2019s maps in the record makes this issue somewhat more difficult to resolve, but, in the end, we conclude that the trial court correctly ruled on this issue as well. A 1915 \u201cGeological Map\u201d indicates what appears to be a road to the property. Moreover, appellees cite deposition testimony of Bob Graf, who owned the property in the 1960s, and testified that Graf used an established roadway for access when he owned the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 16} Because appellant has offered nothing by way of rebuttal, we believe this evidence, as sparse as it is, is sufficient to carry their burden to show the easement\u2019s location. Our conclusion is further buttressed by appellant\u2019s own affidavit. As stated, appellant\u2019s property has frontage on Tick Ridge \u2014 Koenig Hill Road \u2014 the road to which appellees need access. Appellant attests in her affidavit that appellees are claiming a \u201cprivate roadway\u201d behind her residence. Appellant offers no explanation as to where this private roadway goes, or why it is appurtenant to her property if she already has access to the Tick Ridge\u2014 Koenig Hill Road. The only conclusion to be drawn is that this road is the right of way for the otherwise landlocked parcel situated behind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 17} For these reasons, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that no genuine issues of material fact exist, and appellees are entitled to judgment in their favor as a matter of law on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s first, second, third, and fifth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">{\u00b6 19} In her fourth assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by entering judgment against her on all issues in the case. Specifically, she points to the \u201cfourth cause of action\u201d in her second amended complaint, wherein she averred that she had extinguished appellees\u2019 easement through adverse possession. Appellant maintains that their particular \u201ccause of action\u201d was not before the court as part of the motion for summary judgment and, therefore, that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment against her on all counts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>(\u00b6 20} Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment asked the trial court to determine that they had a \u201cvalid\u201d easement. Obviously, appellees could not have a valid easement if that easement had been extinguished by prescription. Thus, the summary judgment motion implicated the question of adverse possession. Appellant offered no evidence on this issue, and the trial court correctly disregarded the issue. We find no merit to the fourth assignment of error, and it is hereby overruled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 21} Having found no merit in the errors appellant assigned and argued in the brief, we hereby affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-7\">Harsha, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b246-8\">Kline, J., concurs in judgment only and opinion as to Assignment of Error IV and concurs in judgment only as to Assignments of Error I, II, III, and V.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\">. These facts come from the appellate briefs. The only maps in the record are tax or topographical maps that provide little information regarding the location of the properties, the roadway, or the claimed easement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">. We assume, for sake of our analysis, that adverse possession can, in fact, extinguish an express easement. Appellees argue in their brief that it cannot, but we have found nothing in our research one way or the other. Although it is intuitively logical that adverse possession could extinguish an express easement, as it can extinguish any other interest in property, the only case law we have found on the subject deals with adverse possession extinguishing an easement by prescription. See e.g. <em>J.F. Gioia, Inc. v. Cardinal Am. Corp. </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 33, 40, 491 N.E.2d 325. Fortunately, however, we need not address this issue because, as we note above, the issue of adverse possession was raised in the course of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
