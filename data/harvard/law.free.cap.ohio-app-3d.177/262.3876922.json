Facts and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Kevin Blair, appeals the judgment entered upon a jury\u2019s verdict in favor of defendant-appellee, Kevin McDonagh. He also appeals the trial court\u2019s decision overruling his motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d), for a new trial, and for remittitur. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, except for the award of punitive damages. We remand the case to the trial court to determine whether the award of punitive damages was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">A. Background and Origin of Claddagh</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 2} McDonagh is a businessman from Ireland who owned Supermac\u2019s, a large, successful restaurant chain in Ireland. In 1997, he hired Blair, a native of Ohio, as director of operations for Supermac\u2019s. Blair and McDonagh got along well and became friends. Due to his wife\u2019s homesickness, Blair decided to return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">{\u00b6 3} Blair and McDonagh decided to open a series of Irish-pub-themed restaurants in the midwestern United States. In 2001, they signed the operating agreement for Claddagh Employee Leasing. They later changed the name of the company to Claddagh Development Group, L.L.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">B. The Operating Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">{\u00b6 4} The agreement provided that Blair and McDonagh were both \u201cmembers\u201d of the company. It stated that each of them had provided a capital contribution of $1,000 and that each owned 50 percent of the common units. Blair was the general manager and tax-matters partner and received a salary. He ran the day-to-day operations and had broad authority to act without McDonagh\u2019s input. The agreement obligated him to provide annual financial reports and tax information and to give McDonagh access to Claddagh\u2019s books and records \u201cat all reasonable times\u201d and on reasonable notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">C. Funding and Declining Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">{\u00b6 5} Claddagh opened its first restaurant in Indianapolis in 2001. By 2006, it had expanded to 17 restaurants across the Midwest. The pubs generally did well when they first opened but had declining sales over time. By 2004, Claddagh was regularly behind in paying its vendors and other creditors. Those creditors had sued it for default on a number of debts, and it had accrued large tax obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>{\u00b6 6} From 1999 to 2004, McDonagh advanced approximately $20 million to Claddagh. McDonagh contended that those advances were loans to the company. Blair contended that they were capital contributions. Part of the money came from personal loans that McDonagh had taken out in his own name. McDonagh asked Blair for information about Claddagh\u2019s financial condition. Blair was not forthcoming with that information. At the end of 2004, because Blair had not sent payments on the loans in some time, McDonagh told Blair that he would not be advancing any more funds. He also told Blair that if he could get money elsewhere, he should \u201cfeel free to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 7} Blair attempted to obtain a line of credit from Fifth Third Bank that was to be secured by Claddagh\u2019s assets. McDonagh refused to sign the loan documentation. According to McDonagh, Blair attempted to hide the loan terms. Blair sent him only two pages of the entire loan agreement, and McDonagh would not sign without seeing the entire agreement. Further, the bank loan would have subordinated McDonagh\u2019s loans to the bank\u2019s security interest. Because McDonagh would not sign the loan documentation, the bank refused to loan money to Blair.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">D. \u201cImpasse Buy-Sell\u201d Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">{\u00b6 8} Subsequently, Blair sought to invoke the \u201cImpasse Buy-Sell\u201d provision in the operating agreement to force McDonagh to sell his interest in the company to Blair. The agreement stated that if a dispute arose between the members over seven enumerated \u201cmanagement matters,\u201d the members would submit the issue to mediation. If mediation was unsuccessful, the mediator could declare an impasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 9} Then a member could invoke the \u201cImpasse Buy-Sell\u201d provision. The \u201cinitiating member\u201d would set a value on the company. The \u201creceiving member\u201d would have 60 days to decide whether to purchase the initiating member\u2019s shares or to sell his shares to the initiating member based on the valuation. The agreement stated that \u201c[ejection by the Receiving Member shall be mandatory, and a failure by the Receiving Member to make an election with the sixty-day period shall conclusively mean that the Receiving Member has elected to sell at the price stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">{\u00b6 10} Without declaring that a dispute over a management matter existed or asking that the dispute be submitted to mediation, Blair sent McDonagh a letter invoking the \u201cImpasse Buy-Sell\u201d provision. He set the value of the company at $42 million. Because McDonagh had advanced $20 million to the company, the remaining interest would be $22 million. Thus, each member\u2019s interest in the company would be approximately $11 million. Blair knew that if McDonagh chose to sell, Blair would have to pay $31 million to cover McDonagh\u2019s advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and his interest in the company. If McDonagh chose to buy, he would pay Blair $11 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">{\u00b6 11} Blair admitted that he never had $31 million or a financial backer willing to give him that amount of money. He contended that the dispute between him and McDonagh had scared off all potential investors. McDonagh contended that no dispute over a management matter existed and that Blair had not followed the terms of the operating agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">E. The Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 12} Blair subsequently filed suit against McDonagh and Claddagh. He alleged causes of action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud. He sought a declaratory judgment that McDonagh was contractually obligated under the terms of the operating agreement to transfer his interest in Claddagh to Blair, and that the $20 million that McDonagh had advanced to Claddagh represented capital contributions and not loans. He also sought an injunction, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 13} McDonagh filed a counterclaim against Blair in which he alleged causes of action for breach of contract, breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty. He sought an accounting, dissolution of the company, and a declaratory judgment declaring the rights and obligations of the parties under the operating agreement and that the $20 million he had advanced to Claddagh represented loans and not capital contributions. He also sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">{\u00b6 14} McDonagh filed cross-claims against Claddagh asking for repayment of loans, an accounting, the appointment of a receiver, and dissolution of the company. Claddagh, in turn, filed various cross-claims against McDonagh, including a request for a declaratory judgment that all of McDonagh\u2019s advances to the company were capital contributions, not loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court eventually ordered the parties to mediate their dispute as required by the operating agreement. It also ordered Blair to provide McDonagh with access to Claddagh\u2019s books and records.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">{\u00b6 16} After the mediator declared an impasse, Blair presented McDonagh with a letter invoking the Impasse Buy-Sell provision and setting the value of the members\u2019 interests at $25 million, exclusive of McDonagh\u2019s advances. But Blair again did not have the money or financial backing to purchase McDonagh\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>F. Improper Use of Company Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 17} Before the mediation, McDonagh hired BBP Partners, led by Robert Brlas, to audit Claddagh\u2019s books and records and to determine its value. BBP sent accountants to Claddagh\u2019s headquarters in Cleveland, and they reviewed documents for over four months at a cost of over $400,000. According to Brlas, Blair and his chief financial officer, Michael Ely, obstructed BBP\u2019s efforts. Ely even took documents from BBP\u2019s workspace and shared them with Blair and his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 18} The accountants discovered that Blair had used Claddagh funds for his personal expenses. Blair contended that he had used Claddagh\u2019s credit cards for convenience but that he had always marked the expenses \u201cpersonal\u201d and had made sure that they went into an account marked \u201cKevin Blair Receivables\u201d as a debt to the company. But BBP accountants identified $32,000 in personal expenses, only $10,000 of which appeared on Claddagh\u2019s books and none of which was ever repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">(\u00b6 19} The accountants also identified an additional $140,000 in credit-card charges by Blair that were likely personal. But they could not definitively state that those charges were personal, because Blair had never provided the necessary information that they had requested. The charges included purchases of groceries, clothing, sunglasses, and a trip to the Caribbean.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 20} In July 2003, Blair used $67,000 in Claddagh funds for a down payment on a $500,000 home. In December of that same year, he made a distribution of $80,000 to each member at a time when Claddagh had no distributable cash flow and had \u201crepaid\u201d the down payment on Claddagh\u2019s books.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 21} Blair also used Claddagh funds to start the \u201cKevin and Stacey Blair Family Athletic Scholarship\u201d for hockey players at Ohio State University. He contended that Supermac\u2019s had often sponsored and supported athletic teams in Ireland, but those donations were made in the name of the company. Blah-contended that the use of his name on the scholarship instead of Claddagh\u2019s was a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">{\u00b6 22} Blair had Claddagh\u2019s corporate law firm reserve trademarks for other potential restaurant concepts and paid for those services with Claddagh funds. The trademarks were assigned to Blair personally and not to Claddagh. He also used Claddagh funds to pay his lawyers and expert witnesses to carry on his litigation against McDonagh. Blair\u2019s counsel received $40,000 from Claddagh for the purpose of suing McDonagh.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">G. Declaratory Judgment \u2014 Loans, Not Capital Contributions</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">{\u00b6 23} The issue whether McDonagh\u2019s advances were loans or capital contributions was tried to the court. The remaining issues proceeded to a jury trial. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the close of the evidence, but before closing argument and the jury charge, the trial court ruled on the parties\u2019 requests for a declaratory judgment. It found that the $20 million that McDonagh had advanced to Claddagh represented loans and not capital advances. The court instructed the jury that the advances were loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">H. Jury Verdicts for McDonagh</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 24} A jury returned verdicts in favor of McDonagh on all of Blair\u2019s claims against him. It found for McDonagh and against Blair on McDonagh\u2019s breach-of-contract and breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims. It awarded McDonagh $400,000 in compensatory damages for the breach of contract. It awarded him $228,000 in compensatory damages and $1,500,000 in punitive damages for the breach of fiduciary duty. The jury also found for McDonagh on all of Claddagh\u2019s cross-claims against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court overruled Blair\u2019s motion for JNOV, for a new trial, and for remittitur. In this appeal, Blair presents six assignments of error for review. Claddagh, which is now in bankruptcy and represented by a bankruptcy trustee, has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">II. Expert Testimony and Questionable Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 26} In his first assignment of error, Blair contends that the trial court erred in admitting speculative testimony into evidence and in allowing counsel to argue based on that testimony. He asserts that the court should not have allowed Brlfl.fi to testify about the $140,000 that he could not identify as personal or business expenses. He also argues that McDonagh\u2019s counsel improperly argued to the jury that it should award an amount of damages that included the $140,000. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">A. Expert Testimony Was not Speculative</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">{\u00b6 27} Evid.R. 702(C) states that an expert witness\u2019s testimony must be \u201cbased on reliable, scientific, technical or other specialized information.\u201d Whether an expert\u2019s opinion is admissible depends on whether the principles and methods employed by the witness to reach his opinion were reliable and not \u201cwhether his conclusions are correct.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the witness\u2019s knowledge \u201cmust not be based on subjective belief or unsupported speculation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the witness need not \u201cutter any \u2018magic language\u2019; i.e., that his opinion was within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>reasonable degree of certainty or reasonable degree of certainty within the particular knowledge of his professional experience.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">{\u00b6 28} The trial court has broad discretion in the admission of evidence, including expert testimony. We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 29} Blair\u2019s contention that Brlas\u2019s testimony regarding the questionable expenses was not reliable is misplaced. Brlas was well qualified to testify as an expert in forensic accounting. His testimony concerned matters within his knowledge and expertise as a certified public and forensic accountant. In general, no dispute existed that his methods were rehable. He and his subordinates had spent months reviewing Claddagh\u2019s general ledger and other available documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 30} In discussing the questionable expenses, Brlas was simply reporting what he had found. He was not asserting an opinion. He said that he could not offer an opinion because Blair had provided insufficient documentation regarding those expenses. Brlas essentially refused to speculate about the expenses absent further information. Under the circumstances, we cannot hold that the trial court\u2019s decision to allow his testimony into evidence was so arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable as to connote an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">B. Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 31} Blair also contends that McDonagh\u2019s counsel improperly argued about the questionable expenses. We agree that the argument was improper, but we cannot hold that it resulted in reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 32} Closing arguments present counsel with the opportunity to comment on the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Counsel has wide latitude in closing argument, but arguments that are not supported by the evidence are improper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In closing argument, McDonagh\u2019s counsel began discussing Brlas\u2019s testimony. Blair\u2019s counsel objected. The trial court overruled the objection, stating, \u201cGo ahead, sir, of what\u2019s in evidence.\u201d Counsel discussed Brlas\u2019s testimony some more and then stated, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to make up your own judgment whether an additional $140,000 should be included [in damages for breach of fiduciary duty] or not.\u201d Blair\u2019s counsel did not object to that portion of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">{\u00b6 34} Generally, a party must show damages with reasonable certainty and cannot leave them to conjecture or speculation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Brlas\u2019s testimony showed that the $140,000 of expenses was speculative, and, therefore, those expenses could not be part of a damages award. Counsel could certainly have discussed Brlas\u2019s testimony about the expenses as it related to credibility, for example. But counsel\u2019s argument that the jury could include the expenses in a damages award was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 35} Nevertheless, counsel\u2019s remarks did not rise to the level of plain error, as they did not affect the basic fairness and integrity of the proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They certainly did not rise to the level of the sort of gross and abusive tactics that we have found to be plain error in our recent cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 36} Blair contends that the jury necessarily included the $140,000 in its damages award. But McDonagh presented substantial evidence of damages, unrelated to the $140,000 in questionable expenses, that would have allowed the jury to award $228,000. Without more specific jury interrogatories that explained the basis of the jury\u2019s damages award, we cannot hold that counsel\u2019s argument was prejudicial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, we overrule Blair\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">III. Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 37} In his second assignment of error, Blair contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for JNOY or for a new trial regarding McDonagh\u2019s claim for breach of fiduciary duty. He argues that McDonagh\u2019s claim for breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of fiduciary duty was actually Claddagh\u2019s claim and that only the corporation could raise it. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">A. Waiver and Invited Error</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 38} Circumstances exist in which a shareholder in a close corporation may bring an individual action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But we need not reach that issue. Even if it were improper for McDonagh to bring the action individually, Blair never raised the issue until he filed his motion for JNOV or for a new trial. A party may not raise an issue, particularly one that is determinative of a claim or cause of action, in a posttrial motion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The parties have a responsibility to raise issues at the earliest possible opportunity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 39} Further, Blair raised his own claim of breach of fiduciary duty. Under his logic, he, too, should have brought it in the name of the company. Instead, he named Claddagh as a defendant. He did not object to the instructions on breach of fiduciary duty and the related damages instructions to the jury. To the contrary, he requested them and argued his case on that basis. Consequently, any error was invited error. Under the invited-error doctrine, a party may not take advantage of an error that the party invited or induced the trial court to make.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 40} The record is clear that Blair followed a specific trial strategy. Only when that strategy backfired and the jury found against him did he raise numerous issues. \u201cA court of appeals should be especially cautious to find plain error when a party may have made a strategic decision that it subsequently regrets.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Consequently, we overrule Blair\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>B. Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 41} In his sixth assignment of error, Blair contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for JNOV and for a new trial on his claim for breach of fiduciary duty. He argues that the evidence unequivocally showed that McDonagh had breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to consent to the line of credit that Blair had negotiated with Fifth Third Bank, and that McDonagh knew was necessary for the good of the company. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 42} A limited-liability company, like a partnership, involves a fiduciary relationship.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That relationship imposes on the members a duty to exercise the utmost good faith and honesty in all dealings and transactions related to the company.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 43} Similarly, the parties to a contract owe each other a duty of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cGood faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party.\u201d Bad faith may be \u201cthe abuse of a power to specify terms, [or] interference with or a failure to cooperate in the other party\u2019s performance.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 44} We review the decision to grant or deny a motion for JNOV de novo. A JNOV is proper if, upon viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving party.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But where substantial evidence exists to support the nonmoving party\u2019s side of the case, upon which reasonable minds could reach different conclusions, the court must deny the motion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We review a ruling on a motion for a new trial under an abuse-of-discretion standard.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>{\u00b6 45} McDonagh presented substantial evidence showing that he had acted in good faith and that he had not breached his fiduciary duty. The evidence showed that McDonagh had withheld his consent for the loan for legitimate reasons, the most important of which was that Blair had refused to provide necessary financial information to evaluate the business and the necessity for the loan. Further, the Fifth Third loan would have subordinated McDonagh\u2019s loans. Under the circumstances, he was not acting in bad faith when he faded to consent to the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">{\u00b6 46} Blair is simply arguing that his version of events was more credible. But in considering a motion for JNOV, a court does not weigh the evidence or test the credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Consequently, we cannot hold that the trial court erred in overruling Blair\u2019s motion for JNOV or that the court abused its discretion in overruling his motion for a new trial. We overrule Blair\u2019s sixth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">IV. Loans v. Capital Contributions</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 47} In his fifth assignment of error, Blair contends that the trial court erred in ruling that McDonagh\u2019s advances to Claddagh were loans rather than capital contributions. He argues that under the language of the operating agreement, the advances were capital contributions. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">A. Operating Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 48} The interpretation of a written instrument is, in the first instance, a matter of law for the court. If it is clear and unambiguous, the court need not go beyond the plain language of the agreement to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations; it must simply give effect to the contractual language.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But if the provisions of a contract are ambiguous, an issue of fact exists.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\"> {\u00b6 49} In the construction of a written instrument, a court\u2019s primary objective is to give effect to the parties\u2019 intent, which can be found in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>language they chose to employ. The court should read the contract as a whole and gather the intent of each part from the whole.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 50} Section 2 of the operating agreement is entitled \u201cCapital Contributions.\u201d Section 2(b) states that \u201c[t]he Members contemplate that the additional requirements of the Company shall be met through a bank loan and/or capital contribution by McDonagh. The Company is hereby authorized and directed to accept additional capital contributions from McDonagh in such amount as the Members deem necessary or appropriate, in consideration for which the Company is authorized and directed to issue to McDonagh Preferred Units, the price of which shall be $1,000 per Unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 51} Under Section 3(g) of the agreement, the distributable cash flow of the company would be calculated at least annually at the end of each year and distributed to the members within 90 days. If the company made a distribution to the members, a holder of preferred units would be paid in full before the holders of the common units.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 52} Blair contends that these provisions showed that the parties contemplated that any advances by McDonagh would be treated as capital contributions rather than loans, and that if a loan was required, both members had to agree to its terms. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">{\u00b6 53} Section 2(d) provided that \u201c[notwithstanding anything contained herein, no Member shall be required to make any capital contribution or loan to the Company after the date hereof. If the General Manager determines that the Company requires additional funds, subject to Section 6 of this Agreement, any Member may, but shall not be obligated to, advance such funds.\u201d Under the plain language of this section, McDonagh did not have to provide loans or capital, but could provide either if he so chose. Consequently, the operating agreement did not show that McDonagh\u2019s advances were necessarily capital contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">B. Evidence of Loans</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">{\u00b6 54} Blair also argues that even if the advances were not capital contributions under the agreement, no meeting of the minds occurred as to any of the terms of an oral loan agreement, and that, therefore, no binding contract existed. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">{\u00b6 55} A meeting of the minds is an essential prerequisite to the enforcement of an oral contract.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The terms of a contract may be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>from the \u201cwords, deeds, acts, and silence of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">{\u00b6 56} R.C. 2721.10 provides that when a declaratory-judgment action involves an issue of fact, the court may determine that issue in the same manner that it determines issues of fact in other civil actions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Our inquiry, then, involves whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A reviewing court will not reverse judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all essential elements of the case as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 57} The evidence showed that Blair had treated the advances as loans on Claddagh\u2019s tax returns. He had also taken interest deductions on his personal income taxes based on Claddagh\u2019s net operating losses, which were due, in part, to the amounts owed on McDonagh\u2019s advances. McDonagh and Supermac\u2019s paid Irish taxes on the accrued interest owed on the loans, even after Blair had stopped making payments, because McDonagh expected the loans and interest to be repaid and had to report the expected interest income.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 58} Blair made payments to McDonagh from 2000 to 2004. He wrote \u201cloan\u201d or \u201cloan repayment\u201d or similar language on the memo line of the checks. Blair wrote in a February 2004 letter that \u201cPat and I each own one-half or fifty percent of each of the companies. The financing provided by Pat to the companies was in a series of loans.\u201d Claddagh\u2019s financial statements and general ledger consistently recorded McDonagh\u2019s payments as loans to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 59} Further, one of Blair\u2019s accountants specifically testified that McDonagh\u2019s advances were properly characterized as loans. After the litigation commenced, Blair\u2019s counsel tried to get the accountant to characterize the loans as capital contributions on the financial statements. The accountant refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">{\u00b6 60} Because competent, credible evidence supported the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties had agreed that the advances were loans, this court will not reverse the court\u2019s decision. Consequently, we overrule Blair\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>C. Closing Argument about the Loans</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 61} In his third assignment of error, Blair contends that McDonagh\u2019s closing arguments were improper. He argues that the trial court should not have allowed McDonagh\u2019s counsel to use the trial court\u2019s ruling that the advances were loans to argue that Blair was not truthful when he testified that the loans were capital contributions. He further argues that the trial court should have granted his motion for a new trial on this basis. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 62} The record shows that Blair failed to object to the arguments he now contends were improper. Even when a party fails to object, the trial court must act to correct any prejudicial effect when gross and abusive misconduct occurs.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But a trial court\u2019s duty to intervene does not apply when counsel\u2019s arguments are based on the evidence.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 63} Our review of the record shows that, for the most part, McDonagh\u2019s arguments were fair comments on the evidence. Blair\u2019s credibility was at issue because of evidence showing that he had treated the advances as loans, although he repeatedly asserted at trial that they were capital contributions. Counsel mentioned the court\u2019s ruling only once in connection with Blair\u2019s credibility. Under the circumstances, we cannot hold that the argument was the sort of gross and abusive misconduct that required the court to intervene. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the argument or in overruling his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We overrule Blair\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">V. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">{\u00b6 64} In his fourth assignment of error, Blair contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for JNOV, a new trial, or remittitur on the award of punitive damages. He argues that McDonagh failed to present clear and convincing evidence of malice, that the award of punitive damages violated the statutory cap on such damages in R.C. 2315.21, and that the award violated his right to due process. This assignment of error has some merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">A. Actual Malice</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">{\u00b6 65} An award of punitive damages may be appropriate on a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>for breach of fiduciary duty upon a showing of malice.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u201cActual malice, necessary for an award of punitive damages, is (1) that state of mind under which a person\u2019s conduct is characterized by hatred, ill will or a spirit of revenge, or (2) a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">{\u00b6 66} In this case, the evidence showed that Blair had used corporate funds for his own purposes and that he had deliberately withheld documents to cover up his conduct. We hold that McDonagh presented evidence from which the jury could have reasonably found by clear and convincing evidence that Blair\u2019s actions had showed a conscious disregard for McDonagh\u2019s rights that had a great probability of causing substantial harm. Therefore, the evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding of malice.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">B. Punitive-Damages Cap</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 67} Blair also contends that the punitive-damages cap in R.C. 2315.21(D) applied in this case. But he relies on the current version of the statute that became effective on April 7, 2005. Several courts have held that this statute may not be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus, a court cannot apply it to causes of action that arose before the statute\u2019s effective date even if some of the conduct giving rise to the cause of action occurred after the effective date.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 68} In this case, the claims warranting punitive damages arose well before the statute\u2019s effective date, starting in 2001 and continuing until after the lawsuit was filed in September 2005.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Therefore, the current version of R.C. 2315.21 can not be applied retroactively to that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>{\u00b6 69} The versions of the statute in effect during the time when the claims herein accrued had been enacted in response to an Ohio Supreme Court decision declaring a 1997 version unconstitutional in toto.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Those versions, which became effective on July 6, 2001, and November 7, 2002, contained no cap on punitive damages. Consequently, no cap applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">C. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 70} Blair also contends that the punitive-damages award was excessive and violated his constitutional right to due process. McDonagh contends that Blair waived this issue, but our review of the record shows that he did raise it, although somewhat belatedly, in his reply memorandum in support of his motion for JNOY, for a new trial, and for remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 71} While this case was pending, the Ohio Supreme Court decided <em>Barnes v. Univ. Hosps. of </em>Cleveland,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> in which it specifically applied recent United States Supreme Court cases on the issue.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In <em>Barnes, </em>the court set out three factors that must be considered in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive: \u201c(1) the degree of reprehensibility of the party\u2019s conduct, (2) the relation of the punitive damages to the actual harm inflicted by the party, and (3) sanctions for comparable conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 72} Since the trial court could not have considered these factors, we sustain Blair\u2019s fourth assignment of error in part. We reverse the award of punitive damages and remand the case to the trial court for the parties to present evidence on the three factors and for the trial court to determine if the punitive-damages award was excessive based on those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">VI. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">{\u00b6 73} We overrule Blair\u2019s first, second, third, fifth, and sixth assignments of error. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to the issue of liability and the award of compensatory damages. But we sustain Blair\u2019s fourth assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ment of error in part. We reverse the award of punitive damages and remand the cause for further proceedings in accordance with the terms of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-5\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\">. <em>Miller v.
