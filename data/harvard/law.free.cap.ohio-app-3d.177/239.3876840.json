Dunfee was convicted of vandalism, in violation of R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b), after a bench trial in the Miami County Court of Common Pleas. The charge stemmed from Dunfee damaging the window of a rear passenger door of a sheriffs cruiser. By agreement of the parties, Dunfee was tried on stipulated facts and the written arguments of counsel. The trial court found him guilty, and it sentenced Dunfee to six months in prison and ordered him to pay costs in the amount of $534.50. Dunfee appeals from his conviction, raising two assignments of error. For the following reasons, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">{\u00b6 2} I. \u201cThe trial court improperly found appellant guilty of vandalism of business property under R.C. 2909.05(b)(1)(B) when the property that was harmed was governmental property under R.C. 2909.05(B)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>{\u00b6 3} II. \u201cAssuming arguendo that governmental property is not legally distinct from business property, the evidence against appellant was insufficient to convict him of vandalism under R.C. 2909.05(b)(1)(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">{\u00b6 4} In his first assignment of error, Dunfee claims that he should not have been convicted of violating R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b), because the cruiser window constituted governmental, not business, property. Alternatively, he argues in his second assignment of error that his conviction under R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) was improper because the stipulated facts are insufficient to satisfy that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2909.05 enumerates several circumstances that constitute vandalism. Of relevance to this case, R.C. 2909.05(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(B)(1) No person shall knowingly cause physical harm to property that is owned or possessed by another, when either of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(a) The property is used by its owner or possessor in the owner\u2019s or possessor\u2019s profession, business, trade, or occupation, and the value of the property or the amount of physical harm involved is five hundred dollars or more;</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(b) Regardless of the value of the property or the amount of damage done, the property or its equivalent is necessary in order for its owner or possessor to engage in the owner\u2019s or possessor\u2019s profession, business, trade, or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(2) No person shall knowingly cause serious physical harm to property that is owned, leased, or controlled by a governmental entity. A governmental entity includes, but is not limited to, the state or a political subdivision of the state, a school district, the board of trustees of a public library or public university, or any other body corporate and politic responsible for governmental activities only in geographical areas smaller than that of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cSerious physical harm\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical harm to property that results in loss to the value of the property of five hundred dollars or more.\u201d R.C. 2909.05(F)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">{\u00b6 11} The parties stipulated to the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c1. The defendant did knowingly cause physical damage in Miami County to a 2006 Ford Crown Victoria Sheriffs Cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c2. The owner of record of the Cruiser is the Miami County Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c3. The possessor of the Cruiser is the Miami County Sheriffs Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201c4. The physical harm was to a single movable window in the right rear door.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c5. The window was broken at approximately 9:00pm on September 21, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c6. It was repaired by approximately 12:30pm the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c7. The repair cost $346.09 and the Defendant has reimbursed the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">(\u00b6 19} \u201c8. The Cruiser was not in service from approximately 9:30pm on September 21, 2006 until approximately 12:30pm the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c9. The Cruiser was capable of being used in the possessor\u2019s profession, business, trade or occupation from approximately 9:30pm on September 21, 2006 until approximately 12:30pm the following day, except during that period the Cruiser could not be used in the possessor\u2019s profession, business, trade or occupation of transporting prisoners or individuals in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c10. The Cruiser could not be used in any capacity of the possessor\u2019s profession, business, trade or occupation for that two hour period when the physical damage was being repaired from approximately 10:30am on September 22, 2006 until 12:30pm on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c11. The possessor has a total of twelve marked Cruisers like the one at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c12. The possessor has a total of thirty-eight vehicles of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">{\u00b6 24} In his bench brief on the merits, Dunfee conceded that the stipulated facts supported that he damaged property \u201cowned or possessed by another.\u201d He disputed, however, that the property was \u201cnecessary\u201d for the owner or possessor to engage in its profession, business, trade, or occupation. Although Dunfee noted that there was a \u201cvery real concern whether either the Miami County Commissioners or the Miami County Sheriffs Department are engaged in a profession, business, trade, or occupation,\u201d he did not expressly argue that R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) was inapplicable to his situation because the cruiser constituted governmental property.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court found that the stipulated facts supported a conviction under R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b). The court stated that the central issue was whether the cruiser window was necessary for its owner or possessor to engage in its profession, business, trade, or occupation. The trial court found that the window was necessary and that all other elements were satisfied by the stipulation. Dunfee was sentenced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">{\u00b6 26} On appeal, Dunfee claims that R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) does not apply to governmental property, such as a police cruiser. Applying rules of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>construction, Dunfee claims that R.C. 2909.05(B)(2) was the only statute under which he could be prosecuted. The state responds that R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) has no enumerated exceptions and, therefore, the rule of statutory construction \u201cespressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d \u2014 the mention of one thing is the exclusion of another \u2014 has no application. The state further notes that we affirmed a conviction under R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) for harm to a police cruiser in <em>State v. Murray </em>(1986), Clark App. No. CA 2156, 1986 WL 11912.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">{\u00b6 27} As argued by Dunfee, the Ohio legislature identified several categories of property in the subsections of R.C. 2909.05. R.C. 2909.05(A) prohibits \u201cserious physical harm to an occupied structure or any of its contents.\u201d R.C. 2909.05(C) concerns serious physical harm to cemeteries, cemetery enclosures, or memorials to the dead. R.C. 2909.05(D) prohibits physical harms to places of burial (i.e., tomb, crypt, or casket) or other enclosures for the dead. R.C. 2909.05(B)(1) relates to property used for business purposes, and R.C. 2909.05(B)(2) concerns governmental property.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 28} The state \u2014 as noted above \u2014 argues that R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) does not \u201cenumerate any exceptions\u201d and, thus, the rule of statutory construction \u201cespressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d has no application. We agree with the state. R.C. 2909.05(B)(1) is written broadly. By its terms, it applies to any property owned by anyone other than the defendant. R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) does not limit the ownership of property that is subject to its terms. Rather, the only limitation is based on the use of the property. We find nothing in R.C. 2909.05 which precludes a prosecution under R.C. 2905.05(B)(1)(b) when the property at issue is governmental property.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 29} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b6 30} Dunfee next claims that there was insufficient evidence that the damaged property was necessary for the Sheriffs Department to carry out its law-enforcement functions. Dunfee further claims that the state failed to establish that the Sheriffs Department engages in a \u201cprofession, business, trade, or occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">{\u00b6 31} As recognized by the state, the case law interpreting R.C. 2909.05(B)(1), as it relates to governmental property, is sparse. Indeed, we have found only two cases that address R.C. 2909.05(B)(l)(b)\u2019s application to governmental property. In <em>State v. McMillin </em>(1987), Gallia App. No. 85 CA 15, 1987 WL 13490, the defendant was charged with vandalism of a police cruiser, in violation of R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b), and other offenses when he failed to obey an order to stop his vehicle, drove through a roadblock, and had drugs and weapons in his vehicle. McMillan challenged his conviction under the then existing version of R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) on the ground that there was no evidence that the owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>damaged police cruiser, the city of Gallipolis, engaged in any profession, business, trade, or occupation. The Fourth District rejected McMillin\u2019s assignment of error, stating that \u201cthe work of the City of Gallipolis can be commonly construed as the \u2018business\u2019 of the city.\u201d Although R.C. 2909.05 has been amended since <em>McMillin, </em>both the current version and the version applied in <em>McMillin </em>had provisions dealing with property used for business purposes, R.C. 2909.05(B)(1), and governmental property, R.C. 2909.05(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Murray, </em>we likewise affirmed a conviction under R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) based on damage to a police cruiser. We stated: \u201cThe jury heard evidence that the defendant slashed the right front and rear tires of a Springfield Police Cruiser and that Officer Gundolf was unable to respond to calls until after the tires had been replaced. The evidence presented was sufficient to support the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 33} Parenthetically, in neither of these cases was it asserted that R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) did not apply because the cruiser was governmental property.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 34} The state also relies upon <em>State v. Vandyke, </em>Lorain App. No. 05CA008723, 2007-Ohio-1356, 2007 WL 879673, in which the Ninth District affirmed a conviction for vandalism of a police cruiser. The court stated, \u201cThe weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that appellant reasonably knew that repeatedly kicking the door of the police cruiser would cause damage to the vehicle. In this case, there is no dispute that the cruiser window shattered. Furthermore, Officer Pultrone testified that the broken window required that the cruiser be placed out of service due to safety concerns, to prevent escapes and to prevent access by passengers to police equipment and weapons.\u201d We note, however, that Vandyke was charged with a violation of R.C. 2909.05(B). The Ninth District did not specify which subsection of R.C. 2909.05(B) it had considered in affirming the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">{\u00b6 35} Although R.C. 2909.05 has been amended, we find <em>McMillin </em>and <em>Murray </em>to be persuasive. According to the stipulations, Dunfee caused physical harm to a police cruiser, which was in the possession of the Miami County Sheriffs Department. The Sheriffs Department is in the business of law enforcement. <em>McMillin, </em>supra. Furthermore, Dunfee is bound by the facts he stipulated: that the cruiser was used in the Miami County Sheriffs Department\u2019s profession, business, trade, or occupation. Stipulations 9 and 10, quoted above. The error now complained of \u2014 if any \u2014 was invited by Dunfee.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">{\u00b6 36} Moreover, we find the evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that the cruiser window was necessary for the Miami County Sheriffs Department to engage in law enforcement. The parties stipulated that the damaged cruiser could not be used for transporting prisoners or other persons in custody while the window was broken and that it was unusable during the two hours that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>window was being repaired. The transportation of prisoners and others in custody is a basic function of law enforcement, and a cruiser capable of performing that function is necessary to the business of the Miami County Sheriffs Department. Even though the Sheriffs Department had a total of 12 vehicles, a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that each cruiser was necessary for the functioning of the Sheriffs Department. See <em>Murray, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">{\u00b6 37} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">{\u00b6 38} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-7\">Fain, J., concurs.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b283-8\">Grady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AvK\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 39} I would sustain defendant-appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 2909.05(B)(1) prohibits physical harm to property that is owned or possessed by another, and imposes two further alternative circumstances for its violation. Paragraph (a) applies when the property is \u201cused\u201d by the owner in his business and the value of the loss is $500 or more. Paragraph (b) applies \u201c[rjegardless of the value of the property or the amount of damage done,\u201d but only when \u201cthe property or its equivalent is <em>necessary </em>in order for its owner or possessor to engage in the owner or possessor\u2019s profession, business, trade, or occupation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cNecessary\u201d is an adjective, denoting an article or matter \u201cthat cannot be done without: that must be done or had: (is) absolutely required.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International New Dictionary (1969). The American Heritage Dictionary defines necessary to mean \u201cabsolutely essential.\u201d It was the state\u2019s burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the sheriffs cruiser defendant damaged was necessary to the sheriff in discharging the duties of his office. R.C. 2901.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">{\u00b6 42} The stipulated evidence demonstrates that the cruiser was unavailable for use by the sheriff, due to the physical harm defendant had caused, between 9:30 p.m. on the date of his alleged offense until 12:30 p.m. the following day. That result does not, however, likewise demonstrate that during those hours the sheriffs use of the cruiser was necessary in order for him to perform or discharge his duties. To prove that matter, the state was required to offer evidence showing that no alternative to his use of the damaged cruiser was readily available to the sheriff during those hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">{\u00b6 43} The stipulated evidence also demonstrates that, during those same hours, the sheriff possessed eleven other cruisers. The state offered no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>that those other cruisers were not then available for the sheriffs use in the same way or for the same purpose for which the damaged cruiser would have been, but for the physical harm defendant caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 44} The state\u2019s position is that, because his fleet of cruisers is necessary for the sheriffs performance of his duties, each and every one of his cruisers is likewise necessary for purposes of R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b). However, defendant was not convicted of causing physical harm to a class of property, but instead of committing physical harm to the particular cruiser that he damaged. The standard the state urges us to employ would permit the state to prove a violation of R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b), for which no proof of the value of the loss is required when the property is necessary, on the more lenient \u201cuse\u201d standard of R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(a), for which proof of damages valued at $500 or more is required. Any doubt concerning which ought to apply is resolved by R.C. 2901.04(A), which provides that \u201csections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 45} I would reverse and vacate defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence on a finding that the evidence before the court was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding that he violated R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b), the offense of which he was convicted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
