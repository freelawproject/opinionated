Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 1} This matter is before the court on the Notice of Appeal of Robert C. Wood, filed May 21, 2007. Wood and Citibank South Dakota, N.A. (\u201cCitibank\u201d) entered into an agreement pursuant to which Citibank extended credit to Wood, and Wood agreed to repay the principal amount plus interest to Citibank. Wood failed to pay pursuant to the terms of the agreement, and Citibank obtained a judgment against Wood in the amount of $7,821.44, in Clark County Municipal Court. Wood pursued arbitration with Blue Ridge Arbitration, and on March 22, 2005, Blue Ridge issued a decision finding that Wood had settled his account with Citibank in full, and the decision ordered Citibank to set aside any judgments it had obtained against Wood. The award issued by Blue Ridge contained a certificate of service indicating that it was mailed to Citibank on April 4, 2005, via first class mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 2} On July 7, 2005, Citibank filed a \u201cPetitioner\u2019s Motion to Vacate Award\u201d in Clark County Common Pleas Court, pursuant to R.C. 2711.10(D), which provides, \u201cIn any of the following cases, the court of common pleas shall make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration if: . * * * (D) The arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d R.C. 2711.13 requires that notice to vacate an award \u201cmust be served upon the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is delivered to the parties in interest.\u201d Citibank did not attach a copy of the parties\u2019 agreement to its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Wood filed a pro se answer and counterclaim for confirmation of the award. R.C. 2711.09 provides that an application for an order confirming an award may be made \u201c[a]t any time within one year\u201d after the award is issued. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim for confirmation without explanation. The trial court then held a hearing on the motion to vacate on September 30, 2005, at which it did not take evidence from any witnesses or admit any exhibits. Instead, it listened to unsworn statements from Wood and counsel for Citibank. According to Citibank, the parties\u2019 agreement provides, should a dispute arise between the parties, that either party may elect to arbitrate the dispute using one of the following three organizations: the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), JAMS, or the National Arbitration Forum (\u201cNAF\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 4} Wood argued, \u201c[T]here is without doubt an agreement in place which calls for arbitration in the Blue Ridge Arbitration forum in disputes between the plaintiff and the defendant in any matter subsequent to July 12, 2004.\u201d According to Wood, he effected an accord and satisfaction with Citibank, pursuant to R.C. 1303.40. Wood stated that he sent an \u201cagreement\u201d and a \u201cnegotiable instrument\u201d to Citibank. According to Wood, \u201c[C]lear instructions indicated that to refuse the new terms, plaintiff was to return the instrument without negotiating it. Instead plaintiff negotiated that instrument on July 12, 2004. Thus, the plaintiff is bound to arbitration under the agreement.\u201d The Clark County Common Pleas Court granted Citibank\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 5} In an entry issued in response to Wood\u2019s motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court determined that the motion to vacate had been timely filed and that Citibank \u201ccannot be compelled to arbitrate a dispute with Blue Ridge Arbitration Forum when said organization was not one of the three organizations set forth in the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 6} Wood appealed, and we reversed and remanded the matter for further proceedings, finding that the trial court had committed various procedural errors. In terms of the timeliness of the petition to vacate, we noted, \u201c[T]he current record indicates that Citibank\u2019s motion to vacate was filed on July 7, 2005, and was not served on Wood until July 9, 2005. As a result, Citibank\u2019s motion appears untimely on its face. However, because the record is incomplete and because the trial court applied an improper method of analysis, we will remand this matter to allow Citibank and Wood to present evidence on the date of mailing or the postmark date.\u201d <em>Citibank South Dakota, N.A. v. Wood, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 269, 2006-Ohio-5755, 862 N.E.2d 576, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cWhat this means for purposes of the present case is that Citibank may be successful in invoking the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction if Citibank has a copy of the postmarked envelope for the arbitration award or can establish by other evidence that the award was mailed on a date later than the date reflected on the award.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Id. at \u00b6 29. We further noted in a footnote that \u201cWood is required to present some extrinsic evidence of the date that the award was mailed, since the statement on the face of the award was not made under oath. As we have stressed, the court must be presented with legally admissible evidence, not unauthenticated documents.\u201d Id. at fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 8} We further noted, \u201c[E]ven if Citibank established jurisdiction, Citibank failed to present <em>evidence </em>in the trial court to justify vacating the arbitration award. In this regard, Citibank\u2019s attorney claimed, <em>again without proof, </em>that its contract with Wood did not specify Blue Ridge as a proper arbitration forum. However, no copy of the contract is in the record. In addition, no witnesses identified or verified any documents that were, in fact, attached to the motion to vacate. We have previously noted that bare contentions are insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof that R.C. 2711.10 imposes on parties filing objections to arbitration awards.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 9} We also noted, \u201cIn view of Citibank\u2019s failure to present any <em>evidence </em>to the trial court, the court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 10} We also noted that Citibank had failed to attach various documents to its motion to vacate, as required by R.C. 2711.14, such as the arbitration agreement. Finally, we noted that Wood\u2019s motion to confirm the award was timely, pursuant to R.C. 2711.09, and we noted that a court <em>must </em>grant a timely motion to confirm \u201c \u2018unless a timely motion for modification or vacation has been made and cause to modify or vacate is shown.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 42, quoting <em>Warren Edn. Assn. v. Warren City Bd. of Edn. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 170, 18 OBR 225, 480 N.E.2d 456, syllabus. In other words, \u201cthe court\u2019s only choices were to confirm the award or vacate it upon a finding under R.C. 2711.10(D) that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority. The court could not possibly have made this choice before hearing evidence on the matter. As a result, the court clearly erred by granting a motion to dismiss the counterclaim prior to the hearing.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 11} On January 3, 2007, a judicial notice of guardianship was filed with the trial court, providing, \u201cIn October 2005 Robert C. Wood has been appointed a guardian, Ann K. Wood, who will be standing in for Robert C. Wood from this time forward.\u201d Attached to the notice is a document entitled \u201cLetters of Guardianship\u201d from the Probate Court of Clark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 12} Upon remand, a status conference was held, and following the conference, the court issued an entry on January 3, 2007, providing that counsel for Citibank \u201cinformed the Court that he does have evidence to present to the Court that Citibank filed its motion to vacate the arbitration finding within the three-month time period established by Section 2711.13 of the Ohio Revised Code. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Mrs. Wood informed the Court that she is in possession of a dated envelope which suggests that Citibank did not file its motion within the appropriate time-period. Accordingly, the Court decided that it would set the matter for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d The trial court set the evidentiary hearing for April 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">{\u00b6 13} On January 9, 2007, counsel for Citibank filed \u201cPlaintiffs Motion to Correct Court\u2019s Entry of January 3, 2007.\u201d The motion provides, \u201cThe Court\u2019s Entry indicates that the undersigned informed the Court that Citibank is in possession of evidence that it filed its Motion to Vacate the arbitration finding timely pursuant to law. To the best of my recollection, I stated that Citibank would like to present legal issues in support of its claims in this case by filing a dispositive motion. This may address the timeliness of its filing to vacate the arbitration or it may address other legal basis for Citibank to obtain judgment. The Court acknowledged this representation indicating that Mr. Rosenberg may have other issues he wants to present to the Court. Therefore, the Court\u2019s entry which appears to limit the subject matter of a dispositive motion to commit the undersigned to a representation that Citibank has evidence to present that it filed its Motion to Vacate the arbitration finding timely, is misplaced. Citibank simply seeks to file with the Court any applicable dispositive motion available to it and will do so by February 16, 2007. The Court\u2019s entry appears to be limiting it to the issue of the timeliness of the Motion to Vacate and further makes a representation that to the best of the undersigned\u2019s recollection, was not specifically stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 14} On February 2, 2007, the trial court issued an entry, which stated as follows: \u201cPlaintiffs motion to correct this Court\u2019s Entry of January 3, 2007 is OVERRULED, however, the Court\u2019s January 3, 2007 Entry shall not be construed in a manner that will limit the parties\u2019 right to advance legal arguments of their choosing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 15} On February 27, 2007, Citibank filed a motion for extension of time to file a motion for summary judgment. On March 16, 2007, the trial court extended the time for filing motions for summary judgment, and the court\u2019s entry provides, \u201cThe evidentiary hearing scheduled for April 20, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. will not be changed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 16} Attached to Citibank\u2019s motion for summary judgment is the affidavit of Elizabeth Barnette, an employee of Citibank Credit Services, Inc. (USA), a service company for Citibank. Barnette is a custodian of records for Citibank, whose \u201cduties include having custody and control of records relating to the AT &amp; T Universal MasterCard Account that was issued to Robert C. Wood.\u201d The affidavit further provides, \u201cAttached as Exhibit B is the Cardmember Agreement applicable to the Account, which lists the only three tribunals before which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Citibank and Robert C. Wood may arbitrate disputes, which are the American Arbitration Association, JAMS and National Arbitration Forum. Blue Ridge was not one of the tribunals authorized to handle arbitrations between Citibank and its customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 17} Attached as Exhibit A to the affidavit is a letter from Wood to Citibank, dated June 17, 2004, and entitled, \u201cLetter of Intent to Tender Partial Payment and Other Consideration as Satisfaction in Full,\u201d which provides in part, \u201cAny dispute between you and me under this Agreement or any previous agreement between you and me will be resolved by final and binding arbitration at the National Arbitration Council or Blue Ridge Arbitration.\u201d Also attached to the affidavit as Exhibit B is the Cardmember Agreement, which sets forth the three possible forums for arbitration as Barnette indicated. The Agreement provides that it is \u201cgoverned by the Federal Arbitration Act.\u201d Attached as Exhibit C to the affidavit is a letter dated March 26, 2004, to Blue Ridge from Citibank, which provides in part, \u201cThis letter is formal notice to [Blue Ridge] * * * that the Bank has not agreed, and will not agree, to arbitrate any disputes before [Blue Ridge].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 18} Wood filed \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion to Strike Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment and Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment in his Favor and Confirmation of the Award,\u201d on March 28, 2007. Attached to Wood\u2019s motion for summary judgment is the affidavit of Ann K. Wood, averring that she is Wood\u2019s \u201cspouse and guardian.\u201d The affidavit provides that Ann has \u201cfirst hand material fact knowledge of the events of this case from the Defendant\u2019s position.\u201d According to Ann, she is \u201cin receipt of the envelope in which Blue Ridge mailed my Arbitration Award, and [sic] it is postmarked April 4, 2005.\u201d The affidavit further provides, \u201cI shall produce evidence of the April 4, 2005 mailing at the evidentiary hearing in this instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 19} On April 11, 2007, Citibank filed \u201cPlaintiffs Reply in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d and on April 13, 2007, Wood filed \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion to Strike Plaintiffs Reply; Defendant\u2019s Reply to Plaintiffs Reply; Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment; Defendant\u2019s Challenge of Subject Matter Jurisdiction of Plaintiff; and Motion for Sanctions Against Plaintiffs Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 20} The court sustained Citibank\u2019s motion for summary judgment on April 19, 2007. The court\u2019s entry begins, \u201cThis matter is before the Court on plaintiffs February 26, 2007 motion for summary judgment, the defendant\u2019s March 28, 2007 motion to strike plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, the defendant\u2019s March 28, 2007 motion for summary judgment, and the defendant\u2019s April 13, 2007 motion to strike plaintiffs reply in support of its motion for summary judgment.\u201d Of note is the fact that Citibank moved for an extension of time to file its summary-judgment motion on February 27, 2007. After citing Civ.R. 56(C), the trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>{\u00b6 21} \u201cEven construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the defendant, the Court finds that the Blue Ridge letter and its purported \u2018award\u2019 is void ab initio and unenforceable for the three reasons set forth in plaintiffs motion. First, the parties did not mutually agree to arbitrate before Blue Ridge, second, the defendant had no right to unilaterally modify the card-member agreement, and third, courts have universally rejected awards issued by Blue Ridge and other sham \u2018arbitration\u2019 companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cEven construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the defendant, there exists no genuine issue as to material fact, and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cAccordingly, the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is SUSTAINED. Costs and attorney fees are hereby awarded to plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 24} The evidentiary hearing scheduled for April 20 was never held.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b6 25} On May 4, 2007, Wood filed \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion for Clarification,\u201d \u201cDefendant\u2019s Notice of Intent to Appeal,\u201d \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion for Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law Pursuant to Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 52,\u201d and \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion for a New Trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 26} Attached to Wood\u2019s motion for a new trial is a photocopy of an envelope, along with an affidavit from Ann Wood that provides, \u201cI, Ann K. Wood, under penalty of perjury, hereby certify that the attached copy of the envelope from Blue Ridge Arbitration which shows a postmark of April 4, 2005 is a true and accurate copy of the envelope which contained the Award which is the subject\u201d of this case. Apparently, this is the envelope that Wood averred she would present at the evidentiary hearing that was never held.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 27} On May 14, 2007, Citibank filed \u201cPlaintiffs Submission of Attorney Fees,\u201d stating that it was entitled to $7,484.30 in fees. Attached to the motion are redacted invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 28} Wood filed his notice of appeal on May 21, 2007. On May 25, 2007, Citibank filed \u201cPlaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Pursuant to Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 52\u201d and \u201cPlaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Motion for Clarification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">{\u00b6 29} On May 31, the court issued an entry that provides, \u201cThe motions of Defendant, Robert C. Wood for a new trial, for clarification and for findings of facts and conclusions of law are OVERRULED.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cBy granting Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment the Court found that Plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendant and the notice of intent letter did not in any way alter the Cardmember Agreement. The[re] is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>arbitration award to confirm. The Blue Ridge letter and its \u2018award\u2019 are void and held for naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cPlaintiff is awarded attorney fees in the amount of $7,484.30 against Defendant Robert Wood. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">II. Assigned Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 32} Wood asserts three assignments of error. His first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cCitibank has failed to establish subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">{\u00b6 34} Wood argues that we \u201csuccinctly and clearly * * * delineated the requirements to establish subject matter jurisdiction by providing some acceptable evidence as to the date the arbitration award in Wood\u2019s favor was mailed. The only two pieces of potential evidence are 1) the affidavit attached to the BlueRidge notice with the mailing date which was filed with Citibank\u2019s [motion to vacate] * * * and 2) Wood\u2019s affidavit accompanying the certified copy of the envelope with the postmark. Both the date of mailing in the Blue Ridge affidavit and the postmark date on Wood\u2019s envelope are April 4, 2005 which means that Citibank has failed or refused to establish subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">{\u00b6 35} Citibank does not address the trial court\u2019s alleged lack of jurisdiction but rather argues the merits of the matter. Citibank argues that Wood failed \u201cto produce any evidence disputing: (i) that the Card Agreement governed the Account; (ii) that the Card Agreement\u2019s arbitration provision did not authorize arbitration before Blue Ridge; and (iii) that Citibank specifically advised Blue Ridge that Citibank did not consent to any Blue Ridge arbitration.\u201d According to Citibank, it \u201chad no obligation under the FAA [Federal Arbitration Act] or Ohio\u2019s arbitration statute, R.C. 2711.13, to seek to vacate the award because the award was void and never constituted an actual arbitration award. Both statutes presuppose that for any award a party may seek to confirm or vacate, such award is the result of a valid, agreed-upon arbitration proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cCiv. R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment may be granted when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. * * * Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is de novo.\u201d <em>Cohen v. G/C Contracting Corp., </em>Greene App. No. 2006 CA 102, 2007-Ohio-4888, 2007 WL 2743707.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">{\u00b6 37} Citibank relies upon a recent case from the Supreme Court of Montana, <em>Citibank (South Dakota) N.A. v. Dahlquist </em>(2007), 336 Mont. 100, 152 P.3d 693, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>2007 MT 42. In <em>Dahlquist, </em>the creditor filed a complaint against the debtor, seeking money owed pursuant to a credit card agreement. Citibank received notice of arbitration from the National Arbitration Counsel (\u201cNAC\u201d), and Citibank responded with a letter stating that it did not agree and would not agree to arbitrate the dispute before NAC. The agreement between Citibank and the debtor did not list NAC as a potential arbitrator but instead listed AAA, JAMS, or NAF. Despite Citibank\u2019s letter, NAC issued an award for the debtor and against Citibank, which the debtor moved to confirm. Citibank moved to vacate the award, but not within 90 days as required by Montana\u2019s Uniform Arbitration Act, and the debtor argued that Citibank had waived its right to challenge the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 38} In denying the motion to confirm, the district court determined that the debtor\u2019s use of NAC violated the arbitration agreement and that the NAC award was accordingly \u201cinvalid ab initio,\u201d and \u201cthe statutory time limits to challenge the award [were] not triggered.\u201d The debtor appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 39} The Supreme Court of Montana determined, \u201c[T]he arbitration agreement at issue, by its terms, is not governed by Montana\u2019s arbitration statutes but by the FAA (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16).\u201d <em>Dahlquist, </em>336 Mont. 100, 152 P.3d 693, 2007 MT 42, \u00b6 11. The court noted, \u201cUnder the FAA, where parties have not agreed to arbitrate, or where the arbitration does not follow the format provided for in the arbitration agreement, the arbitration award is invalid <em>ab initio. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Exalon Industries, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 426, 430 (1st Cir.1998), and <em>Bank of America v. Dahlquist, </em>336 Mont. 50, 152 P.3d 718, 2007 MT 32], \u00b6 12-13. In <em>MCI, </em>the First Circuit determined that, for a party to be subject to the FAA\u2019s three-month time limitation, a written arbitration agreement must be \u2018in effect\u2019 <em>and </em>the party must be \u2018bound by [the] conditions\u2019 of the agreement. <em>MCI, </em>138 F.3d at 430. One condition that must be followed for an arbitration proceeding to be valid under the FAA is employment of the agreed upon arbitrator. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 5 and <em>R.J. O'Brien &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Pipkin, </em>64 F.3d 257, 263 (7th Cir.1995) (\u2018[I]n order to enforce an arbitration award, the arbitrator must be chosen in conformance with the procedure specified in the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cHere, the arbitration agreement specifically limits the arbitrators that may be used to AAA, JAMS or NAF. Dahlquist, however, did not use one of the three named groups, but unilaterally selected NAC. As Citibank had not agreed to arbitrate the dispute before NAC, and as the agreement specifically calls for AAA, JAMS or NAF to be used, the award is unenforceable, under <em>R.J. OBrien, </em>because NAC was not chosen in conformance with the arbitration agreement. Further, the arbitration award was invalid <em>ab initio </em>under <em>MCI, </em>because, while there is a written arbitration agreement, Citibank had not consented to be bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>by NAC, and in fact had notified NAC by letter that it had not agreed and would not agree to arbitrate before NAC. The FAA time limitation was thus not triggered, and Citibank is not bound by the award, even though it failed to challenge it within three months.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 41} When we initially remanded this matter to the trial court, at issue were the timeliness of Citibank\u2019s petition to vacate the arbitration award and the complete lack of evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s decision. Based upon the record now before us, which includes the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement along with an affidavit that satisfies Civ.R. 56, it is apparent that the Blue Ridge arbitration award is a legal nullity, not subject to the timeliness provisions of either the Federal Arbitration Act or R.C. 2711.13. <em>Dahlquist, </em>336 Mont. 100, 152 P.3d 693, 2007 MT 42, citing 9 U.S.C. 5; <em>MCI, </em>138 F.3d 426, 430; <em>R.J. O\u2019Brien &amp; Assoc., </em>64 F.3d 257; <em>DeCair v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(June 17, 1988), Lucas App. No. L-87-344, 1988 WL 62985 (\u201cThe timeliness provisions of R.C. 2711.13 * * * are not applicable to void judgments\u201d). Since there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the validity of the Blue Ridge award, Wood\u2019s arguments regarding the timeliness of Citibank\u2019s petition to vacate the award lack merit, and Wood\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 42} Wood\u2019s second and third assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cCitibank has again failed to produce any evidence.\u201d And,</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cFailure to comply with ORC 2711.14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 45} As determined above, given our conclusion that the trial court correctly found the award void ab initio, we do not need to address any further the merits of these assignments of error. The judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of Citibank is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">III. Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">{\u00b6 46} Wood\u2019s three assignments of error do not mention the award of attorney fees to Citibank. In the \u201cStatement of the Case\u201d section of his brief, however, Wood argues, \u201c[T]he trial court has awarded attorney fees to Citibank in excess of $7000 which is not reasonable in view of the fact that counsel has filed so few papers, failed to establish subject matter jurisdiction, and failed to provide any evidence. There may as well be other serious problems which the billing presents. At this time it will suffice for Wood to ask that the Appeals court reverse the order granting attorney fees to Citibank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>{\u00b6 47} \u201cPlaintiffs Submission of Attorney Fees\u201d provides, \u201cCitibank is not seeking an award of attorney fees incurred by its prior legal counsel in this matter, * * * even though the Court\u2019s Entry is silent on this issue. Rather, the attorney\u2019s fees sought cover only that period of time from remand of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision through April 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cPlaintiff seeks attorney fees and expenses in the amount of $7,484.30.\u201d Attached to the \u201cSubmission\u201d are two heavily redacted invoices. One invoice is in the amount of $2,101.03, upon which Citibank seeks payment of $1,977. In a footnote, Citibank indicates that the sum sought \u201crepresents the difference between the amount billed and paid based upon an agreement between Citibank [and its counsel] to charge off $124.03 from this invoice.\u201d The other invoice is in the amount of $5,507.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 49} An award of attorney fees must be reasonable and supported by evidence in the record. <em>Swanson v. Swanson </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App.2d 85, 355 N.E.2d 894; <em>Non-Employees of Chateau Estates Resident Assn. v. Chateau Estates, Ltd., </em>Clark App. Nos. 2004 CA 19 and 2004 CA 20, 2004-Ohio-3781, 2004 WL 1587234; see Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.5 (setting forth factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee). The trial court awarded fees to Citibank, without analysis, in the exact amount requested by Citibank based upon, apparently, the unsworn and redacted invoices attached to Citibank\u2019s \u201cSubmission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 50} The plain-error doctrine \u201cis not favored and may be applied only in the extremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself.\u201d <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 122-123, 679 N.E.2d 1099. The trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees herein, without proper support in the record and without analysis to establish their reasonableness, constitutes plain error. Under these exceptional circumstances, the trial court\u2019s judgment awarding fees to Citibank is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 51} In conclusion, the judgment vacating the arbitration award is affirmed, and reversal and remand is limited to the issue of reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-10\">Wolff and Brogan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-12\">.
