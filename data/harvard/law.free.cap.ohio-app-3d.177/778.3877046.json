Fleming and others, appeal from the decision of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment to appellees, AAS Service, Inc. and others. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">{\u00b6 2} Beginning in 2002, appellant William Fleming started as a part-time employee of appellee A.A.S. Service, Inc. as a subcontractor assisting with painting jobs. In 2003, Fleming became a full-time employee assisting with, inter alia, chimney cleaning and repair. Fleming had no prior experience with chimneys but was given \u201con the job\u201d training by appellee Urs Schneeberger, the owner and employee of AAS. In July 2005, AAS, through Schneeberger and Fleming, visited the one-story home of Keith and Shannon Mamajek to examine their chimney and provide an estimate for its repair. The Mamajeks subsequently signed a contract with AAS for the repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">{\u00b6 3} Schneeberger and Fleming arrived at the Mamajek home at approximately 8:00 a.m. on August 9, 2005. They worked on the chimney for several hours without incident. After finishing the chimney repairs, Fleming commenced cleaning the roof top. He was the only person on the roof during the cleaning process. While cleaning, Fleming had rinsed the roof with a water hose and had placed larger pieces of mortar and other debris in a 3-5 gallon bucket, which also contained flashing seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">{\u00b6 4} While he was completing the cleaning process, Fleming noticed the bucket beginning to slide down the slope of the roof. He testified that at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>time, the roof was dry and clear of debris. Fleming was unable to explain why the bucket began its descent; however, he testified that Schneeberger explicitly advised him never to chase any equipment or tool from a roof. If equipment begins to fall, \u201c[i]t happens, but you just don\u2019t go after it. You let it fall, go down and pick it up. If it\u2019s broke, it\u2019s just broke. Better it than you is the philosophy that I was taught from [Schneeberger].\u201d Fleming even acknowledged in his complaint that \u201cthe cardinal rule when working on a roof is not to chase a tool that slides off the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 5} Despite Schneeberger\u2019s explicit training and instructions, Fleming darted after the bucket \u201cat a full run.\u201d He testified that he had heard voices from below and was concerned that the falling debris would fall and strike one of the Mamajeks, who had been outside in their backyard. As he pursued the bucket, he dodged a vent stack on the roof and swatted at the bucket to change its direction. At this point, however, Fleming had reached the roof line and, rather than attempt to stop, decided to leap off the edge of the roof and attempt to land safely in the grass. Unfortunately, Fleming landed on the Mamajeks\u2019 concrete driveway, injuring his leg and foot. Although the bucket tumbled off the roof with Fleming, the Mamajeks were not harmed. In fact, Shannon Mamajek testified that she and her two daughters were between 18 and 20 feet from the roof at the time of the incident. Fleming repeatedly testified that he did not fall from the roof but, rather, jumped of his own free will, and at no point did Schneeberger advise him to act as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 6} On May 15, 2006, appellants filed their complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas alleging negligence against the Mamajeks, intentional tortious conduct on behalf of AAS and Schneeberger, and loss of consortium. After filing their answer, the cause was transferred to the Portage County Court of Common Pleas. On December 22, 2006, the Mamajeks filed their motion for summary judgment to which appellants responded on January 17, 2007. On March 19, 2007, AAS and Schneeberger filed their motion for summary judgment, to which appellants duly responded. On March 21, 2007, the trial court granted summary judgment in the Mamajeks\u2019 favor. Later, on July 12, 2007, the trial court awarded summary judgment in AAS\u2019s and Schneeberger\u2019s favor. Appellants filed a timely appeal and now assign three errors for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Keith and Shannon Mamajek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">{\u00b6 9} We review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment is appropriate under Civ.R. 56(C) when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining to be litigated; (2) the moving party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion favors the moving party. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 10} The moving party bears the initial burden of providing the trial court a basis for the motion and is required to identify portions of the record demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact pertaining to the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts that would establish a genuine issue for trial. Id. The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a blank assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case but must be able to specifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C). <em>Dresher, </em>supra Similarly, the nonmoving party may not rest on conclusory allegations or denials contained in the pleadings; rather, he or she must submit evidentiary material sufficient to create a genuine dispute over material facts at issue. Civ.R. 56(E); see also <em>Dresher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">{\u00b6 11} To determine whether a genuine issue exists, a reviewing court must determine whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must necessarily prevail as a matter of law. <em>Spatar v. Avon Oaks Ballroom, </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-T-0059, 2002-Ohio-2443, 2002 WL 1012597, at \u00b6 16, citing <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 340, 617 N.E.2d 1123. \u201cAs to materiality, the substantive law will identify which facts are material. Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">{\u00b6 12} Under their first assignment of error, appellants argue that Keith and Shannon Mamajek, the owners of the home off which Fleming leapt, were negligent in creating a dangerous condition when Mrs. Mamajek remained in her backyard with her children while Fleming was on their roof repairing the chimney. Appellant contends, \u201cWith the grinding of the mortar and debris flying everywhere, along with the presence of the ladder, by being in the backyard the Mamajeks were in harm\u2019s way.\u201d We disagree with appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">{\u00b6 13} To defeat the Mamajeks\u2019 motion for summary judgment, it was necessary for appellants to identify a duty owed them by the Mamajeks that was breached. <em>Fuehrer v. Westerville City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 201, 204, 574 N.E.2d 448. In <em>Michaels v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 475, 478, 650 N.E.2d 1352, the Supreme Court of Ohio underscored that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>owner of property on which construction is taking place may only be held liable for the injuries of an independent contractor\u2019s employees if the owner actively participates in the details of a contractor\u2019s work, e.g., where \u201cthe owner \u2018interfered with the <em>mode </em>of the job operation,\u2019 <em>\u2018actually participated in the job operation by dictating the manner and mode </em>in which the * * * job was to be performed,\u2019 and \u2018had sole control over the safety features necessary to eliminate the hazard.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., quoting, <em>Hirschbach v. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 206, 208, 6 OBR 259, 452 N.E.2d 326. The phrase \u201cactively participates\u201d has been defined as directing the activity that resulted in the injury and/or giving or denying permission for the critical acts that led to the employee\u2019s injury as opposed to merely exercising a general supervisory role over the project. <em>Bond v. Howard Corp. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 332, 337, 650 N.E.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{\u00b6 14} Appellants assert that a genuine issue of material fact exists in this case to the extent that the Mamajeks were \u201cin their backyard\u201d when Fleming\u2019s injury occurred. Appellants allege that Fleming\u2019s actions leading to his injuries were undertaken pursuant to the rescue doctrine, and as a result, there remain triable issues as to whether the Mamajeks were comparatively negligent for the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 15} First, there is no evidence in the record indicating that the Mamajeks \u201cactively participated\u201d in the construction job so as to impose a duty of reasonable care upon them. Even if Mrs. Mamajek and her children had been in the backyard at the time of Fleming\u2019s injury, they were not directing the manner in which he was cleaning the roof. The record simply indicates that the Mamajeks hired AAS to repair their chimney and allowed it to do its job in a manner it saw appropriate. From these facts, it would be difficult to conclude the Mamajeks were engaging in even a \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cpassive\u201d supervisory role. The Mamajeks did not interfere with the contractor\u2019s mode of job operation; they did not actually participate in the job via dictating the manner it would be accomplished; and they had no input, let alone control, over safety features necessary to eliminate the potential hazard. In short, appellants have failed to establish that the Mamajeks owed Fleming a duty of reasonable care that they breached, causing appellant\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">{\u00b6 16} Further, appellants\u2019 contention that issues of fact remain as to comparative negligence assumes, at the least, that they established a breach of duty on behalf of the Mamajeks. They did not. Comparative negligence is a legal concept related to proximate causation. See, e.g., <em>Armstrong v. Best Buy Co., Inc., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088, \u00b6 11. It is axiomatic that absent the establishment of a duty and a breach thereof, a court need not examine the issue of proximate causation. Appellants\u2019 argument therefore misunderstands the necessary sequence of proof in a negligence cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number> {\u00b6 17} Further, appellant\u2019s argument relating to the rescue doctrine also assumes what still needs to be proven; namely, negligence on behalf of the Mamajeks. The \u201crescue doctrine\u201d is applicable when an injured party is hurt in an attempt to rescue a person in danger as a result of that person\u2019s own negligence. <em>Skiles v. Beckloff </em>(Aug. 4, 1993), 9th Dist. No. 93CA005550, 1993 WL 290203, citing <em>Reese v. Minor </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 440, 2 OBR 534, 442 N.E.2d 782. Hence, it follows that a rescuer may recover only from one found negligent. By alleging that there are genuine issues of material fact as to appellant\u2019s role as a rescuer, he presumes the Mamajek\u2019s negligence, a conclusion that requires its own separate proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 18} For these reasons, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to find Ohio Revised Code 2745.01 unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">{\u00b6 21} Under their second assignment of error, appellants assert that the current version of R.C. 2745.01, effective April 7, 2005, is unconstitutional because it essentially mirrors former R.C. 2745.01, which was declared unconstitutional in <em>Johnson v. BP Chems., Inc. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 298, 707 N.E.2d 1107. We hold that appellants\u2019 constitutional challenge has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">{\u00b6 22} Current R.C. 2745.01, which governs causes of action premised upon employer intentional torts, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(A) In an action brought against an employer by an employee * * * for damages resulting from an intentional tort committed by the employer during the course of employment, the employer shall not be hable unless the plaintiff proves that the employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(B) As used in this section, \u2018substantially certain\u2019 means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">{\u00b6 25} The foregoing statute is the only recourse for an employee whose employer has committed an intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">{\u00b6 26} Current R.C. 2745.01 had two statutory predecessors, both of which were respectively declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Ohio. First, in 1986, the General Assembly enacted former R.C. 4121.80. Under this statute, injuries occasioned by an employer\u2019s intentional tort fell under the rubric of Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and permitted an injured employee to seek damages for employer intentional torts committed in the course of the employee\u2019s employment. Under former R.C. 4121.80(G), an intentional tort was defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the same manner as current R.C. 2745.01, i.e., \u201can act committed with the intent to injure another or committed with the belief that the injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d R.C. 4121.80(G). The former statute further provided, \u201c \u2018Substantially certain\u2019 means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer injury, disease, condition, or death.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722, the Supreme Court of Ohio analyzed former R.C. 4121.80 in relation to Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides, \u201cLaws may be passed fixing and regulating the hours of labor, establishing a minimum wage, and <em>providing for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employe[e]s; </em>and no other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the opening sentence of Section 35, Article II provides a basis for legislative enactments in the area of workers\u2019 compensation: \u201cFor the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, <em>occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment * </em>* (Emphasis added.) The court, seizing upon the foregoing, emphasized language, determined former R.C. 4121.80 exceeded and conflicted \u201cwith the legislative authority granted to the General Assembly pursuant to Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution,\u201d and therefore deemed it unconstitutional. <em>Brady </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 28} In relation to Section 34, the court held that the statute acted to confer a functional immunity to employers and, consequently, was \u201ctotally repugnant to Section 34, Article II.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 633, 576 N.E.2d 722. The court reasoned a statute that attempts to remove a common law right to a remedy that would generally benefit an employee cannot be a law \u201cproviding for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees.\u201d Id. Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. See also <em>Brady, </em>at 633-635, 576 N.E.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">{\u00b6 29} With respect to Section 35, the court underscored that \u201cthe legislature cannot, consistent with Section 35, Article II, enact legislation governing intentional torts that occur within the employment relationship, because such intentional tortious conduct will always take place outside that relationship.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d 722. The court, quoting a previous case, elaborated:</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018Injuries resulting from an employer\u2019s intentional torts, even though committed at the workplace, are utterly outside the scope of the purposes intended to be achieved by Section 35 and by the Act. <em>Such injuries are totally unrelated to the fact of employment. </em>When an employer intentionally harms his employee, that act effects a complete breach of the employment relationship, and for purposes of the legal remedy for such an injury, the two parties are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>employer and employee, but intentional tortfeasor and victim.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d 722, quoting <em>Taylor v. Academy Iron &amp; Metal Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 149, 162, 522 N.E.2d 464 (Douglas, J., dissenting.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 31} The court pointed out that Section 35 is concerned solely with compensating employee injuries arising from the employment relationship. However, the statute concerned itself solely with injuries which, by their very nature, have no connection with the fact of employment. <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 633, 576 N.E.2d 722. Thus, the court held, \u201c[T]he legislature cannot, consistent with Section 35, Article II, enact legislation governing intentional torts that occur within the employment relationship, because such intentional tortious conduct will always take place outside that relationship.\u201d Id. at 634, 576 N.E.2d 722. The statute was therefore held unconstitutional in toto, thereby reanimating the common law cause of action for an employer\u2019s intentional tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 32} Subsequent to <em>Brady, </em>the General Assembly enacted former R.C. 2745.01, effective November 1, 1995, to replace former R.C. 4121.80. However, the new statute encountered similar and equally fatal constitutional problems to those encountered by former R.C. 4121.80. As a result, in <em>Johnson v. BP Chems., Inc., </em>85 Ohio St.3d 298, 707 N.E.2d 1107, it was declared unconstitutional. Former R.C. 2745.01(D)(1) set forth the elements of the cause of action, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u2018Employment intentional tort\u2019 means an act committed by an employer in which the employer deliberately and intentionally injures, causes an occupational disease of, or causes the death of an employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">{\u00b6 34} Further, the statute required the employee to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the employer deliberately committed all of the elements of an employment intentional tort. See former R.C. 2745.01(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">{\u00b6 35} In light of these requirements, the court in <em>Johnson </em>determined that former R.C. 2745.01 \u201ccreated a cause of action that is simply illusory.\u201d <em>Johnson, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d at 306, 707 N.E.2d 1107. That is, pursuant to the standards of the statute, \u201can employer\u2019s conduct, in order to create civil liability, must be both <em>deliberate </em>and <em>intentional. </em>Therefore, in order to prove an intentional tort in accordance with [former] R.C. 2745.01(D)(1), the employee * * * must prove, at a minimum, that the actions of the employer amount to criminal assault. In fact, given the elements imposed by the statute, it is even conceivable that an employer might actually be guilty of a criminal assault but exempt from civil liability under [former] R.C. 2745.01(D)(1).\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 306-307, 707 N.E.2d 1107. In relation to this analysis, the court held that former R.C. 2745.01 violated Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution; to wit, \u201cBecause [former] R.C. 2745.01 imposes excessive standards (deliberate and intentional act), with a heightened burden of proof (clear and convincing evidence), it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>clearly not \u2018a law that furthers the \u201c * * * comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employ[ees].\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 308, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 36} The court also cited its Section 35 analysis in <em>Brady </em>as a basis for its holding. The court pointed out that Section 35, Article II grants the legislature authority to enact laws regarding injuries occasioned within the employment context, and therefore, Section 35 precludes the enactment of any law affecting injuries outside the scope of employment. <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 308, 707 N.E.2d 1107. Thus, citing <em>Brady, </em>the court additionally held, \u201c[Former] R.C. 2745.01 \u2018cannot logically withstand constitutional scrutiny, inasmuch as it attempts to regulate an area that is beyond the reach of constitutional empowerment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>citing <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d 722.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 37} Current R.C. 2745.01 (effective April 7, 2005) represents the latest attempt by the legislature to regulate causes of action alleging employer intentional torts occurring within the course of an employee\u2019s employment. Current R.C. 2745.01 provides that in an action for intentional tort \u201ccommitted by the employer during the course of employment,\u201d an employee must prove that \u201cthe employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.\u201d The belief that an injury is substantially certain to occur exists when the employer \u201cacts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u201d R.C. 2745.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 38} We initially point out that all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>Groch v. GMC, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 196, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377. Moreover, where possible, courts must apply all presumptions and all pertinent rules of construction in an effort to uphold a statute challenged on constitutional grounds. See, e.g., <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 303, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 39} We first emphasize that a comparison of former R.C. 4121.80 and current R.C. 2745.01 reveals that the legislature retained the same substantive standard of proof held unconstitutional in <em>Brady. </em>This standard of proof was stricken as \u201ctotally repugnant\u201d to and therefore violative of Section 34, Article II of Ohio\u2019s Constitution. Moreover, notwithstanding the legislature\u2019s subsequent decision to codify the cause of action outside the Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Act, the court in <em>Johnson </em>determined that former R.C. 2745.01 stood in violation of Section 35, Article II. As discussed above, the court construed Section 35 as an explicit limitation upon the legislature\u2019s constitutional powers, i.e., the Constitution permits the General Assembly to regulate only causes of action occurring <em>within the employment relationship, </em>and, therefore, it does not possess the constitutional authority to codify legislation governing employee injuries that fall outside this relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 40} After careful review of controlling case law in this area, we hold that current R.C. 2745.01 cannot pass constitutional scrutiny. Current R.C. 2745.01 cannot be coherently reconciled with the manner in which Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution have been construed by the Supreme Court. Current R.C. 2745.01 is another attempt by the General Assembly to enact legislation governing intentional torts occurring within the employment relationship that according to the Supreme Court in <em>Brady </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>stands contrary to Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. See <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 635, 576 N.E.2d 722; see also <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 308, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 41} Moreover, under the current statute, an employer\u2019s conduct must be either deliberate or intentional. As the court in <em>Johnson </em>pointed out, these requirements \u201care so unreasonable and excessive that the chance of recovery of damages by employees for intentional torts committed by employers in the workplace is virtually zero. * * * [This] \u2018creates an insurmountable obstacle for victims of \u201cemployment intentional torts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 307, 707 N.E.2d 1107, quoting <em>Johnson v. BP Chems., Inc. </em>(Nov. 18,1997), Allen App. No. 1-97-32, 1997 WL 729098. By requiring an employee to demonstrate that his employer acted with an \u201cintent to injure\u201d or \u201cwith the belief that [the] injury was substantially certain to occur\u201d (i.e., acting with \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d to injure), creates an unreasonably high standard of proof which does not provide for the \u201ccomfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employes * * *.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 633, 576 N.E.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">{\u00b6 42} The instant issue has not been broached by the great balance of our sister districts. However, our research reveals that the Seventh Appellate District has ruled on the constitutionality of current R.C. 2745.01 and, in doing so, has arrived at the same conclusion as this panel. In <em>Kaminski v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>175 Ohio App.3d 227, 2008-Ohio-1521, 886 N.E.2d 262, the Seventh District recently held current R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Brady </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>In support of its holding, the court in <em>Kaminski </em>reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cR.C. 2745.01, as currently written, is similar to the earlier version found by the Johnson Court to be unconstitutional. R.C. 2745.01(A) provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>in an employer intentional tort action, the employee must prove \u2018that the employer committed the tortious act <em>with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur' </em>* * * Thus, pursuant to section A, in order to succeed on the claim, the employee must prove one of two things: (1) the employer acted with intent to injure or (2) the employer acted with the belief that injury was substantially certain to occur. This leads one to believe there are two alternate ways for an employee to succeed on an intentional tort claim against the employer. However, we must consider the rest of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c \u2018Intent to injure\u2019 is clear and, therefore, is not defined in the statute. \u2018Substantially certain,\u2019 however, is not as clear. Therefore, the legislature provided a definition. R.C. 2745.01(B) defines \u2018substantially certain\u2019 as acting \u2018with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cWhen we consider the definition of \u2018substantial certainty\u2019 it becomes apparent that an employee does not have two ways to prove an intentional tort claim as R.C. 2745.01(A) suggests. The employee\u2019s two options of proof become (1) the employer acted with intent to injure or (2) the employer acted with deliberate intent to injure. Thus, under R.C. 2745.01, the only way an employee can recover is if the employer acted with the intent to cause injury. The Johnson court held that this type of action was simply illusory * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cPursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Brady, </em>supra, and <em>Johnson, </em>supra, and consistent with Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, we must conclude that R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional. Because of its excessive standard of requiring proof that the employer intended to cause injury, \u2018it is clearly not \u201ca law that furthers the \u2018 * * *comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employe[e]s.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 308, 707 N.E.2d 1107, quoting <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 633, 576 N.E.2d 722, quoting Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Additionally, \u2018because R.C. 2745.01 is an attempt by the General Assembly to govern intentional torts that occur within the employment relationship, R.C. 2745.01 \u201ccannot logically withstand constitutional scrutiny, inasmuch as it attempts to regulate an area that is beyond the reach of constitutional empowerment.\u201d \u2019 Id. quoting <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d 722.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Kaminski, </em>2008-Ohio-1521, 2008 WL 817083, at \u00b6 29-31 and 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">{\u00b6 48} We therefore hold, pursuant to <em>Brady, Johnson, </em>and the supplemental persuasive analysis set forth in <em>Kaminski, </em>that current R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional, standing in violation of Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. As a result, the common law standard set forth in <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number><em>Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, is again the viable standard of proof for an employee seeking redress for an employer\u2019s allegedly intentional tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 50} Appellants\u2019 third assigned error reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants A.A.S. Service, Inc. and Urs Schneeberger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">{\u00b6 52} Although we have found current R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional, we shall review the trial court\u2019s decision by applying the common law test for employer intentional torts set forth in <em>Fyffe, </em>supra.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Fyffe, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio announced the test for an employer intentional tort as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c[I]n order to establish \u2018intent\u2019 for the purpose of proving the existence of an intentional tort committed by an employer against his employee, the following must be demonstrated: (1) knowledge by the employer of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition within its business; (2) knowledge by the employer that if the employee is subjected by his employment to such dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition, then harm to the employee will be a substantial certainty; and (3) that the employer, under such circumstances, and with such knowledge, did act to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task. * * Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">{\u00b6 55} To establish an intentional tort by an employer, an employee must demonstrate proof beyond that required to prove negligence or recklessness. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cIf a plaintiff can show that harm or consequences will follow the risk, that the employer knows that injuries to employees are certain or substantially certain to result from the risk, and yet the employer still requires the employee to proceed, the employer is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired the end result.\u201d <em>Wallick v. Willoughby Supply Co., </em>168 Ohio App.3d 640, 2006-Ohio-4728, 861 N.E.2d 566, at \u00b6 12, citing <em>Fyffe, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">{\u00b6 56} Here, after the Mamajeks\u2019 chimney repair had concluded, Fleming was on top of the roof, cleaning off remaining dust and debris. He had used a water hose to remove most of the brick dust and placed other larger debris in a three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>gallon bucket. Neither Fleming nor the bucket was secured by a safety harness or a rope. Fleming testified that he observed the bucket begin to slide down the roof and attempted to prevent it from falling. Fleming then did the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c[C]aught [the bucket] maybe three feet or so from the edge of the roof, but for me, that\u2019s one stride. I have a six-foot stride. So for me to get three feet away, I had one more step left and I was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cSo the bucket had already gotten to the point where it was headed to the right and Mrs. Mamajek and her daughters were below me. I could hear them, but I couldn\u2019t see them where I was because they were small enough that I had no clue where exactly they were. And when the bucket started to slide, normally I would just let it slide to the bottom, but with people down there, I wasn\u2019t sure where they were so I tried to head it off and stop it from going off the roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cWhen it started sliding, I said \u2018shit\u2019 and I started running immediately after it. I caught it, and like I said, I don\u2019t remember where I was on the roof by the time I actually got within arm\u2019s reach of the bucket, and I reached down, kind of hit it as hard as I could to the left because, like I said, I could hear them to the right, so I figured anything left was my best bet, and it just kind of went right in line with me and we both \u2014 I was at a full run at that point, so stopping was out of the question. I had no way to stop, and I just \u2014 my only out was to jump.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cSo I tried to jump as far as I could in case they were under me, and as I was going over, I just kind of saw movement on the right, and the bucket hit the ground and I was just hoping there was grass under me and there wasn\u2019t. After that, I just hit the ground. I knew as soon as I hit the ground I broke my leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">{\u00b6 61} The record indicates that although Fleming heard the Mamajeks, they were not near the house at the time of the fall. Mrs. Mamajek testified that she was standing approximately 18 feet away from the corner of the house at the time of the fall while her daughters were behind her, approximately 20 feet from the house. Moreover, Fleming\u2019s boss, appellee Schneeberger, was not on the roof when appellant chased the bucket and jumped from the roof. Further, Fleming conceded that Schneeberger did not direct him to retrieve the bucket, and his decision to chase the bucket and ultimately leap from the roof was of his own volition.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">{\u00b6 62} We begin the analysis by pointing out that the elements of <em>Fyffe </em>are conjunctive, and a plaintiff must establish a genuine issue of material fact relating to all three prongs of the test to avoid summary judgment. See, e.g., <em>Wallick, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 640, 2006-Ohio-4728, 861 N.E.2d 566, at If 15. To satisfy the first prong of the test, the plaintiff must demonstrate that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>dangerous process and the employer had actual knowledge of the consequences of the precise dangers that ultimately caused the injury. See, e.g., <em>Hubert v. Al Hissom Roofing &amp; Constr., Inc., </em>7th Dist. No. 05 CO 21, 2006-Ohio-751, 2006 WL 389630, at \u00b6 18. \u201c[DJangerous work must be distinguished from an otherwise dangerous condition within that work. It is the latter of which that must be within the knowledge of the employer before liability could attach.\u201d <em>Naragon v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(Mar. 30, 1998), 3d Dist. No. 17-97-21, 1998 WL 142386. \u2018Were it otherwise, any injury associated with inherently dangerous work * * * could subject an employer to intentional tort liability, whatever the cause.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">{\u00b6 63} Here, the job in which Fleming engaged on a daily basis, i.e., roof work, can be reasonably construed as dangerous work. The condition within such dangerous work that Fleming identifies as dangerous, separate from the work itself, was Schneeberger\u2019s failure to provide safety equipment. Ohio Adm.Code 4123:l-3-03(J)(l) requires an employer to provide and compel his or her employees to use lifelines, safety belts or harnesses, and lanyards on \u201csteeply pitched roofs\u201d and \u201cwhen exposed to hazards of falling where the operation being performed is more than six feet above ground * * Although this section of the Ohio Administrative Code does not provide a grade for defining a \u201csteep pitch,\u201d it is undisputed that the Mamajeks\u2019 roof line was 11 feet five inches. With this in mind, we agree with Fleming that he was exposed to a dangerous condition for purposes of <em>Fyffe </em>and that Schneeberger had knowledge of this dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">{\u00b6 64} During his deposition, Fleming testified that Schneeberger neither provided nor required him to use safety equipment while executing his job duties in general, let alone at the Mamajek residence. Fleming stated he told Schneeberger \u201cseveral times\u201d they needed to obtain safety equipment, but Schneeberger\u2019s response was \u201cyou can either do it or go home.\u201d Moreover, Schneeberger acknowledged that no safety equipment was provided at the Mamajek job, and he provided the same only when the roof was \u201ctoo steep\u201d pursuant to his own subjective determination. Given these facts, we conclude that Fleming established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Schneeberger had knowledge of the dangerous condition to which Fleming was subjected. Accordingly, appellants have met their burden under <em>Fyffe\u2019s </em>first prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">{\u00b6 65} The second prong of <em>Fyffe </em>requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer was substantially certain that an employee would be injured if exposed to the dangerous condition. Courts have acknowledged that <em>Fyffe\u2019s </em>second element \u201cis a difficult standard to meet.\u201d <em>McGee v. Goodyear Atomic Corp. </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 236, 246, 659 N.E.2d 317; see also <em>Hubert, </em>2006-Ohio-751, 2006 WL 389630, at \u00b6 33. In <em>Fyffe, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>{\u00b6 66} \u201cTo establish an intentional tort of an employer, proof beyond that required to prove negligence and beyond that to prove recklessness must be established. Where the employer acts despite his knowledge of some risk, his conduct may be negligence. As the probability increases that particular consequences may follow, then the employer\u2019s conduct may be characterized as recklessness. As the probability that the consequences will follow further increases, and the employer knows that injuries to employees are certain or substantially certain to result from the process, procedure or condition and he still proceeds, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result. However, the mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk \u2014 something short of substantial certainty \u2014 is not intent.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 67} Under <em>Fyjfe, </em>an employee is not required to show that an employer subjectively intended the injury at issue to prove intent. See <em>Hubert, </em>2006-Ohio-751, 2006 WL 389630, at \u00b6 35; see also <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 117, 522 N.E.2d 489. Rather, evidence indicating that an employer knew that subjecting an employee to a dangerous condition would, with substantial certainty, cause an injury is sufficient to show intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 68} During his deposition, Fleming testified that Schneeberger seemed to expect him to fall and be injured during the course of his duties at some point:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cHe asked me daily, \u2018What are you going to do when you fall and get hurt and break your leg?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I heard that. But how do you answer that? When you\u2019re not in that situation, it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ll be fine. If it happens, it happens.\u2019 That\u2019s all I could say. I\u2019ve never been in any kind of situation like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cBut he asked me all the time. I\u2019d be up there or we\u2019d be driving somewhere, What are you going to do one of these days when you fall down and get hurt,\u2019 almost like he was wishing it to happen. And I didn\u2019t think about it too much then. But now in hindsight, if you knew it was going to happen to me, why did you not do anything about it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">{\u00b6 72} The foregoing testimony, viewed in conjunction with Fleming\u2019s testimony that Schneeberger did not offer him (let alone require him to wear) safety equipment while on a rooftop, creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Schneeberger knew that harm to Fleming was substantially certain to result from the dangerous condition. Thus, we hold that appellants met their burden as it relates to the second prong of <em>Fyjfe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>{\u00b6 73} Finally, the third prong of <em>Fyffe </em>requires proof that \u201cthe employer, with knowledge of a dangerous condition and of a substantial certainty of harm, [had] required the employee to perform a dangerous task.\u201d <em>Hannah v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 482, 486, 696 N.E.2d 1044. In analyzing this element, the Supreme Court has held that an employer need not explicitly require an employee to perform a dangerous task.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cInstead, to overcome a motion for summary judgment, an opposing party can satisfy this requirement by presenting evidence that raises an inference that the employer, through its actions and policies, required the [plaintiff] to engage in that dangerous task.\u201d Id. at 487, 696 N.E.2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">{\u00b6 75} As discussed under our analysis of the first element of <em>Fyffe, </em>Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1 \u2014 3\u201403(J)(1) requires an employer to provide and to take responsibility for his or her employees use of specific safety equipment on \u201csteeply pitched roofs\u201d or \u201cwhen exposed to hazards of falling where the operation being performed is more than six feet above ground * * *.\u201d One can reasonably infer that an employee, exposed to the perils of falling from a height greater than six feet above ground, is involved in a dangerous task. <em>Slack v. Henry </em>(Dec. 1, 2000), 4th Dist. No. 00CA2704, 2000 WL 33226197, *5 (\u201cFailure to comply with safety regulations is relevant to show that an employer required an employee to perform a dangerous task, knowing of the substantial certainty of injury\u201d). We therefore hold that there are genuine issues of material fact as to <em>Fyffe\u2019s </em>third element, viz., whether Schneeberger, with knowledge of a dangerous condition and of a substantial certainty of harm, required Fleming to continue to perform a dangerous task.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 76} As a post script to the foregoing analysis, we recognize that the trial court\u2019s holding was premised upon its view that the \u201cdangerous task\u201d in this case was Fleming\u2019s pursuit of the bucket down the slope of the Mamajeks\u2019 roof. While we agree with the trial court that there is no evidence in the record indicating that Schneeberger instructed Fleming to place himself in peril to retrieve equipment that, in his judgment, was sliding from a roof, to protect people who may or may not be standing below. In fact, the opposite is true. Fleming testified that Schneeberger actively discouraged pursuing a tool or equipment that was or was in the process of falling from a roof. However, we do not believe the issue in this case was whether Fleming\u2019s specific voluntary actions caused his injury; rather, under <em>Fyffe, </em>the thrust of the inquiry is whether there are genuine issues of material fact that Schneeberger, through his policies and conditions of employment, placed Fleming in a position in which he was subjected to a dangerous condition, and harm was substantially certain to follow. <em>Gibson v. Drainage Prods., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 171, 2002-Ohio-2008, 766 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 27. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Given our reading of the law in this area, we believe that Fleming has presented sufficient evidence on the foregoing requirements to create an issue for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">{\u00b6 77} Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">{\u00b6 78} While we overrule appellants\u2019 first assignment of error, their second and third assignments of error are hereby sustained.

The court acknowledged that the new numerical statutory designation placed former R.C. 2745.01 outside the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (R.C.

However, due to Ohio\u2019s \u201cno-fault\u201d workers\u2019 compensation scheme, he was entitled to benefits because he was injured in the course of his employment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">{\u00b6 81} In assessing intentional torts, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that \u201c[t]o establish an intentional tort of an employer, proof beyond that required to prove negligence and beyond that to prove recklessness must be established.\u201d <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraph two of the syllabus. In this matter, it is questionable whether the employer\u2019s actions even rise to the level of negligence. We cannot forget the need to establish the element of proximate cause. The old test of <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island RR. Co. </em>is certainly applicable here \u2014 \u201c[t]he risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed.\u201d <em>Palsgraf, </em>248 N.Y. 339, 344, 162 N.E. 99, 100. The threshold question is \u201chow did the injury occur?\u201d It did not occur because Fleming\u2019s foot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>slipped and he slid down a steep slope. It did not occur because Fleming was concentrating on his work and inadvertently tripped on something on the roof. It did not occur because Fleming misjudged his location on the roof and fell. Those instances are typical risks associated with working on a roof and help define the duty to be obeyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">{\u00b6 82} In this case, the following facts are undisputed: (1) the injury to Fleming occurred because he chased after a bucket that he alone had failed to secure; (2) he was specifically trained that if a tool or bucket was falling off the roof, he was not to chase it and was to let it fall; and (3) Fleming ignored his training and <em>jumped </em>off the roof. He did <em>not </em>fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">{\u00b6 83} Analyzing this in another way, we might ask, what should the employer have done if he could have reasonably foreseen the risk that this employee might jump off the roof to chase a bucket? The somewhat obvious answer is that there should be some training to advise the employee not to do that. In this case, Fleming <em>admits </em>he was told by his employer not to do precisely what he did. He was <em>trained </em>not to do <em>the precise act </em>that was unquestionably the proximate cause of his injury. Therefore, the employer discharged his duty to Fleming by specifically warning him not to chase an item down the slope of a roof. Couple this with the clear standard in Ohio established by <em>Fyffe </em>that \u201cthe mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk \u2014 something short of substantial certainty\u2014 is not intent.\u201d <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc., </em>59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">{\u00b6 84} I do not believe there are any genuine issues of material fact in this matter. Further, appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The undisputed evidence shows that Fleming\u2019s injuries were caused by his own actions, which were in express violation of the safety training and instructions he received. The injuries were not a result of the employer\u2019s intentional tort. Accordingly, Fleming\u2019s proper remedy lies within Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">{\u00b6 85} There is no indication that the existence of fall-protection equipment would have prevented this injury. That equipment is designed to prevent accidental falls such as those referred to herein. They are not designed to prevent someone from making the conscious decision to jump off the roof. The lack of fall-protection equipment on this roof had as much to do with the injury as, let\u2019s say, the lack of tail lights on the vehicle that took Fleming to work that day.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
