The property is situated on a heavily traveled portion of Kenwood Road in Blue Ash. The home was built in 1920 and has been used as a private residence since the 1940s. Under the city\u2019s zoning ordinances, the property is located in an R-2 district, which allows only residential uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">{\u00b6 3} In recent years, the Blusts have leased the property to Ruby Blust\u2019s son for $650 per month. Before that, they had leased the house to a tenant for $1,000 per month. According to the appraisals of the Hamilton County Auditor, the property has continued to appreciate in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">{\u00b6 4} Numerous commercial properties have been built in the vicinity of the Blusts\u2019 house. A Jiffy Lube oil-change business is next door to the house, an office building is across the street, and a large office park is located behind the residence. Other businesses have proliferated along Kenwood Road. But immediately to the south of the Blusts\u2019 home, the area remains strictly residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">{\u00b6 5} In 2003, the Blusts entered into a contract to sell the home to a dental-practice group, which planned to raze the house and construct a small office building on the site. The agreement was contingent upon a change in the property\u2019s zoning classification to permit the operation of a dental office.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">{\u00b6 6} The developer of the office project filed an application for a zoning change from residential to commercial, and the city denied that application. The contract with the dental practice therefore was not consummated. In 2004, the Blusts themselves applied for a zoning change for a similar development. The city again denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">{\u00b6 7} The Blusts then filed a declaratory-judgment action challenging the denial of the second application. The Blusts claimed that the denial of the zoning change was unconstitutional, that it constituted a taking of their property, and that it violated their rights to due process and equal protection of the law. The city filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">{\u00b6 8} In a single assignment of error, the Blusts now argue that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">{\u00b6 9} Under Civ.R. 56(C), a motion for summary judgment may be granted only when no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and with the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>construed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to that party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court reviews the granting of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b6 10} The facts in this case concerning the character of the Blusts\u2019 property and the nature of the surrounding uses were uncontroverted. There remained only legal issues concerning the propriety of the zoning classification in light of those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>The Zoning Ordinance </em>Wins <em>Constitutional</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 11} The Blusts first argue that the denial of the zoning-change application was unconstitutionally arbitrary and unreasonable. The city maintains that the denial was necessary to preserve the residential character of the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 12} We begin with the well-settled proposition that municipal legislation is entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To prevail on a claim that a zoning provision is invalid, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is unconstitutional \u201cbeyond fair debate.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">{\u00b6 13} A zoning ordinance is unconstitutional if is arbitrary and unreasonable and bears no substantial relationship to the health, safety, and welfare of the municipality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Alternatively, it is unconstitutional if it denies the economically viable use of land without substantially advancing a legitimate government interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, the Blusts did not demonstrate that the zoning classification was arbitrary or that it failed to advance the health, safety, and welfare of the city. The Blusts argue that the proliferation of business uses in the area, with the traffic, noise, and other conditions arising from commercial uses, rendered the residential classification obsolete.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">{\u00b6 15} This argument is not persuasive. While the record does demonstrate that the area surrounding the Blusts\u2019 property had changed throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>years, the uncontroverted evidence was that the area immediately to the south of the home had retained its residential character. It was certainly within the city\u2019s purview to establish a boundary beyond which business uses would no longer be permitted. The fact that the Blusts\u2019 property represented the point of demarcation was not constitutionally significant. As the trial court properly held, the mere existence of other uses adjacent to residential property does not necessarily destroy the residential character of the entire area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 16} The Blusts cite a number of cases in which zoning restrictions were overturned because there were virtually <em>no </em>residential uses in the immediate vicinity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By contrast, the parcel in this case was within a defined area of residential properties, and the city\u2019s legislative authority could have reasonably determined that it was in the city\u2019s best interest to preserve that area\u2019s residential character. In light of the deference to be accorded such determinations, the fact that the city could have drawn the line elsewhere did not render the designation improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 17} We also find no merit in the contention that the zoning designation denied the Blusts the economically viable use of the land without advancing a legitimate governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 18} A zoning ordinance is not invalid merely because it deprives the owner of the most economically advantageous use of the property; rather, the inquiry is whether the zoning classification denies the owner all practical use of the land.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As this court has recently reiterated, the ability to begin new construction is not one of the fundamental \u201csticks\u201d in an owner\u2019s bundle of property rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And the continued ability to use property for residential purposes generally precludes the finding of a taking, even though the property owner is not permitted to develop the property for more valuable commercial uses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 19} Here, the evidence established that the residential use of the property remained viable. Although the Blusts maintain that no one would want to reside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>in a home in such proximity to business uses, they had successfully rented the residence for years prior to their application for a zoning change, and the value of the property had continued to increase. Thus, the record does not support the argument that a residential use was not economically viable. And as we have already held, the classification of the property advanced the city\u2019s legitimate interest in maintaining the residential character of the area. Accordingly, the Blusts failed to demonstrate beyond fair debate that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\n<em>The City Did Not Violate the Blusts\u2019 Due-Process Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 20} The Blusts next argue that they were deprived of their right to procedural due process by the city\u2019s decision-making process in ruling on the application for a zoning change.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">{\u00b6 21} Procedural due process is a flexible concept that requires such procedural protections as the situation demands.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The fundamental requirement is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">{\u00b6 22} In the case at bar, the Blusts were represented by counsel and were given a full and fair opportunity to present their case. The sole basis for their claim that the proceedings were unfair were hearsay statements by city officials that the city had already earmarked the property for a public-transportation terminal. Those alleged comments, standing alone, were not sufficient to demonstrate that the city had failed to fairly consider the Blusts\u2019 application or that it had deprived the Blusts of a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">{\u00b6 23} The Blusts also argue that the city deprived them of their right to substantive due process in denying their application for a zoning change. \u201cSubstantive due process\u201d in general pertains only to liberty interests secured by the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because property is an individual right secured by state law,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> property rights are protected only by procedural due process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, we reject the substantive-due-process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\n<em>The Blusts Were Not Denied Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">{\u00b6 24} Next, the Blusts argue that they were denied the equal protection of the law because similarly situated properties had been zoned for business uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 25} Zoning regulations are subject to rational-basis scrutiny, meaning that they are invalid only if they make distinctions that bear no reasonable relationship to the government\u2019s interests and no ground can be conceived to justify them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 26} As we have already concluded, the R-2 designation was rationally related to the city\u2019s legitimate interest in preserving the residential character of the neighborhood. The city had a legitimate interest in drawing a line past which business uses would not be permitted, and it did not act unreasonably in drawing that line at the Blusts\u2019 property. Accordingly, the Blusts\u2019 argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>The City Did Not Violate Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">{\u00b6 27} Finally, the Blusts argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the city on their claim under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code. But because that claim was based on the alleged civil-rights violations that we have already held meritless, we also find no error in the court\u2019s rejection of the Section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">{\u00b6 28} We overrule the assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-13\">Dinkelacker, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b191-14\">Painter, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">.

Much has changed. The \u201cneighborhood\u201d is no longer residential. To designate it so \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to prevent the property from being used as a small office building (still dwarfed by those around it) \u2014 is arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 31} Although the majority opinion describes the area, it falls far short of giving a picture of just how commercial this area has become.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 32} On the north side of the property, next to the Jiffy Lube, is a restaurant and bar. On the other side of the busy intersection is a gas station, a dentist\u2019s office, a real estate office, and another restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 33} Directly across the street from the Blust property is a 116,000-square-foot office budding with a large parking lot. Eight or nine single-family houses were razed for that development.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 34} Behind the Blusts is a railroad track. Just behind the track is a six-story office park with a large parking lot and lighting that \u201clight[s] up the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">{\u00b6 35} The majority opinion correctly notes that the area immediately south of the Blust property (along Kenwood Road) is \u201cstrictly residential.\u201d But it does not mention that only five or six houses exist between the Blust property and a natural creek bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">{\u00b6 36} Thus the entire area north of a natural creek bed is commercial\u2014 including a Jiffy Lube and huge office parks \u2014 except for a few houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">{\u00b6 37} In the past ten years \u2014 and according to the Blusts for as long as they can remember \u2014 Blue Ash has denied only one request for a zoning change: theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">\n<em>Arbitrary, Capricious, and Absurd</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">{\u00b6 38} The Blusts are challenging the zoning ordinance as applied to them, not on its face. And as applied to them, the ordinance is unconstitutional. The property\u2019s value as \u201cresidential\u201d has decreased almost to the point of being worthless. It has value only for commercial use. Granting permission for the surrounding office buildings, commercial uses, and a Jiffy Lube next door \u2014 and denying the Blusts a zone change for a dentist office \u2014 -is akin to confiscation of the Blusts\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">{\u00b6 39} The city claims that it denied the Blusts\u2019 application to preserve the \u201cresidential nature\u201d of the neighborhood. What? When the \u201cneighbors\u201d are Jiffy Lube and humongous office parks?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">{\u00b6 40} The city arbitrarily chose the Blusts\u2019 property as the cut-off point between residential and commercial. The city argued that the area to the south of the Blusts\u2019 property was strictly residential. Yes, there were five or six houses to the south of the property. But to call the character of the neighborhood north of the creek bed residential is comical.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>{\u00b6 41} A natural creek bed would serve as an ideal boundary. But instead, the city chose the Blust property to be its boundary \u2014 its line in the sand \u2014 between commercial and residential. And only on that side of the street \u2014 the city allowed developers <em>directly across the street </em>to raze single-family houses to build the office park. Why allow high-traffic commercial businesses to the north, east, and west \u2014 allowing the owners of those properties to realize their value \u2014 but not let the Blusts sell their property to a dental group?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">{\u00b6 42} Furthermore, the Blusts clearly demonstrated that the zoning designation was \u201cnot substantially related to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 43} A dental practice would probably not destroy Blue Ash\u2019s public health or morals. The onliest other reason cited by the city \u2014 other than preserving the \u201cresidential\u201d character of the neighborhood \u2014 was traffic. Not likely. How could a small dental practice (three dentists) create significant additional traffic in this area, especially since the bar, the Jiffy Lube, the office parks, the gas stations, and <em>another </em>dental practice are within spitting distance of the Blusts\u2019 property? If these businesses did not create a traffic problem, then a small dental practice would not put traffic over the edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 44} The area is commercial. It has been for some time. Blue Ash has granted zoning changes to allow that use. Thus it has taken almost all of the Blusts\u2019 property\u2019s value as residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 45} This zoning is simply an arbitrary, capricious, and absurd line in the sand \u2014 long after the beach has washed away.</p>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b193-16\">. <em>Mayfield-Dorsh, Inc. v.
