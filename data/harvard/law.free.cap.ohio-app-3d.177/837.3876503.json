A consent judgment entry filed on January 28, 2005, established a shared-parenting plan that provided for \u201cequitable sharing of parental rights, responsibilities, and decision making\u201d for Katherina. One year and two months later, Jessy filed a motion to terminate the shared-parenting agreement and sought an order naming her residential parent and legal custodian. By agreement of the parties, attorney Pamela Manning was appointed Katherina\u2019s guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d), and the matter was set for an expedited hearing. Jessy then filed a motion to dismiss her own motion, without prejudice. The parties filed a consent judgment entry agreeing to continue shared parenting and to continue Manning\u2019s appointment as GAL. The parties also agreed that both they and Katherina would undergo psychiatric evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">{\u00b6 3} On March 16, 2006, Jessy filed a second motion to terminate the shared-parenting time and requested custody. Andrew responded by filing his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>motion to terminate the plan and requesting custody. Dr. Wayne Graves was appointed to perform psychological evaluations on Jessy, Andrew, and Katherina.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">{\u00b6 4} At trial, Andrew withdrew his motion to terminate the shared-parenting plan and orally requested that the shared-parenting plan continue \u201cin some form.\u201d After two days of testimony, including evidence of Dr. Graves\u2019s evaluations and the GAL\u2019s recommendations, the magistrate denied Jessy\u2019s motion to terminate the shared-parenting plan. The magistrate\u2019s decision granted each party parenting time for seven consecutive days with alternating weeks. The GAL and Jessy filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and reiterated their request that Jessy be named Katherina\u2019s residential parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">{\u00b6 5} On April 5, 2007, the trial court issued a judgment entry with new factual findings, adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision in part and rejecting it in part. Supporting its conclusion, the trial court made the following specific findings in its judgment entry:</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">{\u00b6 6} 1. A Children\u2019s Resource Center prevention specialist who personally observed Jessy and Andrew with Katherina testified that each parent obviously loves Katherina and interacts appropriately with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">{\u00b6 7} 2. Based on the evidence, \u201cKatherina has adjusted well to her home and community. Both parents have been involved throughout Katherina\u2019s life. Katherina has further had opportunity such as attending ballet classes, basketball, soccer, gymnastics, and nature classes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">{\u00b6 8} 3. Andrew voluntarily works one day per week and has not worked full-time for approximately four years. Andrew relies \u201cheavily upon his parents for payment of bills and support.\u201d Jessy works one full-time job and one part-time job. Jessy \u201cis able to provide basic support for herself and Katherina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">{\u00b6 9} 4. Andrew took Katherina to hospital emergency rooms approximately \u201cten times over a four year span for a variety of reasons including constipation, diaper rash, and alleged abuse. In Katherina\u2019s short life, there have been four investigations of alleged physical abuse of Katherina. All of these investigations have been concluded as unsubstantiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">{\u00b6 10} 5. \u201c[Wjhile there was no substantiated abuse, at the very least a number of injuries sustained by Katherina appear to demonstrate some lack of an appropriate level of supervision provided to Katherina\u201d by Jessy.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">{\u00b6 11} 6. Dr. Wayne Graves, a psychiatrist qualified as an expert, evaluated Jessy, Andrew, and Katherina.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">{\u00b6 12} 7. With respect to Katherina, Dr. Graves \u201cdid express some concern over the emotional impact of Katherina repeatedly being taken to the emergency room\u201d by Andrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>{\u00b6 13} 8. With respect to Andrew, Dr. Graves found appellee \u201csomewhat guarded and resistant during his evaluation to the extent he failed to answer certain questions which made a complete assessment * * * difficult.\u201d Andrew \u201calso appears to emphasize concerns and physical issues with Katherina perhaps to an extreme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">{\u00b6 14} 9. Other evidence led the trial court to find that Andrew \u201cworks well with those he considers supporting his position and is reluctant or guarded to work with those he perceives to have positions contrary to his.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">{\u00b6 15} 10. Evidence led the trial court to find that events occurred that \u201cpurportedly provide an insight into [Andrew\u2019s] mental health, thought processes or judgments,\u201d including:</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">{\u00b6 16} a. While proceedings were pending, Andrew established a website critical of the Wood County Department of Job and Family Services, believing that it did not properly investigate his allegations that Katherina was physically abused. Andrew placed pictures of Katherina on the website and banners of his criticism in his yard. Katherina saw one of the banners at least once. The trial court found that these actions \u201cdemonstrate poor judgment and at their worst, attempt to place Katherina\u2019s situation * * * in the public domain primarily for [Andrew\u2019s] purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">{\u00b6 17} b. Andrew kept Katherina\u2019s soiled diapers for \u201csignificant periods of time in an effort to demonstrate [that Jessy] failed to change diapers as needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">{\u00b6 18} c. Andrew \u201ctook pictures of Katherina\u2019s bowel movements. [Andrew] claims these photos were taken as a result of Katherina\u2019s constipation issues and for medical purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">{\u00b6 19} 11. With respect to Jessy, Dr. Graves described her as \u201copen, honest and as someone who avoided conflict.\u201d Jessy was also found to be \u201crelatively independent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">{\u00b6 20} 12. Evidence led the trial court to find that events occurred that \u201cpurportedly provide an insight into [Jessy\u2019s] mental health, thought processes or judgments,\u201d including:</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">{\u00b6 21} a. A documented incident when Jessy left Katherina alone in a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">{\u00b6 22} b. Jessy allowed a \u201cmale companion to spend the night with [Jessy] in [Jessy\u2019s] bed- \u2014 -which is located in the same room where Katherina was sleeping\u2014 separated by a partial partition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">{\u00b6 23} c. \u201cAn incident observed in a YMCA parking lot wherein [Jessy] was observed yelling at Katherina and, per one witness, slapping Katherina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">{\u00b6 24} 13. A specific finding that \u201cboth [Jessy] and [Andrew] can generally honor and facilitate parenting time Orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>{\u00b6 25} 14. Since Andrew believes that Jessy is responsible for alleged physical abuse, and since Jessy \u201cis not desirous of shared parenting,\u201d the trial court found \u201cnearly a complete breakdown of trust between the parties at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">{\u00b6 26} 15. Because testimony conflicted as to whether Andrew consulted with Jessy before changing Katherina\u2019s doctors, enrolled Katherina in counseling, and enrolled Katherina in activities, the court found that \u201cthe ability of the parents to cooperate and make decisions jointly is also seriously compromised\u201d and \u201cextremely limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">{\u00b6 27} 16. The GAL and Dr. Graves recommended that the shared-parenting plan be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">{\u00b6 28} 17. Given the context, \u201cany concept of \u2018shared parenting\u2019 would be a shared parenting plan on paper only. * * * Any use of the word \u2018shared parenting\u2019 in this context is simply a charade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">{\u00b6 29} Based on those findings, the trial court concluded that a change in circumstances had occurred since the original shared-parenting plan was instituted, concluded that termination of the shared-parenting plan was in Katherina\u2019s best interests, and concluded that any harm caused by a new arrangement would be outweighed by the advantages.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">{\u00b6 30} The trial court\u2019s order grants Jessy and Andrew each seven consecutive days of parenting time every other week, with weeks alternating. With respect to the allocation of parental rights, the order specifically states: \u201cPlaintiff/Father and Defendant/Mother shall be named the residential parent and legal custodian of Katherina at all such times as Katherina is legally with them * * Both Jessy and Andrew were given authority to make medical decisions for Katherina \u201cwhile Katherina is physically present with them.\u201d Visitation for holidays was ordered pursuant to the standard court schedule. The parties were ordered to refrain from scheduling activities in conflict with the other parent\u2019s time, without consent. However, they were ordered not to change Katherina\u2019s health-care providers and were required to give each other notice of all nonemergency medical appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">{\u00b6 31} From that order, Jessy appealed and now assigns the following as error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in granting both parties residential parent status with a fifty-fifty time share and joint decision making responsibilities while terminating the shared parenting plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">{\u00b6 33} Jessy argues that the court abused its discretion by contradicting its own findings and recommendations. Specifically, she argues that it was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>abuse of discretion to find shared parenting to be against Katherina\u2019s best interests and then to institute the equivalent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">{\u00b6 34} In determining the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities for the care of minor children, the trial court is vested with broad discretion. <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846. Absent an abuse of that discretion, a trial court\u2019s decision regarding these issues will be upheld. <em>Masters v. Masters </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 83, 85, 630 N.E.2d 665. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140; <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159, citing <em>Bechtol v. Bechtol </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 21, 550 N.E.2d 178, syllabus. \u201cA finding of an error in law is a legitimate ground for reversal * * *.\u201d <em>Davis </em>at 419, 674 N.E.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">{\u00b6 35} R.C. 2151.23(F)(1) provides that the juvenile court shall exercise its jurisdiction in child-custody matters in accordance with R.C. 3109.04, which authorizes domestic-relations courts to allocate parental rights and responsibilities for the care of minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">{\u00b6 36} In order to change the designation of the residential parent and legal custodian of a child, the court must determine that a change in circumstances has occurred and that the modification is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Fisher v. Hasenjager, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 53, 2007-Ohio-5589, 876 N.E.2d 546, syllabus, interpreting R.C. 3109.04(E)(1). However, a court may, without altering the designation of the residential parent and legal custody, \u201cmodify\u201d the terms of a shared-parenting plan on a finding that a modification would be in the child\u2019s best interests. R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(b); <em>Fisher, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 53, 2007-Ohio-5589, 876 N.E.2d 546, \u00b6 27. Thus, a court may modify the terms of a shared-parenting plan without changing the residential parent and legal custodian pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(E)(2), but may only change the designation of the residential parent and legal custodian pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">{\u00b6 37} However, other provisions apply here. \u201cShared parenting\u201d means \u201cthat the parents share, in the manner set forth in the plan for shared parenting that is approved by the court * * * all of some of the aspects of physical and legal care of their children.\u201d R.C. 3109.04(J). The trial court expressly found, granting Jessy\u2019s motion, that shared parenting was no longer in Katherina\u2019s best interest. Accordingly, it expressly and properly terminated the shared-parenting plan pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(c). That section provides; \u201cThe court may terminate a prior shared parenting decree that includes a shared parenting plan * * * upon the request of one or both of the parents or whenever it determines that shared parenting is not in the best interest of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Upon the granting of Jessy\u2019s motion, the trial court was then obliged to follow R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(d), which provides: \u201cUpon the termination of a prior final shared parenting decree under division (E)(2)(c) of this section, the court <em>shall proceed and issue a modified decree for the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities </em>for the care of the children under the standards applicable under divisions (A), (B), and (C) of this section as if no decree for shared parenting had been granted and as if no request for shared parenting ever had been made.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">{\u00b6 39} Division (A) of R.C. 3109.04 gives a trial court two options for allocating parental rights and responsibilities. The second option, R.C. 3109.04(A)(2), allows a trial court to \u201callocate the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the children <em>to both parents and issue a shared parenting order </em>* * (Emphasis added.) However, this can only be done if shared parenting is in the child\u2019s best interest. The GAL and Dr. Graves recommended that shared parenting was not in Katherina\u2019s best interest, and the trial court expressly found against a shared-parenting plan. This section, therefore, cannot apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">{\u00b6 40} Because Andrew had filed an oral motion requesting shared parenting, but the court found shared parenting to be against Katherina\u2019s interests, the only other option for the trial court lay in R.C. 3109.04(A)(1), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[I]f at least one parent files both a pleading or motion and a shared parenting plan under that division but no plan for shared parenting is in the best interest of the children, the court, in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children, <em>shall allocate the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the children primarily to one of the parents, designate that parent as the residential parent and the legal custodian of the child, </em>and divide between the parents the other rights and responsibilities for the care of the children, including, but not limited to, the responsibility to provide support for the children and the right of the parent who is not the residential parent to have continuing contact with the children.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">{\u00b6 42} The conclusion that shared parenting was against Katherina\u2019s interest was, given the evidence, proper. However, the trial court clearly abused its discretion and applied the incorrect statutory sections when naming both Jessy and Andrew as the residential parent and legal custodian. Based upon the parties\u2019 motions and the trial court\u2019s own conclusion that shared parenting was unsuitable, and pursuant to the framework of R.C. 3109.04, the only option was to follow the requirements of R.C. 3109.04(A). The plain language of that section forbids the trial court from naming both parents as the residential parent and legal custodian. R.C. 3109.04(A) allows only one parent to be named the residential parent and legal custodian when a shared-parenting plan cannot and should not be adopted. One parent must have primary rights and responsibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>ties, and only one parent can be designated legal custodian. This must be done considering the \u201cbest interest\u201d factors criteria of R.C. 3109.04(F)(1). As evidenced by the word \u201cshall\u201d in division (A)(1), the court, based on its own conclusions, had no discretion to do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken. The judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is reversed, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision and judgment and the applicable law. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Wood County.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b882-6\">Handwork and Osowik, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
