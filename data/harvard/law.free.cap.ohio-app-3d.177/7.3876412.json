(\u201cBeazer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">{\u00b6 2} The relevant factual and procedural history follows. This case concerns the development of a residential subdivision located in the city of Groveport in Franklin County, and known as \u201cElmont Place.\u201d Stonehenge is a land developer, and Beazer is in the business of building and selling single-family homes. On July 27, 2000, Stonehenge entered into a written contract with Beazer\u2019s predecessor-in-interest, Crossmann Communities, Inc., d.b.a. Beazer Homes, relating to Beazer\u2019s purchase of all of the lots to be developed in Elmont Place (the \u201c2000 contract\u201d). In April 2002, the parties executed an amendment to the 2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>contract, which allowed Stonehenge to sell some lots to another builder, thereby reducing the number of lots that Beazer was required to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">{\u00b6 3} By letter dated June 9, 2004, Beazer\u2019s counsel advised Stonehenge that Beazer did not wish to acquire any additional lots in the Elmont Place development. By letter dated September 9, 2004, however, Beazer\u2019s counsel advised Stonehenge that, despite having not received a response to its previous letter, Beazer had reevaluated its position and now wished to move forward with purchasing additional lots. Later, following additional negotiations, the parties entered into another contract dated November 23, 2004 (the \u201c2004 contract\u201d). This contract concerned only the lots located in Sections 1 and 2 of Phase III of the Elmont Place development.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">{\u00b64} The 2004 contract provided for separate purchase prices for lots in Sections 1 and 2, and contained the following provision with respect to earnest money, including a liquidated-damages clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">2. Earnest Money Deposit. Upon execution of this Agreement, Builder shall deposit Seventeen Thousand Dollars ($17,000) (the Earnest Money) with Developer, to be held by Developer in trust upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">Builder shall forfeit the earnest money to Developer if Builder fails or refuses to perform its obligations herein specified. In such event, damages will be impossible to ascertain; therefore, such forfeiture of the Earnest Money shall constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and shall be Developer\u2019s sole remedy at law or in equity for a breach of any covenants or agreements of this Agreement to be performed or observed by Builder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, and any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary also notwithstanding, as to the first ten (10) Lots in each Section, provided that the Builder has deposited the Earnest Money with Developer for the respective Section, Developer shall be entitled to all remedies at law and in equity, including the right to pursue specific performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">The Earnest Money otherwise shall be refunded or forfeited in accordance with the terms contained in this Agreement, and if all the terms and conditions of this Agreement are satisfied or waived and a transaction is closed, then the Earnest Money shall be applied as a One Thousand Dollar ($1,000) credit toward the purchase price as to each specific Lot as to which the transaction is closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">When future sections are developed, Builder shall deposit Earnest Money in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per Lot when Developer notifies Builder, in writing, that all necessary and appropriate construction permits and plat approvals have been obtained. The said Earnest Money shall be applied as a credit in the same amount toward the purchase price of each such Lot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Section 4 of the 2004 contract required that Beazer \u201ctake down\u201d at least two lots per month, and also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">If Builder fails to take down the required number of Lots in any single calendar month, Builder will stand in default, and upon <em>five (5) business days\u2019 written </em>notice thereof to Builder, <em>at the expiration of which Builder shall still have failed to take down the required number of Lots, </em>Developer may terminate this agreement and retain the balance of the Earnest Money as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty, since damages will be impossible to determine).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer may require assurances from Builder at any reasonable time (and from time to time) as to Builder\u2019s readiness, willingness, and ability to perform under this Agreement. Builder\u2019s failure to <em>provide Developer with </em>assurances upon Developer\u2019s reasonable request within the reasonable time requested by Developer, and/or any breach by Builder, shall entitle Developer to retain the balance of the Earnest Money and, further, relieve Developer of any further obligation under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">(Emphasis sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">{\u00b6 6} The 2004 contract also contained an integration clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">14. Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement sets forth the entire and final agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Any and all prior agreements, understandings, or undertakings, whether written or oral, with respect to the same, are hereby superseded and replaced by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing, executed by each party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">{\u00b6 7} Both the 2000 contract and the 2004 contract contained provisions related to default and cure, nonwaiver, and notices as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">15. Cure and Default. Except as provided in section 4, no failure or default by either party hereto concerning any act required by it shall result in the termination of any right of either party hereunder until such party shall have failed to remedy such failure or cure such default within thirty (30) days after the receipt of written notice of the failure to [sic] default. Receipt shall be assumed upon the earlier of actual receipt or three (3) days after such notice is placed in the U.S. Mail, <em>properly addressed with postage prepaid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">16. Non-Waiver. No waiver, forbearance, of [sic] failure by any party of its right to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver or estoppel of such party\u2019s right to enforce such provision in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">17. Notices. All notices shall be in writing, and shall be deemed delivered when deposited in the U.S. Mail, addressed to the notices as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Crossmann Communities, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">dba Beazer Homes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">Attn: Jeff Lodgson [sic, Logsdon]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">929 Eastwind Drive, Suite 223</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">Westerville, Ohio 43081</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">Stonehenge Land Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At1\">Attn: Mo M. Dioun</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">41 North High Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtF\">New Albany, Ohio 43054</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">(Emphasis sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">{\u00b6 8} Following execution of the 2004 contract, Beazer deposited the $17,000 in earnest money and closed on 16 lots in Phase III, Section 1 of Elmont Place. On May 12, 2005, Stonehenge notified Beazer that all necessary construction permits and plan approvals had been obtained for Phase III, Section 2. It is undisputed that Beazer did not deposit any earnest money for Section 2, nor did it purchase any lots in Section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">{\u00b6 9} The evidence suggests that between May 12, 2005, and November 2, 2005, Beazer\u2019s legal counsel wrote several letters to Stonehenge indicating Beazer\u2019s position that it had no contractual obligation to purchase additional lots. Then, by letter dated November 2, 2005, Stonehenge\u2019s counsel sent a letter to Beazer\u2019s counsel, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">Dear Mr. Dye:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">This firm represents The Stonehenge Company (\u201cStonehenge\u201d). We are responding to your letters to Mr. VanSlyck and Mr. Dioun regarding Cross-man\u2019s [sic, Crossmann\u2019s] obligations under the Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for the Elmont Place Subdivision (\u201cElmont\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">Under any reasonable interpretation of the Agreement, Crossman [sic, Crossmann] is in breach. The Agreement required Crossman [sic, Crossmann] to deposit one thousand dollars ($1,000) per lot in earnest money with Stonehenge when written notice is given that all necessary and appropriate construction permits and plat approvals have been obtained for Section 2 at Elmont. * * * By letter dated May 12, 2005, Stonehenge gave written notice that all necessary construction permits and plot [sic] approvals for Section 2 at Elmont have been obtained. Despite Stonehenge\u2019s repeated demands for payment of earnest money, Crossman [sic, Crossmann] has failed to deposit the earnest money as required by the Agreement. Crossman\u2019s [sic, Crossmann\u2019s] failure to make the deposit of earnest money is a material breach of the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>* * * If I do not hear from you in five business days from the date of this letter, I will assume you have no interest in negotiating a resolution of this dispute, and we will proceed accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">{\u00b6 10} On February 27, 2006, Stonehenge filed a complaint against Beazer, which stated causes of action for breach of the 2000 and 2004 contracts, intentional misrepresentation, and fraudulent inducement, and sought damages in excess of $300,000. The breach-of-contract claims included claims that Beazer breached its duty to purchase Phase III lots under both the 2000 and 2004 contracts and that it anticipatorily breached its duty to purchase Phase IV lots under both contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">{\u00b6 11} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. With respect to the breach-of-contract claims, Beazer argued that it did not breach either contract, Stonehenge\u2019s claims were barred because it had not satisfied the condition precedent of properly serving a notice of default, and the liquidated-damages provision in the 2004 contract limited Stonehenge\u2019s damages to the amount of earnest money already deposited. Stonehenge argued that Beazer breached both the 2000 and 2004 contracts by failing to purchase certain lots in Phase III and any lots in Phase IV, and that Stonehenge is entitled to specific performance as a remedy for these breaches. With respect to the tort claims, Beazer argued that Stonehenge could not establish the element of justifiable reliance common to both claims, and Stonehenge argued that genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">{\u00b6 12} By decision and entry dated February 21, 2007, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Stonehenge on its claim for breach of its obligations to purchase Phase III lots under the 2004 contract. The court found that Stonehenge\u2019s failure to provide written notice of default, in accordance with the provisions for such notice set forth in the contract, was a \u201ctechnical breach\u201d of the notice provision, but that it was not a \u201cmaterial\u201d breach. Therefore, the court reasoned, the failure to comply with the notice provision did not entitle Beazer to summary judgment on the breach-of-contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">{\u00b6 13} The court found that Stonehenge is entitled to damages for breach of contract, but is not entitled to specific performance. This is because the 2004 contract only provides for specific performance as to any lots with respect to which Beazer had deposited earnest money but then failed to purchase. Since Beazer had purchased all lots for which it had deposited earnest money, specific performance was not available. The trial court further found that the liquidated-damages provision is ambiguous as to whether it provides merely for retention of earnest money already deposited or whether it also allows Stonehenge to recover monies that it expected Beazer would deposit for Phase III lots, but that never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>were in fact deposited. Therefore, it determined that the jury would decide what the liquidated-damages provision meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">{\u00b6 14} As to Beazer\u2019s obligation to purchase Phase IV lots, the court denied both parties\u2019 summary-judgment motions. The court recognized that the 2004 contract contains an integration clause, but noted that the 2000 contract concerns <em>all phases </em>of Elmont Place, whereas the 2004 contract only concerns Phase III. Therefore, the court determined that there remained a question for the jury whether the 2004 contract superseded the 2000 contract with respect to Phases III and IV, or whether it only superseded the 2000 contract with respect to Phase III. In other words, the jury was to determine whether Beazer\u2019s obligation to purchase Phase IV lots under the 2000 contract survived the parties\u2019 execution of the 2004 contract. Finally, the court denied both parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment with respect to the tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">{\u00b6 15} Beazer made several motions in limine, including a motion to exclude any evidence as to the actual value of the Elmont Place lots, and other evidence as to Stonehenge\u2019s actual damages, arguing that the liquidated-damages clause precluded the jury\u2019s consideration of such evidence. The court denied the motion and allowed Stonehenge to introduce evidence of its actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">{\u00b6 16} Following a four-day trial, the jury answered a series of interrogatories. The jury granted judgment in favor of Beazer on the fraudulent-inducement and intentional-misrepresentation claims. The jury determined that the 2004 contract \u201cnullified,\u201d or superseded, the 2000 contract, with respect to Phase III lots, and that Beazer did not breach the 2000 contract when it failed to purchase Phase IV lots. Therefore, it granted judgment in favor of Beazer with respect to Stonehenge\u2019s claims for breach of the unsuperseded portion of the 2000 contract; that is, the claims based on Beazer\u2019s failure to purchase Phase IV lots. With respect to Stonehenge\u2019s claims for breach of the obligation to purchase Phase III lots under the 2004 contract (for which the trial court had already granted summary judgment to Stonehenge), the jury determined that the liquidated-damages provision does not limit Stonehenge\u2019s damages to earnest money already deposited. The jury awarded Stonehenge $359,522 in damages for breach of the 2004 contract, and $100,000 in attorney fees. Finally, the jury determined that Stonehenge had not made reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages and had incurred $45,960 in damages that it could have avoided by mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">{\u00b6 17} After trial, Beazer moved the court for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B). Specifically, it argued that the jury\u2019s award of attorney fees was unsupported by the evidence because Stonehenge had offered no evidence as to the reasonableness of the fees. The trial court agreed and granted the motion. Beazer also moved the court for an award of attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>expended in its successful defense of Stonehenge\u2019s claims under the 2000 contract, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">{\u00b6 18} Each party filed a separate appeal, and we consolidated the appeals for decision. In its appeal, Beazer advances three assignments of error for our consideration, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">Assignment of Error Number One</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">The Trial Court erred in granting Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment because Appellant was not given a contractually required notice of default and opportunity to cure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">Assignment of Error Number Two</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">The Trial Court erred by submitting the issue of Appellee\u2019s actual damages to the jury when the Court had already determined that there was a clear and unambiguous contract provision for liquidated damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">Assignment of Error Number Three</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">The Trial Court erred by denying Appellant\u2019s motion for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, to which Appellant was entitled pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Purchase Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">{\u00b6 19} In its appeal, Stonehenge advances the following assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">Assignment of Error No. 1: The Trial Court erred by granting Beazer\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and vacating the jury award of attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">Assignment of Error No. 2: The Trial Court erred by denying Stonehenge an award of prejudgment interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">Assignment of Error No. 3: The Trial Court erred by failing to order a post-trial hearing to allow Stonehenge to present complete evidence of its attorneys fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">{\u00b6 20} We begin with Beazer\u2019s first assignment of error, in which Beazer argues that the trial court erred in concluding that Stonehenge\u2019s breach-of-contract claim was not barred by Stonehenge\u2019s failure to provide notice of default and an opportunity to cure, according to the specific procedure set forth in the 2004 contract. The contract provided that no failure or default by any party results in termination of any right under the contract until the party shall have failed to cure the default within 30 days after receipt of written notice of the failure or default, and that any such written notices were to be sent via U.S. Mail to Stonehenge in care of employee Jeff Logsdon. See \u00b6 7, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">{\u00b6 21} The trial court found that the letter dated November 2, 2005, from Stonehenge\u2019s attorney to Beazer\u2019s attorney, constituted sufficient notice of default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and of Stonehenge\u2019s intent to declare a breach and to pursue its remedies under the contracts. The court determined that Stonehenge\u2019s failure to address the letter to Logsdon, at the address provided in the contracts, was a technical breach of the notice provision, but was not material or prejudicial. The court also found that Beazer had both actual notice of Stonehenge\u2019s declaration of default and intent to declare a breach, and an opportunity to cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">{\u00b6 22} On appeal, Beazer argues that the trial court\u2019s determination undermined the purpose for which the notice provision was negotiated, which was to make the designated decision-maker, Logsdon, aware of circumstances in which Stonehenge believed Beazer to be in default and of how long Beazer had to decide whether or not to cure. The only case that Beazer cites in support of its position is the case of <em>Cummings v. Getz </em>(Feb. 11, 1985), Butler App. No. CA84-09-105, 1985 WL 8164, which does not support Beazer\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Cummings, </em>a former tenant sued her landlord for return of her security deposit, and the landlord asserted the affirmative defense that the tenant had not given the contractually required 30-day written notice of intent to vacate at the end of the lease term. The court of appeals held that, in the context of a residential lease, the purpose of requiring written notice of intent to vacate is to create certainty. However, the court determined that the tenant\u2019s failure to provide written notice of intent to vacate was immaterial because she had requested that the landlord allow her and her husband to terminate the lease before the expiration of the lease term, and he had advised her that she would have to wait until the end of the term. Thus, because the landlord had actual notice that the tenant intended not to renew her lease, her failure to comply with the notice terms was not a defense to the tenant\u2019s breach-of-contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">{\u00b6 24} Our research reveals support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that where there is evidence of actual notice, a technical deviation from a contractual notice requirement will not bar the action for breach of contract brought against a party that had actual notice. In <em>Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. v. Calex Corp., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-980, 2006-Ohio-638, 2006 WL 328679, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cThe long and uniformly settled rule as to contracts requires only a substantial performance in order to recover upon such contract. Merely nominal, trifling, or technical departures are not sufficient to breach the contract.\u201d <em>Ohio Farmers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Cochran </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 427, 135 N.E. 537, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cA court should confine the application of the doctrine of substantial performance to cases where the party has made an honest or good faith effort to perform the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Burlington Resources Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Cox </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 543, 548, 729 N.E.2d 398, citing <em>Ashley v. Henahan </em>(1897), 56 Ohio St. 559, 47 N.E. 573, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cFor the doctrine of substantial performance to apply, the part unperformed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>must not destroy the value or purpose of the contract.\u201d <em>Hansel v. Creative Concrete &amp; Masonry Constr. Co., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 53, 2002-Ohio-198, 772 N.E.2d 138, at \u00b6 12, citing <em>F.C. Mach. Tool &amp; Design, Inc. v. Custom Design Technologies, Inc. </em>(Dec. 27, 2001), Stark App. No. 2001CA00019, 2001 WL 1673702, citing <em>Wengerd v. Martin </em>(May 6, 1998), Wayne App. No. 97CA0046 [1998 WL 225107]. Furthermore, \u201cwhen the facts presented in a case are undisputed, whether they constitute performance or a breach of the contract, is question of law for the court.\u201d <em>Luntz v. Stern </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 225, 237, 20 N.E.2d 241.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">Id. at \u00b6 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">{\u00b6 25} Stonehenge\u2019s attorney\u2019s letter to Beazer\u2019s attorney may have deviated from the contract\u2019s express terms as to where Stonehenge was required to send written notice of default and election to pursue contractual remedies for breach. However, under the facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot say that this technical deviation was sufficient to constitute breach of the 2004 contract that would relieve Beazer of liability for its breach. See, e.g., <em>Ohio Farmers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Cochran </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 427, 135 N.E. 537, paragraph two of the syllabus (holding that merely nominal, trifling or technical departures are not sufficient to constitute breach of contract); see also <em>Roger J. Au &amp; Son, Inc. v. Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 284, 292, 29 OBR 349, 504 N.E.2d 1209 (stating that \u201c[t]here is no reason to deny the claims for lack of written notice [if a party] was aware of [a disputed fact] and had a proper opportunity to investigate and act on its knowledge, as the purpose of the formal notice would thereby have been fulfilled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA repudiation or other total breach by one party enables the other to get a judgment for damages or for restitution without performing acts that would otherwise have been conditions precedent.\u201d 5 Corbin on Contracts (1951) 920, 922, Section 977. On this principle, Ohio courts have concluded that the \u201crenunciation of a contract by one of the parties constitutes a breach of contract which gives rise to a cause of action for damages, and in such a case notice, demand and tender are waived.\u201d <em>Loft v. Sibcy-Cline Realtors </em>(Dec. 13, 1989), Hamilton App. No. C-880446, 1989 WL 149667, *3. Here, Beazer repudiated the contract by failing and refusing to perform the obligations that went to the heart of the contract itself \u2014 the purchase of lots. Under those circumstances, Beazer cannot now insist that Stonehenge scrupulously adhere to every term of the contract. <em>Midwest Payment Sys., Inc. v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank </em>(S.D.Ohio 1992), 801 F.Supp. 9, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">{\u00b6 27} For all of the foregoing reasons, Beazer\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>{\u00b6 28} In support of its second assignment of error, Beazer contends that the trial court erred in determining that the liquidated-damages provision of the 2004 contract was ambiguous, and in submitting the issue of damages to the jury. The question of whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. <em>Wells v. C.J. Mahan Constr. Co., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-180, 2006-Ohio-1831, 2006 WL 951444, \u00b6 21, citing <em>Latina v. Woodpath Dev. Co. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 212, 214, 567 N.E.2d 262. An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s resolution of legal issues de novo, without deference to the result that was reached by the trial court. <em>Graham v. Drydock Coal Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 311, 313, 667 N.E.2d 949. A court should interpret a contract to give effect to the intention of the parties as manifested by the language of the contract. <em>Skivolocki v. E. Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 244, 67 O.O.2d 321, 313 N.E.2d 374, paragraph one of the syllabus. When the terms of the contract are clear and unambiguous, courts may not create a new contract by finding intent not expressed by the terms. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 245-246, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">{\u00b6 29} In this case, the liquidated-damages provision is contained within Section 2 of the 2004 contract and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">Earnest Money Deposit. Upon execution of this Agreement, Builder shall deposit Seventeen Thousand Dollars ($17,000) (the Earnest Money) with Developer, to be held by Developer in trust upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">Builder shall forfeit the earnest money to Developer if Builder fails or refuses to perform its obligations herein specified. In such event, damages will be impossible to ascertain; therefore, such forfeiture of the Earnest Money shall constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and shall be Developer\u2019s sole remedy at law or in equity for a breach of any covenants or agreement of this Agreement to be performed or observed by Builder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, and any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary also notwithstanding, as to the first ten (10) Lots in each Section, provided that the Builder has deposited the Earnest Money with Developer for the respective Section, Developer shall be entitled to all remedies at law and in equity, including the right to pursue specific performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">The Earnest Money otherwise shall be refunded or forfeited in accordance with the terms contained in this Agreement, and if all the terms and conditions of this Agreement are satisfied or waived and a transaction is closed, then the Earnest Money shall be applied as a One Thousand Dollar ($1,000) credit toward the purchase price as to each specific Lot as to which the transaction is closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>When future Sections are developed, Builder shall deposit Earnest Money in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per Lot when Developer notifies Builder, in writing, that all necessary and appropriate construction permits and plat approvals have been obtained. The said Earnest Money shall be applied as a credit in the same amount toward the purchase price of each such Lot. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">{\u00b6 30} The trial court concluded that the liquidated-damages provision was ambiguous as to whether it provides only for Stonehenge to keep any earnest money that Beazer had <em>already deposited, </em>or whether it also entitles Stonehenge to monies it <em>expected </em>would be deposited, but that Beazer never ultimately deposited. Contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, we think that the language is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">{\u00b6 31} The liquidated-damages provision states, \u201cBuilder shall forfeit the earnest money to Developer if Builder fails or refuses to perform its obligations herein specified.\u201d Contract terms are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emp. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6, citing <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167-168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 436 N.E.2d 1347. \u201cEarnest money\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] deposit paid (often in escrow) by a prospective buyer (esp. of real estate) to show a good-faith intention to complete the transaction, and ordinarily forfeited if the buyer defaults.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) 547. Because \u201cearnest money\u201d plainly refers to a \u201cdeposit paid\u201d and does not refer to a deposit not yet paid, the liquidated-damages clause only encompasses those monies that Beazer had <em>already </em>deposited with Stonehenge prior to Beazer\u2019s breach. Therefore, the measure of Beazer\u2019s damages was readily ascertainable by reference to the language of the contract, and the trial court erred in submitting this issue to the jury instead of resolving the issue as a matter of law. The fact that the liquidated damages may be far less than Stonehenge\u2019s actual damages does not change this result. If the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, courts must enforce the instrument as written. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">{\u00b6 32} For all of the foregoing reasons, Beazer\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">{\u00b6 33} In support of its third assignment of error, Beazer argues that the trial court erred in denying Beazer\u2019s motion for attorney fees expended in its successful defense of Stonehenge\u2019s claim for breach of the 2000 contract vis-a-vis Phase IV lots. It directs our attention to a provision within the 2000 contract that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In the event a party hereto engages counsel to represent such party in connection with any breach or default, or threatened breach or default, hereof by the other party or to construe or enforce compliance with this Agreement, then the non-breaching or non-defaulting party and/or the party otherwise prevailing in any action to enforce or construe this Agreement, or any settlement associated therewith, shall be entitled to recover from the other all attorney fees, disbursements and costs to be incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">{\u00b6 34} Attorney fees are generally not recoverable in contract actions. <em>First Bank of Marietta v. L.C. Ltd. </em>(Dec. 28, 1999), Franklin App. No. 99AP-304, 1999 WL 1262058. Such a principle comports with the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that requires each party involved in litigation to pay its own attorney fees in most circumstances. <em>Sorin v. Warrensville Hts. School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 177, 179, 75 O.O.2d 224, 347 N.E.2d 527. An exception to that rule allows for the recovery of attorney fees if the parties contract to shift fees. <em>McConnell v. Hunt Sports Ent. </em>(1999), 132 Ohio App.3d 657, 699, 725 N.E.2d 1193, citing <em>Pegan v. Crawmer </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 155, 156, 679 N.E.2d 1129.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">{\u00b6 35} In denying Beazer\u2019s motion for attorney fees the trial court explained: The jury returned a verdict in favor of [Beazer] on [Stonehenge\u2019s] breach of contract claim relating to the 2000 Purchase Agreement. The 2000 Purchase Agreement contained a provision stating that the non-breaching party in an action to enforce or interpret the 2000 Purchase Agreement is entitled to its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. [Beazer] has moved the Court for an award of its attorney\u2019s fees, based on such verdict, and has requested a hearing to determine the reasonable amount thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">At trial, the Court determined that the question of whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees was to be made and if so the amount thereof, was to be submitted to the jury. * * * [Beazer] offered no evidence at trial from which a determination could be made of the amount or reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to [Beazer], and as such the Court is incapable of making such an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">{\u00b6 36} On appeal, Beazer argues that it did not have to present evidence at trial regarding its attorney fees expended in defense of Stonehenge\u2019s claim for breach of the 2000 contract, because its right to recover these fees only vested when the jury rendered a verdict in its favor on that claim. Beazer maintains that it would have been inappropriate and confusing to the jury if it had presented evidence as to its attorney fees at the same time it presented substantive evidence that it had not breached the 2000 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">{\u00b6 37} In response, Stonehenge presents two arguments, which we will address in turn. First, it points out that the jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to the interrogatory inquiring, \u201cWas the 2000 Purchase Agreement, as amended in 2002, nullified by the 2004 Purchase Agreement?\u201d Stonehenge argues that because the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>determined that the 2000 contract had been \u201cnullified,\u201d then the <em>entire contract, </em>including the attorney fees provision, is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">{\u00b6 38} We note initially that the trial court did not rely on this interrogatory in denying Beazer\u2019s motion for attorney fees. More important, however, the record demonstrates that the jury did not determine that the <em>entire 2000 contract </em>had been nullified. The <em>only </em>issue before the jury respecting whether the 2004 contract nullified the 2000 contract was whether or not Beazer\u2019s 2000 contract obligation to purchase Phase IV lots survived the 2004 contract. Stonehenge claimed that Beazer had breached the 2000 contract by failing to purchase Phase IV lots, and Beazer\u2019s defense to that claim was that the 2004 contract superseded all terms in the 2000 contract that would have obligated Beazer to purchase Phase TV lots.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury interrogatory that Stonehenge cites does not even encompass whether the 2004 contract nullified the attorney fees provision, or other non-Phase IV lot purchase-related provisions; <em>the interrogatory only concerns whether the 200k contract nullified Beazer\u2019s obligation to purchase Phase W lots. </em>By its answer to the interrogatory, the jury indicated it found that Beazer\u2019s obligation under the 2000 contract to purchase Phase IV lots had been nullified by the parties\u2019 2004 contract. The interrogatory does not mean that Beazer is not entitled to attorney fees under the 2000 contract; on the contrary, the interrogatory means that Beazer successfully defended itself against Stonehenge\u2019s claims that Beazer\u2019s obligation to purchase Phase IV lots survived the 2004 contract, and that Beazer had breached that obligation. Thus, under the 2000 contract, Beazer had a right to its reasonable attorney fees expended in defense of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>{\u00b6 39} But Stonehenge also argues that the trial court correctly observed that Beazer was required to present evidence of its attorney fees at trial and that because Beazer failed to do so, the trial court correctly denied Beazer an award of fees or an opportunity to present evidence to the court. In reply, Beazer argues that requiring it to present evidence to the jury as to its attorney fees \u201chad the legal effect of shifting to Beazer the burden of proof on a matter on which [Stonehenge] had such burden * * * [because evidence about Beazer\u2019s attorney fees was a matter] that the jury could not possibly have distinguished as being applicable to Beazer\u2019s case only.\u201d Beazer maintains that this, coupled with the fact that its right to attorney fees only \u201cvested\u201d upon the jury\u2019s verdict in its favor on Stonehenge\u2019s claim for breach of the 2000 contract, required that Beazer\u2019s claim for attorney fees be addressed not at trial but in a posttrial motion hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">{\u00b6 40} Beazer does not provide any authority for the proposition that a right to attorney fees under a contractual fee-shifting provision only vests upon the jury returning a verdict for the prevailing party. However, we note that this court has previously held that a plaintiffs right to <em>statutory </em>attorney fees did not vest until she received a judgment in her favor. <em>Pasco v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-696, 2005-Ohio-2387, 2005 WL 1155901, \u00b6 20. In the case of <em>Keal v. Day, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 21, 2005-Ohio-5551, 840 N.E.2d 1139, the First Appellate District held that for purposes of a contract providing for reasonable attorney fees for the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in any dispute over the contract, the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d means \u201cone in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">{\u00b6 41} We are persuaded that Beazer did not acquire the right to attorney fees for its successful defense of Stonehenge\u2019s claim for breach of the 2000 contract until the jury rendered its verdict in Beazer\u2019s favor on this claim. Thus, it was not required to seek its reasonable attorney fees until that time. We note that Beazer moved for an award of attorney fees and a hearing on the issue merely three days after the jury rendered its verdict. Under these circumstances, we agree that the trial court erred in summarily denying Beazer\u2019s motion for a hearing on its request for attorney fees. Accordingly, we sustain Beazer\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">{\u00b6 42} We now move on to Stonehenge\u2019s appeal. Because they are interrelated, we will address Stonehenge\u2019s first and third assignments of error together. In its first assignment of error, Stonehenge argues that the trial court erred in granting Beazer\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) and vacating the jury\u2019s award of attorney fees. In its third assignment of error, it maintains that the trial court should have allowed Stonehenge a posttrial hearing in order to submit additional evidence on the issue of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>{\u00b6 43} A motion for JNOV should be granted when the trial court, construing the motion most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, finds that upon any determinative issue, reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted, and such conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Mantua Mfg. Co. v. Commerce Exchange Bank </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 661 N.E.2d 161. Neither the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses is for the court\u2019s determination in ruling upon a motion for JNOV. <em>Nickell v. Gonzalez </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 17 OBR 281, 477 N.E.2d 1145, quoting <em>Posin v. A.B.C. Motor Court Hotel </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 271, 275, 74 O.O.2d 427, 344 N.E.2d 334. \u201cA motion * * * for judgment notwithstanding the verdict does not present factual issues, but a question of law, even though in deciding such a motion, it is necessary to review and consider the evidence.\u201d <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896. Thus, our review is de novo. <em>Hale v. Spitzer Dodge, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1379, 2006-Ohio-3309, 2006 WL 1781402, \u00b6 15, citing <em>Miller v. Lindsay-Green, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-848, 2005-Ohio-6366, 2005 WL 3220215, \u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">{\u00b6 44} The parties\u2019 2004 contract provides that the nonbreaching and/or prevailing party in an action to enforce the contract \u201cshall be entitled to recover from the other its reasonable attorney fees.\u201d The trial court granted Beazer\u2019s motion for JNOV as to the jury\u2019s award of attorney fees under the 2004 contract because, it found, Stonehenge had presented no evidence as to the reasonableness of its fees. Stonehenge argues that it presented evidence as to the reasonableness of its attorney fees through <em>the </em>testimony of its owner, Mr. Dioun, who testified that the fees Stonehenge seeks to recover are reasonable. Stonehenge also argues that Beazer never presented evidence that Stonehenge\u2019s fees were unreasonable. Stonehenge admits that it did not present \u201ccomplete evidence of its attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d but argues this was because the trial court required it to present proof of its attorney fees during trial rather than at a posttrial hearing. It contends that the trial court should have held a separate posttrial hearing on attorney fees, but does not specify what other evidence would constitute \u201ccomplete\u201d evidence of its attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">{\u00b6 45} In response, Beazer points out that even though the 2004 contract provided that Stonehenge was <em>entitled </em>to its reasonable attorney fees by virtue of its status as a prevailing party, Stonehenge still had to prove that the amount it sought was in fact reasonable in the circumstances of this case. We agree. \u201cA party seeking an award of attorney fees has the burden of demonstrating the reasonable value of such services.\u201d <em>DeHoff v. Veterinary Hosp. Operations of Cent. Ohio, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-454, 2003-Ohio-3334, 2003 WL 21470388, \u00b6 145; see also <em>Roth Produce Co. v. Scartz </em>(Dec. 27, 2001), Franklin App. No. 01AP-480, 2001 WL 1654555 (\u201cA \u2018reasonable\u2019 fee must be related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>work reasonably expended on the case and not merely to the amount of the judgment awarded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cIn calculating attorney fee awards, we require that a number, of factors be considered, including, among other things, the time and labor involved in maintaining the litigation, the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented, the professional skill required to perform the necessary legal services, the reputation of the attorney, and the results obtained.\u201d <em>Christe v. GMS Mgt. Co., Inc. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 376, 378, 726 N.E.2d 497, citing <em>Bittner v. Tri-County Toyota, Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 143, 145-146, 569 N.E.2d 464. The factual determination of reasonableness must also be predicated upon an analysis of the hourly rates charged multiplied by the hours actually and necessarily spent, along with the aforementioned considerations of difficulty and complexity of the case, the attorney\u2019s reputation, and the results obtained. <em>Bittner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">{\u00b6 47} In the present case, as Stonehenge concedes, the only evidence it presented as to its attorney fees was the testimony of Mr. Dioun. Mr. Dioun merely testified that his attorney fees were reasonable in his opinion and that the amount of fees that Stonehenge was requesting was consistent with what the attorneys estimated their fees would be for this litigation. But he did not know whether the hourly rates charged are typical for the market, which hourly rates were charged to Stonehenge, exactly who had worked on the case, or how much Stonehenge had actually been charged. He did not personally review Stonehenge\u2019s attorney invoices. This evidence is insufficient for the jury to determine the reasonableness of the attorney fees that Stonehenge seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">{\u00b6 48} Moreover, the trial court did not err in submitting the attorney-fee issue to the jury rather than holding a separate posttrial hearing on the matter. \u201cGenerally, attorney\u2019s fees are allowable as damages in breach of contract cases where the parties have bargained for a particular result and the breaching party\u2019s wrongful conduct led to the legal fees being incurred.\u201d <em>Natl. Eng. &amp; Contracting Co. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-435, 2004-Ohio-2503, 2004 WL 1103993, \u00b6 23, citing <em>Westfield Cos. v. O.K.L. Can Line, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 747, 2003-Ohio-7151, 804 N.E.2d 45. Because the attorney fees being sought herein were in the nature of damages, the trial court was required to submit the issue to the jury. \u201cIf the fees are damages, then the availability and amount of such fees have to be determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Christe, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 878, 726 N.E.2d 497, citing <em>Zoppo v. Homestead Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 552, 557, 644 N.E.2d 397. Accordingly, the trial court correctly submitted the issue of Stonehenge\u2019s attorney fees to the jury, rather than holding a separate hearing on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">{\u00b6 49} For all of the foregoing reasons, Stonehenge\u2019s first and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>{\u00b6 50} In its second assignment of error, Stonehenge argues that the trial court erred in the calculation of prejudgment interest. The trial court awarded prejudgment interest \u201conly for the time period after the breach, and prior to the Court\u2019s entry of judgment herein, which was not already covered by Plaintiffs interest calculation at trial, i.e. from March 9, 2007 to the date of filing of this decision.\u201d Stonehenge argues that it was entitled to prejudgment interest on the jury\u2019s damage award from June 2005, at eight percent per annum, for a total of $43,141.53. In light of our disposition of Beazer\u2019s second assignment of error, which alters the amount of compensatory damages upon which any prejudgment interest calculation would be based, we find Stonehenge\u2019s second assignment of error to be moot, and we overrule it on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">{\u00b6 51} In summary, we overrule Beazer\u2019s first assignment of error and sustain Beazer\u2019s second and third assignments of error; and we overrule Stonehenge\u2019s first and third assignments of error on their merits, and its second assignment of error as moot. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and remand this cause to that court for further proceedings consistent with law and with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-7\">Petree and Klatt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\">. {\u00b6 a} Jury <em>Instruction </em>No. 10 <em>states:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">{\u00b6 b} \"Stonehenge also claims that Beazer breached the parties' contract with respect to Phase 4 of Elmont Place. Stonehenge also alleges that the 2004 Purchase Agreement was an amendment to the parties' contract that did not relieve Beazer of its obligations to buy the lots in Phase 4. According to Stonehenge, the subject matter of the 2004 Purchase Agreement was limited to Phase 3 of Elmont Place. Therefore, Stonehenge asserts that Beazer remained obligated pursuant to the 2000 Purchase Agreement, as amended in 2002, to purchase 10 lots in Phase 4. Stonehenge alleges that statements by Beazer that it would be making no further purchases of lots at Elmont Place constitutes an anticipatory breach of Beazer's contractual obligation to purchase the lots in Phase 4 of Elmont Place. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">{\u00b6 c} \u201cBeazer denies that it breached the contract with respect to Phase 4.

Rather, Beazer claims the parties intended only to establish the price at which such lots would be sold to Beazer, if Beazer wanted to purchase and Stonehenge wanted to sell those lots, if Stonehenge did not exercise its right to rezone Phase 4 for condominiums. Beazer also claims the 2004 Purchase Agreement superseded all terms of the 2000 Purchase Agreement, as amended in 2002, and that under the 2004 Purchase Agreement Beazer had no obligation to purchase lots in Phase 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">{\u00b6 d} <em>\u201cYou must decide whether the amended 2000 Purchase Agreement obligated Beazer to purchase Phase 4 lots.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
