Whatever theoretical opinion may be entertained of the question, it cannot be denied that, practically, the latter view of it has been maintained.

Four years must elapse from the date of the title and possession, to change this private instrument to a public one, with all the solemnities and requisites of the law ; being understood that, during these four years, the buyer shall be entitled to use said land as his own, and perform all kinds of work and improvements, which he may see proper, to enhance its value, under the express and agreed penalty, that if the vendor, after the expiration of four years mentioned in the foregoing clause, should refuse to grant the public title herein mentioned under any pretext, the vendor binds himself to ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Mbit to the buyer an amount of four thousand dollars in ready cash money, or equivalent property, as an indemnity for the cost, damages and losses, resulting to the buyer for want of title to the property, such as one public document in due form, and moreover in consideration of the expenses that said buyer may have done on the aforesaid land. It is also understood and agreed between the buyer and vendor, as a condition, that, if by some unforseen accident, the buyer should die before the expiration of the four years fixed for the execution of the title deed of sale, this one must be made, in the aforesaid term, in favor of the widow and heirs of the buyer, in conformity with the established laws. And it is the will of the vendor that, in the unforseen case of death, his administrators and heirs shall comply exactly with the provisions of this document, which I will and it is my volition, shall have the same value as if it was judicial, and to that effect I renounce all the laws and customs that can favor me, and I submit myself to the jurisdiction of all Justices and Courts which may take cognizance of my case at law; <em>si convenerit de jurisdictions omnium judicium, </em>with the general law, <em>el derecho en forma.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">In testimony whereof I have granted this, and knowing not how to write my name, I pray the citizen Ynacio Herrera of this place to do it for me before the undersigned witnesses, in the aforesaid city, on the same day, month, and year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">At the prayer of the granting party I do sign.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">YNACIO HERRERA.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">Attested by seven subscribing witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">Defendants then read a deed from McMullen, as administra, tor, &amp;c., to Van Ness, dated November 5th, 1840. It was admitted that all the estate which Yan Ness took by reason of said deed, was vested in the defendants by regular mesne conveyances. There were suggestions of possession and improvements in good faith, and evidence thereto, which is omitted, as not now important.

The plaintiffs sue for the recovery of the land described in their petition, which land it is alleged, the defendants claim by a pretended sale made by McMullen, claiming to be administrator of their deceased father\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">2d. The defendants deny the right of the plaintiffs to recover, and assert a right to the land through conveyances from the vendees of Van Ness, the purchaser at a sale made by McMullen, acting as they assert as administrator of John Soye, the father of plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">3d. The defendants also claim to be purchasers in good faith, and in possession of the land for twelve months before the commencement of this suit, and they claim pay for their improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-10\">4th. The real or supposed inadequacy of price; the want of any necessity for an order to sell the land, or any real or supposed unfairness on the part of McMullen, while acting as administrator, are questions that are not in issue on the trial. They are questions with which you have nothing to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-11\">5th. The sole questions for your consideration, in making up your verdict, are simply these ; had the estate of John Soye such an interest in the land, as would make it liable for the payment of his just debts or claims against his estate? Was McMullen the administrator of Soye\u2019s estate ? Did he petition for, and, as administrator, obtain from the Probate Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>an order of sale, and did he as such administrator, and by virtue of such order, sell in accordance with law the same to Van Ness ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">6th. The recognition of a party as administrator by the Probate Court, and the continuous action of the Court with reference to the administrator while acting as such, is legal evidence of the party\u2019s character, and will support rights acquired by a third party, at a sale made under the order of the Probate Court, obtained and carried into effect by such administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">7th. The records of a Court of competent jurisdiction are evidence of what they contain or assert, and are conclusive on such matters, unless attacked for fraud, and such fraud proven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">8th. The fact of land claimed by an intestate\u2019s estate being conveyed by the original grantee to the children, as heirs of their deceased father, will not destroy or weaken the right of creditors, or others in such estate, unless the facts show that the transfer to the heirs was made upon such valuable consideration as would justify and enable a stranger to hold the land against the estate, or those representing such estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">9th. If from the evidence you believe that this land was claimed by \u201c Soye\u2019s estate,\u201d and the transfer from Delgado to the minor children was made by him, not to the children, as purchasers in their own right, but to them as the heirs of John Soye, deceased, and as carrying out in good faith the agreement or understanding between himself (Delgado) and John Soye, the plaintiffs\u2019 father, and that McMullen, as the administrator of Soye\u2019s estate, petitioned for and obtained an order to sell, and, as administrator did sell in accordance with law, the land to Van Ness, then you will find a verdict for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">The instructions as to the issue of valuable improvements, not being now important, are omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-10\">The plaintiffs requested the Judge to charge the Jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>1st. That the act, or contract, between Juan Delgado and John Soye in reference to the land in controversy was in violation of the law then in force, which inhibited a sale by Delgado, before the expiration of four years after the date of the grant, and said act was therefore a mere nullity, which conveyed no estate to Soye or his heirs, legal or equitable ; gave the heirs no right in the property or to the property, nor did it divest the said Delgado of any property in the estate, or create any obligations upon him to specifically perform the contract, or to convey to Soye, his legal representatives or heirs; nor did it operate as an estoppel on said Delgado, but he was still left free to dispose of the land as soon as the inhi. tion was removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-4\">I give you this instruction with this qualification : That if you believe Delgado conveyed to Soye\u2019s children by way of carrying out in good faith his original understanding or agreement with Soye, and that it was intended to convey, for the benefit of the estate of Soye, it was liable for the debts of his estate. (Signature of Judge.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">2d. That as soon as the legal inhibition was removed, Juan Delgado had the legal right to convey his estate in it; and his conveyance to the plaintiffs created in them a legal and valid estate, independent of any rights of the creditors of their ancestors, the administration and all other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">3d. That the law, <em>prima facie, </em>presumes that the consideration, acknowledged in the deed, was paid by the grantees ; but whether the deed was with or without consideration paid by the defendants, it was binding upon the grantors, and the defendants can have no benefit from the want of consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">4th. The admissions in the deed are evidence of the facts recited as between the parties and privies thereto, and by privies is meant those who derive title under a deed ; therefore the defendants cannot be heard to deny the recitals in the act between Delgado and Soye, but they are bound thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>5th. And if such recitals show that the act is void, it forms no foundation for title in the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">6th. That the deed from Delgado to Juan Soye conveyed no property, and therefore was no evidence that the land was assets of the estate of John Soye subject to administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">7th. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the land in controversy was not the property of John Soye, but the property of the plaintiff, then the administrator had no right to sell the land, and the sale by him did not affect the rights of the plaintiffs, and the purchasers took nothing by the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">8th. That, even had the heirs purchased and held in trust for the benefit of creditors, they could not have been divested of the estate by the administrator\u2019s sale, but it could only have been divested out of them by their own voluntary conveyance, or by a decree of the District Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">9th. If the deed from Delgado to the plaintiffs had been duly registered before the administrator's sale it was notice to all the world, and the defendants are charged with this notice of adverse right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">10th. That if the jury believe from the evidence, that more than one year had elapsed after the appointment of McMullen as administrator, before the pretended sale, then the sale was void, unless the jury believe from the evidence that he, McMullin, had been duly and legally appointed administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">(No. 11 is wanting in the transcript, and was probably embraced in the general charge of the Judge.\u2014Reps.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-11\">12th. The records of the Probate Court having been given in evidence to the jury, they are not at liberty to presume the existence of any records not therein found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-12\">13th. Presumptions of facts and records, which form the basis of title, cannot be indulged against the plaintiffs who were infants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-13\">14th. The records and judicial proceedings of Courts of record cannot be presumed, but they must either be proved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the records themselves, by copies thereof, or by proving their destruction or mutilation, and then proving their contents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">15th. That, if the jury believe from the evidence that at the time of the administrator\u2019s sale the land was the property of the plaintiffs, then the Probate Court had no power and jurisdiction to sell the land at the suit of the administrator, and their rights were unaffected by said sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">16th. That, if the jury believe from the evidence that, before the sale the administrator had fully paid the debts of Soye and been discharged, then there was no power in the Probate Court to re-appoint him, and the fact that the Court subsequently recognized him as administrator, gave him no right to sell the land, and all his subsequent acts were void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">llth. When the estate of a decedent is so far administered that nothing remains to be done, but to discharge the administrator formally, after his compliance with an order for distribution, the Probate Court has no power to appoint another administrator on said estate, or to re-appoint the same, and the act of the Probate Court in making such appointment, would be void and of no effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">18th. When the Probate Court has once entered a judgment or decree against the personal estate of an administrator in favor of creditors, the same becomes final and the Court has no power at any subsequent term to alter, or revise, or set aside said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-9\">19th. Even admitting that the contract between Delgado and John Soye created an equitable estate in John Soye, still any such interest enured to the benefit of Soye and his wife, as community property, and the administrator could at most have conveyed one-half the estate, and the children have the right to recover one-half the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-10\">20th.

As to whether John McMullen was, or was not re-appointed administrator of the estate of John Soye, deceased, is a question of fact to be determined by the jury from the record and proceedings of the Probate Court, and, if from an examination of said records, the jury believe McMullen was not re-appointcd administrator of the estate of John Soye, within twelve months of the date of sale, or that he did not renew his bond as such, they will find for the plaintiffs, as he was without power to sell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-12\">28th.

The agreement between Delgado and Juan Soye, was null and void, it being in contravention of law. No agreement could be based upon it, and it was incapable of ratification. (Code of 1808, Art. 11, 12; 3 An. 329; Hunt v. Robinson, 1 Tex. R., 748; Desmuke v. Griffin, 10 Id. 113.) For the distinction between void and voidable acts, see Cummings v. Powell, 8 Tex. R. 85.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-9\">2nd. Had Soye survived his wife, and a deed similar to the one made to plaintiffs, been made to him, it could not have been made to relate back to the former void contract; it would have been his separate property and not property of the community. Or had a bankruptcy intervened between the execution of the void contract, and the execution of a deed to John Soye, similar in every respect to that made to the plaintiffs, the land could not have been claimed by the creditors as part of his former estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-10\">It is contended by appellees, that though the bond is in law absolutely null, and constitutes no legal consideration for a new conveyance, it is a moral consideration, and as such entitled to respect. This is something new in legal ethics. To state the question is to answer it. Can a contract, in absolute violation of positive law, constitute a moral consideration ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The sale from Delgado to plaintiffs stands entirely disconnected from any former transaction, and vests in them an absolute fee simple title; it is on good and full consideration ; $500 was then as much as the land was worth, and we are not driven behind the deed to seek a consideration to sustain it. It was for the consideration named in the deed and no other. No mention is made of the former transaction. Nothing in the deed connects it with the void bond, nor is there any proof to show a connexion between the deed to the four grantees named in it, and the former void contract with John Soye,</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\">The deed is absolute in its terms, and conveys the property-in the following language : \u201c The said party of the first part \u201chas granted, bargained and sold, and by these presents does \u201c grant, bargain, sell, convey and deliver unto Rowland Soye, \u201c John Soye, Elizabeth Soye and Ellen Soye, parties of the \u201c second part, one league and labor of land,\u201d &amp;c. And in the habendum thus : \u201c To have and to hold the land described as aforesaid unto them, the said party of the second part, their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">There is also a clause of full warranty to these parties and their heirs. It is therefore obvious that the consideration named in the deed is the true one. Had the eighty dollars formerly paid by John Soye at the time of the execution of the bond, been the moving consideration, the grantor would not by his deed with warranty have bound himself for the sum of five hundred dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">There is no privity shown either by the deed or otherwise, between John Soye\u2019s estate and these grantees, or between these grantees and the administrator, nor is there a vestige of proof either in the administrator\u2019s accounts or elsewhere, that the $500 was paid by or came out of John Soye\u2019s estate ; nor any proof any where to be found, from which a trust in favor of the estate could be inferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">3rd. The deed from McMullen to Van Ness, under whom defendants claimed, recites the deed to plaintiffs as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>recording of the same ; they are therefore estopped from denying their knowledge of the deed and its contents. They are not innocent purchasers under the administrator\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-5\">Again, defendants have no title or pretence of title, except such as they claim under the conveyance from Delgado to the plaintiffs. They deduce title down to themselves from that deed. It is therefore <em>pruna facie </em>evidence as against them of every recital which it contains, and they can only overturn these recitals by proof that they are untrue, and that something else was designed between the parties to the deed, than appears upon its face.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-6\">This is our case as made out by the record. Let us see how our views of the law applicable, agree with the charges of the Court below. And though we in our brief only refer to the especial charges on which we rely to operate a reversal, we would call the attention of the Court to the entire charge, that they may see how it was calculated to act upon the minds of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">The 8th charge takes it for granted that the land in dispute was \u201c claimed by the intestate\u2019s estate, and goes on in effect to state that the property was conveyed to the grantees in right of their deceased father ; this charge also intimates that notwithstanding the recitals in the deed, the burthen is on the grantees to show by \u201c facts\u201d what the consideration was. Of the 9th, we will speak when we come to the Tth instruction asked for by plaintiffs and refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-8\">The first instruction asked by plaintiffs is given with an ad dition which renders it nugatory, which is not warranted by the facts or the law of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-9\">The fourth instruction asked for by plaintiffs, and refused, is the well established law of estoppel, its refusal simply deprives the plaintiffs of the recitals in the deeds, though there is no evidence in the case even tending to cast a doubt upon them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-10\">On what ground the sikth charge was refused, it is difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>to perceive ; it is certainly the law; nor can its refusal be justified on the ground that it is inapplicable to the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">By the ninth instruction given, and the refusal of the seventh instruction asked, the Judge in effect took the testimony in the case from before the jury, and decided the cause against the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-6\"><em>I. A. &amp; Q. W. Paschal, </em>also for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-7\"><em>Denison </em>and <em>Newton, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-8\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">The plaintiffs, to maintain their action, rely on the conveyance, from the original grantee of the government, Delgado, to themselves, of the 6th of October, 1888. They insist that the deed vested in them the title, exclusive of the rights of creditors of their ancestor ; that the land conveyed constituted no part of his estate, and consequently was not subject to sale by his administrator. And to support this view, they rely upon the evidence afforded by the face of the deed itself: the fact that it conveys the land to the plaintiffs by name, for a consideration therein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">But it is seen that, in stating the parties to the deed, the plaintiffs, though named as the grantees, are described as the \u201c heirs and legal representatives of John Soye, deceased.\u201d The conveyance, being made to them as such, must be deemed <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the consideration moved from their ancestor: else why convey to them as his heirs and legal representatives ? The manifest intention was, not to convey to them in their own right, irrespective of their ancestor, whom they represented, but in their right in their representative character, as the heirs and representatives of their deceased father. The consequence is, that they took the estate, as they did whatever other estate they inherited from their ancestor, subject to the payment of his debts. It became assets in the hands of his administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Such is the <em>prima fade </em>conclusion to be deduced from the face of the deed. But it does not rest alone on the proper construction of the instrument. It is in proof that, in December, 1833, the plaintiff\u2019s grantor executed to their ancestor an obligation, showing a sale to him of the land, for a consideration acknowledged to have been received, and agreeing, when the legal inhibition should cease, to make to him a title, or in case of his death, to make the title to his widow and heirs. It is unnecessary now to discuss the question whether this agreement was, to all intents and purposes, null; or was only in so far inoperative and ineffectual as that it could not be enforced unless it was validated by the grantee after the removal of the legal impediment; or unless there were supervening equities which had the effect to make good the title in the purchaser. Whatever theoretical opinion may be entertained of the question, it cannot be denied that, practically, the latter view of it has been maintained. (1 Tex. R. 748; Hunt v. Turner, 9 Tex. R. 385; Box v. Lawrence, 14 Id. 545.) But though it be utterly void, the agreement is, nevertheless, a fact, which may be looked to, <em>to </em>ascertain the motive and consideration, which actuated the grantor to make the subsequent conveyance to the plaintiffs. It is equally significant of the intention of the party, as if it had been operative, and effectual to bind him to its performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">It is further inferable that the consideration moved from the ancestor, from the fact, that the plaintiffs were not of sufficient age to contract and make purchases ; and that the conveyance was intended to operate in favor of the estate, from the fact that it was so treated by the administrator at the time, and by the plaintiffs themselves until the bringing of this suit; as appears by the petition in the former suit instituted by them for the land in question. That it was so made and intended in fact, is-evident, as well from the face of the deed itself, which was matter of legal construction by the Court, as from the other facts referred to, which were evidence for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>jury. There being nothing in the evidence to countervail the<em>prima fade </em>presumption, arising from the face of the deed, that the conveyance was virtually and beneficially for the estate, but the contrary, there was no error in the charge of the Court upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The objections to the validity of the administrator's sale, and the title derived by the defendants under it, have been, considered and answered in former decisions, to which it will suffice to refer for their disposition in the present case. (Poor v. Boyce, 12 Tex. R. 309; Howard v. Bennett, 13 Tex. R. 309; Dancy v. Stricklinge, 15 Tex. R. 557; Burditt v. Silsbee, Id. 604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">There is an interesting decision, lately made by the Supreme Court of Georgia, upon the effect which ought to be given to the proceedings of Probate Courts in the sale of the estates of deceased persons, to which we have been referred by the counsel for the appellants in another case now before the Court. It is admitted that, in that case, the Court went quite as far as this Court has gone in maintaining the doctrines which support the titles of fair purchasers at those sales. In a very learned and elaborate opinion by Judge Lumpkin, the legal propriety and necessity of upholding these titles, fairly acquired, are strongly insisted upon, and maintained upon authority and reasons which seem unanswerable. (Tucker v. Haris, 13 Ga. R. 1.) The principal objection to the sale in the present case, is, that it does not appear that the term of administration was continued down to the period of the sale. The administrator, however, continued to act under the sanction of the Probate Court; and there is more than the usual apparent regularity in the proceedings, in other respects. That the absence in the record, of any evidence of the extension by the Court of the term of administration, does not invalidate the title of the purchaser, has been fully settled in the cases referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">It is further objected to the title of the purchaser at the administrator\u2019s sale, that there does not appear to have been any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>administration taken upon the estate of the wife of John Soye. Both departed this life about the same time. The debts for \u25a0Which the property was sold were community debts. Such, at least, is the presumption ; and. we \u00a1jare of opinion that there was no necessity of two administrations upon the same property, to pay debts, for which it must have been equally liable, in the hands of the administrator of either or both \u00f3f the decedents. (Jones v. Jones, 15 Tex. R; 143; Berry v. Young, Id. 369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">It is unnecessary to revise the several rulings of the Court upon instructions to the jury ; for the reason that, under the evidence and law of the case, they could not legally have returned a different verdict. There is no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
