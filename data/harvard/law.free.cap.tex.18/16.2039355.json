H. Miller v. Noel Roberts.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b24-9\">A contract between A and B, to the effect that if A would move B and his wife from the county of McMinn in the State of Tennessee, where they then resided, to the State of Texas, and into Peters\u2019 Colony, B would give A one-half of all the land B should acquire by virtue of his emigration to said State and settlement in said Colony, was not a contract for the sale of land, and it was not necessary therefore, under our statute of frauds, that said contract or promise or any memorandum thereof should be in writing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b24-10\">Nor was the contract contrary to public policy. A contract, not in itself immoral, nor in contravention of any law, by which the State acquires a citizen, cannot be contrary to its policy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b24-11\">It would seem, that where one side of a contract is to be performed within a year, and is so performed, it is no objection to the enforcement of the contract, under the statute of frauds, that it is not in writing, although the other side of the contract may be in its nature incapable of performance within a year.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-12\">Appeal from Dallas. . Tried below before the Hon. Nat. M. Burford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-13\">The petition in this case was filed December 22d, 1855, and was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-14\">Tour petitioner, Stephen H. Miller, who resides in the county of Grayson and State of Texas, respectfully represents, that heretofore, to wit, in the month of March or April, 1848, he was residing in the county of McMinn and State of Tennessee ; that he then and there entered into a contract with Joel Roberts, who resides in the county of Dallas and State of Texas, whereby said Roberts undertook and agreed with your petitioner, that if he (your petitioner) would move the said Roberts and his wife from the said county of McMinn and State of Tennessee, where they then resided, to the State of Texas, into \u201c Peters\u2019 Colony,\u201d that he, said Roberts, would give your petitioner one-half of all the land he should acquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>by virtue of his immigration to said State, and settlement in said Colony, and that he, said Roberts, would make a deed to your petitioner for one-half of said land so soon as he should obtain a patent therefor. That your petitioner thereupon fur nished horses and carriage, and removed said Roberts and his wife from their said residence in the said State of Tennessee to said State of Texas, and within the boundaries of said \u201c Peters\u2019 Colony that, in so doing, your petitioner expended in money, time, the wear and tear of his team and carriage, one hundred and fifty dollars ; and your petitioner would further represent that the said Roberts, by virtue of his immigration to Texas and settlement in said Colony, obtained, as a headright, six hundred and forty acres of land, situated in the said county of Dallas and State of Texas on Prairie Creek, beginning, \u00abfee.\u2014 [Here followed a description of the land.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">And your petitioner would further represent that the said Roberts has' obtained from the State of Texas, a patent for said six hundred and forty acres of land, situated and described as above ; but now, though requested by your petitioner, said Roberts refuses to make a title to your petitioner for the said one-half of the six hundred and forty acres of land, situated and described as aforesaid, to the damage of your petitioner one thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">The petition concluded with a prayer for one-half the land, \u00abfee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">The defendant filed a general demurrer, and assigned for special causes, that the petition did not aver whether the said contract was in writing or verbal, and did not show the time of the issuance of the patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-8\">Amendment by plaintiff alleging that the contract was verbal, and that the patent issued in 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-9\">The Court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the suit, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-11\"><em>J. M. Crockett, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>J. J. </em>Good, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsP\">1st. The contract was for a thing, or right not in esse at the time thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">2d. It was void under the statute of frauds. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1451.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">The principle is too well established, for controversy, that \u201c terms of art or technical terms,\u201d in a statute, \u201c are to be taken according to the acceptation of the learned in each art, trade or science.\u201d (1 Bla. Com. side p. 59.) The words contract and sale are common law technicalities, and to ascertain the prohibition intended by the Legislature, we must look to that law for their definition. \u201c Contract is an agreement, upon \u201c sufficient consideration, to do or not to do some particular \u201cthing.\u201d (2 Bla. Com. side p. 442.) \u201c Sale is a transmuta. \u201c tion of property from one person to another, in consideration \u201c of some price or recompense in value.\u201d (Id. 446.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">From these it is clear that the Legislature intended to pro\" Mbit all actions \u201c whereby to charge any person on any agree- \u201c ment upon sufficient consideration for the transmutation of \u201c land to another, unless the promise or agreement upon which \u201c such action shall be brought, or some memorandum thereof, \u201c shall be in writing,\u201d &amp;c., Ac.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">3d. The statute prohibits actions \u201c whereby to charge any \u201c person upon any agreement which is not to be performed \u201c within the space of one year from the making thereof, unless \u201cit or some memorandum thereof is in writing,\u201d Ac., Ac.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-9\">If the contract depended on a contingency that might oi\u2019 might not happen within the space of one year, it would not come within the operation of the statute, for the want of a writing. (2 Stark. Ev. 2d American from 3d London edition, side p. 482, and authorities there referred to.) But such was not the case. It depended upon a contingency that could by no possibility happen within the year. Appellee had first to acquire - the land before he could dispose of it or any part, and this he could not do under three years from the time of settlement. (Hart. Dig. Art. 2103, and colony contracts.) Hence we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>safely conclude that the contract sought to be enforced \u201c was not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof, and is therefore void.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-5\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">The contract, set out in the petition, was not a contract for the sale of lands. There was no land, in particular, which was the subject of the contract. It was a contract for the acquisition, of land in which, at the time, there was not any individual proprietorship. It was analagous to the case of one man furnishing another with funds to purchase land for him, or them jointly. Such a contract creates a trust, which is not within the statue of frauds. It was no more a contract for the sale of lands, than an agreement to locate land certificates and procure patents for a part of the land\u00bb when obtained; which is not within the statute of frauds. (Watkins v. Gilherson, 10 Tex. R. 340.) Nor was the contract contrary to public policy. A contract, not in itself immoral, nor in contravention of any law, by which the State acquires a citizen, can not be contrary to its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">We are of opinion that the petition discloses a valid and binding contract, upon which the plaintiff is entitled to maintain his action : and that the Court therefore erred in sustaining the demurrer to the petition; for which the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Eeversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
