In all, $3185 60.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">The testimony in support of the plaintiff's account was as follows : The plaintiff called Wm. T. Mitchell to prove the account filed with the petition. Witness stated that he was principal clerk and bookkeeper in Victoria during the time of the running up of the account mentioned in petition ; that Wheeler\u2019s books were correctly kept; that he drew off the the account filed in this cause; that the clerks employed in the store during that time were correct men.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">The plaintiff then proceeded to prove the correctness of the charges in the said account; the defendants objected to this proof unless the books of original entries were produced. Plaintiff then produced five books of original entries. Witness testified that they were the blotters kept in the store of Wheeler, the books of original entries of merchandise, sold from the first of April, 1849, until the year 1851, and read from the same. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>item by item, all the charges and credits against the steamer \u201c Kate Ward.\u201d He stated that an account was opened for the steamer, in April, 1849, by Capt. W. J. Ward, the defendant; that the most of the charges in the said account were in his own hand writing : some of them were in the hand writing of James Cunningham ; some in that of Mr. Gaines, and some in that of Wm. Phillips, all of whom were clerks at different times. Cunningham is dead <em>; </em>Gaines is alive. Some of the charges are in the writing of Trow. Ward, who was agent of the steamer \u201cKate Ward,\u201d and some in the writing of the plaintiff. He also believed that most of the goods were delivered, but could not now testify that any article was delivered at the particular date charged, unless by reference to the books; he knew that they would not be charged unless delivered. The books were correctly kept and the rule was for each clerk to charge the goods sold by him. He believed the Brown, mentioned in the account, was the Mate of the boat Kate Ward ; that McPherson and John Garnett were engineers ; that Porter wast an engineer <em>; </em>that other persons, to whom articles are charge to have been delivered, were hands and wood-choppers on, or in some way, in the employ of the boat; does not know who Ball and Armstead are; did not deliver any goods to them.' Capt. Ward did, sometimes, give verbal orders to let his hands have articles when they called for them; he frequently paid them a portion of their wages from the store. Brown was Mate of the boat; believes Porter, McPherson and Garnett were engineers ; Wonderly was carpenter or wood-chopper ; that Steidler was a wagoner, and Duranges a butcher. Before Capt. Ward left the river, in Dec. 1850, witness presented him with an account, rendered against the Kate Ward, similar to that filed with the petition. Witness thinks that he did render an account twice to defendant, during the time embraced in it; he made no objections to it. Witness sometimes made entries in the books without having sold the goods, when ordered by plaintiff; had sometimes paid cash to defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>himself, upon Wheeler\u2019s order, and most of the charges for cash are in the had writing of witness. Witness kept the key of the safe, and paid out most of the money ; kept cash account, and considered himself responsible for the cash ; although Wheeler never told him that he was responsible. Wheeler sometimes paid money out of the safe, and witness, if ordered would make the charge on the books. Witness does not recollect anything of any drafts, but knows that the Kate Ward brought up the amount of freight, in the two items of credit in plaintiff\u2019s account, for government; that the plaintiff forwarded them to San Antonio ; that he paid the wagoners, be thinks, one dollar per hundred pounds ; recognises the bills of lading and knows that plaintiff paid the wagoners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">Here followed memorandums of bills of lading from Victoria to San Antonio, dated some in January, and some in March 1850, showing that John W. Patton hauled 4458 pounds ; Dewitt Grove 8859 lbs.; Wm. Gwinn 5822 lbs.; Claud Wilrnel 3090 lbs.; Jacob Krumm 5295 lbs.; M. H. Hardy 28354 lbs.; H. M. Tippett 12115 lbs.; H. H. Brockman 16239lbs.; Carlos de la Garza 9465 lbs.; Patrick Gain 8295 lbs.; C. Reas 2624 lbs.; Hall 4016 lbs.; C. Harper 3714 lbs.; D. B. Fryer 6286 lbs., and 5246 lbs. by person unnamed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">Mitchell, cross-examined, stated item by item of the original entries, naming by whom charged. He stated that he was absent from about the 7th of May, 1849, to September same year, on a visit to Tennessee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the Court to rule out all the evidence as to the items, not charged in witness\u2019 hand writing, also all items paid or delivered to other persons ; all cash items ; which motion was overruled, and the defendant excepted to the ruling of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">Plaintiff called T. A. Brown, who testified that he was Mate on the steamer Kate Ward, whilst she was running in the Guadalupe river, in 1849 and 1850 ; that he purchased such articles as were charged to him ; does not recollect all the ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>tides ; had authority from the Captain to purchase such things as he needed: the hands of the steamer were paid in such things as were needed for them, in the stores in Victoria : the largest account was at Wheeler\u2019s; does not think that any other officer or hand on board' was allowed to purchase goods without an order from Captain. The articles purchased by him, for himself on account of the steamer, were settled for by him in his account with the steamer. Witness got such articles as were charged in the writing of Mr. Wheeler, in the Summer of 1849 ; does not recollect the particular amount or time of purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">Defendant called Winnimore, who stated that he was in the employ of the Quartermaster Department during the whole of the years 1849 and 1850 ; that he paid Wheeler for hauling about 150,000 pounds of freight to San Antonio ; that he paid the amounts on drafts drawn by W. J. Ward in favor of J. O. Wheeler ; the amounts were paid on freight from Indianola to San Antonio. The usual price of freight was, at that time, from $1 25 to $1 50 per hundred ; the amount he paid then was SI 25 per hundred. There was a deduction in one case because the weight fell short; in the other for breakage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">Here followed bills of lading, signed by defendant for the amount of freight mentioned by witness, with copies of drafts, drawn by defendant, in favor of plaintiff on the United States Quartermaster at San Antonio for the freight; one dated January 16th, 1850, for $510 75, and another dated April 8, 1850, for 1353 68. Attached to first bill of lading and copy of first draft was plaintiff\u2019s receipt for $472 50, dated March 2d, 1850 ; and, attached to the other, plaintiff\u2019s receipt for $1347 93, dated June 7, 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">The defendant offered his books, with his suppletory oath to prove the correctness of his books. The plaintiff objected ; the objection sustained and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">F. A. Brown, sworn, says he was mate on the Kate Ward whilst running in the Guadalupe river. It was his principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>business to receive and deliver freight. He recollects that many articles in defendant\u2019s account are such as were delivered to plaintiff at Victoria, and carried from there for him : cannot recollect the precise amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">The books introduced by defendant are the books of the Kate Ward, kept in the regular course of business by the captain ; believes they were correctly kept. Stated each item by item of the account taken from the books of original entries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">Defendant here proved the last two items of his account of $300 and $20.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">Mr. Brown also states that it was understood on board the boat that none of the hands, but himself, could get anything on the credit of the boat without an order from the captain. Did not know whether the clerks at Wheeler\u2019s knew this. Did not know the amount of lumber ; knows that the steamer, several times, delivered lumber to Wheeler; some pecans were shipped ; Wheeler shipped cotton several times. He does not recollect whether the twenty-five bales were shipped for Wheeler or Campbell. The charge for mill stones was for taking them from the river at Wheeler\u2019s request; does not know whether they were worth $30 or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-8\">Here defendant showed bills of lading ; witness recognized them (same as before referred to.) . The defendant proved by William Bunge, that he shipped lumber by the Kate Ward ; does not know to whom. He recognized one shipment that he shipped to Wheeler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">Samuel Ward testified that he did not know that any one on the Kate Ward was authorized to buy goods on the credit of the boat, without an order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-10\">The statement of facts showed that the defendant read a deposition of Trobridge Ward, which was mislaid and contents not stated ; also that plaintiff, in rebuttal, read another deposition of the same witness previously taken, which was also mislaid, and contents not stated. The conclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>statement of facts was as follows : Plaintiff here showed by the books of defendant, that he had charged Wonderly by amount of Wheeler\u2019s account - dollars ; Porter by amount of Wheeler\u2019s account -- dollars; among other items seventy-five cents cash ; Miller &amp; Stewart also were charged by amount of Wheeler\u2019s account---dollars. _ The defendant having taken his books away the exact amount cannot be shown by these items.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-10\">The Court instructed the jury that if they believed from the evidence, that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff, they should so find, and the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-11\">The instructions asked by defendant and refused were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-12\">1st. That the entries in the book of a merchant must be proved by the clerk making them, if the merchant has a clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-13\">2d. One clerk cannot testify to entries made by another, unless he saw them made and knew them to be correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-14\">3rd. Cash items in an account of a merchant, who sells goods, wares and merchandise, cannot be proved by his books alone, though the books are admitted as evidence to go before the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-15\">4th. When orders or invoices are referred to in entries in merchants\u2019 books of accounts, as the foundation of the entries, those oders or invoices must be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-16\">5th. That in order to prove merchants\u2019 accounts from their books, it is necessary that the clerk, who made the entries, should be produced as a witness, and that in case of his death, his handwriting may be proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-17\">6th. That if the clerk who made the entries is living, it is not sufficient to establish the entries by proving the \u25a0 handwriting of the clerk, without proving the delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-18\">The jury found for the plaintiff $1855 57, for which judgment was rendered March 22,1854. Afterwards the plaintiff remitted $300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-19\">The answer of defendant, instructions asked by both parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the motion for a new trial, and the assignment of errors, all referred to a defence that the plaintiff was a partner of defendant in running the boat, during the period covered by the account; but there was nothing of that sort in the statement of facts. The evidence, if any upon the subject, may have been in the depositions of Trobridge Ward, which the statement of facts says were mislaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">The statement of facts was signed by the counsel for appellee, and certified by the Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">There was a bill of exceptions as follows : Be it remembered that, at the said Term of Court, came on to be heard the cause of J. G. Wheeler v. William J. Ward, when the plaintiff introduced, as a witness, William T. Mitchell, who testified that the books, then presented as the account books of the plaintiff, were the plaintiff\u2019s books of account, kept by him as a merchant, and also, that he (the said witness) had been during the years 1849, 1850 and 1851, a book-keeper in the establishment of the plaintiff, and that there had been business transactions during that time between the plaintiff and defendant, and that an account had been opened in said books with the steamer Kate Ward by agreement with the defendant; that during the time aforesaid witness had been absent from the State about three months ; that the entries in said books were, a portion of them, in the writing of the witness, and a portion in the writing of J. 0. Wheeler, the plaintiff, and a portion in the writing of other clerks of said plaintiff, and that one of said clerks was dead; the others were living, and that witness believed that the plaintiff\u2019s books were correctly kept. The defendant then, by counsel, objected to the testimony of the witness offered to prove the sale and delivery of articles not entered by himself, the sale and delivery of which he did not know of Ms personal knowledge, but believed from the entries in the books to be correct. The Court objected to this mode of proceeding in the trial, as it would be inconvenient and retard the progress of the trial, to object to the items of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>account in detail, and ordered that the witness proceed and testify as to all the entries, and that, after the full examination of the witness, the defendant might move to exclude any portion or portions of his testimony from the jury, to which order the defendant, by his counsel, excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">After the examination of the witness the defendant, by his counsel, moved the Court to exclude from the jury the evidence of all the items of the account, not entered by himself, and in the handwriting of others, and of the sale and delivery of which he had no distinct recollection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">The witness, Mitchell, also having stated in his evidence that he had no recollection of the actual delivery of any particular article, charged by him against defendant, in said books, but had a full and distinct recollection of the purchase of goods out of the store from the fact of the entry being in his hand-writing ; he believed they were delivered, and, also having stated, that he frequently made entries by the direction of plaintiff, without having personal knowledge of the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">Defendant, by counsel, moved the Court to exclude from the jury said items, charged in his own hand-writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">And the said witness, Mitchell, having read charges of items from the books, purporting to have been made upon orders of defendant, which said orders were not produced upon the trial, but which, witness stated and he supposed, were in the counting room of plaintiff; the defendant, by his counsel, moved the Court to exclude from the jury the said evidence of said items, unless the said orders were produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\">And the said Mitchell having also read from said books items of charges, made as per invoices, and having stated that said items were in different hand-writings, some of them in his own, and that he could not testify as to their correctness from his personal recollection, but believed those made by him were correct, from the fact of his having entered them, and said invoices not having been produced upon the trial, and the said witness stating that he supposed said invoices were on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>file in the store of <em>plaintiffs; </em>the defendant, by his counsel, moved the Court to exclude from the jury said evidences of said items, unless said invoices were produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">And the said Mitchell having read from said books several items of charges for cash and stated that he could not testify as to those charges from his recollection of the individual items, but believed they were correct; that he, witness, carried the key of the iron safe, and also kept the cash account, and that these entries were made, some by him, some by plaintiff and some by other clerks; the defendant by his counsel moved the Court to exclude from the jury all said evidence, unless additional proof should be given as to them, on the ground that they were not items in the regular course of mercantile business, and that such charges could only be proved by actual evidence of the individual items, or by productions of receipts or orders therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">Which said motions to exclude said testimony were all overruled by the Court, and the said testimony permitted to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">To which overrulings of said motions, as well as to the permitting of said testimony to go to the jury, defendant, by counsel, objected.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-8\"><em>Phillips &amp; </em>Phillips, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXz\">I. The Court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude testimony, as set forth in defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions No. 1, and in permitting that evidence to go to the jury as good and suEcient proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">The best evidence to prove the items charged as on the orders of the defendant, was the respective orders themselves. Those charged as per invoice, should have been proved by the production of the invoices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">So too with regard to the entries not made by himself, the best evidence was the testimony,of those clerks by whom they were made. The absence of those clerks was not accounted for, with the exception of the one who was dead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The admissibility of the entries in a merchant\u2019s books, is a departure from the common law rules of evidence, and is only tolerated from a supposed \u201c moral necessity,\u201d arising from the nature of the case. This moral necessity is founded upon the supposed impossibility or extreme difficulty of making the common law proofs of an account. When the reason of this departure from the common law fails, then the rule fails also. This is clearly laid down in all the text books, and is elaborately discussed in Cowen <em>&amp; </em>Hill\u2019s Notes to Phillips on Evi., 3d ed. part 1st, p, 297, <em>et infra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">The American decisions under the respective Statutes of the different States, are there fully discussed, and shown to be dependent upon the presumption that unless such evidence could be received, there would be a total failure of proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">But this Court has likewise investigated this subject, and declared in Cole v. Dial, 8 Tex. R. 347, that the rule (admitting books in evidence) was admitted with some reluctance in the case of Parrot v. Underwood, 2 Tex. R. 163, but that its further extension would not be tolerated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-7\">Yet the intrinsic circumstances laid down in the latter case as essential to accredit the books, would exclude the testimony of the witness Mitchell:</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">First, with regard to the items entered by other clerks ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">Second, those of which he did not know the delivery ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">Third, those made by the plaintiff himself;</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-11\">Fourth, those based upon orders and invoices; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-12\">Fifth, those made while the witness was absent from the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-13\">It will be seen from the bill of exceptions, that the witness Mitchell was permitted to read off all the items of the account, seriatim, without regard to whether they were charged by himself or others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-14\">The Court refused to exclude this improper testimony, 1st, when it was objected to item by item, on the ground of inconvenience ; and 2nd, when they were objected to in the aggre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>gate, after the testimony had disclosed their inadmissibility ; but the grounds of this last refusal was not stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">The jury were impressed with the belief that the items were all fully proved, because they were read off by a witness under oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">With respect to the correctness of the charges made by Wheeler, and his other clerks, Mitchell could not testify, but only that he recognized their hand-writings. He even states that many of the entries made by himself, were made at the dictation of Wheeler, when he, Mitchell, knew nothing of the transaction. Yet no distinction was drawn between the various items, but all were permitted to go to the jury promiscuously, <em>en masse, </em>and from the sanction of the Court, they were led to believe them all fully established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">\u201c If it appear either on the face of the charge, or in any \u201c other way, that there is in fact living or attainable proof of \u201c the item, independent of the items, the latter are then inad- \u201c missible, for it being apparent that the ordinary common law \u201c proof exists, which is superior in degree, that must be pro- \u201c duced.\u201d (Cowen <em>&amp; </em>Hill\u2019s Notes, 3rd ed. part 1st, p. 309.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">\u201c The common case in New York, is where the party has a clerk.\u201d (Cowen &amp; Hill, 3rd ed. part 1st, p. 309 ; Vosberg v. Thayer, 12 Johns. R. 452. See also dissenting Opinion of Platt Justice, in that case, and authorities there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-9\">\u201cNothing can excuse the absence of the clerk but his death.\u201d (Cowen <em>&amp; </em>Hill, p. 309; Kennedy v. Fairman, 1 Harvy, 458; Whitfield v. Walk, 2 Harvy, 24.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-10\">Charges for work done by a servant were disallowed as evidence, the Court saying such evidence was allowed from necessity, and where the work is done by a third person, the necessity does not exist. He can prove it; <em>cessante ratione, cessat ipsa lex. </em>(Cowen &amp; Hill, 310; Wright v. Sharp, 1 Brown, 344.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-11\">\u201c If the goods were delivered to a third person on account \u201c of the vendee, the books are not evidence, (Id. Kerr v. Lane, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201c 1 Wash. R. 172,) not even though they were the vendee's \u201c servants.\" (Eastman v. Moulton, N. H. R. 156.) \u201cThe charge \u201c on its face purporting to be of goods delivered to another \u201con the defendant\u2019s order, it was rejected as incompetent.\u201d (Cowen v.Hill, 310; Pembroke v. Johnson, 1 Coxe\u2019s R. 288; Townsly v. Wooley, 1 Coxe\u2019s R. 377.) The order must be produced. (Smith v.

R. 156.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">Cash advanced and money loaned are not within the regular course of mercantile business, and could not be proved by the entries in the books. This has been expressly so decided in the case of Cole v. Dial, 8 Tex. R. 347.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">II. The Court erred in refusing to give the instructions asked by the defendant. The propriety of all the charges asked on the part of the defendant, will readily appear from the authorities cited above. What has already been said under the first assignment of errors, is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-9\">During the progress of the trial we took down the notes of the evidence, and made a list of the different classes of the items in the plaintiff\u2019s account, noting those in each handwriting, with what the witness said in regard to them respectively. From these data we prepared a statement of facts, which we submitted to the opposite counsel and the Court, but they refused to sign it. Hence any apparent contradiction between the plaintiff\u2019s statement of facts, signed by the Court after the trial, and defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions Ho. 1, signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>by the Court during the progress of the trial. We could not give our assent to the statement of facts submitted by the counsel for the plaintiff, because it differed very materially in every important particular, from the evidence given on the trial, and noted down by us as delivered. We are therefore reduced to the necessity of relying almost exclusively on our bill of exceptions, and we claim the protection of this Court in behalf of our client.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-5\"><em>Cunningham &amp; Holt, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0M\">The rule, as we understand, established by the authorities in proving merchants\u2019 accounts is this : That upon the production and proof of the original books of entries, and proof that the books were correctly kept, and that a considerable portion of the charges are correct, the books, together with the facts proved, are evidence from which the jury may find that the amount as charged is correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">. The appellee offered in evidence five books of accounts, in which the account sued on was charged in regular course of business: proved them to be original books of entry, and proved that the books were correctly kept. Witness, who was the principal book-keeper, proved that a large number of the charges were in his hand-writing ; that the residue of the charges was in the hand-writing of the other clerks in the house and the plaintiff <em>\u2022 </em>that one of the clerks was dead that nearly all the charges for cash were in the hand-writing of the witness. It was proved by other witnesses who were at the time in the employ of the defendant, that they purchased of the plaintiff by authority on account of the defendant, a large number of the articles charged in the account, and that the account to that extent was correct, and that a number of the articles purchased by one of them were charged in the hand-writing of plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">This proof we conceive fully authorized the Court to suffer the books to go before the jury for their consideration, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>is for the jury to determine from the facts before them, what portion of the accounts is established, and the Court will no t disturb a verdict found upon such testimony.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-5\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anx\">The only question presented by the record, which is deemed to require notice, is as to the admissibility of evidence, and its sufficiency to support the verdict. It cannot be doubted that it was competent to permit the witness, Mitchell, to testify as to the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s account, to the extent of his information and knowledge of the subject. And it is not perceived that there was any impropriety in the course adopted by the Court to elicit the information and knowledge he possessed. Having been the principal clerk and book-keeper, he was certainly competent to testify respecting the correctness of the books under his especial care and keeping. That other clerks in the store may have made an occasional entry of goods sold by them, did not necessarily render them the only competent witnesses of the correctness of the entries. The book-keeper under whose especial supervision they were made may be supposed equally cognizant of their correctness, and competent to depose to the fact-The motion to exclude items and portions of the evidence, as disclosed by the bill of exceptions, appears to have been premature. The proper time to have made the motion would have been when the plaintiff had closed his evidence, rather than when he had concluded the examination of the particular witness. Portions of the account not sufficiently established by that witness, might be by others ; as the event showed. Objections to evidence apparently well taken at the time, and certainly so, if the evidence had been closed on the part of the plaintiff, were afterwards obviated by other evidence. Other witnesses corroborated the testimony of the book-keeper respecting parts of the account, which, upon his testimony alone, might not have been deemed sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>It is not deemed necessary to notice all the objections to evidence, and the rulings of the Court upon them, separately. We think, upon the whole, the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s account was established by competent evidence, and beyond a doubt, to at least the recovery awarded by the judgment of the Court; and that the proofs were made in accordance with the principles maintained by the Opinion and judgment of this Court in the cases of Underwood v. Parrott, (2 Tex. R. 168.) and Cole v. Dial, (8 Id. 347.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The Court did not err in refusing to give in charge to the jury abstract propositions upon the law of evidence. The Court had ruled upon the questions of evidence propounded, at the time, and in the terms propounded ; and more, upon that subject, could not be required. To have given the instructions asked in the\" form proposed, would have had a tendency rather to mislead than to enlighten the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We are of opinion there is no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
