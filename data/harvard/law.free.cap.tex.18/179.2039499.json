Samuel A. Maverick.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-12\">The Statute of 1843, (Hart. Dig. 1067) did not prohibit the Probate Court from ordering a sale of the property of an estate on the petition or application of the administrator.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-13\">This question was not necessarily involved in the decision of the case of Miller v. Miller, (10 Tex. R. 319) on which counsel for the appellant rely, and was not decided by the Court in that case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-14\">It has been assumed, generally, that a petition was neeessaiy to give jurisdiction to the Probate Court to order the sale of the property of deceased persons ; or to call into exercise the jurisdiction of the Court over the subject matter. But the question has not been necessarily involved in the decision of any case, and has not been authoritatively decided.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-15\">It does not affirmatively appear by the record in this case, that the application (by an administrator for an order of sale) was not made by a petition in writing But if it did so appear, I apprehend it could not, on principle, be held to defeat the Probate Court of its jurisdiction to order the sale on the application of the administrator; nor could the purchaser be affected by the irregularity, if such it was, in making the order. He was not required to look beyond the judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-16\">It would seem that the Probate Courts are Courts of general jurisdiction over the estates of deceased persons, and that all presumptions are in favor of the regularity of their proceedings, which cannot be impeached except for fraud or by showing that in the instance of that estate, the jurisdiction did not attach ; but on the latter exception see Burdett v. Silsbee, 15 Tex. R 604.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-17\">An entry that the final account of an administrator be admitted and filed, and that he be discharged upon paying costs, is not such a final close of the administration, as will defeat the title of a bona fide purchaser at a sale by such administrator, upon order granted eight months afterwards.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-18\">This case distinguished from Hurt v. Horton, 12 Tex. R. 285.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b187-19\">Appeal from Travis. Tried below before Robert J. Townes, Esq., appointed by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-20\">Suit by appellants, as heirs of Edwin xblexander, deceased, against appellee, commenced Aug. 19, 1854, in Bexar county and afterwards removed by change of venue to Travis, to clear the title to three and one-third leagues of land, describing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>them and setting forth the facts. Answer by defendant, setting up title in himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">A jury was waived, and the cause submitted to the Court upon the following evidence. The plaintiffs proved that Edwin Alexander died in 1838, being at the time a resident of Bexar, and the owner of the lands in controversy, and that plaintiffs were his nephews and nieces ; that he had no wife or child, and that he recognized the plaintiffs as his heirs in his life-time. The defendants gave in evidence a transcript from the records of the Probate Court of Bexar county, from whicli it appeared as follows : At January Term, 1839, James MeGloin was appointed administrator of said Alexander\u2019s estate\u00bb The proceedings of the administrator and of the Probate Court down to August Term, 1841, showed very clearly that there-was very little if any cause for administration, to pay debts, and that the administrator was consuming the estate by the expenses of administration.

Green, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnY\">There are many objections made to the sale of 1843 in the petition, but we will confine them to one point; that the Court had no jurisdiction to make the order. Where a Court has no jurisdiction to make an order, it is universally admitted to be null and void. The order was made on a verbal motion of the administrator. The Statute requires a written petition as a perquisite to jurisdiction. It has been so adjudged in Lynch v. Baxter, 4 Tex. R. 431, in Finch v. Edmonson, 9 Tex. R. 504, in Miller v. Miller, 10 Tex. R. 319, and in Howard v. Bennett, 13 Tex. R. 309, in 6 S. <em>&amp; </em>M. 259, 3 Barb. R. 341.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-8\">If the petition filed in 1841 shall be considered as before the Court in its order of 1843, yet at time (March Term) it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>not lawful to sell on petition of administrator, and an order granted on such petition is null and void. (Miller v. Miller, 10 Tex. R. 319.) In that case the principle is fully argued in the separate opinion of Justice Lipscomb, and the position assumed by him is fully sustained by the authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-5\">We find in Langlan v. Thompson, 6 Sm. &amp; M. 259, citing authorities, the principle is settled that the records of the Probate Court must show affirmatively that every pre-requisite to the order of the sale, required by Statute, must be complied with before the Court will acquire jurisdiction. In Corwin v. Murritt, 3 Barb. R. 341, it is stated, that those claiming under a decree of the Surrogate, must show affirmatively that he had authority to make the decree; that filing a petition and the account required by Statute was necessary to give jurisdiction ; that presumptions cannot be admitted to establish sucli a vital jurisdictional fact. A great many cases are cited by the Court in that case, which show that the Court is following the authorities in its decision. (3 Barb. 341.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">II. The sale of 1844, at which the defendant Maverick claims the remaining 2-J- leagues claimed by him was under an order made after the succession was closed, and by MeG-loin long after he ceased to be administrator. The Court clearly had no jurisdiction as is established clearly by the case of Fisk v. Norvell, 9 Tex. R. 13, and is the identical character of sale which is declared null and void in Hurt v. Horton, 12 Tex. R. 285. It is impossible to distinguish this case from that, to the advantage of the sale claimed under by the defendant. After the heir had been cited, and the estate closed, administration was again granted (in the case of Hurt v. Horton) and a sale made. In this case administration was not even re-opened. If it had been, the publication of the notice of application might possibly have notified the heirs. We do not ask that the cause shall be decided upon any new principles, but upon the principles embodied in our own reports\u2014those of Poor v. Boyce, Dancy v. Stricklinge, and Burditt v. Silsbee, inclusive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>It is admitted in each of these cases, that if the Court had not jurisdiction, its order would have been void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\">At the same Term at which Poor v. Boyce was decided, the Opinion of Hurt v. Horton was delivered without dissent, in which the objection urged was that the estate had been closed before the order was made. Other minor points were made, but each of them exists also in case, and the Court there unhesitatingly declare the sale a nullity, which could \u201c afford no protection and confer no right,\u201d and that want of authority in \u201c the Court and administrator was too glaring to permit the mind to hesitate in pronouncing it null and void.\u201d (12 Tex. R. 289, 288.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-6\">If any distinction whatever can be drawn between the case in controversy and that of Hurt v. Horton, or any inconsistency between that and subsequent decisions, we' are utterly unable to conceive what it will be. (The remainder of the brief related to the equities between the parties, and is not now important.\u2014Reps.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-7\"><em>I. A. &amp; G. W. Paschal, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-8\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-B\">It is insisted on behalf of the appellant, that the title of the defendant, which he seeks to have set aside and annulled, is void for want of jurisdiction in the Probate Court of Bexar county to order the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">To the order of sale of the March and April Terms, 1848, it is objected, that it was made on motion of the administrator, and not upon petition of any creditor, heir, legatee, or next friend of a ward, as provided in the Act of the 25th of February, 1843. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1067.) To the order of the March Term of the Court 1844, it is objected, that it was made after the administration had been closed, and the functions and powers of the administrator had ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The Statute of 1843 does not prohibit the Probate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>from ordering a sale of the property of the estate, on the petition, or application of the administrator. It only provides that he shall not be required to sell the property of the estate, or to render and settle his account, except upon application of a creditor, or some one of the persons mentioned in the Act. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1067.) The language of the Statute does not import an inhibition on the power of the Probate Court to-order a sale, except upon such application. Nor could it have been intended, or contemplated, that the succession should be kept open indefinitely; and the administrator not be at liberty to obtain the necessary order for the sale of the property, or have settlement of his accounts, and finally close his administration, unless some of the persons mentioned in the Statute should see proper to make application to the Court for that purpose. No such consequence could have been intended ; or could have entered the legislative mind in enacting this Statute. It was simply intended to remove the requisition upon the administrator, imposed by the Act of the 5th of February, 1840, by which it was made his duty to petition the Court for the sale of all the property of the estate, in a certain event, within a precribed period. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1023.) Under the Act of 1843, he was not required to petition the Court for a sale of property, as under the former Statute ; but there was nothing to prevent him from applying for and obtaining an order for that purpose, when necessary for the payment of debts, or the settlement of the estate. This question was not necessarily involved in the decision of the case in Miller v. Miller, (10 Tex. R. 319,) on which counsel for the appellant rely, and was not decided by the Court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Nor did the Statute of 1843 require that the application to the Court for the sale of property should be by petition in writing. And the case, therefore, is not within the principle of the decision in Finch v. Edmonson, 9 Tex. R. 504. It has been assumed, generally, that a petition was necessary to give jurisdiction to the Probate Court to order a sale of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>erty of deceased persons ; or to call into exercise the jurisdiction of the Court over that subject matter. But the question has not been necessarily involved in the decision of any case ; and has not been authoritatively decided. The case of Finch v. Edmonson was determined upon the particular provisions of the Act of 1846, and the sale was adjudged void on account of fraud, which is always a sufficient ground for setting aside sales, and annulling the most solemn act and judgments of Courts, whether of limited or general jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In the case of Tucker v. Harris, (13 Geo. R. 1,) the Supreme Court of Georgia held their Courts of Ordinary\u2014constituted as our Courts of Probate are\u2014Courts of general jurisdiction over testate and intestate estates ; that their judgments relative to that subject matter, stand upon the same footing as the judgments of any other Court of general jurisdiction. \u201cThe \u201cjurisdiction being established,\u201d the Court says, \u201c all presump- \u201c tions must be made in favor of what does not appear. The \u201c Court having the right to decide upon the application ; the \u201c purchaser is not bound to go behind the judgment of the \u201c Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The Court quote and approve the case of Duval\u2019s heirs v. McLoskey, (1 Ala. R. N. S. 708,) where, under a Statute of the State of Alabama, which required that the executor or administrator shall \u201c file \u201d a petition in open Court, prescribing what it shall contain, as the initiatory step towards obtaining an order for the sale of the real estate of the testator'or intestate, the Supreme Court of that State held, that the order of sale could not be considered invalid, because the record did not show affirmatively that the petition was filed. As the Court went on to render its decree, the Court held, it could not be intended, from the absence of such a paper merely, that it was never filed ; but the intendment most rational, would be that it was lost after the rendition of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The Court also cite the case of Thompson v. Tolmie, (2 Peters\u2019 R. 165,) where the order of sale was under a-Statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>which provided, that if all the parties were minors at the death of the intestate, the estate should not be sold till the oldest arrived of age ; and the Supreme Court held, in effect, that in order to. give the Court jurisdiction to order the sale, it was not necessary that it should appear affirmatively that one of the heirs had arrived of age; but sustained the jurisdiction because the contrary did not appear by the record. The Court said : \u201c It is to be borne in mind that no such fact appears on \" the face of the proceedings.\u201d * * <em>\u201c </em>And how can we say \u201c but that the Court had satisfactory evidence before it, that 41 one of the heirs was of age ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Judge Lumpkin also cites the case of Kennedy v. Nachsmith, which, he says, was decided in the Supreme Court at Philadelphia, and makes the following quotation and observation upon the case : 44 The Court say ' Beyond the decree, the purchaser ''is not bound to look. The inquiries upon ejectment are: ''was there an administrator and order to sell, such as would ''authorize the administrator to make sale ? was the sale fair <em>? </em>''If so the settled rule is, <em>de fide et officio judicis, non recipitur \u201c questio. </em>And it is asserted that no sale in that State ever ''has been declared void in ejectment, against a purchaser <em>bona \u201cfide, </em>for any alleged irregularity in the Orphans\u2019 Court; or '' because the decree of the Court was founded on mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-f\">The Georgia Court hold that the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court existed potentially from the death of the testator or intestate ; and they quote, upon this subject, the language of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of McPherson v. Cunliff, (11 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, cited by us in Burdett v. Silsbee, 15 Tex. R. 617,) as follows : ''The matter which gives \u201cthe Orphans\u2019 Court jurisdiction, is the death of the owner intestate ; for if administration were taken out on the effects of ''a living man, or of one who died testate, the administration ''itself would be void, and there could be no administrator to ''act\u2014no party before the Court; consequetly all the pro-''ceedings would be null. Where an executor obtains pay- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201c ment on a probate of a void will, without suit, it cannot be \u201c impeached, notwithstanding the probate was afterwards de- \u201c dared null\u2014it being proved on the faith of the act of a judi\u201ccial tribunal having competent jurisdiction. (Toll. Ex. 51.) \u201c The distinction in this respect is this : a probate of the will \u201c of a living person, or a letter of administration on his effects, \u201c where the person is dead, but left a will, is void, <em>ipso </em>facto, \u201c because there is no jurisdiction ; but where the person is dead \u201c intestate, the Orphans\u2019 Court have power over his estate ; and \u201c any one acting on the faith of their judicial acts will be pro- \u201c tected.\u201d This, it will be seen, is in occordance with the opinion held by us in the case of Poor v. Boyce. (12 Tex. R. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It does not affirmatively appear by the record in this case, that the application was. not made by a petition in writing. But if it did so appear, I apprehend it could not, on principle, be held to defeat the Probate Court of its jurisdiction to order the sale on the application of an administrator ; nor could the purchaser be affected by the irregularity, if such it was, in making the order. He was not required to look beyond the judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As respects the order of 1844, though there does appear an entry in the minutes of a Court, of a former Term, that the administrator\u2019s final account be admitted and filed, and \u201che discharged \u201c upon paying costsit is not an absolute and final settlement and discharge. The case, described by its title, thus : \u201cNo. 52, Estate of E. Alexander, deceased,\u201d was continued upon the docket of the Probate Court: the authority of the administrator continued to be recognized by the Court, until after the order, and report, and approval of the sale of 1844, and his final account of his administration thereafter rendered; and he was finally discharged upon paying costs ; with which last order he complied. Notwithstanding the previous entry in the minutes, it was disregarded, and he went on to administer, and to close the administration, with the sanction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Probate Court as though it had not been made. \u2022 It was disregarded by all parties; and it cannot be now invoked to annul the subsequent orders of the Court, and his acts thereafter done, in the due course of administration, and thereby defeat the title of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The present is a very different case from that of Hurt v. Horton. (12 Tex. R. 285.) There the property was legally sold, and the administration finally closed and settled. Nearly two years after the final settlement and discharge of the administrator, he again applied for and obtained a grant of administration on the estate, without showing any necessity for a renewal of his administration ; and proceeded again to sell the same property to another purchaser. The first purchaser protested, but the Court proceeded, notwithstanding, to confirm the sale to the second purchaser. It was held, and rightly, that the estate having been fully administered, and closed, a second administration upon the same estate, and the same property, which had already been administered upon, was a nullity, and the second sale void. The present is a very different case. The estate was not fully administered, nor the administrator absolutely and finally discharged by the Court; but on the contrary he continued to act as administrator and the Court recognized and approved his acts as such. And upon the repeated decisions of this Court, it must be held, that, the order of sale and sale were effectual to pass the title to the purchaser. There is therefore no error in the judgment and it is afiirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
