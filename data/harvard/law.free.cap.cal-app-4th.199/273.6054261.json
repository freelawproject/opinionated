Lexis 50 at p. *15). We reach this conclusion based on our opinion in <em>Overaa Construction v. California Occupational Safety &amp; Health Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 235 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 154] <em>(Overaa), </em>which we issued two months before the <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We shall affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and attorney fees order, which, respectively, (1) granted a writ of mandate that vacated the <em>Harris-Board Decision, </em>remanded the matter to the Board, and specified that, on remand, this \u201cposition to abate\u201d requirement was not an element of the Division\u2019s prima facie case and (2) denied the writ petitioner\u2019s request for attorney fees under the private attorney general theory of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\n<em>Legal Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">In California, the Division has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing Cal-OSHA. <em>(Rick\u2019s Electric, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1026 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 847] <em>(Rick\u2019s Electric).) </em>The Board is an independent adjudicatory agency that resolves appeals from Division-issued citations under Cal-OSHA. <em>(Rick\u2019s Electric, </em>at p. 1027; \u00a7 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Prior to the adoption of title 8, section 336.10 in 1997, California had no rules for issuing multiple employer (multi-employer) citations. In 1997, the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations (the Director) promulgated the multi-employer worksite standard\u2014title 8, section 336.10\u2014in response to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s determination that, in the absence of such a standard, the Cal-OSHA program was not as protective as the federal program, as federal law required.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Title 8, section 336.10 provides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cOn multi-employer worksites, both construction and non-construction, citations may be issued only to the following categories of employers when the Division has evidence that an employee was exposed to a hazard in violation of any requirement enforceable by the Division:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201c(a) The employer whose employees were exposed to the hazard (the exposing employer);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201c(b) The employer who actually created the hazard (the creating employer);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\u201c(c) The employer who was responsible, by contract or through actual practice, for safety and health conditions on the worksite; i.e., the employer who had the authority for ensuring that the hazardous condition is corrected (the controlling employer); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">\u201c(d) The employer who had the responsibility for actually correcting the hazard (the correcting employer).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201cNote: The employers listed in [subdivisions] (b) through (d) may be cited regardless of whether their own employees were exposed to the hazard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">In 1999, the Legislature codified title 8, section 336.10 by amending Labor Code section 6400, subdivision (b)(1) through (4), which repeats the regulation virtually word for word.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">This matter arose out of a citation the Division issued to Harris Construction Company, Inc. (Harris), for a general violation of title 8, section 3329, which requires that pressurized systems be depressurized prior to dismantling or opening.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In 2003, Harris was the general contractor on a project to expand Madera Community College. Jeff Gilkison was an apprentice pipefitter for Champion Industrial Contractors (Champion), Harris\u2019s subcontractor on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Gilkison seriously injured his leg after being instructed by his supervisor at Champion to fix a leak in a pressurized chill water line that other Champion employees had installed two days before. Gilkison mistakenly opened the pressurized line, causing a large valve to be thrust against his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Evidence presented at the citation hearing before the administrative law judge (ALJ) also showed the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Harris\u2019s subcontract with Champion contained the following two provisions: (1) \u201cWhen so ordered, the Subcontractor shall stop any part of the work, which Harris deems unsafe until corrective measures satisfactory to Harris have been taken, and the Subcontractor agrees that it shall not have nor make any claim for damages growing out of such stoppages\u201d; and (2) \u201cShould the Subcontractor neglect to take such corrective measures, Harris may do so at the cost and expense of the Subcontractor and may deduct the cost thereof from any payments due or to become due to the Subcontractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Harris maintained an office trailer at the worksite, about 600 feet from where Gilkison was injured. Gilkison spoke with Harris employees almost daily regarding his work. Harris also held weekly safety meetings, which Champion supervisors usually attended, and Harris stipulated that it \u201cplayed an active role in safety.\u201d Gilkison believed that he jokingly mentioned to some of Harris\u2019s \u201cforemen\u201d shortly before the accident that he was \u201ccleaning up\u201d after some journeymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The Division\u2019s citation officer, an industrial hygienist, cited Harris as a controlling employer. (Champion was also cited, but that citation is not at issue.) The citation officer based Harris\u2019s citation primarily on the two provisions of Harris\u2019s subcontract with Champion quoted above, but the officer also considered Harris\u2019s actual practices at the worksite.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The ALJ upheld the citation against Harris as a controlling employer. The ALJ relied on two prior Board decisions: <em>In re DeSilva Gates Construction </em>(Cal. OSHA, Dec. 10, 2004, No. 01-R2D2-2742) 2004 CA OSHA App.Bd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Lexis 62 <em>(DeSilva-Board </em>Decision) and <em>In re C. Overaa &amp; Co. </em>(Cal. OSHA, Apr. 1, 2004, No. 01-R1D4-3560) 2004 CA OSHA App.Bd. Lexis 15 <em>(Overaa-Board Decision).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The <em>DeSilva-Board Decision </em>had concluded that \u201cthe applicability of [title 8,] section 336.10 is not conditioned upon a controlling employer\u2019s knowledge of the [general] violation\u201d; and to \u201cinject into [title 8,] section 336.10[, subdivision] (c) [(i.e., the definition of \u2018controlling employer\u2019)] an interpretation that requires that a [controlling] employer have a \u2018realistic ability\u2019 to detect hazardous conditions as a necessary element of finding the controlling employer liable for [a general] violation would lead to \u2018unwieldy subjective enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(DeSilva-Board Decision, </em>supra, 2004 CA OSHA App.Bd. Lexis 62 at p. *7, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In the <em>Overaa-Board Decision, </em>the Board held that the Division did not bear the burden of proving, as an element of a prima facie case of a Cal-OSHA general violation against a controlling employer, the employer\u2019s lack of reasonable diligence regarding the violation. <em>(Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at p. 246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">On its own motion, the Board ordered reconsideration of the ALJ\u2019s decision here, and issued, in turn, the <em>Harris-Board Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>held that \u201can employer\u2019s status as a controlling employer subject to citation under [title 8,] section 336.10 is dependent on whether the employer was in a position to abate the specific violative condition at issue. ...[][]... Accordingly, the Division must present a prima facie case demonstrating that the employer was in a position to abate the specific violative condition at issue.\u201d <em>(Harris-Board Decision, supra, </em>2007 CA OSHA App.Bd. Lexis 50 at p. *15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Gilkison\u2019s union, United Association Local Union 246, AFL-CIO (the Union), with the Division as real party in interest, petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate to vacate the <em>Harris-Board Decision. </em>(\u00a7 6627.) Relying on our decision in <em>Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th 235, the trial court obliged, concluding that \u201cthe [Board] committed \u2018legal error\u2019 in [the <em>Harris-Board </em>Decision] by holding that the Division had the burden of proving, as part of its prima facie case, that Harris, as the controlling employer, was in a position to abate the condition that led to the citation and the worker injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The trial court, however, denied the Union\u2019s request for attorney fees under the private attorney general theory of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. The court concluded that the Union had \u201cnot demonstrated that the ruling in this case conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The Board then appealed the overturning of the <em>Harris-Board Decision. </em>The Union appealed the denial of its attorney fees request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In the published portion of this opinion, we discuss the Board\u2019s appeal from the judgment granting the Union\u2019s writ of mandate; in the nonpublished portion, we address the Union\u2019s appeal for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">I. The Board\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">A. <em>The Pivotal Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The pivotal issue in the Board\u2019s appeal is the proper interpretation of the term \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d in section 6400, subdivision (b)(3) (hereafter section 6400(b)(3)) (mirroring tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10, subd. (c); hereafter title 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>section 336.10(c)). Section 6400(b)(3) specifies: \u201c(b) On multiemployer worksites, both construction and nonconstruction, citations may be issued only to the following categories of employers when the [D]ivision has evidence that an employee was exposed to a hazard in violation of any requirement enforceable by the [Division: [f] . . . [f] (3) The employer who was responsible, by contract or through actual practice, for safety and health conditions on the worksite, <em>which is </em>the employer who had the authority for ensuring that the hazardous condition is corrected (the controlling employer).\u201d (\u00a7 6400(b)(3), italics added [as noted, the language of tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10(c) is identical to this statute except the statute substitutes \u201cwhich is\u201d for \u201ci.e.\u201d (see italicized words)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">As we shall explain, the proper interpretation of \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d in this statute (and corresponding regulation) effectively delineates the proper burden of proof the Division must meet in its prima facie case against a controlling employer cited for a general violation of Cal-OSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\"><em>Overaa </em>sets forth our standard of review: \u201c \u2018 \u201cOur function on appeal is the same as that of the trial court in ruling on the petition for the writ. . . . [Citations.] Where the [Board\u2019s] decision involves the interpretation and application of existing regulations [and statutes], we must determine whether the administrative agency applied the proper legal standard. [Citation.] . . . The Board is one of those agencies [(as is the Division)] whose expertise we must respect. [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.] However, \u201c[a]n administrative agency cannot alter or enlarge the legislation, and an erroneous administrative construction does not govern the court\u2019s interpretation of the statute.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at pp. 244\u2014245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\"><em>Overaa </em>has also done most of the heavy interpretive lifting already. There, in construing the legal framework encompassing section 6400(b)(3) (and tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10(c)), we concluded that the Board, in the <em>Overaa-Board Decision, </em>properly held that the Division did not have to prove lack of reasonable diligence by a controlling employer as an element of the Division\u2019s prima facie case of a general violation under Cal-OSHA. <em>(Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at pp. 237-239, 246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>We reasoned in Overaa: \u201cWhen the Division alleges a \u2018serious\u2019 violation [under Cal-OSHA, as opposed to a general violation] . . . , section 6432 [(the serious violation statute)] . . . authorizes the employer to assert reasonable diligence as an affirmative defense. . . . [Fn. omitted.] [][] There would be no need for section 6432\u2019s statutory authorization (for employers to assert diligence as an affirmative defense) if lack of diligence were an element of the Division\u2019s prima facie case. [][] No parallel provision addresses employer diligence in the context of a <em>general </em>(as opposed to serious) violation. Overaa offers no reason as to why the Division should have a heavier burden in proving a general violation than it has in proving a serious violation.\u201d <em>(Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at pp. 246-247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We conclude the Board\u2019s requirement in the <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>that the Division demonstrate\u2014as part of its prima facie case against a controlling employer cited for a general violation under Cal-OSHA\u2014that the controlling employer \u201cwas in a position to abate the specific violative condition at issue\u201d <em>(Harris-Board Decision, supra, </em>2007 CA OSHA App.Bd. Lexis 50 at p. *15), is similar to the \u201clack of reasonable diligence\u201d requirement that we found, in <em>Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at page 246, would have been legally improper to impose as part of the prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">As the trial court aptly reasoned regarding this similarity, \u201cThe similarity [between these two legal requirements] arises from the fact that both [of them] force the Division, in the first instance, to address factual issues regarding the controlling employer\u2019s actual ability to detect and correct the violation for which it was cited which are not set forth in . . . section 6400(b)(3). In either case, the Division would need to go beyond the issues of contractual responsibility, actual practice and authority that are set forth in the statute in order to establish a prima facie case. . . . Both requirements go beyond what the applicable statute requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Furthermore, the \u201clack of reasonable diligence\u201d requirement was couched in the context of the controlling employer\u2019s knowledge\u2014i.e., \u201cthe employer knew, or in exercising reasonable diligence should have known, of the violation.\u201d <em>(Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at pp. 237-238; see <em>id. </em>at p. 246.) Arguably, the \u201cposition to abate\u201d requirement of the <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>places an even greater burden on the Division\u2019s prima facie case than the mere constructive knowledge component of the \u201clack of reasonable diligence\u201d requirement we discredited in <em>Overaa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The Board counters that it properly interpreted the ambiguous, two-part definition of \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d in section 6400(b)(3) (and the virtually identical tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10(c))\u2014through its \u201cposition to abate\u201d requirement in the <em>Harris-Board </em>Decision\u2014and that it is the administrative agency with the expertise to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Specifically, the Board argues that the <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>correctly analyzed the \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d definition by concluding that the definition requires more evidence, in the Division\u2019s prima facie case, of a controlling employer\u2019s connection to the violative condition than \u201cmere contract language\u201d giving the controlling employer responsibility \u201cfor safety and health conditions on the worksite\u201d; the Board notes the \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d definition also requires, in its second part, that the employer have \u201cthe authority for ensuring that the hazardous condition is corrected.\u201d (\u00a7 6400(b)(3); tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10(c).) In other words, the Board maintains, its interpretation properly gives effect to the <em>two </em>parts of the \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d definition, rather than just the first part, and avoids making section 6400(b)(3) an improper strict liability standard. As the Board sees it, the <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>properly held that, \u201cunder the facts presented, which consisted merely of the [subjcontract language and the presence of Harris\u2019s trailer 600 feet from the accident site, a general violation of the [Cal-OSHA] safety orders was not shown under the multi-employer worksite . . . rule [of] section 6400(b)(3) and [title 8,] section 336.10[(c)].\u201d We disagree for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">First, the definition of \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d in both section 6400(b)(3) and title 8, section 336.10(c) does not comprise two distinct parts, but two equivalent parts connected explanatively by \u201cwhich is\u201d and \u201ci.e.,\u201d respectively. That is, the \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d is the employer \u201cwho was responsible,\u201d in other words \u201cwho had the authority\u201d\u2014\u201cby contract or through actual practice\u201d\u2014\u201cfor ensuring that the hazardous condition is corrected.\u201d (\u00a7 6400(b)(3); tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10(c).) This is not a strict liability standard. Moreover, the \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d can be contrasted with another category of multi-employer, the \u201ccorrecting employer,\u201d which is \u201c[t]he employer who had the responsibility for actually correcting the hazard.\u201d (\u00a7 6400, subd. (b)(4); tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Second, the Board\u2019s interpretive expertise rests on progressively shaky ground here. As we have seen, the Board\u2019s \u201cposition to abate\u201d interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>in the <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>conflicts with its earlier interpretations of title 8, section 336.10(c) in the <em>DeSilva-Board </em>and <em>Overaa-Board Decisions. </em>The Division, which disagrees with the Board\u2019s \u201cposition to abate\u201d interpretation, is also an administrative agency \u201c \u2018whose expertise we must respect\u2019 \u201d because it has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing Cal-OSHA. <em>(Rick\u2019s Electric, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034; see <em>Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at p. 245.) And, most significantly, the \u201cposition to abate\u201d interpretation is similar to the \u201clack of reasonable diligence\u201d interpretation we discredited in <em>Overaa, </em>and it is the judiciary which has the final say in interpreting the law. <em>(Overaa, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.4th at pp. 244\u2014245, 246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Third, and lastly, \u201cthe facts presented\u201d at the ALJ hearing showed that while the Division\u2019s citation officer based Harris\u2019s citation primarily on Harris\u2019s subcontract with Champion, the officer also considered Harris\u2019s actual practices at the worksite. There was evidence at the ALJ hearing that these actual practices included Harris\u2019s (1) onsite job trailer near the accident site, (2) almost daily discussions with the injured Champion employee (Gilkison) concerning his work, (3) weekly safety meetings with Champion supervisors, and (4) stipulation that it \u201cplayed an active role in safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We conclude the Board improperly interpreted section 6400(b)(3) (and tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10(c)) in the <em>Harris-Board Decision </em>to require that the Division, as an element of its prima facie case against a controlling employer for a general Cal-OSHA violation, demonstrate that the controlling employer was \u201cin a position to abate the specific violative condition at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On remand, Harris will be allowed to assert an affirmative defense of due diligence, should it choose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">II.

OSHA, Mar. 30, 2007, No. 03-R2D5-3914) 2007 CA OSHA App.Bd. Lexis 50 <em>(Harris-Board Decision).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-15\"> Harris was represented in the underlying action by Attorney Deb C. Pedersdotter and was entitled to appear as a real party in interest, but it did not file a brief or otherwise actively participate in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"><em> </em>We grant the United Association Local Union 246, AFL-CIO\u2019s request for judicial notice, which attached copies of four Board decisions. We deny the union\u2019s motion to strike a particular argument in the Board\u2019s reply brief on the issue of standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> On appeal, the Board has disputed the Union\u2019s standing to petition the superior court and appeal here. This dispute is largely academic. This is because, on the issue of overturning the <em>Harris-Board Decision, </em>section 148.6 grants standing to the Division (real party in interest) \u201cto seek judicial review\u201d of a board decision, the Division\u2019s interests in the present litigation match those of the Union, the Division has appeared and litigated in the trial court and on appeal here, and the Division moved the trial court to realign it as a petitioner instead of a real party in interest (to match the Union\u2019s designation as a petitioner; the trial court denied this motion only because, at the time of the motion, the issue of the Union\u2019s administrative exhaustion had not yet been resolved). When a party lacks standing to sue, the action must be dismissed, unless the complaint (petition) can be amended by substituting a party who has standing. <em>(Cloud v. Northrup Grumman Corp. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 1004-1011 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 544] <em>(Cloud).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Given the facts recounted in this footnote, this principle applies here. The Division\u2019s realignment motion acted as the functional equivalent of a motion to amend the petition to substitute real party in interest Division as a petitioner; also, given the identity of interests between the Union and the Division, this functional motion to amend \u201crelates back\u201d to the timely filing of the Union\u2019s petition (\u00a7 6627 sets forth a 30-day statute of limitations for applying for a writ of mandate challenging a Board decision). <em>(Norgart </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 408-409 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79] [relation-back doctrine]; see also <em>Cloud, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at p. 1005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>And, on the issue of denial of the attorney fees, assuming for the sake of argument the Union has standing, we shall affirm that denial on its merits in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 273.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
