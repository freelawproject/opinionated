It alleged that Reid had committed various drug and weapons offenses on or about December 16, 2009: possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359) (count one); cultivation of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11358) (count two); possession of a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(1)) (count three); possession of a controlled substance, specifically \u201cOxycontin and Morphine Sulfate\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)) (count four); possession of an assault weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12280, subd. (b)) (count five); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>possession of a blowgun (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12582) (count six); and possession of a destructive device, specifically eight incendiary projectiles (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12303) (count seven).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On January 22, 2010, a five-count complaint was filed against Barry in Santa Cruz County Superior Court case No. F18756. The complaint alleged that, on or about December 22, 2009, Barry had committed the following offenses: possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359) (count one); cultivation of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11358) (count two); possession of hydrocodone (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)) (count three); possession of an assault weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12280, subd. (b)) (count four); and possession of a deadly weapon (Pen Code, \u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(1)) (count five).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Reid filed a motion to suppress pursuant to section 1538.5 on the grounds that he had been unlawfully arrested on December 6, 2009, following a traffic stop and the ensuing warrantless searches of his vehicle and a cell phone found in the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment violated the Fourth Amendment. He contended that the evidence seized during subsequent searches pursuant to warrants must be suppressed because the searches were based on evidence derived from unlawfully searching the cell phone. The exhibits attached to the motion indicated that, on December 8, 2009, Santa Cruz County Deputy Sheriff Steven Ryan obtained and executed a search warrant on Reid\u2019s cell phone based on the information obtained from the initial searches of the vehicle and cell phone. Deputy Ryan sought and obtained a warrant on December 9, 2009, to search 2001 Larkin Valley Road, Watsonville, and executed the search on December 16, 2009. The motion sought to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the allegedly unlawful arrest of Reid, including urine test results, a gun found under the seat of the vehicle that Reid had been driving, the cell phone found in the vehicle, the officers\u2019 observations, Reid\u2019s statements, narcotics paraphernalia, and the evidence obtained in executing the search warrants, which included additional guns, scales, cash and drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Barry joined in Reid\u2019s suppression motion, arguing that the search of Barry\u2019s home was \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d Barry further argued that the warrant to search his home was not supported by probable cause and was not executed in good faith since his residence was separate from Reid\u2019s residence even though both residences were situated on the same large parcel of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In their opposing papers, the People maintained that Deputy Ryan had probable cause to arrest Reid for being under the influence, Deputy Ryan lawfully searched the area of Reid\u2019s car where Reid was sitting incident to arrest, the vehicle was lawfully inventoried and towed for safekeeping, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Deputy Gonzales conducted a lawful limited search of Reid\u2019s cell phone that was \u201csubstantially contemporaneous\u201d with Reid\u2019s arrest, the search warrant for the Larkin Valley Road property was based on probable cause, and, even if Deputy Gonzales\u2019s search of Reid\u2019s cell phone was unlawful, the same evidence would have been inevitably discovered because Deputy Ryan would have obtained a search warrant to search the cell phone based on the screensaver photo that showed someone who looked like Reid brandishing two assault weapons. As to the search of Barry\u2019s residence, the People contended that the search warrant for the Larkin Valley Road property was supported by probable cause and executed in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">At the time set for the preliminary hearing, the magistrate heard and granted the suppression motion. Respondents were not held to answer. The prosecutor indicated that, based on the ruling, the People did not have sufficient evidence to proceed in either case and the magistrate dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The prosecutor subsequently moved to reinstate the complaints pursuant to section 871.5. (See \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (j).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor argued, among other things, that the searches of the vehicle and cell phone were lawful as searches incident to arrest and that the magistrate erroneously denied the People\u2019s request to call Deputy Gonzales to testify at the suppression hearing. The superior court denied the motions. In each case, the People filed a notice of appeal. (See \u00a7\u00a7 871.5, subd. (f), 1238, subd. (a)(9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">B. <em>Motion to Suppress at the Preliminary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">1. <em>Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Deputy Sheriff Ryan attended a six-month police academy that included 40 hours of narcotics enforcement training. The deputy had investigated over 300 persons for being under the influence and arrested \u201ca little over 80\u201d individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Deputy Ryan had worked with the county narcotics enforcement team and he had assisted the team in an \u201cauxiliary fashion on search warrants\u201d and with paperwork but he had never been a member of the team. He had used the team\u2019s expertise as a resource. Deputy Ryan had done some work with Deputy Yanez, a team member who had produced a manual about identifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>persons who are under the influence. Deputy Ryan recognized Deputy Yanez as an expert in the field. Deputy Ryan had learned from working with the team that drug addicts and casual drug users very often sell drugs either to maintain their habits or obtain income.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In Deputy Ryan\u2019s experience, drug paraphernalia or narcotics related to being under the influence are often found on persons under the influence, or somewhere close to them, or in their vehicles. In his experience, cell phones are the main communication device used by drug users and drug sellers. Cell phones can contain text messages related to acquiring and offering drugs. Text and voice mail messages, contact lists, call history, photos, and videos found in cell phones can be useful to investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In the FTO (field training officer) training program, a trainee is paired with a more experienced deputy who teaches the trainee how to conduct a vehicle inventory in accordance with the policy of the sheriff\u2019s office and California\u2019s Vehicle Code. During Deputy Ryan\u2019s training, his FTO covered the inventory search protocol and Deputy Ryan was familiar with the policy of the sheriff\u2019s office on the subject of vehicle inventories.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">At approximately 1:55 a.m. on December 6, 2009, Deputy Ryan was on duty in full uniform and traveling southbound on Highway 1 in a marked patrol car. As he was traveling at a speed of 65 miles per hour, the deputy observed a silver car, which was approximately a quarter-mile ahead, pull away from his vehicle. He accelerated to get closer and then followed approximately 100 yards behind the vehicle, keeping pace with it at 90 miles per hour for approximately a quarter of a mile. When he moved closer to the vehicle, he determined that it was a silver Acura TL.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The speed limit in that area of Highway 1 was 65 miles per hour. When the vehicle exited, Deputy Ryan followed. When the Acura made a left onto Larkin Valley Road from the off-ramp, the deputy initiated a vehicle stop by activating his overhead red stop lamp for the observed speeding in violation of Vehicle Code section 22349, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Deputy Ryan contacted the driver through the front driver\u2019s window, which was rolled down, and asked for his driver\u2019s license. The driver, identified as Reid at the hearing, told the deputy that he did not have it on him. Reid said that the vehicle did not belong to him. The deputy assumed it belonged to Reid\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Reid appeared \u201cvery nervous\u201d but he was \u201calso very alert and awake\u201d which Deputy Ryan found odd \u201csince it was pretty late at night.\u201d Reid was not able to sit still and he was noticeably perspiring and had a \u201cnoticeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>body odor.\u201d His eyes were watery, slightly bloodshot, and darted around \u201cin a really nervous kind of fidgeting fashion.\u201d He was rocking slightly in his seat and \u201cseemed very, very ill at ease.\u201d His speech was rapid, \u201cdisjointed,\u201d and \u201cvery punctuated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Reid informed Deputy Ryan that he had been up all night studying and the deputy took that fact into consideration in determining whether Reid was under the influence of a drug. Reid also said he had been drinking caffeinated energy drinks, which Deputy Ryan saw littered throughout the car. Based on his observations and training and experience, Deputy Ryan concluded that Reid was potentially under the influence of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Deputy Ryan also observed that a woman slouched in the passenger seat of the vehicle was highly intoxicated. She spoke animatedly \u201cin an exaggerated fashion\u201d and slurred her words. Her eyes were red and watery and she informed the deputy that she had been drinking and Reid was taking her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Deputy Ryan walked back to his patrol vehicle and ran Reid\u2019s name for warrants and driver\u2019s license status. He learned that Reid\u2019s driver\u2019s license was expired. On the radio, Sergeant Carney, the watch commander for the night, told Deputy Ryan to call him on the cell phone. Over the cell phone, Sergeant Carney alerted Deputy Ryan that a Mr. Nottoli had been investigated for his involvement in drugs sales some years back.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The deputy returned to Reid, who said his birthday was on December 5. The deputy asked Reid to step out of the vehicle. At this point it was approximately 2:20 a.m. on December 6, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Deputy Ryan conducted a pupil check of Reid\u2019s eyes with a penlight and determined, using a pupillometer, that his pupils were constricted and fixed at approximately four millimeters, which the deputy concluded was abnormal under the ambient outdoor lighting conditions. Deputy Ryan next conducted a Romberg test, which requires the subject to estimate 30 seconds with his eyes closed and head tilted back. He observed that Reid had rapid eye tremors indicative of controlled substance use. Reid\u2019s estimate of 30 seconds was actually 25 seconds, which Deputy Ryan regarded as faster than normal. He then tested for horizontal nystagmus and found nothing significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Next, Deputy Ryan took Reid\u2019s pulse, which was 160 beats per minute and outside the range of normal. The deputy had tested recent users of controlled substances, who had rates of 120 to 130 beats per minute. Deputy Ryan noted that Reid\u2019s muscle tone was \u201cvery tense, very rigid,\u201d which can be attributed to nervousness or controlled substance use. He observed white spittle forming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>at the comers of Reid\u2019s mouth, a symptom of dry mouth. The deputy also observed that Reid\u2019s breath was \u201cvery rapid\u201d and \u201csharp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">At the end of the exam of Reid, Deputy Ryan concluded that Reid was under the influence of a stimulant based on his training and experience, the results of the exam, and Reid\u2019s excessive driving speed, which indicated to the deputy that Reid\u2019s judgment was impaired. Deputy Ryan arrested Reid for being under the influence of a controlled substance in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a), and driving on an expired license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500, subdivision (a). He handcuffed Reid and put Reid in the back of his patrol vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Deputy Ryan could not allow the passenger to drive the vehicle, even though she was a licensed driver, because she was so intoxicated. Her emotional state had continued to deteriorate during the contact and the deputy arrested her for public intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">With Reid under arrest and handcuffed in the patrol car, Deputy Ryan decided to have Reid\u2019s Acura towed. Reid had wanted Deputy Ryan to leave the Acura on the side of the road or to drive the vehicle to his house, which was a half-mile up the road. Driving the vehicle to Reid\u2019s house was not an option because the deputy was on patrol and driving it would expose the sheriff\u2019s office to liability. Deputy Ryan\u2019s decision to take the vehicle into safekeeping was based on his concern that leaving the car on the side of the road would expose it to possible vehicular theft or burglary since it was nighttime, that stretch of road was sparsely populated and not frequently traveled, and the vehicle was a nicer, newer model car.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Deputy Ryan began completing a CHP-180 form, which documents the condition and contents of a vehicle to be towed. He was acting under the authority of Vehicle Code section 22651, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">At the hearing, Deputy Ryan acknowledged that the Santa Cmz County Sheriff\u2019s Office inventory protocol required DUI (driving under the influence) cases to be turned over to the CHP (California Highway Patrol). He explained that Reid\u2019s driving was not sufficiently impaired to require the involvement of the CHP. Reid was not arrested for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">During the search of the vehicle, Deputy Ryan found a gun, with a loaded magazine and its grip facing forward so that it was easily accessible to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>seated driver, underneath the driver\u2019s seat. The gun was a \u201cGuncrafter Industries\u2019 conversion of a Glock 20 handgun,\u201d altered to \u201cfire a very propriety [szc] and powerful handgun round,\u201d a .50-caliber, hollow-point round. Deputy Ryan, who was a longtime, avid gun enthusiast and collector, recognized the gun immediately. He confronted Reid, who admitted the gun was his. Although the gun itself was not an illegal weapon, it was illegal to have the gun in the car; it should have been secured in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">At some point while Deputy Ryan was conducting a search of the vehicle, Deputy Gonzales arrived and he took over the completion of the CHP-180 form. Deputy Ryan was searching the vehicle for narcotics and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In the driver\u2019s side door cubby, Deputy Ryan located two hollow tubes, one cardboard and the other plastic, each with a white powdery residue inside. He suspected that the tubes were \u201cfooters,\u201d straws used to ingest drugs. At some point, the deputy called dispatch and requested a canine sniffer, a drug-trained dog, to run around the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Deputy Ryan found a BlackBerry Curve cell phone in the vehicle\u2019s center cup holder area. The BlackBerry Curve is a smart phone capable of receiving and sending e-mail and text messages and taking and storing photographs. It also provides Internet access and is essentially a small computer. Deputy Ryan picked up the BlackBerry and \u201cpressed a key to see if it was functional.\u201d He also thought he was going to find further evidence of drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The phone\u2019s screen showed a photograph of someone wearing a mask, a white smock, and camouflage baseball cap. The person was \u201cwielding two rifles in akimbo fashion.\u201d The hat in the photograph was \u201cremarkably similar\u201d to the hat that Reid was wearing when stopped that night and the person in the photograph and Reid were both \u201clarger in stature, more full body <em>[sic].\u201d </em>Deputy Ryan believed the individual in the photograph holding the rifles was Reid.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The deputy immediately became concerned about terrorism or violence. Based on his training and experience and the characteristics of the rifles observable in the photograph, Deputy Ryan identified them as real AR-15 style assault rifles, which are a semiautomatic version of the Ml6. AR-15 rifles are very difficult to obtain legally in California. When the assault weapon ban was enacted in California, there was a window period during which owners of assault weapons previously purchased legally under California law could register their weapons. Otherwise, only law enforcement and military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>personnel may generally register assault weapons in California. But in Nevada, it is legal to rent and shoot fully automatic weapons. Reid denied owning any assault rifles.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Based on the cell phone\u2019s \u201cwallpaper\u201d photograph, Deputy Ryan believed that \u201cthe cell phone would have evidence of possibly gun-related crimes,\u201d such as discussions related to obtaining, trafficking or selling illegal weaponry. Since he knew that cell phones are a common means of communication between drug users and sellers and he had found footers in the vehicle, he also believed that the cell phone would contain further evidence of drug use, drug transactions, and drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Deputy Ryan handed the cell phone to Deputy Gonzales. At that juncture, only about 10 minutes had elapsed since arresting defendant Reid and starting the search of the vehicle. Sergeant Carney arrived on scene about seven to 10 minutes after the handgun was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Deputy Gonzales looked through the cell phone\u2019s text messages, photographs and e-mails for about 10 minutes. Deputy Gonzales found many photographs of different firearms. At the scene, Deputy Ryan was shown five text messages, two photographs of guns, and an e-mail. The text messages related to marijuana cultivation. There was an e-mail receipt from gunbroker.net for \u201cthe purchase of incendiary projectiles for 50 BMG caliber.\u201d Incendiary projectiles contain highly flammable material that may set an object on fire upon impact. They are illegal in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In the probable cause form that Deputy Ryan completed at the scene, he stated that he believed Reid was potentially under the influence of a stimulant. At 3:17 a.m. on December 6, 2009, Deputy Ryan called for a tow truck. Someone from a towing company arrived and towed the Acura.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Deputy Ryan transported Reid to Dominican Hospital ER, where he obtained a urine sample from Reid. The deputy tested the sample and the result showed a \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d for \u201cTHC usage, marijuana, and opiates.\u201d The drug test results showed that Reid was not under the influence of stimulants. In his Health and Safety Code section 11550 arrest report, which the deputy completed after the drug test, he stated that he thought that Reid had used opiates. At the suppression hearing, Deputy Ryan conceded that the standard investigation of a person suspected of being under the influence involves field tests and then a blood or a urine test.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Subsequently, Deputy Ryan sought and obtained a search warrant to search Reid\u2019s cell phone. Based upon the additional information obtained from the cell phone, a search warrant for his residence was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>At the suppression hearing, the magistrate decided to initially focus on the evidence relevant to the validity of the traffic stop and warrantless searches of the vehicle and cell phone and resolve those issues first.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">2. <em>Ruling on Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The prosecutor contended that the traffic stop, detention, and arrest were reasonable. As to the vehicle search, she argued that Deputy Ryan was entitled, under <em>Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. 332 [129 S.Ct. 1710], to search Reid\u2019s car for evidence relevant to the arrest for violating Health and Safety Code section 11550. The prosecutor maintained that opening the BlackBerry cell phone was permissible under <em>U.S. v. Finley </em>(5th Cir. 2007) <em>477 </em>F.3d 250.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pointing to the deputy\u2019s testimony that drug purchasers commonly arrange drug buys through cell phone text messaging, the prosecutor argued that the deputies lawfully turned on and searched Reid\u2019s cell phone incident to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The magistrate determined that Deputy Ryan\u2019s observations justified the traffic stop and Reid\u2019s detention based on the violation of the posted speed limit. He concluded that Deputy Ryan lawfully arrested Reid for violating Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a), and Vehicle Code section 12500, subdivision (a), based upon his observations and his examinations of Reid and his training and experience. He further determined that Deputy Ryan properly decided to impound the Acura since defendant Reid had an expired driver\u2019s license, Reid was under the influence of a controlled substance, the passenger was unable to drive safely, the vehicle was \u201cfairly expensive,\u201d and the location of the stop made it a possible target of theft and vandalism. The magistrate then concluded that the reasonable impoundment justified a warrantless inventory search of the vehicle pursuant to standardized procedure. The inventory search justified the discovery of the loaded handgun, the two footers, and the cell phone. But the magistrate concluded that the circumstances did not justify the opening and searching of the BlackBerry by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The magistrate found that the search of the BlackBerry was \u201can intentional act by the deputy in seeking further evidence of any crimes.\u201d He explained his grant of the motion to suppress: \u201cI think there was an expectation of privacy that the defendant had for his Blackberry, that there were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>sufficient grounds to authorize the deputy to open that Blackberry up and, therefore, anything that was discovered as a result of that activity would be suppressed . . . .\u201d Although the magistrate stated that \u201c[t]he cell phone had nothing to do with the crimes in <em>[sic] </em>which he was arrested,\u201d he did not state that he disbelieved Deputy Ryan\u2019s testimony regarding the use of cell phones by drug users to arrange drug buys. The magistrate concluded: \u201cAs a result of the Blackberry being opened up a search warrant was secured of the defendant\u2019s home, the four structures as indicated in that affidavit. . . . [T]hat search warrant would be invalid as a result of this Court\u2019s finding today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The magistrate did not reach the remaining Fourth Amendment issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">C. <em>Search of Vehicle and Cell Phone</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On appeal, the People agree with the magistrate\u2019s determinations that the vehicle stop and arrest of Reid were lawful and the ensuing search of the vehicle was justified as an inventory search. They argue that the vehicle search was also lawful as a search incident to arrest because it was reasonable to believe- that narcotics and drug paraphernalia relevant to Reid\u2019s arrest for being under the influence might be found in the vehicle. The People also maintain that it was reasonable to believe that the cell phone might provide evidence of the offense of being under the influence. They urge us to find that the magistrate erred in suppressing the evidence derived from searching Reid\u2019s cell phone and the superior court erred in denying the People\u2019s motions to reinstate the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">1. <em>Review of Suppression Ruling on Review of Motions to Reinstate Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u201cIn a proceeding under Penal Code section 871.5 to reinstate a complaint, the superior court sits as a reviewing court and is bound by the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Slaughter </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 629, 633 [200 Cal.Rptr. 448, 677 P.2d 854].)\u201d <em>(People v. Rosales </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 325, 329 [259 Cal.Rptr. 503].) The only ground for a motion for reinstatement of a complaint is that \u201cas a matter of law, the magistrate erroneously dismissed the action or a portion thereof.\u201d (\u00a7 871.5, subd. (b).) \u201cIn determining whether to compel reinstatement of a complaint dismissed after the granting of a defendant\u2019s suppression motion by the magistrate at a preliminary hearing, the superior court reviews the legal soundness of the magistrate\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion [citations] based on \u2018the record of the proceedings before the magistrate\u2019 (\u00a7 871.5, subd.

In <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 364 [49 L.Ed.2d 1000, 96 S.Ct. 3092], the Supreme Court held that \u201ca routine inventory search of an automobile lawfully impounded by police for violations of municipal parking ordinances,\u201d consistent with \u201cstandard police procedures,\u201d was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>(Opperman, </em>at pp. 365, 372-376 [upholding search of glove compartment]; cf. <em>Illinois v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>Lafayette </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 640, 648 [77 L.Ed.2d 65, 103 S.Ct. 2605] [holding that \u201cit is not \u2018unreasonable\u2019 for police, as part of the routine procedure incident to incarcerating an arrested person, to search any container or article in his possession, in accordance with established inventory procedures\u201d].) The court has made clear that \u201creasonable police regulations relating to inventory procedures administered in good faith satisfy the Fourth Amendment, even though courts might as a matter of hindsight be able to devise equally reasonable rules requiring a different procedure.\u201d <em>(Colorado v.

The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cview that standardized criteria [citation] or established routine [citation] must regulate the opening of containers found during inventory searches is based on the principle that an inventory search must not be a ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence.\u201d <em>(Florida v. Wells </em>(1990) 495 U.S. 1, 4 [109 L.Ed.2d 1, 110 S.Ct. 1632].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">While \u201c[t]he policy or practice governing inventory searches should be designed to produce an inventory\u201d <em>(Florida v.

But there was no evidence that this step or the subsequent search of the cell phone was taken in accordance with any standardized policy or practice governing inventory searches. Consequently, neither the viewing of the opening screen nor the subsequent search of the cell phone\u2019s contents could be considered valid as part of a lawful inventory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">3. <em>Search Incident to Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">a. <em>Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In <em>Chimel v.

The two justifications for the authority to search were officer safety and preservation of evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 763; see <em>Knowles v.

In <em>Robinson, </em>a police officer \u201ceffected a full-custody arrest\u201d after stopping a vehicle based upon probable cause to believe that the driver was operating a motor vehicle with a revoked operator\u2019s permit, and then searched the driver even though the officer did not suspect that the driver was armed. <em>(Robinson, supra, </em>414 U.S. at p. 221, fn. omitted; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 220-223, 236.) The Supreme Court explained its holding: \u201cA police officer\u2019s determination as to how and where to search the person of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quick <em>ad hoc </em>judgment . . .\u201d and \u201c[t]he authority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.\u201d <em>(Robinson, supra, </em>414 U.S. at p. 235.) \u201c[T]he absence of probable fruits or further evidence of the particular crime for which the arrest is made\u201d did not narrow the scope of the search incident to arrest. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 234.) The court held: \u201cA custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification. . . . [I]n the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 235.) Under these principles, the arresting officer was entitled to search the driver, examine the crumpled cigarette package found in his pocket, and to seize the heroin capsules found inside. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 223, 236; see <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 260, 266 [38 L.Ed.2d 456, 94 S.Ct. 488] [upon custodial arrest for driving automobile without possession of a valid operator\u2019s license, police officer was entitled to search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>arrestee\u2019s person incident to arrest, inspect box of cigarettes found in the arrestee\u2019s pocket, and seize the homemade cigarettes that the officer believed contained marijuana].)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In <em>New York v.

The court determined that \u201cthe area within the immediate control of the arrestee\u201d in the vehicular context was the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment. <em>(Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 460.) It stated the rule that \u201cwhen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fhs. omitted.) It also established the corollary rule \u201cthat the police may also examine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment, for if the passenger compartment is within reach of the arrestee, so also will containers in it be within his reach. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 460-461, fn. omitted.) The court explained that the word \u201ccontainer\u201d \u201cdenote[d] any object capable of holding another object\u201d and its \u201cholding encompasse[d] only the interior of the passenger compartment of an automobile and [did] not encompass the trunk.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 461, fn. 4.) The court clarified that \u201c[s]uch a container may, of course, be searched whether it is open or closed, since the justification for the search is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em>Thornton v.

It stated \u201c[t]he safety and evidentiary justifications underlying Chimel\u2019s reaching-distance rule determine <em>Belton\u2019s </em>scope\u201d and it made clear that <em>\u201cBelton </em>does not authorize a vehicle search incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest after the arrestee has been secured and cannot access the interior of the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 335 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1714].) Consequently, <em>Belton </em>did not authorize a vehicular search of Gant\u2019s car since he was handcuffed and \u201clocked in the back of a patrol car\u201d when \u201cpolice officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The Supreme Court proceeded to recognize an alternative justification permitting vehicular searches incident to arrest even if an arrestee was secured in custody: \u201cAlthough it does not follow from <em>Chimel, </em>we also conclude that circumstances unique to the vehicle context justify a search incident to a lawful arrest when it is \u2018reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u2019 <em>Thornton, </em>541 U.S., at 632, 124 S.Ct. 2127 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 343 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719]; see <em>id. </em>at p. 335 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1714].) The court declared that this new rule was \u201c[c]onsistent with the holding in <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>541 U.S. 615 [158 L.Ed.2d 905, 124 S.Ct. 2127] (2004), and follow[ed] the suggestion in Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion concurring in the judgment in that case, <em>id., </em>at 632 [124 S.Ct. 2127] . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 335 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1714].)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In his separate opinion in <em>Thornton, </em>Justice Scalia had stated: \u201cIf <em>Belton </em>searches are justifiable, it is not because the arrestee might grab a weapon or evidentiary item from his car, but simply because the car might contain evidence relevant to the crime for which he was arrested.\u201d <em>(Thornton, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 629 (conc. opn. of Scalia, J.).) Justice Scalia recognized the government\u2019s general interest in gathering evidence related to the crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>arrest and reasoned: \u201cThere is nothing irrational about broader police authority to search for evidence when and where the perpetrator of a crime is lawfully arrested. The fact of prior lawful arrest distinguishes the arrestee from society at large, and distinguishes a search for evidence of <em>his </em>crime from general rummaging. Moreover, it is not illogical to assume that evidence of a crime is most likely to be found where the suspect was apprehended.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 630 (cone. opn. of Scalia, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">As to application of the newly articulated justification for a vehicular search incident to arrest, the Supreme Court in <em>Gant </em>explained: \u201cIn many cases, as when a recent occupant is arrested for a traffic violation, there will be no reasonable basis to believe the vehicle contains relevant evidence. See, <em>e.g., Atwater </em>v. <em>Lago </em>Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 324 [149 L.Ed.2d 549, 121 S.Ct. 1536] (2001); <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Iowa[, supra,] </em>525 U.S. 113, 118 [142 L.Ed.2d 492, 119 S.Ct. 484] .... But in others, including <em>Belton </em>and <em>Thornton, </em>the offense of arrest will supply a basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle and any containers therein.\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at pp. 343-344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].) In the <em>Gant </em>case \u201c[n]either the possibility of access nor the likelihood of discovering offense-related evidence authorized the search . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].) The offense for which Gant was arrested, driving with a suspended license, was \u201can offense for which police could not expect to find evidence in the passenger compartment of Gant\u2019s car. Cf. <em>Knowles, </em>525 U.S., at 118 [119 S.Ct. 484].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 335, 344 [129 S.Ct. at pp. 1714, 1719].) The court concluded that \u201c[b]ecause police could not reasonably have believed either that Gant could have accessed his car at the time of the search or that evidence of the offense for which he was arrested might have been found therein, the search . . . was unreasonable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><em>Gant </em>made clear that when neither of the two announced justifications for a vehicular search incident to arrest is present, \u201ca search of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle will be unreasonable unless police obtain a warrant or show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies.\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 351 [129 S.Ct. at pp. 1723-1724].)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">b. <em>Search of Vehicle Driven by Respondent Reid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In this case, the <em>Belton </em>safety and preservation of destructible evidence rationales were certainly not applicable since Reid was handcuffed and secured in a patrol car before any vehicular search occurred. As in <em>Gant, </em>there was no reasonable basis to believe that evidence, relevant to Reid\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>arrest for driving with an expired license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500, subdivision (a), might be found in the vehicle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">While we recognize that <em>Gant </em>was not entirely consistent in its language, the court explicitly held that a vehicular search incident to arrest is valid when \u201cit is reasonable to believe that evidence of the offense of arrest might be found in the vehicle\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 335 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1714]) or when \u201cit is \u2018reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (556 U.S. at p. 343 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].) Thus, the threshold issue is whether it was reasonable to believe that evidence relevant to Reid\u2019s crime of arrest for being under the influence of a controlled substance in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a), <em>might </em>be found in the interior of the Acura.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In both <em>Belton </em>and <em>Thornton, </em>the crime of arrest was possession of a controlled substance. <em>(Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 456 [arrest for unlawful possession of marijuana]; <em>Thornton, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 618 [arrest for unlawful possession of marijuana and crack cocaine].) In <em>Gant, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the offense of arrest in <em>Belton </em>and in <em>Thornton </em>supplied \u201ca basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle and any containers therein.\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].) The arrest offense of being under the influence in this case is likewise a drug crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Respondents attempt to distinguish <em>Belton </em>and <em>Thornton </em>on the ground that the police in those cases found illegal drugs before conducting the vehicle search incident to arrest. Citing two federal district court cases, respondents maintain that it was not reasonable to believe the vehicle might contain evidence relevant to being under the influence of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In <em>U.S. v. Reagan </em>(2010) 713 F.Supp.2d 724, a court concluded that a national park ranger\u2019s warrantless search of a vehicle incident to the arrest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the driver for DUI was unlawful. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 734.) The court found that it was \u201cnot reasonable to believe that evidence of DUI is inside the passenger compartment of a vehicle based solely upon the nature of the charge or the existence of evidence that the vehicle\u2019s driver is intoxicated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 733.) It gave examples of particular facts that could give rise to \u201ca particularized and articulable reason to believe\u201d that the passenger compartment of a vehicle contains evidence of a DUI offense: \u201cobservations of the driver drinking while driving, observations of an open container of alcohol in plain view inside the passenger compartment, statements made by the occupants of the vehicle indicating that an open container is in the passenger compartment, the smell of alcohol emanating from within the passenger compartment, or indications that the driver was traveling from a location such as a recreational area or campground where alcohol is not available unless it is transported in by private vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 733 &amp; fn. 7.) Even though the ranger testified that he \u201csometimes discovered open containers of alcohol when searching some vehicles following the arrest of their drivers for DUI,\u201d this reason was not \u201cparticularized to the Defendant or the circumstances of this case\u201d and the ranger\u2019s \u201cgeneral prior experience alone was not enough to establish a reasonable belief that evidence of DUI was contained within the Defendant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 733-734.) The court acknowledged, however, that other courts had \u201cindicated that DUI is an offense that, by its very nature, might yield physical evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 732, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In <em>U.S. v. Grote </em>(2009) 629 F.Supp.2d 1201, the court determined that it was reasonable to believe that evidence relevant to the crime of arrest, DUI, might be found in the driver\u2019s vehicle where an officer, during the initial contact with the arrestee, observed, from outside the vehicle, \u201ca brown paper bag wrapped around a bottle\u201d located next to the driver. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1203-1204.) The bottle \u201cappeared to be a bottle of alcohol since liquor stores typically put such bottles in brown paper bags.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1204, fn. omitted.) The subsequent search of the vehicle revealed that the bag contained \u201ca full, unopened bottle of vodka\u201d and uncovered \u201ca loaded handgun and some blasting caps.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The court expressed its hesitation \u201cto hold that a lawful arrest for DUI will always justify a search of a vehicle incident to arrest on the assumption it will always be reasonable to believe that evidence of DUI will be found in the vehicle\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Grote, supra, </em>629 F.Supp.2d at p. 1204). It concluded that, under the particular factual circumstances of the case, the search of the vehicle was a valid warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest under <em>Gant. (Id. </em>at pp. 1205-1206.) The court recognized, however, that an open bottle of vodka can be \u201cpotential corroborative evidence of DUI,\u201d \u201cpotentially corroborates that an individual was operating a motor vehicle in an intoxicated physical condition,\u201d and \u201carguably\u201d constitutes \u201cevidence of recent alcohol consumption.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Although these federal district courts were focused on the particularized facts, nothing in <em>Gant </em>suggests that the Supreme Court was adopting a fact-intensive test similar to the reasonable suspicion standard established by <em>Terry v.

The Supreme Court in <em>Gant </em>indicated that the nature of the crime of arrest was determinative and, in some cases, \u201cthe offense of arrest will supply a basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle and any containers therein\u201d while, in other cases, the offense of arrest would not provide any \u201creasonable basis to believe the vehicle contains relevant evidence.

When a driver is arrested for being under the influence of a controlled substance, the officers could reasonably believe that evidence relevant to that <em>offense </em>might be found in the vehicle.

They also assert that \u201c[a] cellular phone is a container which might hold relevant evidence of drug-related activity.\u201d They point to Deputy Ryan\u2019s general testimony regarding drug users\u2019 use of cell phones and contend that the deputy \u201chad sufficient reason to believe that [Reid\u2019s] cellular phone might provide evidence of the offense for which he had been arrested.\u201d Respondents counter that, even if the vehicle search was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>justified as a search incident to arrest, search of the cell phone was not justified because \u201cthe cell phone was neither an item immediately associated with the person of the arrestee <em>(People v. Diaz </em>[(2011)] 51 Cal.4th [84,] 93 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 105, 244 P.3d 501]) nor a container that was likely to contain evidence of the offense of arrest <em>(Arizona v. Gant, supra, </em>129 S.Ct. at p. 1719).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We must immediately dispel any misconception that <em>Gant </em>limits the scope of a vehicular search incident to arrest in the situation where \u201cit is reasonable to believe that evidence of the offense of arrest <em>might </em>be found in the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, 556 </em>U.S. at p. 335 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1714], italics added; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 343-344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].) A close reading of <em>Gant </em>makes clear that warrantless vehicular searches are authorized in only two situations but, if authorized, the scope of vehicular searches incident to arrest as established by <em>Belton </em>is unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">After <em>Gant, </em>the fact that a recent occupant or occupant of a vehicle is arrested is not a sufficient basis for searching the vehicle incident to that arrest. <em>Gant </em>establishes the additional precondition that either (1) the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the vehicle or (2) there is a reasonable basis for believing the vehicle might contain evidence relevant to the offense of arrest. <em>(Gant, supra, 556 </em>U.S. at pp. 335, 343, 346-347 [129 S.Ct. at pp. 1714, 1719, 1721].) In either of these situations, <em>Gant </em>provides the generalized authority to search the entire passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein incident to arrest. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].) <em>Gant </em>implicitly determined that these requirements were sufficient to ensure that vehicular searches incident to arrest were tethered to legitimate governmental interests related to arrest and adequately addressed \u201cthe central concern underlying the Fourth Amendment\u201d that police officers not have \u201cunbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person\u2019s private effects.\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 345 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1720].) Consequently, having determined that a vehicular search incident to arrest was justified because evidence relevant to the offense of being under the influence might be found in Reid\u2019s vehicle, the deputies were justified in searching the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment and \u201cany containers therein.\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, 556 </em>U.S. at pp. 343-344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Although respondents acknowledge that <em>Gant </em>indicated \u201cthe offense of arrest will supply a basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle and <em>any containers </em>therein\u201d in drug offense cases <em>(Gant, supra, 556 </em>U.S. at p. 344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719], italics added), they argue that \u201cin order to retain the integrity of the <em>Gant </em>rationale, the police may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>search only any container that is reasonably likely to contain relevant evidence of the offense.\u201d They contend that, otherwise, a search of a container would be inconsistent with <em>Ganf </em>s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We reject respondents\u2019 assertion that there must be specific, articulable facts \u201cindicating that the cell phone held relevant evidence of the offenses for which Reid Nottoli was arrested.\u201d Respondents cannot point to any language in <em>Gant </em>imposing such a requirement. Under <em>Gant, </em>a vehicular search incident to arrest is justified \u201cwhen it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the offense of arrest might be found in the <em>vehicle.\u201d (Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 335 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1714], italics added.) It does not require any degree of probability that evidence bearing on that offense will be found in a particular container that is searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In both <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Belton, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the authority to search incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based on the need to disarm and preserve evidence, did not depend on the probability that weapons or evidence would actually be found. <em>(Robinson, supra, </em>414 U.S. at pp. 234\u2014235; <em>Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at pp. 460-461.) In <em>Robinson, </em>the offense of arrest was driving with a revoked permit <em>(Robinson supra, </em>414 U.S. at p. 220) and there was no reason to believe that evidence relevant to that offense would be found in the crumpled cigarette package found on the arrestee. In <em>Belton, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that it was true that \u201ccontainers will sometimes be such that they could hold neither a weapon nor evidence of the criminal conduct for which the suspect was arrested.\u201d <em>(Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 461.) In <em>Gant, </em>the Supreme Court was cognizant that <em>Belton </em>\u201cauthorize[d] police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse, briefcase, or other container within that space\u201d <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 345 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1720]; see <em>Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at pp. 460-461). <em>Gant </em>certainly did not create different rules governing the scope of vehicular searches incident to arrest, the application of which depended upon the underlying justification in each particular case. Neither did <em>Gant </em>suggest that different rules applied to searches of containers, which turned upon whether a person or a vehicle was being searched incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We find no support for respondents\u2019 assertion that <em>Gant </em>narrowed the scope of vehicular searches incident to arrest, under the \u201cevidence relevant to the crime of arrest\u201d justification, to those \u201cplaces and containers that \u2018may conceal the object of the search.\u2019 <em>(United States v. Ross </em>[(1982)] 456 U.S. [798,] 825 [72 L.Ed.2d 572, 102 S.Ct. 2157].)\u201d Respondents point to <em>Gant\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>statement that <em>\u201cRoss </em>allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest, and the scope of the search authorized is broader\u201d than a vehicle search incident to arrest. <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 347 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1721].) The \u201cbroader\u201d scope of a vehicle search pursuant to the automobile exception refers to the fact, mentioned in the previous sentence, that <em>Ross </em>\u201cauthorizes a search of <em>any area of the vehicle </em>in which the evidence might be found.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) <em>Belton, </em>on the other hand, authorizes only a search of a vehicle\u2019s <em>passenger compartment </em>incident to arrest. <em>(Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 460.) This limitation is impliedly continued by <em>Gant. </em>(See <em>Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at p. 344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719] [in certain cases, \u201cthe offense of arrest will supply a basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle and any containers therein\u201d].) <em>Gant </em>did not adopt a narrower but duplicative version of the automobile exception. While <em>Gant </em>rejected an overly broad reading of <em>Belton, </em>it did not turn 180 degrees away from the \u201cbright-line\u201d rule of <em>Belton </em>and compel a finely tuned, fact-intensive assessment with respect to every container.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Moreover, even if <em>Gant </em>were construed to require a factual predicate for searching each object found in a vehicle searched incident to arrest, a proposition we reject, it was reasonable for Deputy Ryan to believe, based on the objective circumstances and his training and experience, that evidence relevant to Reid\u2019s offense of arrest for being under the influence <em>might </em>be found on Reid\u2019s cell phone. The deputy testified that, in his experience, drug users and sellers use cell phones as their \u201cmain communication\u201d and cell phones can contain text messages related to acquiring and offering drugs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, as suggested by the People, text messages saved in Reid\u2019s cell phone might have identified the controlled substance or contained his admissions \u201cas to what he had done that night.\u201d This would be corroborative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In ruling on the suppression motion, the magistrate erroneously focused on the deputy\u2019s subjective intentions to search for evidence of any crimes and Reid\u2019s expectation of privacy in his BlackBerry. Neither determines the applicability or scope of the warrant exception for vehicular searches incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Even if Deputies Ryan and Gonzales were searching for evidence of any crime in the vehicle and cell phone, their subjective intentions or motives did not invalidate actions that were objectively justifiable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Whren v. United States </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 806, 812, 813 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>[135 L.Ed.2d 89, 116 S.Ct. 1769] [\u201cSubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\u201d].) \u201cAn action is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed <em>objectively, </em>justify [the] action.\u2019 <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, 436 </em>U.S. 128, 138 [56 L.Ed.2d 168, 98 S.Ct. 1717] (1978) (emphasis added). The officer\u2019s subjective motivation is irrelevant. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brigham City v. Stuart </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 398, 404 [164 L.Ed.2d 650, 126 S.Ct. 1943] [regardless of police officers\u2019 subjective motives, circumstances justified warrantless entry of home under exigent circumstances exception to warrant requirement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In addition, even though a motorist\u2019s privacy interest in his vehicle was one of the Supreme Court\u2019s considerations in rejecting an overly broad reading of <em>Belton </em>(see <em>Gant, </em>556 U.S. at pp. 344-345 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1720]), nothing in <em>Gant </em>suggests that an arrestee\u2019s privacy expectations in particular objects affect the scope of vehicular searches incident to the arrest. As stated in <em>Belton, </em>\u201cthe justification for the search [(incident to arrest)] is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have.\u201d <em>(Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 461.) The California Supreme Court recently observed in <em>People v. Diaz, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th 84 <em>(Diaz) </em>that <em>Gant </em>\u201creaffirmed <em>Belton's </em>holding that whether a particular container may be searched does not depend on its character or the extent of the arrestee\u2019s expectation of privacy in it. <em>(Gant, </em>556 U.S. at pp. 344-345 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1720] [in permissible warrantless search, police may search \u2018every purse, briefcase, or other container within\u2019 the car\u2019s passenger compartment].)\u201d <em>(Diaz, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th at p. 96, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Respondents assert that \u201cthe issue of whether a cell phone should be distinguished from traditional containers due to its capacity for storage of digital information is not yet settled\u201d and that a cell phone is not a container within the meaning of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions. In <em>Diaz, </em>the California Supreme Court rejected the arguments that the nature or character of a cell phone, its capacity for storing personal data, or the arrestee\u2019s expectation of privacy in its contents required courts to treat the arrestee\u2019s cell phone found on him differently from other types of personal effects or containers that may be validly searched incident to arrest. (See <em>Diaz, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th at pp. 94-101.) We discern no principled reason to distinguish between a cell phone found on an arrestee\u2019s person during a search incident to arrest and a cell phone found in a passenger compartment during a vehicular search incident to arrest. Respondents acknowledge that this court is bound by <em>Diaz. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) They explain their reasons for believing <em>Diaz </em>was wrongly decided in order to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The People also argue that a cell phone is a special case. The People contend that the information held in cell phones is transient and the warrant-less search of the cell phone was justified by the government\u2019s interest in preserving evidence. Under <em>Gant, </em>the transitory nature of the contents of a cell phone found in a vehicle does not provide any additional authority to search a cell phone found in a vehicle. The recognized governmental interest in preserving destructible evidence at the time of arrest relates only to the protection of evidence from an arrestee who might otherwise conceal or destroy such evidence. (See <em>Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at pp. 338-339 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1716].) <em>Gant </em>expressly concluded that this interest is inapplicable when an arrestee cannot possibly access the vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 341-344 [129 S.Ct. at pp. 1718-1719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In sum, it is our conclusion that, after Reid was arrested for being under the influence, it was reasonable to believe that evidence relevant to that offense might be found in his vehicle. Consequently, the deputies had unqualified authority under <em>Gant </em>to search the passenger compartment of the vehicle and any container found therein <em>(Gant, supra, </em>556 U.S. at pp. 343-344 [129 S.Ct. at p. 1719]), including Reid\u2019s cell phone. It is up to the United States Supreme Court to impose any greater limits on officers\u2019 authority to search incident to arrest. (See <em>Oregon v. Hass </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 714, 719 [43 L.Ed.2d 570, 95 S.Ct. 1215] [a state court may not impose \u201cgreater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional law when [the United States Supreme Court] specifically refrains from imposing them\u201d (italics omitted)]; <em>People v.

After the court indicated those facts were not at issue, the prosecutor asked if she could excuse the witness. On appeal, the People now argue that, <em>if </em>\u201cthe scope of the deputy\u2019s intrusion into the cellular phone\u2019s contents is found relevant and material to the legality of the phone\u2019s search, ... the magistrate erred in precluding the People from presenting [his] testimony . . . .\u201d Since the scope or duration of Deputy Gonzales\u2019s search of the cell phone\u2019s contents is not relevant to our analysis, we need not address this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>5. <em>Standing and Reasonable Expectation of Privacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The People argue that, to assert the frait-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine based upon the initial search of respondent Reid\u2019s cell phone, respondent Barry \u201cneeded to show that he had a personal and reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the phone.\u201d (See <em>Wong Sun v. United States </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 471, 492 [9 L.Ed.2d 441, 83 S.Ct. 407] [\u201cseizure of this heroin invaded no right of privacy of person or premises which would entitle Wong Sun to object. . .\u201d].) They also assert that respondent Barry \u201cfailed to present sufficient proof to meet his burden of establishing standing to object to the cellular phone search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The People initially contended that, \u201c[although [they] have found no California case authority directly on point, ... a defendant\u2019s burden of proving a personal, reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched cannot be waived by the People\u2019s silence.\u201d In their reply brief, they concede that respondents found several cases indicating that standing issues are forfeited if not timely raised in the suppression motion, which they admittedly did not do. The first time that the People raised Barry\u2019s standing to challenge the search of his son Reid\u2019s cell phone was in their written argument in support of their motion to reinstate the complaint in case No. F18756.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">To claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must ordinarily demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched.
