(Apple), is one of the world\u2019s largest multinational corporations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is incorporated in California and has its principal place of business in this state, but operates worldwide as the parent of a number of wholly owned foreign subsidiary corporations. Apple and its subsidiaries design, manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sell a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">At issue in this tax refund action is the California tax treatment of repatriated dividends paid to Apple from certain of its subsidiaries in its 1989 tax year. More specifically, the issue is the appropriate method to account for the source from which repatriated dividends are paid, and which of two competing methods is more consistent with the provisions of our tax code that seek to ensure that foreign subsidiary income is appropriately taxed\u2014but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>only once. Also in dispute is an interest deduction taken by Apple in its 1989 tax year, but disallowed by California\u2019s Franchise Tax Board (FTB).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Apple argued that FTB improperly subjected it to double taxation when it applied a last-in-first-out (LIFO) proration of its income, treating the dividends as paid first from the current year\u2019s earnings, and only then from the most recent prior years\u2019 earnings on a year-by-year basis. Apple contends that Revenue and Taxation Code section 25106,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as interpreted by this district in <em>Fujitsu IT Holdings, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 459 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 473] <em>(Fujitsu), </em>requires that such dividends instead be subject to \u201cpreferential ordering\u201d and be deemed to be paid first out of income already taxed in prior years, and thus eliminated entirely from the recipient\u2019s income subject to California tax. Apple also argued that FTB improperly disallowed an interest expense deduction on its domestic borrowing, which FTB allocated in part to nontaxable dividends repatriated in the 1989 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Following a nonjury trial, presented largely on stipulated facts, the trial court ruled against Apple on the dividend ordering issue, but in Apple\u2019s favor on the disputed interest deduction. As a result, it ordered that a refund be paid to Apple in the amount of $920,482.80 plus interest\u2014the full amount sought by Apple in its complaint. Apple subsequently moved for an award of its attorney fees under section 19717, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, finding the position taken by FTB was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Apple appeals the court\u2019s adverse ruling on the application of section 25106. FTB cross-appeals, challenging the determination on the interest deduction and the refund order. We have also consolidated Apple\u2019s separate appeal from the court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorney fees. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">As our Supreme Court has observed, \u201cOurs is a global economy. In contrast, government and the taxing authority used to fund it are national and local. This geographic disparity generates difficulties when each jurisdiction seeks its piece of the economic pie, a pie generated by economic activity that knows no borders.\u201d <em>(Microsoft Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 750, 754 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 216, 139 P.3d 1169] <em>(Microsoft).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">At the federal level, a United States corporation is taxed on all of its income whether it is earned inside or outside of the United States. To deter United States taxpayers from using related foreign companies to accumulate earnings offshore, the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.; hereafter IRC) requires that a United States entity include in current taxable income, as a constructive dividend, a portion of the United States entity\u2019s share of the controlled foreign company\u2019s current income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (IRC, \u00a7\u00a7 951-965; <em>Koehring Co. </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(7th Cir. 1978) 583 F.2d 313, 317.) California instead focuses on dividends \u201cpaid,\u201d and takes intercompany dividends into account for tax purposes at the time that they are distributed. (\u00a7 25106.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\n<em>California Taxation of Unitary Business Enterprises</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">California imposes a franchise tax on corporations doing business within the state on the corporation\u2019s net income derived from or attributable to sources within California. (\u00a7 25101.) When a corporation, and its affiliated corporations, conduct business both within and outside the state as part of a larger unitary business enterprise, it becomes necessary to determine how much of the income of the unitary business is attributable to sources within California.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">California has adopted the unitary business principle to determine the portion of a corporate taxpayer\u2019s total income that is attributable to this state for California franchise and income tax purposes. <em>(Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 159, 162-163 [77 L.Ed.2d 545, 103 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>2933].) A unitary business is one that receives income \u201cfrom or attributable to sources both within and without the state . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 25101.) \u201cA unitary business is generally defined as two or more business entities that are commonly owned and integrated in a way that transfers value among the affiliated entities.\u201d <em>(Citicorp North America, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1411, fn. 5 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 509].) \u201cA unitary business has been judicially defined as one in which the following factors are present: (1) unity of ownership; (2) unity of operations, as evidenced by central accounting, purchasing, advertising, and management divisions; and (3) unity of use in a centralized executive force and general system of operation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at pp. 468-469.) Apple agrees that it operated as a unitary business in the relevant tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Under the unitary business principle, an affiliated group of corporations under common control or ownership is viewed as a whole or a single unit. A taxpayer that is engaged in a unitary business generally determines its tax based upon a worldwide combined report, which includes the income of all domestic and foreign members (e.g., corporate affiliates and subsidiaries) of the unitary business. A formula is applied \u201c \u2018apportioning the total income of that \u201cunitary business\u201d between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of the world[,] . . . taking into account objective measures of the corporation\u2019s activities within and without the jurisdiction.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Microsoft, <em>supra, 39 </em>Cal.4th at p. 756.) \u201c[T]axes are apportioned based on property, payroll, and sales to allocate to California for taxation \u2018its fair share of the taxable values of the taxpayer . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Effective January 1, 1988, taxpayers that constituted a unitary business were allowed to choose a \u201cwater\u2019 s-edge election\u201d combined report that includes the income of domestic entities and only a portion of the income of certain controlled foreign subsidiaries (controlled foreign corporations; CFC\u2019s).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 25110, 25111.) A CFC that is partially included in the water\u2019sedge report has two kinds of earnings: (1) \u201cexcluded income\u201d (i.e., income not included in the unitary group\u2019s combined report) and (2) \u201cincluded income\u201d (i.e., income included in the unitary group\u2019s combined report). An \u201cinclusion ratio\u201d is provided by section 25110<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to determine the portion of the income and apportionment factors of the CFC that must be included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the water\u2019s-edge group\u2019s combined report. The \u201cinclusion ratio\u201d is a fraction, the numerator of which is the \u201cSubpart F income\u201d of the CFC and the denominator of which is the entire earnings and profits of the CFC for that taxable year. \u201cSubpart F income\u201d gets its name from subpart F of the IRC (IRC, \u00a7\u00a7 951-965). <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 469.) It expressly includes dividend income. California has chosen to measure Subpart F income by incorporating the federal definition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 477.) A CFC\u2019s net income is multiplied by its inclusion ratio to arrive at the CFC\u2019s income that is to be included in the water\u2019s-edge group\u2019s combined report. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\n<em>Apple\u2019s California Tax Filings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Through the taxable year ending September 30, 1988, Apple filed its California franchise tax returns on the basis of a worldwide combined report, which included Apple and all of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries that were engaged in a single unitary business. During 1989 and prior tax years, Apple owned 100 percent of the stock of Apple Computer Inc. Limited, incorporated in Ireland (ACL), which, in turn, owned 100 percent of the stock of two subsidiary corporations, Apple Computer International Limited, a United Kingdom company (ACIL), and AC Limited, incorporated in Ireland (AC Ltd.). During the 1989 tax year in question, ACIL owned 100 percent of the stock of Apple Computer Cayman Finance Limited (AC Cayman), a Cayman Islands company. Apple calculated its inclusion ratios under section 25110 for ACL at 9.6490 percent; for ACIL at 73.7722 percent; and for AC Ltd. at 1.4578 percent. Also included in Apple\u2019s worldwide combined report were Apple Computer Holding BY, Apple Australia, Apple Canada and Apple Computer A.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Beginning with the 1989 tax year, Apple made a water\u2019s-edge election and filed its California franchise tax return on the basis of a water\u2019s-edge combined report, which included all the income of its unitary domestic subsidiaries and the partial income of certain CFC\u2019s. In 1989, Apple had previously undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings of $698,778,366. It repatriated $86.6 million in dividends from its foreign operations. AC Cayman distributed a dividend of $11.4 million to ACIL, ACIL distributed a dividend of $45.1 million to ACL, AC Ltd. distributed a dividend of $2 million to ACL, and ACL distributed a dividend of $50 million to Apple. In addition, in the 1989 tax year, Apple received the following dividends from its other foreign subsidiaries: $10,440,309 from Apple Computer Holding BY; $8 million from Apple Australia; $18 million from Apple Canada; and $210,035 from Apple Computer A.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>In its tax filing, Apple applied preferential ordering to the dividends and took the position that the dividends were being paid from the CFC\u2019s retained earnings accrued over prior tax years. Since, it argued, California had already taxed the earnings out of which dividends were being paid, section 25106 allowed it to transfer the dividends without tax consequence. As a result, all of these dividends were either excluded from Apple\u2019s water\u2019s-edge combined report as nonbusiness income or treated as deductible items.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> FTB agrees that, if preferential ordering is required, nearly all of the dividend distributions would be eliminated from Apple\u2019s 1989 California taxable base.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Apple deducted $10,691,430 in interest expenses for its 1989 tax year. FTB disallowed $1,893,886 of this amount on the basis that, to the extent that the dividends paid by Apple\u2019s CFC\u2019s were paid out of excluded income, they were deductible as \u201cQualifying Dividends\u201d under section 24411.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> FTB made an allocation of Apple\u2019s domestic borrowing to its foreign subsidiary operations, and applied a formula under section 24344, subdivision (b) to reduce the allowable deduction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As we have noted, as a result of the subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>decision <em>Farmers Bros., supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th 976, FTB determined that the dividends should be deductible instead (at least for the 1989 tax year) under section 24402. Section 24402 provides that even in the absence of a unitary business, where the payor corporation was subject to California tax, the recipient corporation may deduct from its gross income dividends that were declared from income already included in the measure of California franchise tax imposed upon the payor corporation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The same allocated portion of the interest deduction was then disallowed under section 24425.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">FTB determined that Apple had underpaid its 1989 franchise tax liability and owed an additional $231,038 in tax for that tax year. With interest of $689,444.80, the total amount of FTB\u2019s assessment was $920,482.80. Apple paid this amount prior to filing the suit for refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\n<em>The Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On January 16, 2008, Apple filed its complaint against FTB in San Francisco Superior Court seeking a refund in the amount of $920,482.80, plus interest. A nonjury trial was held February 25 to 26, 2009 (before Judge Harold E. Kahn), presented largely on stipulated facts with limited live testimony. On January 26, 2010, the trial court issued its final statement of decision, ruling against Apple on the LIFO issue, and in favor of Apple on the section 24425 issue. An amended judgment was entered on February 22, 2010, granting Apple a tax refund in the amount of $920,482.80 plus interest. Apple filed its notice of appeal on March 29, 2010, and FTB filed its notice of cross-appeal on April 19, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\n<em>The Attorney Fees Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">On March 29, 2010, Apple filed its motion seeking an award of attorney fees. A hearing on the motion was held on April 26, 2010, and the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>issued an order denying Apple\u2019s motion for attorney fees on June 22, 2010. Apple filed and served a timely notice of appeal on the attorney fees issue on July 14, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">A. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">FTB first contends that Apple is precluded from appealing the court\u2019s adverse ruling on the distribution ordering issue because it succeeded in obtaining the full refund requested in its complaint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since Apple obtained a judgment in its favor, FTB insists that Apple is not a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d and therefore may not appeal the judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> see <em>Estate of Funkenstein </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 594, 595 [150 P. 987] [generally, a party in whose favor judgment is entered is not a party aggrieved.].) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Apple\u2019s notice of appeal states that it is appealing from \u201cthe portion of the judgment . . . which incorporates the [trial court\u2019s] ruling against [Apple] contained in the Final Statement of Decision (pp. 3-7) relating to the distribution ordering issue.\u201d FTB correctly notes that an appeal can only be taken from a final judgment, not from a statement of decision, and that Apple cannot appeal a portion of the trial court\u2019s statement of decision. <em>(Bailey v. County of El Dorado </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 94, 97-98 [210 Cal.Rptr. 237]; 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Judgment, \u00a7 10, p. 554 [an oral or written opinion by a trial judge \u201cmay be helpful ... in interpreting ambiguous or uncertain portions of the judgment\u201d but \u201cit is not itself ... a judgment\u201d].)  However, \u201c \u2018any party aggrieved by an appealable order has a right to appeal therefrom, even though the order is in form apparently favorable to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>San Gabriel Ready Mixt </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 355, 357 [343 P.2d 327].) \u201cOne is considered \u2018aggrieved\u2019 whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(County of Alameda v. Carleson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 737 [97 Cal.Rptr. 385, 488 P.2d 953].) We liberally construe the issue of standing and resolve doubts in favor of the right to appeal. <em>(Ajida Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roos Instruments, Inc. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 534, 540 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Apple insists that it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d because the distribution ordering issue was fully litigated before the trial court, was necessarily determined in the trial court\u2019s decision in that the court reached the interest expense deduction issue at all only as a consequence of its ruling on this question, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>that it will be subject to collateral estoppel on the distribution ordering issue with respect to claims for this and future tax years if it cannot appeal the adverse determination.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">FTB contends that the two issues litigated before the trial court were merely \u201cseparate, alternative grounds\u201d upon which the trial court could have relied in awarding the refund to Apple, and that the court\u2019s determination of the distribution ordering issue was not \u201cnecessary\u201d to the judgment. FTB\u2019s reliance on <em>Estate of Funkenstein </em>is misplaced. There the court relied upon \u201cwell settled\u201d law to find the judgment in favor of appellants to be nonappealable because \u201cwhere a finding is <em>contrary to a judgment or order rendered, or immaterial to it, </em>and the judgment or order is based upon other findings that do support it, the findings contrary or immaterial are not adjudications against the party who prevails.\u201d <em>(Estate of Funkenstein, supra, </em>170 Cal. at pp. 595-596, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We do not agree that the trial court\u2019s adjudication of the distribution ordering issue under section 25106 was \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the judgment entered. The issue raised the legal question of whether the dividends that Apple received from its foreign subsidiaries in the 1989 tax year should be treated as paid first out of current and prior years\u2019 earnings already taxed before consideration of any other earnings (preferential ordering), or subject to LIFO ordering under the approach applied by FTB. The parties stipulated that \u201c[n]either ... \u00a7 24425 nor \u00a7 24344 applies to dividends that are eliminated under . . . \u00a7 25106.\u201d If preferential ordering is applied, all of the dividends in question would be deemed paid from previously taxed earnings and thus eliminated from Apple\u2019s income. (\u00a7 25106.) If LIFO ordering is applied, some of the subject dividends would be eliminated and the remainder of the dividends would be deductible. (\u00a7 24402.) The trial court\u2019s determination of the distribution ordering issue decided whether Apple\u2019s dividends should be eliminated in the first instance, or whether they should be deducted. Only the deductible dividends may result in disallowance of interest expense deductions (\u00a7 24425)\u2014the second issue that was then addressed and decided by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Nor do we find persuasive FTB\u2019s insistence that we should decline to review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the distribution ordering issue because it will then lack collateral estoppel effect, despite the fact that the issue was fully litigated between these parties. FTB argues that the decision lacks any precedential effect in any event because the court\u2019s determination \u201cwas entirely unnecessary to the judgment.\u201d An element of collateral estoppel is the requirement that \u201cthe issue to be precluded was actually litigated and necessarily decided. [Citations.] The ' \u201cnecessarily decided\u201d \u2019 requirement generally means only that the resolution of the issue was not \u2018 \u201centirely unnecessary\u201d to the judgment in the initial proceeding.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Zevnik v. Superior Court </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 76, 83 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 817] <em>(Zevnik).) </em>As we have discussed, we do not agree in the first instance that the court\u2019s resolution of the distribution ordering issue was entirely unnecessary to the judgment. FTB is correct that we could nevertheless <em>deprive </em>the ruling of collateral effect by declining to decide it. In <em>Zevnik, </em>the court held that there should be no preclusive effect given to <em>alternative </em>grounds used by the trial court for its decision where an appellate court affirms the decision on only one of the alternative grounds without deciding the other grounds: \u201cWhen an appellate court declines to review a particular ground for a trial court decision, the reliability of that ground is not enhanced and is left in the same condition as if there had been no opportunity for review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">For the reasons we have discussed above, we doubt our ability to decide the propriety of Apple\u2019s interest expense deduction without necessarily addressing the issue of distribution ordering, and we do not agree that the distribution ordering issue was merely an alternative ground on which the trial court could have ruled in Apple\u2019s favor. Even if it were possible for us to do so, we see little justification for avoiding the question. \u201cThe principal reason for an appellate court to decline to review alternative grounds for a trial court decision is judicial economy . . . .\u201d <em>(Zevnik, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.4th at p. 85.) There is nothing, however, that prevents us from considering more than one ground for the court\u2019s judgment, particularly when we are aware of collateral litigation and believe \u201cthat to establish collateral estoppel on an alternative ground would be beneficial . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The interests of judicial economy are not served by requiring the parties to continually relitigate issues. \u201cTo preclude parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate protects their adversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>(Montana </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 147, 153-154 [59 L.Ed.2d 210, 99 S.Ct. 970], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>In sum, we find that Apple has standing to pursue its appeal on this question, and we see no persuasive policy reason to decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In our review on the merits, \u201cwe apply the substantial evidence test to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, but review legal determinations independently. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 470.) In our review, we are mindful of our Supreme Court\u2019s declaration that ambiguities in the governing statutes are resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>(Agnew v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 310, 326 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 981 P.2d 52].)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">C. <em>The Distribution Ordering Issue and Application of Section 25106</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">FTB characterizes this case as an attempt by Apple to avoid, or indefinitely defer, California taxes and to secure an improper \u201cdouble benefit.\u201d Apple argues that this is instead a case of \u201cdouble taxation.\u201d Apple complains that it previously paid $30 million in California franchise tax on the earnings of its CFC\u2019s which it accumulated, and that section 25106 provides a \u201cplain and broad mandate\u201d that unitary members \u201cbe permitted to move previously taxed unitary earnings among themselves, in the form of dividends, without tax incident.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) Apple asserts that <em>Fujitsu </em>is controlling here because <em>Fujitsu </em>addressed the same distribution ordering issue now before this court, and that FTB simply disagrees with the court\u2019s holdings in <em>Fujitsu </em>and seeks to \u201cavoid its application.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) The trial court found that <em>Fujitsu </em>did not address the precise issue presented here, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\"><em>Fujitsu </em>did address application of section 25106, and the inclusion ratio to be applied to CFC income under section 25110, but in a different context. In <em>Fujitsu, </em>a multinational California-headquartered parent corporation filed water\u2019s-edge combined income tax returns that included combined income of its unitary group members incorporated in the United States, and Subpart F income from its CFC\u2019s. <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at pp. 468, 469.) The corporation characterized a United Kingdom tax refund it received, under the terms of a tax treaty, from the United Kingdom subsidiary as a dividend on its combined return, while FTB treated it as nondividend income. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 471-472.) The corporation sued for a refund encompassing four tax years. FTB denied the refund, the trial court granted it, and the appellate court affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 470-489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The <em>Fujitsu </em>court first held that, in determining the numerator (Subpart F income) of the inclusion ratio for taxable CFC income (\u00a7 25110), \u201c[i]t is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>that California has chosen to measure Subpart F income by incorporating the federal definition\u2014a standard that implies California\u2019s willingness to follow the federal lead. In defining Subpart F income for purpose of calculating the inclusion ratio defined in section 25110 . . . absent clear language in the statute or in administrative regulations refusing to do so, we may assume California has adopted into its definition of Subpart F income the federal exclusions, including \u2018distributions of previously taxed income under [IRC \u00a7] 959(b).\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 477.) Moreover, the court found that the \u201cclear statutory language\u201d of section 25106<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> separately \u201censures that amounts included in the combined income of a unitary group can be moved (in the form of dividends) among members of the unitary group without tax consequence. ... In a combined unitary group, the subsidiaries\u2019 apportioned earnings are taxed as income of the unitary business. Because the state has already taxed the earnings out of which dividends are paid, the dividends themselves are not subject to taxation. This prevents dividends from subsidiaries from being taxed twice\u2014once as earnings of the issuing subsidiary, and once as separate income to the unitary business from receipt of the dividend, [f] . . . [f] . . . [T]he legislative scheme contemplates that \u2018dividends paid out of unitary income of lower-tier subsidiaries should be excluded from all the factors used in the computation of the amount included under [section] 25110 ... : that is, such dividends should be excluded from the numerator (Subpart F income), the denominator (earnings and profits) and the amount to which the inclusion ratio is applied (the income of the [CFC]).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fujitsu, </em>at pp. 477-478.) While the inclusion ratios applied to Apple\u2019s various CFC\u2019s were originally contested, FTB subsequently conceded the issue in light of <em>Fujitsu, </em>and there is no contention that the disputed dividends were included in either component of the fraction used here.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The <em>Fujitsu </em>court then considered the ordering to be applied to payment of dividends <em>within </em>a tax year \u201cwhere part of the CFC\u2019s income is Subpart F income and thus included in the unitary group\u2019s tax return, and some is not.\u201d <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 479.) The court noted an absence of any \u201cstatute, regulation or other administrative pronouncement providing] clear guidance on this question\u201d and applied a \u201c \u2018construction ... to favor the taxpayer rather than the government.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 480.) The court concluded that \u201cdividends paid by first-tier subsidiaries from current year earnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>should be treated as paid (1) first out of earnings eligible for elimination under section 25106, with (2) any excess paid out of earnings eligible for partial deduction under section 24411. In the case of a CFC that is partially included in a unitary group, the CFC will be able to move amounts that have been included in the combined income of the unitary group without tax incident only by adopting the ordering rule described above.\u201d (Fujitsu, at p. 480, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The issue here, however, is characterizing the source of the dividend payments when the CFC\u2019s also have an undistributed pool of accumulated earnings from <em>prior </em>tax years in addition to a surplus in the current year.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that Apple had sufficient \u201cincluded income\u201d from the 1989 tax year and prior years to fully eliminate, under section 25106, almost all of the CFC dividends paid in the 1989 tax year.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><em>Fujitsu </em>did not discuss at all how earnings accumulated over multiple tax years should be treated. Apple contends, however, that the rationale of <em>Fujitsu </em>dictates that retained earnings from <em>prior </em>years that have already been taxed as \u201cincluded income\u201d must be deemed to be the first source of a dividend until that retained surplus has been exhausted. Only in that way, Apple argues, can double taxation be avoided and the California tax policy reflected in section 25106, to ensure that amounts included in the combined income of a unitary group can be moved among members of the unitary group in the form of dividends without tax consequence, be respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">FTB first disputes Apple\u2019s contention that the CFC accumulated earnings necessarily represent amounts which were \u201cincluded in the combined income of the unitary group\u201d since only a fraction of this income (based on Subpart F income or \u201cincluded income\u201d) is taxed, and the balance is excluded and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>therefore outside the ambit of section 25106. (See <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 745, 750-751 [91 Cal.Rptr. 616, 478 P.2d 48] (Safeway) [\u201cfact that the combined or consolidated report of the group of corporations reflected total gross income and total deductions of all of the corporations, in order to arrive at the group\u2019s total net operating income to which the apportionment formula was applied, does not mean that the total gross income was included in the measure of the tax\u201d].) As FTB also notes, Apple cannot demonstrate any actual double taxation here, since its 1989 tax year dividends, to the extent not entirely \u201celiminated\u201d from its income under section 25106, were fully deductible under section 24402.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> FTB further asserts that, unlike the circumstances in <em>Fujitsu, </em>there is specific statutory and regulatory authority for its position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">1. <em>Application of IRC Section 316 and Revenue and Taxation Code Former Section 24495</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">FTB relies upon IRC section 316 and Revenue and Taxation Code former section 24495 as establishing a definitive LIFO ordering rule for dividends paid. IRC section 316(a)(2) defines a dividend as \u201cany distribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders . . . <em>out of its earnings and profits of the taxable year </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) It further provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle . . . , every distribution is made out of earnings and profits to the extent thereof, <em>and from the most recently accumulated earnings and profits. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) Its purpose was to preclude a corporation from declaring which year\u2019s profits were being distributed. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(1925) 269 U.S. 204, 216 [70 L.Ed. 235, 46 S.Ct. 85].) Former section 24495 and its successor statutes have either followed the language of IRC section 316 or expressly incorporated its provisions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>FTB regulations also incorporate the LIFO dividend ordering rule.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the water\u2019s-edge context, the regulation in effect for the 1989 tax year provided in relevant part: \u201cThe source of distribution for an entity which has Subpart F income shall follow the rules set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2).\u201d (Cal.

We disagree. Apple is correct that IRC section 959(c) provides that distributions received from a foreign subsidiary are deemed to have been paid first from earnings and profits attributable to amounts previously included in taxable gross income and then to other earnings and profits. But as FTB points out, IRC section 959(c), unlike IRC section 316, is not expressly incorporated in the Revenue and Taxation Code, and the federal tax scheme differs with respect to tax treatment of income from CFC\u2019s, deeming it to be a constructive dividend paid in the year earned (and thereby taxable income to the parent company), whether or not any of the amounts are repatriated in that year. <em>Fujitsu </em>did not hold otherwise, since it expressly addressed only current year earnings. <em>Fujitsu's </em>sole discussion of IRC section 959, and application of the double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>taxation principles underlying that section, was in the context of calculation of the appropriate inclusion ratios under section 25110. <em>Fujitsu's </em>assumption that California had adopted into its definition of Subpart F income the federal exclusion \u201c \u2018distributions of previously taxed income\u2019 \u201d under IRC section 959(b) was further premised on the absence of \u201cclear language in the statute or in administrative regulations refusing to do so.\u201d <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 477.) <em>Fujitsu </em>did not consider the clear language of IRC section 316, nor <em>that of </em>Regulation 24411, and it did not purport to invalidate Regulation 24411.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Nor are we persuaded by Apple\u2019s insistence that section 25106 implicitly adopts an equivalent preferential ordering mle in its temporal references to tax of a corporation which \u201cis <em>or has been </em>determined under this chapter with reference to the income and apportionment factors of one or more corporations with which it is doing <em>or has done </em>a unitary business.\u201d (\u00a7 25106, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) Section 25106 says nothing about ordering of dividends, or the tax year in which they are recognized. Section 25106 expresses a clear legislative policy against imposition of double taxation on income, but we are not convinced that the double taxation specter Apple invokes necessarily arises simply by virtue of LIFO ordering of dividend distributions. Certainly it does not appear that it did so with respect to the tax year at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In Apple\u2019s administrative appeal in this matter, the SBE\u2019s opinion included a detailed analysis of the dividend ordering issue. <em>(Appeal of Apple Computer, Inc., supra, </em>Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 404-085, pp. 34,110-34,115 [2006 Cal. Tax Lexis 431 at pp. *6-*32].) The Legislature has delegated to the SBE the duty of hearing and determining appeals from actions of the FTB. (\u00a7\u00a7 19045-19048.) In rejecting Apple\u2019s proposed preferential ordering, the SBE found that the plain language of IRC section 316 and Regulation 24411 required LIFO ordering as between tax years (and pro rata allocation between included and excluded income within the tax year). <em>(Appeal of Apple Computer, Inc., </em>at pp. 34,111, 34,114 [2006 Cal. Tax Lexis 431 at pp. *11-*16, *21-*28].) Further, it found that the ordering suggested by Apple would \u201crender meaningless the statutory and regulatory references to \u2018current\u2019 and \u2018most recent\u2019 earnings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 34,111 [2006 Cal. Tax Lexis 431 at p. *2].) The SBE concluded that CFC dividends paid from accumulated earnings must be \u201cdeemed paid from the current year\u2019s earnings until those earnings are exhausted, and thereafter from the most recent years\u2019 earnings, exhausting each year\u2019s earnings in turn.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>(Appeal of Apple Computer, Inc., </em>at p. 34,115 [2006 Cal.

The level of deference due to an agency\u2019s statutory and regulatory interpretation turns on a legally informed, commonsense assessment of its merit in the context presented. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cAlthough we are not bound by administrative decisions construing a . . . statute, we accord \u2018 \u201cgreat weight and respect to the administrative construction.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 508, 524 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 22 P.3d 324].)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">We agree with the SBE\u2019s conclusion that LIFO ordering as between tax years is consistent with clear statutory and regulatory authority, and that it deters abuse by preventing a corporation from declaring what year\u2019s earnings are being distributed. To allow preferential ordering of dividends between tax years would allow potentially indefinite tax avoidance by ignoring consideration of earnings attributable to untaxed excluded income until all included income had been exhausted. We believe that the policy of section 25106 to prevent double taxation is still honored in allowing total exclusion for dividends received within a tax year to the extent of <em>included </em>income for that tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">D. <em>The Interest Deduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u201cDeductions may be allowed or withheld by the Legislature as it sees fit [citations] and such deductions, like credits and exemptions, are to be narrowly construed against the taxpayer [citations].\u201d <em>(Great Western, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 5-6.)  \u201cIn a suit for refund of tax, the burden of proof is on the taxpayer.

Section 24425 applies whenever income is eliminated from tax \u201cunder any authority or for any purpose,\u201d thus preventing a taxpayer from receiving a double benefit in deducting interest expenses incurred in the production of nontaxable income. <em>(Great Western, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 6; see <em>Appeal of Zenith National Insurance Corporation </em>(Jan. 8, 1998, 1998-SBE-001) [1995-1999 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr.

Tax Lexis 1] <em>(Zenith).</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>Since FTB determined that a portion of Apple\u2019s dividend distributions were paid from excluded income, and were fully deductible under section 24402, FTB also allocated a portion of the interest Apple paid on its domestic borrowings, and deducted during the 1989 tax year, to those fully deductible dividend distributions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> FTB disallowed $1,893,886 of the claimed deduction, applying a formula based on the ratio of Apple\u2019s foreign investments to the assets of the combined water\u2019s-edge reporting group. FTB asserts here, as it did in the trial court, that because money is \u201cfungible,\u201d a portion of Apple\u2019s domestic interest expense was properly \u201callocable\u201d\u2014and properly allocated\u2014to its foreign source dividend distributions paid from excluded income.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The evidence with respect to this issue was largely undisputed. There was a dispute, however, as to the dominant purpose of Apple\u2019s borrowings. The trial court made detailed findings of fact on this question. It found that, while FTB failed to offer evidentiary support for disallowance of the interest deduction, Apple presented substantial evidence showing that the dominant purpose of its borrowings in 1989 was to fund its domestic operations. The evidence established that Apple had no long-term debt in 1989, 1988 or 1987, and its short-term debt had an average date to maturity of 26 days in 1989; Apple incurred short-term debt to finance its domestic working capital needs; Apple\u2019s seven CFC dividend payors held $601 million in cash reserves in 1989, and did not need to borrow funds from Apple to fund their operations; there were no intercompany loans from Apple to any of the seven dividend payors during the 1989 tax year; and there was no other flow of funds from Apple to the seven CFC dividend payors during the 1989 tax year. The court noted that FTB\u2019s own witness on this issue (Jenice Twomey) testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Apple\u2019s borrowing was for its domestic operations, and that the witness found no evidence of loans or other flow of funds from Apple to the dividend-paying CFC\u2019s.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court found that Apple had proven the absence of any connection between its borrowings generating the interest expense and the dividend payors.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">FTB argues that, nevertheless, \u201cit is reasonable to infer that, when Apple incurred indebtedness to fund its domestic operations, a portion of the proceeds from [that] indebtedness was also used to carry the assets of the subsidiaries that paid the dividends at issue in this case,\u201d and that a portion of the interest expense must therefore be allocable to the dividend income deducted. The gist of this argument is that even when money is borrowed for a specific purpose, the borrowing will generally free other funds for discretionary purposes and that the expense thereby contributes to all aspects of the corporate operations. In this instance, FTB further contends that the evidence shows that Apple \u201cadmitted\u201d that it borrowed to fund its domestic activities in order to avoid the tax consequences of repatriation of dividends from its cash-rich foreign subsidiaries (sometimes referred to as \u201c \u2018tax arbitrage\u2019 \"; see <em>Hunt-Wesson, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. </em>(2000) 528 U.S. 458, 465-466 [145 L.Ed.2d 974, 120 S.Ct. 1022] <em>(Hunt-Wesson)).</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Consequently, FTB insists, even if interest cannot be directly allocated, it may still be allocated indirectly by application of a formula which apportions the interest expense between taxable and nontaxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Both Apple and FTB cite the SBE determination in <em>Zenith, supra, </em>Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 402-965 [1998 Cal. Tax Lexis 1], in support of their respective positions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In <em>Zenith, </em>the taxpayer (Zenith National Ins. Corp.) received nontaxable dividends from a wholly owned subsidiary over several tax years. During those same tax years, Zenith incurred interest expense in connection with the issuance of corporate debentures used to develop a portfolio of preferred stock paying taxable dividends. Zenith deducted all of its debenture-related interest expense, but on audit FTB used a formula to reallocate a pro rata portion of this interest expense to the nontaxable insurance dividends. The SBE considered the question of \u201chow properly to allocate, if at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>all, the . . . interest expensebetween appellant\u2019s taxable and nontaxable activities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28,990 [1998 Cal. Tax Lexis 1 at p. *3].) The SBE found that Zenith had justified the deductions for all but one tax year, and that allocation of the interest deduction was therefore required for that single year. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28,992 [1998 Cal. Tax Lexis 1 at p. *19].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Premised on the \u201cfungibility of money,\u201d FTB took the position that interest, by its nature, is not susceptible to direct allocation, and could only be indirectly allocated by formula. <em>(Zenith, supra, </em>Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) <em>\u00b6 </em>402-965, pp. 28,991-28,992 [1998 Cal. Tax Lexis 1 at p. *18].) The SBE said that the establishment of the proper allocation of interest expense would instead involve an inquiry into both the purpose of the borrower and an accounting as to the actuad use or uses the borrowed funds were put. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28,992 [1998 Cal. Tax Lexis 1 at p. *14].) The SBE held that the burden was on the taxpayer to establish a direct allocation between the borrowing expense and the investment purpose, and that FTB\u2019s allocation formula would otherwise apply: \u201cIn the absence of direct evidence linking indebtedness with a particular purchase, the IRS, and this Board, will determine whether the totality of the facts and circumstances establish a sufficiently direct relationship between the borrowing and the investment to allow for a direct allocation between those two items. [Citation.] Unless the taxpayer can establish its dominant purpose and a sufficiently direct relationship between the expense and the income, [FTB\u2019s] allocation formula will provide the best means to allocate interest expense between taxable and nontaxable activities. Further, due to the factual <em>nature of the inquiries presented by this analysis, </em>it is also clear that the taxpayer must carry the general burden of proving its dominant purpose for incurring and/or continuing the subject obligations (and the related interest expense), as well as the burden of demonstrating the actual use of the subject funds, by tracing or some other method.\u201d (Ibid., italics added.) The SBE has followed this analysis in subsequent cases. (See, e.g., <em>In the Matter of the Appeal of American General Realty Investment Corp., Inc., </em>(June 25, 2003) [2003-2005 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 403-483, p. 31,022 [a nonprecedential summary decision stating, \u201cestablishment of the proper allocation of interest expense may involve an inquiry into both the purpose of the borrower and an accounting as to what use or uses the borrowed funds were put\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We again find the SBE analysis on this issue persuasive. The issue is not whether FTB may seek to allocate otherwise deductible expenses between taxable and nontaxable income. Unquestionably it can. (See <em>Hunt-Wesson, supra, </em>528 U.S. at p. 466 [Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently upheld deduction denials that represent reasonable efforts properly to allocate a deduction between taxable and tax-exempt income, even though such denials mean that the taxpayer owes more than he would without the denial\u201d].) The question is simply whether Apple then met its burden under the \u201ctotality of facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>circumstances\u201d to establish that its dominant purpose in the borrowing, and the actual use of the funds, was to support, and was allocable to, its domestic (taxable) income-producing activities. The trial court found that it did and we believe that substantial evidence supports its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">FTB\u2019s approach would ignore <em>Zenith, </em>and would instead implement an effectively conclusive presumption that if a domestic corporation borrows at all, it has done so at least in part to support its other unitary operations, regardless of any contrary showing by the taxpayer. We decline to adopt a position that would push the concept of fungibility of money \u201cpast reasonable bounds.\u201d <em>(Hunt-Wesson, supra, </em>528 U.S. at p. 466.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">E. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Apple sought an award of attorney fees of $683,492.73 under section 19717, subdivision (a) and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

It urges that an award of attorney fees is necessary \u201cas a disincentive to the FTB to take positions that it cannot substantially justify.\u201d <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Apple overstates the significance of the principal case authorities upon which it relies. For example, Apple contends that the Supreme Court decision in <em>Hunt-Wesson, supra, </em>528 U.S. 458, is both directly applicable to this case and dispositive of the \u201cfungibility of money\u201d argument. It is not. In <em>Hunt-Wesson, </em>the Supreme Court rejected FTB\u2019s attempt to extend the theory in order to deny interest expense deductions incurred with respect to a <em>nonunitary </em>business operation. The court found that the effect was to assess a tax upon constitutionally protected nonunitary income. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 466.) Failing to make \u201ca reasonable allocation of expense deductions to the income that the expense generates\u201d was held to constitute \u201cimpermissible taxation of income outside [of our state\u2019s] jurisdictional reach.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 468.) The high court did not, however, reject \u201creasonable efforts properly to allocate a deduction between taxable and tax-exempt income\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 466), and it specifically noted with approval both federal and state use of \u201cratio-based formulas\u201d to allocate borrowing <em>(id. </em>at p. 467). The court did not disapprove the concept of \u201cfungibility of money,\u201d but rather rejected an absolutist application that \u201cpushes this concept past reasonable bounds.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 466.) In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>FTB applied a ratio-based formula, consistent with <em>Hunt-Wesson, </em>to allocate Apple\u2019s borrowing. Its effort to make the allocation here failed not because its suggested ratios were inherently unreasonable, but because Apple succeeded in meeting its burden of demonstrating that allocation was not appropriate in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Likewise, Apple attempts to draw too much from the SBE\u2019s holding in <em>Zenith. </em>Far from outright rejecting FTB\u2019s indirect allocation formula for apportioning deductible expenses, the SBE held that \u201c[u]nless the taxpayer can establish its dominant purpose and a sufficiently direct relationship between the expense and the income, [FTB\u2019s] <em>allocation formula </em>will provide the best means to allocate interest expense between taxable and nontaxable activities.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>(Zenith, supra, </em>Cal.Tax Rptr.

It similarly rejected Apple\u2019s contention that <em>Hunt-Wesson </em>was dispositive, and recognized and accepted <em>Zenith's </em>holding that FTB\u2019s indirect allocation formula could still be used where the taxpayer failed to establish the dominant purpose of its borrowing either through direct tracing or by consideration of the totality of facts and circumstances.

This is inconsistent with <em>Fujitsu\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>requirement to first exhaust included income on a dollar-for-dollar basis. <em>(Fujitsu, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 480.) The SBE found that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Safeway, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at pages 749-750 approved proration of dividends, and was controlling. <em>(Appeal of Apple Computer, Inc., </em>at p. 34,114 [2006 Cal. Tax Lexis at pp. *25-*26].) It concluded that there was \u201cno practical or theoretical reason\u201d for preferential ordering. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 34,115 [2006 Cal. Tax Lexis 431 at p. *30].) While the issue is not squarely presented here, we see no reason to depart from our colleagues\u2019 thoughtful analysis in <em>Fujitsu, </em>and we do not accept or adopt the SBE position on this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\"> The SEE later clarified aspects of this opinion that are not relevant here.

Apple asserts that section 19717, subdivision (b)(1) requires only that it have pursued <em>an </em>administrative appeal on its refund claim, and contains no additional requirement that specific facts and issues must have been presented in that appeal. Apple also notes that paragraph 42 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the parties\u2019 joint stipulation recites that \u201cAPPLE exhausted all applicable administrative remedies.\u201d Since we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying fees, it is unnecessary for us to address these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">For the same reason, we also do not address FTB\u2019s argument that Apple\u2019s fees are \u201cgreatly inflated,\u201d nor its contention that Apple failed to establish the \u201cspecial factor\u201d required to justify a higher hourly rate than the $125 per hour allowed under section 19717, subdivision (c)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"Ar6\"> The SBE also observed that \u201c[e]ach party presents valid arguments in support of its position, and each argument is founded upon meritorious considerations.\u201d <em>(Zenith, supra, </em>Cal.Tax Rptr.
