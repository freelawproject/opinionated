(collectively \u201cDalmine\u201d), contest certain aspects of the Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration\u2019s (\u201cITA\u201d or \u201cCommerce\u201d) Final Determination in <em>Small Diameter Circular Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel, Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe from Italy, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 31,981 (June 19,1995) (\u201cFinal Determination\u201d), as unsupported by substantial evidence and contrary to law. This Court has jurisdiction under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2) (1988) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-16\">Quanex argues that four actions by Commerce were unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and not in accordance with law: (1) the exclusion of certain U.S. sales of subject merchandise from its an-tidumping calculations; (2) the failure to use best information available (\u201cBIA\u201d) to calculate margins for certain unreported U.S. sales; (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>failure to apply adverse BIA to calculate margins for certain unreported U.S. sales; and (4) the failure to explain its decision to exclude the unreported U.S. sales from the margin calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Dalmine argues that six actions by Commerce were unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and not in accordance with law: (1) the application of adverse BIA as a result of Dalmine\u2019s omission of a single sale from its outlier request; (2) the initiation of a below-cost-of-production investigation of Dalmine\u2019s home market sales; (3) the calculations of cost of production (\u201cCOP\u201d) and constructed value (\u201cCV\u201d) with respect to Dalmine\u2019s galvanized products; (4) the attribution of Instituto per La Riconstruzione Industr\u00edale S.p.A.\u2019s (\u201cIRI\u201d) interest expenses to Dalmine because IRI is Dalmine\u2019s ultimate parent; (5) the reduction of IRI\u2019s interest expenses by short-term interest income only; and (6) the rejection as \u201cnew\u201d information of certain documents that Dalmine submitted with their Reply Brief during the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Dalmine has abandoned its claims that Commerce erred in not reducing Dalmine\u2019s general expenses by Dalmine\u2019s exchange gains, and that Commerce understated the \u201cCV offset ratio\u201d because it excluded certain categories of accounts receivable from related companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">For the reasons discussed below, the Court remands to Commerce only on the issue of the calculation of COP and CV with respect to Dal-mine\u2019s galvanized products. The Court affirms Commerce\u2019s actions on all other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">Procedural Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">On June 23,1994, Quanex filed a petition with Commerce requesting an antidumping investigation of seamless pipe from Italy. Petition from Schagrin Assoc, to Sec. of Commerce (\u201cPetition\u201d), Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) Pub. Doc. 1, Fiche 2-3, Fr. 1. Quanex alleged that seamless pipe was being, or was likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">The ITA initiated an antidumping investigation on July 13, 1994, published in Federal Register on July 20,1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Initiation of Antidump-ing Duty Investigations: Small Diameter Circular Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe from Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy, </em>59 Fed. Reg. 37,025 (\u201cInitiation Notice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">Commerce issued a preliminary negative determination on January <em>27,1995.Notice ofPreliminary Determination of Sales at Not Less Than Fair Value: Small Diameter Circular Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel, Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe from Italy, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 5358 (\u201cPre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>liminary Determination\u201d). In the <em>Final Determination, </em>however, Commerce determined that Dalmine\u2019s weighted-average dumping margin was 1.84 percent. 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,992. Dalmine and Quanex challenge certain aspects of Commerce\u2019s Final Determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">In reviewing a final ITA determination, this Court will \u201chold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found * * * to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B). \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018is something less than the weighing of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) 44, 51, 750 F.2d 927, 933 (1984) (quoting <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-20 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">In reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of the statute that the agency administers, the Court\u2019s initial inquiry is to determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). \u201cIf Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843-44. Consequently, \u201c[t]he court will defer to the agency\u2019s construction of the statute as a permissible construction if it \u2018reflects a plausible construction of the plain language of the statute[s] and does not otherwise conflict with Congress\u2019 express intent.\u2019\u201d <em>Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>82 F.3d 1039, 1044 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">ITA Made A Reasonable Decision To Exclude From Its Antidumping Calculations Certain U.S. Sales of ASTM A-335 Pipe Made During The Period Of Investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d) Because The Scope Description Provided by ITA Was Ambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"A_TX\">During verification, Commerce discovered that Dalmine failed to report certain U.S. sales of ASTM A-335 pipe used in boiler applications. Commerce determined that the ambiguous scope description contained in the Notice of Initiation and Preliminary Determination caused Dal-mine to believe that this merchandise was not included in the investigation, and thus these sales did not need to be reported. Commerce decided to exclude these sales from the calculation of the dumping margin. Qua-nex contends that Commerce erred in not including these sales and argues that the scope description clearly encompassed this merchandise. For the reasons that follow, Quanex\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">As proposed by Quanex, \u201c[t]he scope of this petition includes all subject seamless pipe produced to the ASTM A-106, ASTM A-335, ASTM A-53 and API 5L specifications, regardless of application\u201d. Petition at 5. The scope also included all products not meeting the ASTM A-106, A-335, A-53 or API 5L standards, but used in the covered applications. <em>Id. </em>A footnote to the sentence preceding this description stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-5\">In addition, A-106 pipe may be used in some boiler applications. However, this petition is not intended to cover boiler tubing unless such tubing is being used as a substitute in applications covered by this petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\"><em>Id. </em>at n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">In defining the scope of the investigation as follows, the ITA slightly modified Quanex\u2019s Petition and, in addition to listing ASTM A-106, ASTM A-53, ASTM A-335, and API 5L as covered specifications, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-8\">The following information further defines the scope of these investigations * * * A-106 pipe may be used in some boiler applications. The scope of these investigations includes all multiple-stenciled seamless pipe meeting the physical parameters described above and produced to one of the specifications listed above, whether or not also certified to a non-covered specification. Standard, line and pressure applications are defining characteristics of the scope of these investigations. Therefore, seamless pipes meeting the physical description above, but not produced to the A-106, A-53, or API 5L standards shall be covered if used in an A-106, A-335, A-53 or API 5L application. * * * Specifically excluded from these investigations are boiler tubing, mechanical tubing and oil country tubular goods except when used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">Initiation Notice, 59 Fed. Reg. at 37,026. The scope description contained in the Preliminary Determination was identical to the one contained in the Initiation Notice. 60 Fed. Reg. 5358.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">In the Final Determination, Commerce determined that the scope of the investigation included the disputed alloy pipe made to ASTM A-335 specification. 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,981-83. Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-11\">The scope of this investigation includes seamless pipes produced to the ASTM A-335, ASTM A-106, ASTM A-53 and API 5L specifications and meeting the physical parameters described below, regardless of application. The scope of this investigation also includes all products used in standard, line, or pressure applications and meeting the physical parameters below, regardless of specification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyQ\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-12\">Specifically excluded from this investigation are boiler tubing and mechanical tubing, if such products are not produced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>A-335, A-106, A-53 or API 5L specifications and are not used in standard, line or pressure applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-3\"><em>Id. </em>at 31,981-82 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">Commerce stated that the scope description contained in the Initiation Notice and Preliminary Determination was ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 31,987. Commerce decided to exclude the sales of pipe made to A-335 specification which were used in boiler applications for purposes of its final calculation so that Dalmine would not be penalized for a reasonable misunderstanding. <em>Id. </em>at 31,987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-6\">Based on the results of the Houston verification, it is apparent that there had been considerable confusion concerning scope coverage. In order to eliminate this confusion, we find it necessary to clarify the scope to make explicit that all products made to ASTM A-335, A-106, A-53 and API 5L are covered, regardless of application, and modify any future suspension of liquidation instructions to Customs. Therefore, considering the ambiguity in the scope language, it is not appropriate to penalize the respondent by including these sales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Final Concurrence Mem. of June 12,1995 at 10, AR Non Pub. Doc. 108, Fiche 104, Fr. 1 (emphasis added). Thus, although Commerce determined that pipe produced to a covered specification but used in a non-covered application is within the scope of the investigation, it excluded these sales from the dumping margin because the scope language was ambiguous. Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,984, 31,987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Commerce Reasonably Determined That The Scope Description Was Ambiguous And Excluded Certain U.S. Sat.es</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">This issue is extremely narrow: whether Commerce may exclude certain U.S. sales from the dumping margin calculation when the respondent\u2019s failure to report those sales was due to the ambiguous scope description found in the Initiation Notice and Preliminary Determination. Based on the specific facts of this case, Commerce\u2019s actions were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">Commerce, in administering the antidumping duty program, interprets antidumping duty orders and determines which products fall within the scope of the order. <em>Ericsson GE Mobile Communications Inc. v. United States, </em>60 F.3d 778, 783 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In discharging this duty, Commerce \u201cenjoys substantial freedom\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 782. Before an an-tidumping duty order is issued, however, Commerce must define the scope of the investigation and perform its investigation. In accordance with Commerce\u2019s freedom to interpret an antidumping duty order, the Court views Commerce\u2019s interpretation of its scope description with deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">The parties cite numerous places in the record to support their competing contentions that the scope was either ambiguous or clear. For ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>ample, Quanex points to appendices I and V of the questionnaire which list ASTM A-335 alloy pipe as a covered specification. Appendix V provides that some covered products, specifically A-106 pipes, \u201cmay be used in some boiler applications. \u201d Quanex also argues that Commerce\u2019s discussion of the published scope description in the Initiation Concurrence Memorandum put Dalmine on notice of the proper scope description. It describes the scope as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-4\">Petitioner would like the Department to initiate these investigations using a scope that includes any merchandise which (1) meets the physical description of the subject seamless pipe as set forth in the petition, (2) is made to one of the specifications listed in the petition (whether or not also certified to a non-covered specification) or is used in one of the types of applications listed in the petition, and (3) is not specifically exempted. Petitioner specifically exempts oil country tubular goods, mechanical tubing and boiler tubing that is not also certified to one of the covered specifications and that is not used in one of the covered applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Initiation Concurrence Mem. of July 13, 1994 at 4, AR Pub. Doc. 18, Fiche 4, Fr. 85 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Dalmine, on the other hand, argues that it \u201cinformed both ITA and Quanex that it considered various types of boiler products bearing subject stencils to be non-subject merchandise.\u201d Mem. of Defendant-Int. Dalmine S.p.A. et al. In Oppos. To Plaintiff s Mot. For Judgment On The Agency Record at 30 (\u201cDalmine Response\u201d). According to Dalmine, footnote 3 to the petition contributed to its confusion. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-7\">In addition, A-106 pipe may be used in some boiler applications. However, this petition is not intended to cover boiler tubing unless such tubing is being used as a substitute in applications covered by this petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Petition at n. 3. Dalmine claims that \u201cQuanex\u2019s use of the word \u2018however\u2019 in the footnote logically can only mean that all boiler pipe \u2014 including ASTM A-106 boiler pipe \u2014 was non-subject merchandise, provided it was not used in a subject application.\u201d Dalmine Response at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">Dalmine also claims that in exhibit 5 to its petition, Quanex noted that excluded boiler products \u201cha[ve] separate [Harmonized Tariff Schedule] subheadings\u201d, which suggested that all pipes to be used in a boiler application were excluded. Dalmine Response at 21. According to Dalmine, Quanex\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he fact that [Tubicar\u2019s A-106] boiler tubing products may not be in the scope of the investigation does not prevent them from being used as the basis for foreign market value\u201d, Quanex Letter of Sept. 26,1994 to Sec\u2019y Comm. Objecting to Outlier Request at 3, AR Pub. Doc. 65, Fiche 12, Fr. 1, is an admission that boiler application products bearing a subject stencil are non-subject merchandise. Dalmine Response at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">Here, Commerce determined that the scope description \u201cwas unclear as to whether the products in question are subject merchandise. The respondent did not report these sales based on its reading of the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>the initiation * * * the scope language in the initiation is ambiguous * * Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,987. In view of the conflicting information above, and because the Court looks upon Commerce\u2019s interpretation of its scope description with deference, Commerce\u2019s determination that the scope description was ambiguous is reasonable. Commerce clarified the scope description in the Final Determination, thus assuring that the subject merchandise will be included in all subsequent reviews.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Although The Narrow Facts Of This Case Support Exclusion Of U.S. Sales Based On Ambiguity In The Scope Description, Most Respondents Will Not Be Able To Meet This Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">Neither Commerce nor this Court is opening the door for respondents \u201cto control the amount of antidumping duties\u201d by deliberately miscom-municating in order to claim ambiguity in the scope description. <em>See P\u00e9r-sico Pizzamiglio, S.A. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 299, 304 (1994) (citing <em>Olympic Adhesives, Inc. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 69, 76,899 F.2d 1565,1572 (1990)). A respondent is still responsible for seeking clarification from Commerce in order to create an adequate record. <em>Chinsung Indus. Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 103,106, 705 F. Supp. 598, 601 (1989). In this case, however, the Court agrees with Commerce that all of the parties believed in good faith that they were interpreting the scope correctly. As a result, because of its unique facts, this case does not adversely impact those considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">Commerce Explained Its Decision To Exclude The Unreported U.S. Sales From The Margin Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">The Court rejects Quanex\u2019s argument that Commerce failed to explain why it did not calculate a margin for the ASTM A-335 pipe used in boiler applications or include it in its average margin and duty deposit calculations. Quanex admits that Commerce provided an explanation for why it was not applying an adverse BIA, but erroneously concludes that Commerce\u2019s failure to explain its reasons for not applying some other BIA renders the determination unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and contrary to law. Brief Of Plaintiff Gulf States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Tube Div. Of Quanex Corp. In Support Of Its Motion For Judgment Upon The Agency Record at 43 (Quanex Brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">With regard to the ASTM A-335 pipe used in boiler applications, Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-5\">we agree that the merchandise is within the scope of the investigation. However, we have decided that the use of adverse BIA for these unreported sales is unwarranted. * * * [T]he scope language, as published in the notice of initiation and the preliminary determination, was unclear as to whether the products in question are subject merchandise. The respondent did not report these sales based on its reading of the scope of the initiation. Since the scope language in the initiation is ambiguous (and hence has been clarified in the final determination), it is not appropriate to penalize the respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">Commerce did not apply any BIA to these sales, adverse or otherwise. As a result, the explanation set out above is the ITA\u2019s explanation for its treatment of these unreported sales, i.e., their exclusion from the anti-dumping calculations. The ITA\u2019s explanation clearly states that the ambiguous scope description excused Dalmine\u2019s failure to report these sales. Application of any BIA may penalize Dalmine because it is the \u201cBest Information Available\u201d and not necessarily the most accurate information available. This would be contrary to the purpose of the anti-dumping laws which \u201care remedial not punitive.\u201d <em>NTNBearing Corp. v. United States, </em>74 F.3d 1204,1208 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Commerce has sufficiently explained its actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">The ITA\u2019s Decision To Apply Adverse BIA To Dalmine\u2019s Sale Of Honing Stock Is Supported By Substantial Evidence On The Record And Is In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">Dalmine received permission from Commerce to not report its U.S. sales of meter run pipe and other products because they comprised less than 5% of Dalmine\u2019s total U.S. POI subject sales even though these products were covered by the scope of the investigation. Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,987; Mem. of Nov. 28, 1994 from Team to Stafford at 3. At verification, Commerce found an additional sale of a product called \u201choning stock\u201d which it determined should have been included in the exclusion request. Because this additional sale raised the percentage of excluded products over 5% of Dalmine\u2019s total U.S. POI subject sales, Commerce decided to apply adverse BIA to the sale of honing stock and to the sales included in the exclusion request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Dalmine argues that the honing stock was not covered by the scope of the investigation because it was a non-subject intermediate pipe that was produced to non-standard pipe sizes. Dalmine also argues that the application of adverse BIA to the sale of honing stock and to the excluded sales was \u201cdraconian\u201d. For the reasons that follow, the Court upholds Commerce\u2019s determination that the honing stock is reportable and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>the application of adverse BIA to these sales is supported by substantial evidence on the record and in accordance with law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">On September 19, 1994, Dalmine requested the exclusion of certain U.S. sales from its antidumping calculations, alleging that they constituted only an insignificant quantity of all U.S. sales. AR Non Pub. Doc. 7, Fiche 58, Fr. 41. Among other products, Dalmine requested the exclusion of meter run pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">In agreeing to exclude the U.S. sales from its margin analysis, Commerce warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-8\">We generally consider that outlier sales of less than 5% based on volume may be excluded from analysis. <em>(See, Stainless Steel Bar From Italy (A-475-813)). </em>We believe that in this case, the percentage of outlier sales is insignificant based on volume and do not consider such quantities critical to our analysis. However, if the information is not available for verification in Italy, we will confirm the accuracy of the percentages and circumstances surrounding these sales at Dalmine\u2019s U.S. facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">Mem. of Nov. 28,1994 from Team to Stafford at 3, AR Non Pub. Doc. 22, Fiche 69, Fr. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">At verification, Commerce discovered that Dalmine failed to include an amount of meter run tubing in its request. Commerce considered both pipe and tube to be within the scope of the investigation because \u201cthe physical parameters of the scope include all seamless carbon and alloy steel pipes, of circular cross-section, not more than 4.5 inches in outside diameter, regardless of wall thickness. Therefore, the fact that such products may be referred to as tubes by some parties, and may be multiple-stenciled, does not render them outside the scope.\u201d Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">As a result, Commerce applied an adverse BIA to the unreported pipe as well as the pipe included in the request. Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-12\">In the early stages of this investigation, the respondent made several requests to be excused from reporting particular categories of U.S. sales which were clearly covered by the scope of this investigation. The respondent based this exclusion request on the claim that these sales represented a certain percentage of total U'S. sales. Based on this representation, we granted the request but indicated that the claim would be subject to verification. At verification, we found additional unreported sales of the same merchandise that was the subject of the respondent\u2019s exclusion request. These additional unreported sales constitute a significant additional quantity than was represented in the exclusion request.

Dalmine Case Brief at 9,16,29,30, AR Non Pub. Doc. 93, Fiche 93-95, Fr. 1. However, because the A-106 stencil appeared on the honing stock and it was not used in an excluded application, it is reportable. In addition, the Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument that the honing stock, as a \u201ctube\u201d, is not covered by the scope of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">The Honing Stock Bore An A-106 Stencil And Was Not Used In An Excluded Application</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">The ITA excluded from the investigation \u201credraw hollows\u201d, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-13\">With respect to redraw hollows for cold drawing, the scope language excludes such products specifically when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube. We understand that petitioner included this exclusion language expressly and intentionally to ensure that hollows imported into the United States are sold as intermediate products, not as merchandise to be used in a covered application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-15\">Dalmine argues that honing stock is an intermediate product that is finished through a cold process (that is, honing), just like hollows. In addition, Dalmine states that honing stock is not used to convey liquids or gas (or in any other application) and therefore is not used \u201cin a covered application\u201d, in the form in which it is sold by Dalmine. Dalmine argues that it reasonably concluded that it was not subject merchandise because honing stock must undergo significant further processing before it can be used. <em>See </em>Sales Verif. Ex. M-6, AR Non Pub. Doc. 87, Fiche 89, Fr. 51 (showing that the merchandise was processed by a customer of Dalmine\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-16\">Commerce made no determination that honing is equivalent to cold-drawing, and the scope description does not indicate that honing is excluded from the investigation as equivalent to cold-drawing. <em>See </em>Initiation Notice, 59 Fed.

Further processing of the hon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>ing stock by the purchaser does not meet the \u201credraw hollows\u201d exclusion from the scope of the investigation. <em>See id. </em>(Commerce\u2019s guidance on this exclusion is: \u201c[e]xcluded from these investigations are redraw hollows for cold-drawing when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-3\">The record shows that the A-106 stencil appeared on honing stock in question. <em>See </em>Sales Verification Exhibit M-6, AR Non Pub. Doc. 87, Fiche 89, Fr. 51. That is one of the four listed specifications contained in the scope description. Accordingly, the honing stock was within the scope of the investigation. <em>See </em>Initiation Notice, 59 Fed. Reg. at 37,025-26. Coupled with the evidence that it was not used in an excluded application, honing stock was a reportable product. As a result, Commerce\u2019s determination that the honing stock is covered by the scope of the investigation is reasonable and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Even If The Honing Stock Is Considered A \u201cTube\u201d, It Is Still Covered By The Scope 0,f The Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Dalmine also argues that the honing stock was not subject merchandise because it is a \u201ctube\u201d produced to non-pipe sizes, and is not a \u201cpipe\u201d. Dalmine states that pipes are hollow steel products produced to a finite number of OD and wall thickness combinations such as ASTM A-106, A-53, A-335, and API-5L. Tubes, it claims, are produced to any other OD or wall thickness combinations. Dalmine Brief at 34-36. Dalmine points to Commerce\u2019s statement that redraw hollows could be used to produce either \u201cpipe or tube\u201d as a further example that Commerce recognized a difference. <em>See </em>Initiation Notice, 59 Fed. Reg. at 37,026.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">The ITA determined that all hollow steel products, both pipes and tubes, having an OD of not more than 4.5 inches, were products subject to the Seamless Pipe investigation. Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,984. The ITA pointed out that the product definition included in the investigation all pipe having an OD of less than 4.5 inches, \u201cregardless of wall thickness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-8\">Although it is unclear as to where the dividing line between pipe and tube products is at the present time, it is our understanding that petitioner intended to include pipes of all wall thicknesses in the scope of the subject proceedings. The very first sentence of the scope which refers to the physical description of the merchandise reads as follows: \u201cFor purposes of [these investigations], seamless pipes are seamless carbon and alloy (other than stainless) steel pipes, of circular cross-section, not more than 114.35 mm (4.5 inches) in outside diameter, <em>regardless of wall thickness </em>(emphasis added) * * *\u201d Although not specifically stated in the petition, it would appear by this language that tubes are included in the scope of the investigation if they are produced to one of the covered specifications or otherwise used in standard, line or pressure pipe applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>Mem.

Dalmine argues that this action is \u201cdraconian\u201d and exaggerates the significance of the honing stock sale. The Court affirms Commerce\u2019s application of adverse BIA to these sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">Congress has provided for Commerce to use the \u201cBest Information Available\u201d whenever it is unable to verify the accuracy of information provided in a response, information requested is not supplied in a timely manner or the required form due to either refusal or inability, or the investigation is significantly impeded. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) and (c). According to the tiered system for using BIA, BIA can be partial or total, and can be adverse or non-adverse, depending on the circumstances. <em>Nat\u2019l Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>18 CIT1126,1131,870 F. Supp. 1130, 1135 (1994). Commerce will apply non-adverse partial BIA where there is an inadvertent gap in the record or a minor or insignificant adjustment is involved. <em>Id. </em>at 1132, 870 F. Supp. at 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has determined the conditions under which BIA may be considered adverse or \u201cpunitive\u201d. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-11\">In order for the agency\u2019s application of the best information rule to be properly characterized as \u201cpunitive, \u201d the agency would have had to reject low margin information in favor of high margin information that was demonstrably less probative of current conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\"><em>Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v. United States, </em>899 F.2d 1185, 1190 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">Dalmine argues that it made a <em>single </em>sale of only [ ] tons of honing stock in the U.S. market during the POI, equal to [a certain percentage] of their total POI U.S. sales of subject merchandise. Dalmine concludes that \u201c[t]his trivial amount cannot be \u201csignificant\u201d under any circumstances. \u201d Dalmine Brief at 38. Dalmine adds that even if it had included the honing stock sale in its exclusion request, the total of the request would still be less than 5% of U.S. subject total sales and thus is harmless error. Dalmine Brief at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-14\">Commerce granted Dalmine\u2019s exclusion request based on the representations made by Dalmine. Contrary to Dalmine\u2019s assertion, inclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>sion of the honing stock in the exclusion request would have caused it to be over 5% of the total U.S. sales. The honing stock sale of [ ] tons added to the [ ] tons Dalmine requested the exclusion for, amounts to over 5% of the total U.S. sales of [ ] tons that should have been reported by Dal-mine for the POI ([ ] actually reported by Dalmine plus [ ] which should have been reported). Defendants\u2019 Mem. In Partial Opposition To Counts 1-7 Of The Mot. For Judgment On The Agency Record Filed By Dalmine at 26-27 (\u201cDefendants\u2019 Mem.\u201d). Thus, the exclusion request fell outside Commerce\u2019s stated guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">Accordingly, the addition of the single sale of honing stock is significant because it raised Dalmine\u2019s unreported sales above the 5% threshold. <em>See </em>Final Determination 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,987. The missing information, i.e., the honing stock sale, was in the control of Dalmine. This information did not amount to an inadvertent gap in the record and cannot be considered a minor or insignificant adjustment which would justify the application of neutral BIA. Thus, application of adverse BIA is appropriate and hardly \u201cdraconian\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">The ITA\u2019s Decision To Initiate A Below-Cost-Of-Production (\u201cCOP\u201d) Investigation Of Dalmine\u2019s Home Market Sales Is Supported By Substantial Evidence On The Record And In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">Commerce initiated a COP investigation of Dalmine\u2019s home market sales based on information given to it by Quanex. Subsequently, Commerce did find below cost-of-production sales and as a result employed the constructed value of the merchandise to determine the foreign market value. Dalmine claims that ITA\u2019s initiation of the COP investigation was unlawful because (1) it lacked reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that Dalmine\u2019s home market prices were below its cost of production and (2) Quanex failed to provide an appropriate public version of its allegations, contrary to Commerce\u2019s regulations. For the reasons that follow, Dalmine\u2019s arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">In a letter dated November 22, 1994, Quanex alleged that Dalmine was selling seamless pipe in Italy at below cost. AR Non Pub. Doc. 21, Fiche 69, Fr. 1. Quanex claimed that it \u201c does not know, and has no way of obtaining Dalmine\u2019s actual cost of production for the subject merchandise\u201d because Dalmine had not (1) reported its sales in the U.S. that did not have identical matches in Italy or any differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise being compared, and (2) placed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>the record detailed financial statements. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. As a result, Quanex stated that it had to construct Dalmine\u2019s COP using the COP of a U.S. domestic producer that had similar production processes and cost structure to Dalmine. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Dalmine objected to the information presented by Quanex. Dalmine\u2019s Letter of Dec. 2, 1994, AR Pub. Doc. 97, Fiche 17, Fr. 23. Dalmine claimed that the cost analysis was flawed because (1) the surrogate\u2019s cost should have been based on the fiscal year of 1994 instead of 1993; and (2) the International Trade Commission (\u201cITC \u201d) had found that the productivity of the U.S. domestic industry has been increasing since 1992, contrary to Quanex\u2019s representation that it had decreased. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Quanex responded to Dalmine\u2019s first comment by explaining that the 1994 and 1993 usage rates had been certified as identical by the party supplying the information. Quanex\u2019s Letter of Dec. 9, 1994 at 1-2, AR Non Pub. Doc. 25, Fiche 70, Fr. 25. With regard to the second comment, Quanex stated that the \u201caggregated data reported by the ITC simply has no relationship to the producer-specific and product-specific data used by petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Initially, Commerce decided not to initiate the COP investigation because it could not rely upon the cost data submitted by Quanex to show whether there were reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that below-cost sales were made. Mem. of Dec. 23,1994 from Team to Stafford, AR Non Pub. Doc. 33, Fiche 79, Fr. 28. Quanex objected to the decision not to initiate a COP investigation. Quanex\u2019s Letter of Jan. 3,1995, AR Non Pub. Doc. 34, Fiche 79, Fr. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">Commerce\u2019s Office of Accounting and Investigations consulted with Richard Weible, the Division Director of the Office of Agreements Compliance, and the in-house expert on matters relating to the steel industry. Mr. Weible analyzed Quanex\u2019s below-cost allegations and concluded that the methodology used by Quanex was reasonable. Mem. of Feb. 1, 1995 from Mr. Weible, AR Non Pub. Doc. 54, Fiche 81, Fr. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Taking into account the information submitted by Quanex and Dal-mine, Mr. Weible made several determinations. He agreed with Dalmine that seamless pipe mills produce products in specific size ranges, that producing pipe in smaller sizes will cost more, and that companies invariably have different production facilities which produce unique products with individual size range capabilities. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Weible recognized, however, that the size ranges may overlap from mill to mill. He stated that petitioners would be unable to make COP allegations if they were required to provide cost data for a comparable mill with the same product size range capacity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">Mr. Weible concluded that Quanex provided reasonably available evidence for determining whether Dalmine\u2019s sales were below-cost in a certain size. He based this conclusion on the fact that Quanex used the costs of 2 inch material from a surrogate that used the same process as Dal-mine to produce the product in its allegations. In addition, the size range capabilities of the surrogate and Dalmine overlapped in this size. <em>Id. </em>Fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>nally, the method used by Quanex when it calculated cost differentials, taking into account possible cost differences in producing pipe by different processes (rotary piercing versus the extrusion process), and then deriving costs in smaller sizes by using these differentials was reasonable if not somewhat conservative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-3\">In reconsidering its decision not to initiate a COP investigation, Commerce relied upon the following factors: (1) the similar production processes used by the surrogate and Dalmine despite the different size ranges; (2) the application of Quanex\u2019s cost ratios to costs developed from the surrogate\u2019s data, which provided a conservative result even though the ratios did not exactly reflect Dalmine\u2019s cost relationship; and (3) the rejection of Quanex\u2019s allegation because it was unable to obtain data from a mill with exactly the same product size range and production facilities would be unreasonable and inconsistent with Commerce\u2019s standard for initiation of COP investigations. Mem. of Feb. 1,1995 from Team to Stafford at 6, AR Non Pub. Doc. 53, Fiche 81, Fr. 33. Subsequently, Commerce found below COP sales for certain products. 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The Record Contains Substantial Evidence That Commerce Had Reasonable Grounds To Believe or Suspect below Cost-Oe-Production Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">An antidumping duty is calculated \u201cin an amount equal to the amount by which the foreign market value exceeds the United States price for the merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673. Usually, foreign market value is based upon the price at which the merchandise is sold in the market of the exporting country for home consumption or to third countries other than the United States. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l). However, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-7\">Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales in the home market of the country of exportation * * * have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of producing the merchandise in question, it shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of producing the merchandise. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">19U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b). Ifbelow costs sales were made in substantial quantities and over an extended period of time, they must be disregarded. <em>Id. </em>Commerce must then employ the constructed value (\u201cCV\u201d) of the merchandise if the remaining above-cost sales are inadequate for determining foreign market value. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">\u201cCommerce must have a \u2018specific and objective\u2019 basis for suspecting or believing that sales are being made at prices below the COP before initiating a COP investigation.\u201d <em>FMC Corp. v. United </em>States, 3 F.3d 424, 428 (Fed. Cir. 1993) <em>(citingAl Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>6 CIT 245, 250, 575 F.

However, as the Federal Circuit stated in <em>FMC:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-4\">[Petitioner] is not required under the statute to prove actual sales below the COE That is a job for Commerce.

In addition, this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-6\">There is no correlation between what constitutes reasonable grounds to the ITA, and what constitutes information reasonably available to the petitioner. Indeed, the information which is reasonably available to a particular petitioner can be substantially more or less consequential than what Commerce would consider reasonable grounds, depending on how resourceful the petitioner may be. Hence, the relative rigor of the standard will vary from case to case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\"><em>Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>15 CIT 456,460-61, 772 F. Supp. 1284, 1288 (1991) (emphasis added). Here, as recapped in the \u201cBackground\u201d of this section, the record shows Commerce had reasonable grounds to suspect that Dalmine was selling below cost. These reasonable grounds are sufficient to explain why Commerce reversed its decision not to perform a COP investigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">The Court also rejects Dalmine\u2019s assertions that Quanex\u2019s cost allegations were based on impermissibly non-contemporaneous information, and that the Surrogate\u2019s claim its 1993 and 1994 actual \u201cusage rates\u201d were identical is inherently implausible. Dalmine Brief at 47-50. The record reflects that Quanex did use contemporaneous information, <em>i.e., </em>from 1994, which was identical to the 1993 information, because it provided an Affidavit from an official of the surrogate which states that \u201cthe usage rates for the surrogate did not change between 1993 and 1994.\u201d Quanex Letter of Jan. 3, 1995. Dalmine\u2019s claim that identical rates are \u201cinherently implausible\u201d is speculative and unsupported by any competent evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">Dalmine also argues that the ITA unlawfully ignored its own practice requiring below cost allegations to be based on costs incurred by U.S. producers adjusted to reflect production costs in the country under investigation. Specifically, Dalmine claims that (a) Commerce made no effort to determine whether the Surrogate uses the same type of \u201ccontinuous mill\u201d that Dalmine uses, and (b) the Surrogate\u2019s per unit usage rates are biased against Dalmine because, it says, the Surrogate probably uses heavier, more expensive equipment to product its seam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>less pipe, given that its size range is likely larger than Dalmine\u2019s range of small diameter pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">Dalmine did not cite any statutory authority for its claim that Commerce\u2019s regulations require COP allegations to be \u201cadjusted for known differences\u201d in manufacturing processes. Nor did Dalmine demonstrate that it is Commerce\u2019s practice to require such adjustments. Nevertheless, the record contains substantial evidence that Commerce did consider these issues raised by Dalmine. <em>See </em>Mem. of Feb. 1, 1995 from Team to Stafford. The record states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-5\">we note that the surrogate and respondent use similar production processes, even though the size range of seamless pipe produced may not be the same. When petitioner\u2019s cost ratios are applied to cost developed from the surrogate\u2019s data, even if these ratios do not exactly reflect respondent\u2019s cost relationships, the result is conservative and, therefore, in respondent\u2019s favor. This is because petitioner\u2019s methodology yielded a lower cost per ton for the smaller diameter pipe, which generally is more expensive on a tonnage basis, than larger diameter pipe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 6. Thus, since Commerce\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is in accordance with law, Dalmine\u2019s argument is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">Finally, the Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument that the \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d from the Fourth Amendment is applicable to the initiation of a below-cost investigation. The exclusionary rule is applied in criminal cases or \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d cases to deter unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>United States v. Modes, Inc., </em>16 CIT 189, 192-94, 787 F. Supp. 1466, 1470-71 (1992). A quasi criminal case is one in which \u201cthe objective of those proceedings is to impose what appears to be a penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 787 F. Supp. at 1471. Thus, in civil proceedings, the exclusionary rule is applicable only \u201cwhere the \u2018object, like a criminal proceeding, is to penalize for the commission of an offense against the law.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 787 F. Supp. at 1469 (quoting <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 700, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 1250 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">This proceeding is not criminal or quasi-criminal in nature. The objective of the antidumping statute is not to penalize a respondent. <em>See NTNBearing Corp. v. United States, </em>74 F.3d. 1204,1208 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (recognizing that the antidumping laws are remedial rather than punitive) . Rather, the purpose of the proceeding is to assess duties that will in principle eliminate the unfair trade practice. <em>See Chaparral Steel Co. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 101,109, 901 F.2d 1097,1103 (1990) (purpose of duties is remedial because they are \u201cintended merely to prevent future harm to the domestic industry by reason of unfair imports that <em>arepresently </em>causing material injuries.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Consequently, the exclusionary rule is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The Initial Failure Op Quanex To Provide An Appropriate Public Version Of The Business Proprietary Allegations To The Below-Cost-Of-Product Petition Did Not Render ITAs Initiation Of The Below COP Investigation Improper</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The statute requires that when a document containing proprietary information is submitted to ITA, it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-6\"><em>shall </em>require that information for which proprietary treatment is requested be accompanied by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-7\">(A) either\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-8\">(i) a non-proprietary summary in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-9\">(ii) a statement that the information is not susceptible to summary accompanied by a statement of the reasons in support of the contention * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">19U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(b)(l) (emphasis added). The ITA\u2019s regulations on anti-dumping duties state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-11\"><em>Public Summary </em>* * * [N]ot later than one business day after submitting information for which proprietary treatment is requested, any person who requests proprietary treatment <em>shall </em>provide to the Secretary:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-12\">(1) An adequate public summary of all proprietary information, incorporated in the public version of the document (generally, <em>numeric data are adequately summarized if grouped or presented in terms of indices, or figures within 10 percent of the actual figure, and if an individual portion of the data is voluminous, at least one percent representative of that portion is individually summarized in this manner); </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-13\">(2) A statement itemizing those portions of the proprietary information which cannot be summarized adequately and all arguments supporting that conclusion for each portion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-14\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.32(b) (1994) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">There is no allegation or evidence in the record indicating Quanex\u2019s submission of below-cost allegations containing proprietary information was untimely. The issue concerns only the submission of the public version. The record reflects that Quanex did submit the necessary public summary. On January 17,1995, Commerce orally requested Quanex to submit a revised nonconfidential version of its November 22,1994 allegation of sales below cost. <em>See </em>Quanex\u2019s Letter of Jan. 17, 1995, AR Pub. Doc. 132, Fiche 26, Fr. 27. Quanex complied, and Commerce properly considered the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">The Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument that it was unable to gain a \u201creasonable understanding of the substance\u201d necessary to adequately participate in defending their interests against Quanex\u2019s below-cost allegations because a proper non-confidential summary was unavailable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>Dalmine Brief at 65. Dalmine\u2019s counsel had access to the proprietary document under an administrative protective order. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(c). Although Dalmine claims that \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s access to the business proprietary data under an APO is <em>no </em>substitute for the client\u2019s access to the public version of those data\u201d, Dalmine\u2019s Reply to Mem. In Opp. To Dalmine Brief at 15 (\u201cDalmine Reply\u201d), the Court notes that Dalmine\u2019s counsel was able to obtain sufficient cooperation from its client to craft its legal arguments in considerable depth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Dalmine\u2019s claim that the public version was insufficient under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.32(b) is rejected. Commerce\u2019s regulations provide that \u201cgenerally, numeric data are adequately summarized if grouped or presented in terms of indices, or figures within 10 percent of the actual figure. * * *\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.32(b)(1). The public version contained (1) indexed costs for each subcategory of cost in Exhibit 1 and (2) provided indexed costs for each stage of production and indexed usage rate and ranged cost subtotals for each stage of production in the cost buildup in Exhibit 2. Quanex\u2019s Letter of Jan. 17, 1995. Quanex did not include a public summary of the results of the below-cost analysis because it contained Dalmine\u2019s proprietary data which Quanex was not allowed to summarize. <em>Id. </em>Thus, there is substantial evidence on the record to support Commerce\u2019s initiation of the COP investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The Court Remands To ITA To Recalculate The COP And CV With Respect To DTPs Galvanized Products</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Commerce overstated Dalmine\u2019s actual COP for galvanized pipe produced by Dalmine Tubi Industriad S.r.l. (hereinafter \u201cDTI\u201d), a production subsidiary of Defendant-Intervenor Dalmine S.p.A., by improperly allocating factory overhead costs. Consequently, the Court remands for recalculation of the COP and CV with respect to DTI\u2019s galvanized products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">DTI produces Seamless Pipe at a facility known as the \u201cFAP mill.\u201d Cost Verif. Rep. at 2, AR Non Pub. Doc. 91, Fiche 92, Fr. 1. For certain galvanized pipes that Dalmine sold in the U.S. market, DTI produced the bare (ungalvanized) pipe at the FAP mill, and then used an unrelated third party to transport the bare pipe to a second unrelated third party for galvanizing. Response of Dalmine to the Dept\u2019s Section D Quest, at 44-45 (Dec. 19,1994), AR Non Pub. Doc. 29, Fiche 71-78. As a result, the galvanizing and transportation costs are incurred outside Dalmine\u2019s production facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">In the Final Determination, ITA made certain adjustments to Dal-mine\u2019s previously reported factory overhead costs. 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,986. Commerce agrees, and the record reflects, that these adjustments resulted in the overstatement of the factory overhead costs attributable to galvanized pipe. An error occurred when Commerce applied revised cost variance and overhead rates. At that time, Commerce calculated the overall variance rate as the total variance to total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>standard cost. When the variance rate was applied to the cost of manufacturing which included galvanizing costs, the COP and CV were overstated. Defendants\u2019 Mem. at 45-46. Although a request by Commerce for remand does not control the Court, see <em>Hylsa, S.A. De C.V v. United States, </em>960 F. Supp. 320,322 (CIT 1997), in this case there is substantial evidence on the record that an error in calculation occurred. Consequently, this issue is remanded to Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The ITA\u2019s Decision To Attribute A Portion Of IRTs Interest Expenses To Dalmine\u2019s COP And CV Is Supported By Substantial Evidence On The Record And Is In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"AjNM\">Commerce attributed a portion of the consolidated interest expense reported by Dalmine\u2019s parent company, IRI S.p.A.,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to Dalmine\u2019s COP and CV Dalmine claims that this action distorted its actual interest expenses. For the reasons that follow, the Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">Commerce used the interest expense of IRI for calculating Dalmine\u2019s CV and COP instead of Dalmine\u2019s own financing costs. Because IRI\u2019s 1994 audited consolidated financial statements were not available, Commerce used IRI\u2019s 1993 statements. Mem. from Theresa L. Caherty, Accountant to Christian Marsh, Director, Office of Accounting, Verification of COP and CV at 26 (May 10,1995), ARNonPub. Doc. 91, Fiche 92, Fr. 1. In the Final Determination, Commerce explained its actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-9\">The Department\u2019s long-standing practice is to calculate interest expense for COP/CV purposes from the borrowing costs incurred by the consolidated group. Silicon Metal from Brazil, 56 Fed. Reg. at 26,986 (1991). This methodology, which has been upheld by the CIT in Camargo Correo Metals, S.A. v. U.S., Slip Op. 93-163 (CIT 1993), is based on the fact that the consolidated group\u2019s controlling entity has the power to determine the capital structure of each member of the group. IRI has such power since it owns a substantial majority of Dalmine through ILVA. In addition, although the respondent claims that IRI does not exercise control over Dalmine\u2019s operations, it is the Department\u2019s position that majority equity ownership is prima facie evidence of corporate control. See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: New Minivans from Japan (Minivans), 57 FR 21946 (May 26, 1992). The respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that IRI\u2019s consolidated financing expense would distort Dalmine\u2019s financing costs. In Minivans, we determined that, as a member of a consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>group of companies, the operations of a financing company remain under the controlling influence of the group. Like other members of the consolidated group, the financing company\u2019s capital structure is determined largely within the group. Consequently, its interest income and expense are as much as part of the group\u2019s overall borrowing experience as any other member company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-4\">Lastly, we do not consider it more appropriate to use Dalmine\u2019s 1994 consolidated figures over IRI\u2019s 1993 consolidated figures simply because Dalmine\u2019s audited information more closely relates to the time period of the POI. We have no reason to believe that IRI\u2019s 1993 audited financial statement interest expense data is not representative of the POI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Commerce\u2019s Calculation Of Dalmine\u2019s Interest Expense For COP And CV Purposes From The Borrowing Costs Incurred By The Consolidated Group Is Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">When calculating CV Commerce adds \u201can amount for general expenses and profit equal to that usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same general class or kind as the merchandise under consideration * * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(l)(B), to the cost of materials and of fabrication or other processing. According to Commerce\u2019s regulations, COP is based on the cost of materials, fabrication and general expenses incurred in the production of such or similar merchandise. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.51(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">Congress has not clarified what \u201cgeneral expenses\u201d are or how they are calculated. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(l)(B). Pursuant to the discretion granted to it by Congress, then, Commerce devised a methodology for calculating general expenses. Commerce includes in general expenses both (1) selling, general and administrative expenses, and (2) financial expenses. <em>See, </em>e.g., Verification of COP and CV Mem. of May 10, 1995 from Caherty to Marsh, Director, Office of Accounting, at 24-27, AR Non Pub. Doc. 91, Fiche 92, Fr. 1 (setting forth the basic steps Commerce performed during verification of Dalmine\u2019s general expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">IRI is Dalmine\u2019s ultimate parent. As a result, Commerce attributed a portion of the consolidated interest expense reported by IRI on its consolidated financial statements to Dalmine\u2019s reported COP and CV and thus calculated Dalmine\u2019s interest expense from the borrowing costs incurred by the consolidated group as a whole. Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">Dalmine does not disagree that Commerce may use the consolidated interest expense from a parent company when the subsidiary is being investigated. Rather, Dalmine claims that in this case, Commerce should have used Dalmine\u2019s own financing costs instead of those of IRI. Although Dalmine was able to cite to other cases in which the ITA treated consolidated interest expenses differently from this case, those decisions were presumably supported by substantial evidence on the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>ministrative record which justified a change in Commerce\u2019s practice. As discussed in more detail below, Dalmine was not able to provide support for its contentions through cites to the record. Thus, the Court finds Commerce\u2019s practice to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The Record Does Not Contain Substantial Evidence that IRI Does Not Exercise Control Over Dalmine\u2019s Operations</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">Commerce\u2019s practice is to consider majority equity ownership to be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of parent control over a subsidy. As a result, Dal-mine had the burden of submitting evidence to Commerce rebutting this presumption. Dalmine failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">The Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s assertion that while IRI legally controls a majority of Dalmine\u2019s shares, it exercises no effective production, marketing, or managerial control over Dalmine\u2019s operations. Dalmine Brief at 72. Although Dalmine claims that Dalmine S.p.A. operates as an independent, profit-maximizing corporation, without the financial assistance of IRI or any IRI-affiliated party, <em>id., </em>the record does not contain substantial evidence to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">In support of Dalmine\u2019s argument that it is independent, Dalmine cites to the verification report issued by ITC in the companion countervailing duty investigation of the subject merchandise. <em>See </em>Mem. from McGinty and Wilkniss to Kuhbach at 5, Annex K to Dalmine\u2019s Case Brief. The report states that \u201c[w]e asked IRI officials how much discretion IRI exercises when presented with a subsidiary\u2019s business plan. Officials explained that IRI may make suggestions and may assist in and follow the activities of the subsidiary, but its involvement is limited to an advisory role.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Dalmine\u2019s citation to the verification report issued by the ITC in the companion countervailing duty investigation does not rectify the failure of Dalmine to provide evidence during the administrative proceeding in the antidumping investigation that IRI had no such control over Dal-mine\u2019s capital structure, production, selling, or management decisions. Dalmine failed to provide Commerce with substantial evidence on the record to necessitate a change in practice in this case. Further, because countervailing duty laws are directed at a different type of unfair trade practice than antidumping duty laws, an antidumping proceeding is not bound by findings in a countervailing duty proceeding. <em>See Aimcor, Alabama Silicon, Inc. v. United States, </em>18 CIT1117,1123,871F. Supp. 447, 453 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">The Record Does Not Contain Substantial Evidence In Support Of Dalmine\u2019s Assertion That IRI Does Not Have The Power To Determine Dalmine\u2019s Capital Structure</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">The Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument that because IRI allegedly did not have the capability of changing Dalmine\u2019s capital structure at will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>Commerce acted unlawfully in resorting to IRI financial data. Dalmine Brief at 74-75. The ITA has a \u201cwell-established practice of deriving net financing costs based on the borrowing experience of the consolidated group of companies * * *. [The ITA\u2019s] practice is based on the fact that the group\u2019s parent, primary operating company, or other controlling entity, because of its influential ownership interest, has the power to determine the capital structure of each member company within the group.\u201d Minivans, 57 Fed. Reg. at 21,946. Dalmine has interpreted this statement to mean that the majority equity owner must be able to change the capital structure of subsidiaries at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-3\">Dalmine\u2019s argument is flawed because Commerce does not require the parent company to be able to change the capital structure \u201cat will\u201d. Rather, Commerce\u2019s policy is based on the rebuttable presumption that \u201cmajority equity ownership is prima facie evidence of corporate control.\u201d <em>Minivans, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 21,946.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">Dalmine also argues that the ITA has focused on only the legal relationship between IRI and Dalmine even though there is an absence of any distortive financial transactions between them. Dalmine Reply at 46. This, according to Dalmine, is contrary to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>FAG Kugelfischer v. United States, </em>932 F. Supp. 315 (CIT 1996). In FAG <em>Kugelfischer, </em>the Court found that the administrative record did not support ITA\u2019s decision to collapse the sales of two sister companies for purposes of calculating dumping margins. The Court observed that ITA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-5\">focused on \u201cpotential\u201d rather than \u201cactual\u201d influence that [the sister companies\u2019 parent] may assert over its subsidiaries. This potential for influence absent consideration of other factors is not enough to create a strong possibility of price manipulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\"><em>FAG Kugelfischer is </em>inapposite here. In <em>FAG Kugelfischer, </em>Commerce collapsed the companies for purposes of calculating dumping margins because of its concern that \u201cgranting two related companies separate treatment creates an incentive to evade the dumping order by making U.S. sales through whichever company has a lower margin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322. Those concerns are not at issue in this case. Here, Commerce is not dealing with sister companies. Instead, it is looking at the parent-subsidiary relationship. It is simply following its practice of considering Dalmine\u2019s ownership by IRI to <em>be prima facie </em>evidence of IRI\u2019s control. Dalmine failed to rebut Commerce\u2019s presumption that there is \u201cactual\u201d influence in this situation. Thus, Commerce\u2019s actions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">The Record Does Not Contain Substantial Evidence That By Using IRTs Consolidated Interest Expense, Commerce Is Distorting Dalmine\u2019s True Financing Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">The Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument that by using IRI\u2019s consolidated interest expense, ITA is distorting Dalmine\u2019s true financing expenses. Dalmine Brief at 76. For the reasons discussed below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>Commerce\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Commerce normally uses a parent company\u2019s consolidated financial statements even in cases involving consolidated groups whose member companies are involved in a wide variety of business activities. <em>Minivans, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 21,946. Thus, it is irrelevant that \u201cIRI is ahuge government-owned holding company, with equity interests in diverse operations.\u201d Dalmine\u2019s Case Brief at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">In addition, Commerce will allow respondents to \u201cpresent! ] evidence sufficient to show that the Department\u2019s practice of calculating interest expense based on the consolidated group of companies would result in any distortion of the true financing costs of [the subsidiaries\u2019] operations.\u201d Minivans, 57 Fed. Reg. at 21,946. Thus, Commerce will change its practice of using a parent company\u2019s consolidated financial statement regardless of the activities of its member companies when presented with the appropriate information. Nothing in the record of this case indicates Dalmine gave Commerce any evidence that would have justified different treatment. The ITA\u2019s actions, then, are supported by substantial evidence on the record and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">The ITA\u2019s Decision That Dalmine\u2019s Own Consolidated Interest Expense Does Not Reflect The Full Financing Cost For The Subject Merchandise Is Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">Dalmine argues that it is reasonable to conclude the consolidated interest expense reported in its financial statements is the full financing cost for the pipe in issue. The role of the Court, however, is to determine not the reasonableness of a party\u2019s position, but that of Commerce\u2019s method in reaching its position. <em>See </em>Chevron, <em>supra. </em>Here, Commerce\u2019s method is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">In conducting a COP/CV investigation, the ITA\u2019s goal is to calculate the full actual cost to produce the subject merchandise. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b). Commerce based its calculations on the IRI consolidated expense. Although it might also be reasonable for Commerce to have based its calculations on Dalmine S.p.A.\u2019s consolidated statements, the Court may only determine whether Commerce\u2019s method was a reasonable one. In view of the presumption that majority equity ownership of a subsidiary as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of corporate control, Commerce\u2019s use of IRI\u2019s consolidated expense is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">Commerce\u2019s Decision To Use The 1993 IRI Consolidated Interest Expense Is Supported By Substantial Evidence On The Record And In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-16\">The Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument that Commerce should have used its 1994 audited consolidated interest expense because that is allegedly more probative information for production and sales during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>POI than 1993 IRI consolidated interest. Dalmine Brief at 82. Unless contrary evidence is provided, the prior year is assumed to be reasonably representative of the company\u2019s normal experience. <em>See Furfuryl Alcohol from Thailand, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 22,557, 22,561 (May 8, 1995). Commerce will use the prior-year consolidated financials when more current financials are unavailable so long as they reasonably reflect the current financial situation. <em>Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, </em>58 Fed.

See, e.g., Timken v. United States, 852 F. Supp. 1040,1048 (CIT 1994). The Department does not, however, offset interest expense with interest income earned on long-term investments because long-term interest income does not relate to current operations. See, e.g., Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 31734 (July 11,1991). * * * [W]e were able to determine the amount of short-term interest income for the consolidated IRI group * * * and have applied short-term interest income as an offset to Dalmine\u2019s financing costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 31,991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The ITA Properly reduced IRPs Interest Expenses By Short-Term Interest Income Only</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">The Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s argument that the ITA\u2019s interest policy improperly treats the same categories of interest expense and interest income differently. Dalmine states that the ITA is claiming that all of a respondent\u2019s debt (that is, both long- and short-term borrowings) is used to fund a \u201ccompany\u2019s current operations,\u201d but only its short-term investments are related to current operations for offset purposes. Dal-mine Brief at 83. Dalmine argues that the ITA should treat interest paid and interest received by a company in the same manner. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84. Dalmine concludes that long-term debt \u201cfund[s] the company\u2019s current operations,\u201d and long-term interest income must also be taken into account in calculating a respondent\u2019s net interest expense. <em>Id. </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Commerce allows respondents to submit proof that interest on long-term investments is related to current operations. The respondent needs to show Commerce that there is \u201ca nexus between the reported interest income\u201d and its \u201cmanufacturing operation\u201d. <em>NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, </em>905 F. Supp. 1083, 1097 (CIT 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">The record shows that Dalmine did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the nexus to convince Commerce to use a different method. <em>See </em>Final Determination, 60 Fed. Reg. at 31,990-91. The Court rejects Dalmine\u2019s claim that companies may be unable to establish a nexus between its reported long-term interest income and its ordinary operations because money is generally considered to be fungible, regardless of where it is sourced or applied, Dalmine Reply at 53-54, as speculative. The Court affirms Commerce\u2019s treatment of IRI\u2019s interest expenses as supported by substantial evidence on the record and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">The ITA\u2019s Rejection As New Information Of Certain Documents That Dalmine Submitted With Their Reply Brief In Response To Quanex\u2019s Case Brief Was Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">Commerce rejected two sets of documents attached to Dalmine\u2019s reply brief as new information and refused to consider them, but allowed Dalmine to submit a reply brief with the \u201cnew\u201d information deleted from it. Dalmine argues that \u201cdue process and fairness required that they be given an opportunity to rebut new arguments advanced for the first time in [Quanex\u2019s] Case Brief. \u201d Dalmine Brief at 23-24.

Doc. 255, Fiche 50, Fr. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">The ITA Properly Rejected Certain Documents Attached To Dalmine\u2019s Reply Brief</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">This Court has recognized that foreign respondents have a right to due process in antidumping proceedings. <em>Sugiyama Chain Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 423, 436, 852 F. Supp. 1103, 1115 (1994). This right is limited by the lack of a Constitutional right to import merchandise into the United States or to engage in foreign trade. <em>See American Ass\u2019n of Exporters and Importers v. United States, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) 58, 71, 751F.2d 1239,1250 (1985) (\u201cNo one has a protectable interest to engage in international trade.\u201d). Consequently, parties simply have a right to the procedures set forth in the antidumping statute or in the agency regulations implementing that statute. <em>See Remira Fibres Oy v. United States, </em>18 CIT 687, 694, 858 F. Supp. 229, 235 (1994) (\u2018judicial review of administrative determinations can only be meaningful under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment if the reviews have been initiated in compliance with the procedures which Congress has set forth in statutes and which Commerce has implemented in its regulations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">The regulation concerning the submission of factual information reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-9\">[Submissions of factual information for the Secretary\u2019s consideration shall be submitted not later than:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-10\">(i) For the Secretary\u2019s final determination, seven days before the scheduled date on which the verification is to commence; * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-11\">(3) The Secretary will not consider in the final determination or the final results, or retain in the record of the proceeding, any factual information submitted after the applicable time limit. The Secretary will return such information to the submitter with written notice stating the reasons for the return of the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.31(a)(1) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>After the Preliminary Determination is issued, Commerce allows an interested party to submit a \u201ccase brief\u201d. This brief must \u201cseparately present in full all arguments that continue in the submitter\u2019s view to be relevant to the Secretary\u2019s final determination * * *, including any arguments presented before the date of publication of the preliminary determination * * 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.38(c)(1) and (2). An interested party may also submit a \u201crebuttal brief\u201d separately presenting in full all rebuttal arguments and \u201cresponding only to arguments raised in case briefs.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.38(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">In <em>Acciai Speciali Terni, S.p.A. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 95-142, at 18 (Aug. 7, 1995), this Court did not require the ITC to provide any opportunity to rebut factual information submitted after the deadline for posthearing briefs even though the agency requested the information. Further, in <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 955, 699 F. Supp. 300 (1988), the Court rejected a respondent\u2019s claim that it should have been given an opportunity to comment on a telex placed in the record eight days before publication of the final determination. The Court noted that the record contained many examples of respondent\u2019s involvement in the investigation which convinced the Court that respondent received adequate procedural rights. <em>Id. </em>at 966, 699 F. Supp. at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Dalmine has received all the process that was due to it. The relevant regulation notifies the parties that Commerce will not consider'untimely factual information. Commerce\u2019s policy of setting time limits on the submission of factual information is reasonable because Commerce \u201cclearly cannot complete its work unless it is able at some point to \u2018freeze\u2019 the record and make calculations and findings based on that fixed and certain body of information. <em>\u201d Bowe-Passat v. United States, </em>17 CIT 335, 339 (1993). There has been no unusual conduct by Commerce which deprived Dalmine of its due process rights. Indeed, Dalmine was permitted to submit a rebuttal brief in which Dalmine responded to Quanex\u2019s arguments. Consequently, the Court upholds Commerce\u2019s decision to reject as \u201cnew\u201d the evidentiary material attached to Dalmine\u2019s rebuttal brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">For the foregoing reasons, this matter is remanded to Commerce with instructions that Commerce shall re-calculate the COP and CV with respect to DTI\u2019s galvanized products. Commerce\u2019s actions on all other issues contested in Dalmine\u2019s Motion For Judgment Upon The Agency Record are affirmed. Quanex\u2019s Motion For Judgment Upon The Agency Record is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-17\"> This case was consolidated. As a result, Defendant-Intervenors are also Plaintiffs on certain issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1032-12\"> Because this case involves many issues, the specific facts involving each issue will be discussed separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1032-13\"> This case is governed by the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, that were in effect prior to 1 January 1995, the effective date of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Pub. L. No. 465,103d Cong., 2d Sess., 108 Stat. 4809 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1037-12\"> Asa result of the Court\u2019s determination that Commerce\u2019s exclusion of the ASTM A-335 pipe used in boiler applications from the antidumping calculations is reasonable, Quanex\u2019s claims that Commerce erred (1) in not applying BIA to these sales to calculate a margin and (2) that the BIA used should have been adverse, are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">A final determination of dumping may only be based on verified information or the best information otherwise available (\u201cBIA!\u2019). 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e (1988). BIA is used whenever: (1) ITA is unable to verify the accuracy of information provided in a response, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b); (2) a party or any other person \u201crefuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c), or (3) a party or any other person \u201csignificantly impedes an investigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">Here, none of the statutory triggers providing for the application of BIA have been met. Dalmine was not put on notice that the ASTM A-335 pipe used in boiler applications was included in the investigation In other words, the ITA never \u201crequested\u201d this information from Dalmine. The ITA, in its discretion, determined that the ambiguous scope description excused Dalmine\u2019s failure to report this pipe and did not find that Dalmine had \u201csignificantly impeded the investigation\u201d on this issue. Because Commerce\u2019s determination not to apply BIA is affirmed by this Court, it follows that Commerce\u2019s determination not to apply adverse BIA is also affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1039-13\"> The Court, because it has affirmed Commerce\u2019s application of adverse BIA, does not need to reach Quanex\u2019s argument that Commerce\u2019s five percent exclusion policy \u201cis beyond Commerce\u2019s statutory authority and would be contrary to law if applied in this case.\u201d Mem.

It appears from the record that is exactly what Commerce meant, if they contain the subject stencils.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1043-11\"> Draconian: barbarously severe; harsh; cruel. Webster\u2019s <em>New International </em>Dictionary; Unabridged, 780 (2d ed. 1954). The ITA\u2019s actions in this instance do not rise close to the level of \u201cdraconian\u201d. Indeed, the ITA\u2019s treatment of these sales is consistent with its treatment of the ASTM A-335 pipes used in boiler applications discussed previously and from which Dalmine benefited when the ITA decided to exclude those sales from the margin calculation. Dalmine is asking the Court to require ITA to treat these products differently, which the Court declines to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1046-10\"> The Court need not reach Quanex\u2019s argument that this issue is moot because actual below-cost sales were found. Quanex Response at 55 Further, at oral argument held on February 26,1997, counsel for Quanex admitted that if this issue were remanded it would not be entitled to submit information obtained during the below-cost sales investigation. Quanex misread <em>Koyo Seiko Co. v. United Stales&gt; </em>16 CIT 740, 796 F Supp. 517 (1992), which permitted the petitioner only to \u201csupplement its allegation of below-cost-of-production sales with information not derived from [ITA\u2019s] investigation of below-cost-of-production sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745, 796 F.
