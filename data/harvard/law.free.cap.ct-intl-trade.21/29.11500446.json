Plaintiffs challenge the United States Department of Labor\u2019s (\u201cLabor\u201d or \u201cDepartment\u201d) determination that the former employees of Shaw Pipe, Incorporated\u2019s (\u201cShaw Pipe\u201d) Highland, Pennsylvania facility are not eligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits because they do not produce an article within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(3) (1994). Plaintiffs assert Labor\u2019s determination that plaintiffs are ineligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits is not supported by substantial evidence on the record and is not otherwise in accordance with law. Plaintiffs move this Court to vacate the determination and remand this matter to the Department of Labor for further consideration and redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-15\">Defendant asserts the Department of Labor\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence on the record and should be affirmed by this Court. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(d) (1994), and for the reasons set forth below grants plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment upon the agency record, vacates the Department\u2019s determination finding it unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and not otherwise in accordance with law, and remands the matter to the Department of Labor for further appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Plaintiffs are a group of approximately thirty-five workers who were separated from Shaw Pipe\u2019s Highspire, Pennsylvania facility which was closed on August 12,1994. Three former employees filed a petition with the Department of Labor on behalf of all separated employees for trade adjustment assistance on January 3, 1995. Plaintiffs characterized Shaw Pipe\u2019s Highspire, Pennsylvania facility as producing \u201csmall diameter steel pipe coated with polyethylene coating\u201d and \u201clarge diameter steel pipe coated with concrete coating.\u201d (Admin. R. at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Labor initiated its investigation into plaintiffs\u2019 petition on January 3, 1995. On February 8,1995, Labor sent a questionnaire to the plant accountant at Shaw Pipe\u2019s Highspire, Pennsylvania facility requesting information regarding operations conducted at that facility. [</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On February 23,1994, the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, Department of Labor, reached a final negative determination, concluding the former employees of Shaw Pipe\u2019s Highspire facility were not eligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits. <em>See Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 13,177 (Dep\u2019t Comm. 1995). The basis for the Department\u2019s negative determination was its conclusion \u201cthe workers * * * do not produce an article within the meaning of Section 222(3) of the Act.\u201d (Admin. R. at 17.) Labor\u2019s determination went on to note \u201cworkers of Shaw Pipe, Incorporated, Highspire, Pennsylvania may be certified only if their separation was caused importantly by a reduced demand for their services from a parent firm, a firm otherwise related to the subject firm by ownership, or a firm related by control.\u201d The determination concluded \u201c[tjhese conditions have not been met\u201d and accordingly denied plaintiffs\u2019 application for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">A. <em>Plaintiffs:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Plaintiffs advance two arguments in challenging the Department\u2019s determination which found plaintiffs ineligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits. First, plaintiffs challenge the Department\u2019s failure to \u201cindicate any investigation of whether these were in fact \u2018articles\u2019 within the meaning of the Trade Act of 1974,\u201d and assert \u201cthere is no support in the agency record for the order entered in this action.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Br. at 10.) Additionally, plaintiffs characterize the Department\u2019s analysis as \u201cdeficient and more like a post hoc analysis.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Br. at 9.) Plaintiffs specifically challenge the failure of the investigation to include \u201csales or production figures for any of the relevant time periods,\u201d its \u201cfailure] to discuss the time frame in which these articles were produced,\u201d and the Department\u2019s failure to determine if any imports of the products at issue entered the United States. (Pis.\u2019 Br. at 11.) Plaintiffs also challenge the Department\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>verify Shaw Pipe\u2019s statements concerning loss of contracts and decreased sales, and its failure to determine whether there were any imports of the product at issue. Plaintiffs assert this absence of evidence in the record \u201cfails to provide the court with an opportunity to review the basis of the administrative decision.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">Second, plaintiffs assert an investigator at the Department of Labor improperly supplemented the administrative record on June 1,1995, by including in the record a letter received from Shaw Pipe after the Department reached its final determination on February 24,1995. Plaintiffs note the Labor investigator\u2019s memorandum to the files concerning the letter stated \u201csome of the investigator notes relevant to the findings of the investigation were missing\u201d and therefore, the plaintiffs contend, \u201cthe [Department of Labor] failed to follow the rules for conducting a proper investigation.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Remand (Pis.\u2019 Br.) at 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Plaintiffs contend these alleged flaws in the investigation require this Court to vacate Labor\u2019s determination finding plaintiffs ineligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits, and request the Court grant its motion so \u201cthis action [may] be remanded to the Department of Labor for a more complete and adequate investigation and redetermination.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Br. at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">B. <em>Defendant:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Defendant opposes plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment upon the agency record, contending Labor\u2019s determination should be upheld as supported by substantial evidence on the record and otherwise in accordance with law. Specifically, defendant contends the Department properly declined to certify plaintiffs for trade adjustment assistance benefits because the conduct engaged in by plaintiffs does not constitute the production of an article as defined by \u00a7 222(3) of the Trade Act of 1974. Defendant notes in order to be eligible to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits, \u201cincreases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such workers\u2019 firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof, [must] contribute[] importantly to such total or partial separation, or threat thereof, and to such decline in sales or production.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pis.\u2019 Mot. for J. on Admin. R. (Def.\u2019s Br.) at 5 (quoting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(3) (1988)) (emphasis omitted).) Defendant asserts the Department\u2019s determination is in accordance with law because \u201cpipe coating is a service, not an article.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 6.) Additionally, defendant contends substantial evidence on the record supports the Department\u2019s determination that plaintiffs were not employed as service workers by a firm which produces articles adversely affected by increased imports, and therefore are ineligible to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In reviewing determinations of the Department of Labor denying certification of eligibility to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>this Court will sustain the Department\u2019s determination when it is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2395(b) \u2014 (c) (1994); <em>see also Former Employees of General Electric Corp. v. Labor Department, </em>14 CIT 608, 611 (1990). \u201cSubstantial evidence has been held to be more than a\u2018mere scintilla,\u2019 but sufficient evidence to reasonably support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Former Employees of General Electric Corp., </em>14 CIT at 611 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In reviewing Labor\u2019s determination, this Court will give deference \u201c\u2018to the agency\u2019s chosen [investigative] technique, only remanding a case if that technique is so marred that the Secretary\u2019s finding is arbitrary or of such a nature that it could not be based on \u2018substantial evidence.\u201d\u201d <em>Former Employees of CSX Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 645, 651, 720 F. Supp. 1002, 1008 (1989) (quoting <em>United Glass &amp; Ceramic Workers of North America v. Marshall, </em>584 F.2d 398, 404-05 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In order to certify a group of workers as eligible to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits as provided for under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974, the Secretary of Labor must determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in such workers\u2019 firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">(2) that sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such workers\u2019 firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof contributed importantly to such total or partial separation, or threat thereof, and to such decline in sales or production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a) (1994). It is well-settled that in order to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits, plaintiffs must satisfy all three requirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974. <em>See, e.g., Former Employees of Bass Enterprises Production Co. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 68, 70, 706 F. Supp. 897, 900 (1989) (citation omitted) (\u201c[FJailure to satisfy any one of the three criteria of certification of workers for assistance will result in denial of adjustment assistance.\u201d); <em>Abbott v. Donovan, </em>8 CIT 237, 239, 596 F. Supp. 472, 474 (1984) (\u201cIf any of these three statutory conditions does not exist, the Secretary must deny certification.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">In the case presently before the Court, the Department of Labor determined plaintiffs are ineligible to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits because plaintiffs do not satisfy the requirements of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(3) (1994). More specifically, Labor\u2019s negative determination stated \u201c[t]he investigation revealed that the workers of Shaw Pipe, Incorporated, Highspire, Pennsylvania do not produce an article within the meaning of Section 222(3) of the Act.\u201d (Admin. R. at 17.) The deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ruination continued on to note \u201c[t]he Department of Labor has consistently determined that the performance of services does not constitute production of an article, as required by Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs challenge the Department\u2019s determination, asserting it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and not otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">This Court has interpreted the language in Section 222(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, in several opinions. One of the first significant opinions interpreting that portion of the statute, however, was decided in 1979 by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In <em>Fortin v. Marshall, </em>608 F.2d 525, 526 (1st Cir. 1979), the First Circuit sustained the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination that employees of a commercial airline who \u201cperformed a variety of passenger, cargo, mechanical, administrative and managerial tasks\u201d did not produce an article within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3), and therefore, were not eligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits. In sustaining the Secretary\u2019s determination, the Court noted \u201c[t]o interpret air transportation services as \u2018articles produced\u2019 within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3) is to strain severely, if not fracture, the statutory language\u201d and concluded \u201cwe do not think air transportation service is a \u2018product\u2019 or an \u2018article\u2019 in the ordinary sense of these words.\u201d <em>Fortin, </em>608 F.2d at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">A second opinion addressing the language in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3) was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1981. In <em>Pemberton v. Marshall, </em>639 F.2d 798 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the District of Columbia Circuit sustained the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination that shipyard employees who repaired and maintained marine vessels<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were not eligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits because they did not produce an article within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3). In noting the employees\u2019 actions were \u201cclearly a service to an existing commodity,\u201d the District of Columbia Circuit stated \u201c[e]ven if the repair necessitates the use of new materials, it cannot be said to be the creation of a new ship * * *. Semantics do not overcome the reality that nothing new is entering the stream of commerce.\u201d <em>Pemberton, </em>639 F.2d at 800. The Court sustained the Secretary\u2019s determination of ineligibility, noting \u201c[tjhere was no transformation, but a mere refurbishing of what already existed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In <em>Woodrum v. Donovan, </em>5 CIT 191, 564 F. Supp. 826 (1983), this Court sustained the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination that an automobile dealer\u2019s former employees who prepared and serviced new auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>mobiles prior to their retail sale<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were not eligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits because they did not produce an article within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3). Additionally, the Court formulated a test for analyzing whether employees satisfy the requirements of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3). The Court, utilizing the analysis of the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Pemberton, </em>stated in order to satisfy the requirements of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3), employees must \u201cmanufacture or creat[\u00e9] * * * something tangible. The <em>Pemberton </em>test is whether the workers in question transformed articles into new and different articles.\u201d <em>Woodrum, </em>5 CIT at 198, 564 F. Supp. at 831. In sustaining the Secretary\u2019s determination of ineligibility, the Court concluded \u201c[t]here is no evidence which indicates that plaintiffs made substantial changes to the new Chrysler cars resulting in their transformation into a new end product.\u201d <em>Woodrum, </em>5 CIT at 198, 564 F. Supp. at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Finally, this Court again addressed the requirements of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3) in Nagy <em>v. Donovan, </em>6 CIT 141, 571 F. Supp. 1261 (1983). In <em>Nagy, </em>the Court sustained the Secretary\u2019s determination that employees who cut grooves or channels into wheel hubs for four-wheel drive vehicles were ineligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits. In analyzing the case law interpreting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3), the Court stated the cases discussed above \u201cdemonstrate that the term \u2018article,\u2019 as used in section 222(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, does not embrace activity by a worker that does not result in the creation or manufacture of a tangible commodity, <em>or that does not cause the transformation of an existing product into a new and different article\u201d Nagy, </em>6 CIT at 145, 571 F. Supp. at 1264 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">These cases clearly establish that employees who provide or deliver services are not eligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits. <em>See, e.g., Woodrum v. Donovan, </em>5 CIT 191, 564 F. Supp. 826 (1983) (sustaining Secretary ofLabor\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 222(3) of the Trade Act of 1974 maintaining the phrase \u201carticles produced\u201d does not include the performance of services unrelated to the production of a tangible article); <em>Pemberton v. Marshall, </em>639 F.2d 798, 800 (D.C. Cir. 1981) <em>(\u201cFortin </em>* * * leaves no doubt that services do not fall within the terms of \u00a7 2272.\u201d); <em>Fortin v. Marshall, </em>608 F.2d 525, 527 (1st Cir. 1979) (\u201cWhen read in the context of the entire Trade Act, * * * it becomes clear that the term \u2018article\u2019 was plainly meant to refer to a tangible thing and not to a service. \u201d). Additionally, these cases establish a test to determine whether plaintiffs applying to the Department of Labor for certification of eligibility to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits satisfy the statutory requirements of eligibility. In order to be eligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits, an applicant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201ccreate or manufacture a tangible commodity, or transform it into a new and different article.\u201d <em>Nagy, </em>6 CIT at 145, 571 F. Supp. at 1264. With respect to the present case, however, the court finds the record does not contain substantial evidence supporting the Departments determination that the former employees of Shaw Pipe\u2019s Highspire facility are ineligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits because the pipe coating operations they conducted constituted a service for their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In the previously decided cases discussed above, the Court sustained the Department of Labor\u2019s denials of certification where the record contained evidence the plaintiffs\u2019 work did not transform the product in any material manner, i.e. where the beginning and end product were the same. <em>See, e.g., Nagy v. Donovan, </em>6 CIT 141, 145, 571 F. Supp. 1261, 1264 (1983) (finding the product on which plaintiff worked \u201cwas clearly the beginning and the end product\u201d and that \u201c[p]laintiff * * * merely serviced an already completed article\u201d); <em>Woodrum v. Donovan, </em>5 CIT 191, 198, 564 F. Supp. 826, 831-32 (1983) (noting that \u201cby their own admission, * * * plaintiffs did not manufacture new articles\u201d and that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cwork consisted of adjustments and preparation of the tangible article which was also the end product* * *. There is no evidence which indicates that plaintiffs made substantial changes to the new Chrysler cars resulting in their transformation into a new end product.\u201d); <em>Pemberton v. Marshall, </em>639 F.2d 798, 800 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (observing \u201cthe service did involve a tangible item \u2014 a ship \u2014 but the <em>same </em>item was also the end product. There was no transformation, but a mere refurbishing of what already existed.\u201d). With respect to the present matter, however, the Court finds the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the Labor Department\u2019s determination findings plaintiffs ineligible for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits. Indeed, the Court notes the record simply states \u201c[t]he workers apply protective coatings to steel pipe.\u201d (Admin. R. at 17.) The Court finds this statement insufficient to support the conclusion plaintiffs merely performed a service for Shaw Pipe\u2019s customers. With the exception of an argument addressed below, the Court finds no other information in the record suggesting or supporting the Department of Labor\u2019s conclusion that Shaw Pipe\u2019s pipe coating operations conducted in Highspire, Pennsylvania constituted a service.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The absence of any evidence in the record indicating whether plaintiffs satisfy the test established in the <em>Nagy </em>opinion requires this Court to remand the case to the Department of Labor. On remand, the Department of Labor-shall determine whether plaintiffs \u201ccreate or manufacture a tangible commodity, or transform it into a new and different article, \u201d and thus whether plaintiffs satisfy the requirement of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(3) that, in order to be eligible for certification, applicants for trade adjustment assistance produce an article within the meaning of the statute. Should the Department conclude the operations at Shaw Pipe\u2019s Highspire, Pennsylvania facility do not satisfy the <em>Nagy </em>test, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Department\u2019s investigation will terminate. Should the Department conclude the pipe coating operations do satisfy the <em>Nagy </em>test, however, the Department shall complete whatever further investigation is necessary and reach a final determination concerning plaintiffs\u2019 eligibility for certification to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Finally, the Department of Labor\u2019s investigation [</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion the Department of Labor \u201cfailed to follow the rules for conducting a proper investigation\u201d (Pis. \u2019 Br. at 7.) by supplementing the record following the Department\u2019s final determination, this Court rejects plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. The statute states the administrative record must contain \u201cthe findings or report upon which [the agency\u2019s] determination was based.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2635(d)(1)(A) (1994). The Court finds the statute\u2019s requirement was met in this case. While the administrative record was supplemented after the Department of Labor reached its final determination, the addition to the record simply provided additional evidence documenting a fact the Department relied upon in making its final determination. [</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">] Plaintiff was in no way prejudiced by inclusion of the letter in the administrative record, and does not dispute the facts contained in the letter. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the determination alleging the Department engaged in improper investigative techniques by supplementing the administrative record with a letter following the final determination is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The Court finds the Department of Labor\u2019s determination that plaintiffs do not produce an article within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(3) (1994) is not supported by substantial evidence on the record and is not otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the agency record is granted and the Department of Labor\u2019s determination will be vacated and remanded for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> The opinion notes the employees \u201cpaint and repair tankers, cargo vessels and container ships.
