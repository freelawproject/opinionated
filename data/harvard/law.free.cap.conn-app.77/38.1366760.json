Having provided treatment to the plaintiff, an undocumented alien, the hospital sought medicaid reimbursement from the department of social services (department).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once the department rejected the plaintiffs reimbursement request, the plaintiff sought judicial review in the trial court where his appeal was dismissed. The two issues on appeal are (1) whether the court applied the proper legal standard for determining whether the plaintiff suffered from an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d so as to qualify for medicaid benefits and (2) whether the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff did not have an \u201cemergency condition\u201d was supported by substantial evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">To address the issues on appeal adequately, it is appropriate to provide a brief overview of the medicaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>program as it relates to undocumented aliens.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cMedicaid is a federal program that provides health care funding for needy persons through cost-sharing with states electing to participate in the program.\u201d <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>150 F.3d 226, 227 (2d Cir. 1998). States, such as Connecticut, that elect to participate in the medicaid program are required to follow federal requirements. See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>209 Conn. 390, 394, 551 A.2d 729 (1988). The medicaid program is administered in Connecticut by the department pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-260. The department\u2019s uniform policy manual (manual) sets forth the regulations in regard to medicaid, and has the full force and effect of law pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The department\u2019s regulations of the eligibility of undocumented aliens for medicaid assistance mirror its federal counterpart, which provides that \u201c [undocumented aliens or aliens not otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law generally are not entitled to full medicaid coverage. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (1) (\u2018no payment may be made to a State under this section for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law\u2019); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406. The only exception to this exclusion is payment for medical assistance that is \u2018necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (A).\u201d <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 227-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Under federal law, an \u201cemergency\u201d is defined as \u201ca medical condition (including emergency labor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in \u2014 (A) placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy, (B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u201cThe corresponding regulation . . . found at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255 (b) (1) . . . provides that aliens are entitled to Medicaid coverage for [e]mergency services required after the sudden onset of a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in: (i) Placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy; (ii) Serious impairment to bodily functions; or (iii) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\u201d <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In Connecticut, consistent with the federal requirements, undocumented aliens are ineligible for medicaid coverage unless they have an emergency medical condition and are otherwise eligible for medicaid. See Department of Social Services, Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 3005.05C. \u201cA medical condition is considered an emergency when it is of such severity that the absence of immediate medical attention could result in placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy. This includes emergency labor and delivery, and emergencies related to pregnancy, but does not include care or services related to an organ transplant procedure.\u201d Id., \u00a7 3000.01.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Keeping the foregoing background in mind, we now turn to the facts and procedural history that are relevant to the plaintiffs claims. The plaintiff, a citizen of Poland, came to the United States on a tourist visa and remained illegally after his visa expired. On or about November 15, 1998, he began having symptoms relating to his current medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On November 19, 1998, he reported to his family physician that he was experiencing stomach pain, nausea and was having trouble walking. That same day, the plaintiff underwent blood tests and X rays. The test results became available on November 24, 1998, and on the basis of those results, his family physician referred him to Robert B. Erichson, an oncologist at Stamford Hospital (hospital).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Under the care of Erichson, on November 24, 1998, the plaintiff was diagnosed as having acute myelogenous leukemia, a disease that can be fatal if not treated aggressively with chemotherapy. As a result of the diagnosis, Erichson performed bone marrow biopsies and inserted a triple lumen Hickman catheter into the plaintiff so as to begin chemotherapy treatment. Following a course of chemotherapy, the plaintiff was discharged on December 26, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">On February 26,1999, the hospital filed an application for medicaid on behalf of the plaintiff. In its application, the hospital indicated that it was seeking payment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>in-patient hospital care that the plaintiff had received that was \u201cnecessary for the treatment of his emergency medical condition\u201d and which resulted in his hospitalization from November 24 to December 26, 1998. The plaintiffs application was sent for review to a third party, Colonial Cooperative Care, Inc. (Colonial), and to the department\u2019s medical review team (review team).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On April 24,1999, Colonial found that the plaintiff met the criteria for disability as set forth in the department\u2019s regulations. Notwithstanding Colonial\u2019s findings, the review team found on May 11,1999, that the plaintiff did not meet the criteria for having an emergency medical condition, and on May 17, 1999, the department denied the plaintiffs application for emergency medical assistance under medicaid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff requested an administrative hearing to review the denial of his application for Medicaid assistance. A hearing was held on November 19,1999, in which a department hearing officer adopted the review team\u2019s determination that the plaintiff did not have an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d at the time he was admitted at the hospital on November 24, 1998. The hearing officer\u2019s conclusion was based, inter alia, on his findings that the medical procedures, bone marrow biopsies and the insertion of a Hickman catheter, performed at the hospital during the plaintiffs hospitalization, were not emergency medical events. Furthermore, the officer noted that the plaintiff would not have died if he did not receive treatment the day he was admitted. As a result, the plaintiff filed an administrative appeal with the Superior Court, which in turn was dismissed. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The first issue on appeal is whether the court applied the proper legal standard for determining whether the plaintiff suffered from an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d so as to qualify him for medicaid benefits. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the hearing officer construed the definition of \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d under \u00a7 3000.01 of the manual too narrowly by requiring the plaintiff to show that he \u201cwould . . . have immediately died on November 24,1998 [date of admittance] if he had not received the treatment administered to him on that date at Stamford Hospital.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Before turning to the merits of the plaintiffs claim, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cJudicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is . . . limited. The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of [the Supreme Court] to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>253 Conn. 661, 669, 757 A.2d 1 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1148, 121 S. Ct. 1089, 148 L. Ed. 2d 963 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In its definition of \u201cemergency condition,\u201d \u00a7 3000.01 of the manual mirrors its federal counteipart, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). As stated previously, the manual provides that \u201c[a] medical condition is considered an emer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>gency when it is of such severity that the absence of immediate medical attention could result in placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy. . . .\u201d Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3000.01. Although \u00a7 3000.01 of the manual mirrors its federal counterpart, those regulations do not make plain the circumstances in which a serious medical condition may be considered to be an \u201cemergency.\u201d We have held that \u201c[w]here the words of a statute fail to indicate clearly whether the provision applies in certain circumstances, it must be construed by this court .... Our objective in construing the language of an ambiguous statute is to give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.... In our pursuit of that objective, we look to the language of the statute itself, its legislative history, and previous judicial construction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>20 Conn. App. 500, 511, 568 A.2d 1037 (1990); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In accordance with those principles of statutory construction, we look to the language of the statute itself, its legislative histoiy and previous judicial construction in determining what elements will constitute an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d under \u00a7 3000.01 of the manual. In pursuing our objective, we are informed by the approach taken by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as to the scope and nature of 42 U.S.C. 1396b (v) (3), which \u00a7 3000.01 of the manual mirrors. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>252 F.3d 567 (2d Cir. 2001); <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 252 F.3d 570-79, the Second Circuit provided a comprehensive legislative history of medicaid coverage for illegal aliens. The court noted that the clear purpose of the medicaid statute since its inception in 1965 is to make government more cost-effective. The court opined that in keeping with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>that purpose, Congress amended the medicaid statute in 1986 to bar aid to \u201cnon-PRUCOL aliens\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for any condition short of a medical emergency. Id., 573-74; see also Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1874, 2057 (1986). The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub. L.

On the basis of its review of the legislative history, the court concluded that Congress intended that the \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d exception under PRWORA should be narrowly construed. Id., 580-81. The court stated that \u201c[i]n discussing the alienage restrictions in the bill, the House Conference Report emphasizes: The allowance for emergency medical services under Medicaid is very narrow. The conferees intend that it only apply to medical care that is strictly of an emergency nature, such as medical treatment administered in an emergency room, critical care unit, or intensive care unit. <em>The conferees do not intend that emergency medical services include pre-natal or delivery care assistance that is not strictly of an emergency nature as specified herein. </em>H.R.

The Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., (Greenery Rehabilitation) had operated nursing homes and rehabilitation facilities that provided specialized programs for the care of individuals who have suffered brain injuries. Greenery Rehabilitation entered into an agreement with the New York City human resources administration to provide care for New York City residents who were in need of its services and who were eligible for medicaid. Id., 228. In line with that agreement, Greenery Rehabilitation admitted into its facilities three patients who had suffered sudden and serious head injuries that necessitated immediate treatment, which left the patients with long-term debilitating conditions that required ongoing daily care. Id. It did so under the belief that medicaid would cover the services provided to the patients. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The court in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>reasoned that because the patients\u2019 initial injuries had been treated and the patients were stabilized prior to being moved to the Greenery Rehabilitation facilities, their medical conditions no longer could be classified as \u201cemergencies.\u201d Id., 232-33. Instead, the patients suffered from chronic conditions requiring daily and regimented care. Id. As a result, Greenery Rehabilitation could not receive reimbursement for providing ongoing daily care to the patients, despite the fact that those patients\u2019 conditions upon admission had been \u201cemergencies,\u201d and even though the discontinuance of their ongoing care could have had grave consequences for them. Id. Moreover, the court elaborated that a medical condition does not become an \u201cemergency\u201d under the statute simply because the discontinuance of care may place the patient\u2019s life at risk. Id., 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In arriving at its conclusion that the patients\u2019 conditions were \u201cchronic\u201d as opposed to \u201cemergencies,\u201d the Second Circuit in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>reasoned that \u201c[i]n the medical context, an emergency is generally defined as a sudden bodily alteration such as is likely to require immediate medical attention. . . . The emphasis is on <em>severity, temporality </em>and <em>urgency. </em>We believe that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) clearly conveys this commonly understood definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u201cAn acute symptom is a symptom characterized by sharpness or severity . . . having a sudden onset, sharp rise, and short course . . . [as] opposed to <em>chronic. . . . </em>Moreover, as a verb, manifest means to show plainly. ... In [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) this verb is used in the present progressive tense to explain that the emergency medical condition must be revealing itself through acute symptoms. Thus . . . the statute plainly requires that the acute indications of injury or illness must coincide in time with the emergency medical condition. Finally, immediate medical care means medical care occurring . . . without loss of time or that is not secondary or remote. ... In sum, the statutory language unambiguously conveys the meaning that emergency medical conditions are sudden, severe and short-lived physical injuries or illnesses that require immediate treatment to prevent further harm.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We conclude, on the basis of the language of the statute itself, its legislative history and previous judicial construction of it, that the hearing officer did not use a legal standard that was \u201ctoo narrow\u201d in arriving at the conclusion that the plaintiff did not have an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d as defined by \u00a7 3000.01 of the manual. The hearing officer\u2019s determinations were consonant with the Second Circuit\u2019s admonition that in determining whether a medical condition is an \u201cemergency\u201d for purposes of PRWORA, which \u00a7 3000.01 of the manual mirrors, the legal standard employed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>hearing officer must emphasize the <em>severity, temporality and urgency </em>of the medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In making his determination, the hearing officer considered the <em>severity, temporality and urgency </em>of the plaintiffs medical condition. In terms of the immediacy of the plaintiffs medical treatment, the hearing officer found that the plaintiff \u201cwould not have immediately died on November 24, 1998, if he had not received the treatment administered to him on that date at Stamford Hospital.\u201d As well, the hearing officer also considered the nature of the treatment received by the plaintiff in concluding that \u201c[b]one marrow biopsies and the insertion of a triple lumen Hickman catheter are not emergency events.\u201d Last, the hearing officer considered the severity of the condition by noting that the plaintiff \u201cwas diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia and was admitted to Stamford Hospital, where he underwent certain medical procedures. Although these procedures were necessary to begin [the plaintiffs] chemotherapy, there is no indication that they were of an emergency nature; i.e., that the [plaintiffs] health would have been in serious jeopardy had they not begun on November 24, 1998 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">As our Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[w]e are not without sympathy for those with minimal resources for medical care. But our sympathy is an insufficient basis for approving a recovery based on a theory inconsistent with law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 406. Accordingly, the conclusion of law reached by the hearing officer must stand because it resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and reasonably and logically could follow from such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We next turn to the plaintiffs claim that there was not substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>that the plaintiff did not have an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claim, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cJudicial review of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied in judicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . [I]t imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . and to provide a more restrictive standard of review than standards embodying review of weight of the evidence or clearly erroneous action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>67 Conn. App. 316, 323-24, 786 A.2d 1283 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">As discussed in part I, in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 232, the court defined emergency medical conditions as \u201csudden, severe and short-lived physical injuries or illnesses that require immediate treatment to prevent further harm.\u201d In deciding what constitutes a \u201cmedical emergency,\u201d the emphasis is on <em>severity, temporality </em>and <em>urgency. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In terms of the severity of the plaintiffs condition, the hearing officer found that the plaintiff \u201cwas diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia and was admitted to Stamford Hospital, where he underwent certain medical procedures [bone marrow biopsies and the insertion of a triple lumen Hickman catheter]. The hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ing officer further found that \u201c[although these procedures were necessary to begin [the plaintiffs] chemotherapy, there is no indication that they were of an emergency nature; i.e., that the [plaintiffs] health would have been in serious j eopardy had they not begun on November 24, 1998 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">As to the urgent need for the treatment received by the plaintiff, we note that \u201cimmediate medical care means medical care occurring . . . without loss of time or that is not secondary or remote.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record for the court to determine that the plaintiffs medical condition was not immediate or urgent. More precisely, the court noted that \u201c[t]he administrative record indicates that the plaintiff appeared in the emergency room two weeks after he suffered his initial symptoms.\u201d Furthermore, the plaintiff reported weight loss a few months prior to his hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The record does not reveal that the plaintiffs health would have been in serious jeopardy if he had been admitted for treatment one week later or at some time thereafter. As the court noted in its memorandum of decision, the \u201cplaintiff received the beginning treatments in the hospital for a medical condition that is only cured over the long term, and he was essentially admitted to begin a course of chemotherapy. ... It is true that when he decided to go to the emergency room, the plaintiffs condition had reached a crisis stage . . . but the record also contains notes of health professionals showing that the plaintiff was not in need of urgent care on November 24 [1998], . . . (The plaintiff denied fever, chills, cough, gum bleeding or excessive bruising . . .

We similarly are not persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that the hearing officer should have accorded more weight to other evidence besides the review team\u2019s report, which concluded that the plaintiff did not suffer from an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d As we consistently have held, \u201c[t]he credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency, and, if there is evidence [as is the case here] . . . which reasonably supports the decision of the [hearing officer], we cannot disturb the conclusion reached . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Elf v.

The dissent bases that conclusion on the absence of the term \u201cacute\u201d from the Connecticut regulation and its presence in the federal counterpart regulation, asserting that this difference in language supports the notion that Connecticut has adopted a less restrictive medicaid provision than exists in federal law. Other than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>general discussion concerning an approach to legislative history, the dissent has not cited any portion of the legislative record to support its conclusion that the General Assembly intended for Connecticut citizens to be required to pay, without federal reimbursement, more for emergency medical care to undocumented aliens than that which is mandated by medicaid. Additionally, although the appellant notes the language of Connecticut\u2019s pertinent regulation, he has provided no analysis or argument that Connecticut\u2019s scheme is anything other than a mirror of its federal counterpart. Because the appellant did not brief the question of whether Connecticut\u2019s medicaid scheme relating to undocumented aliens differs from its federal counterpart, we do not believe that claim is appropriate for separate analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\"> There is no dispute between the parties that but for the plaintiffs status as an undocumented alien, he would have been eligible for medicaid assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\"> See footnote 2. \u201cNon-PRUCOL aliens\u201d refers to aliens who are not permanently residing under color of law.

I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff, Zbigniew Szewczyk, did not suffer from an emergency medical condition under the definition set forth in either the federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), or the state regulation, \u00a7 3000.01 of the Uniform Policy Manual of the defendant department of social services (department), and was, therefore, not entitled to receive benefits. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>direct the trial court to remand the matter to the department to grant the plaintiffs application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The underlying facts of this case are not in material dispute. The plaintiff, a native of Poland, illegally remained in this country after his visa expired. On November 24, 1998, the plaintiff sought treatment from his family physician. At that time, he suffered from intense pain, nausea and overall weakness so severe that he could take only one to two steps before collapsing. After reviewing the results of tests performed on the plaintiffs blood samples, the plaintiffs physician immediately referred the plaintiff to Robert B. Erichson, an oncologist at Stamford Hospital (hospital).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">On that same day, Erichson diagnosed the plaintiff with acute myelogenous leukemia and admitted him to the hospital. The plaintiff received treatment consisting of chemotherapy, surgery and biopsies at the hospital until his discharge on December 26, 1998. The hospital charges from November 24 through December 26,1998, totaled $82,046.85.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">An application for benefits from November through December, 1998, was filed with the defendant, an agency of the state. Erichson wrote a letter, which was admitted into evidence by the department\u2019s hearing officer, that stated that \u201cacute myelogenous leukemia . . . <em>is a rapidly fatal disease unless treated aggressively with </em>chemotherapy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Erichson also opined that such chemotherapy is always administered in a hospital, associated with severe infections requiring aggressive antibiotic and transfusion treatment, and that <em>\u201cin the absence of such therapy, [the plaintiff\\ would probably not be alive today.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Despite the absence of any medical evidence to the contrary, the hearing officer determined that the plaintiff did not suffer from an emergency medical condition and therefore was not eligible for benefits. Specifically, the hearing officer found that the plaintiff did not suffer from an emergency medical condition because the plaintiff would not have immediately died on November 24, 1998, if he had not received treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court from the denial of benefits. The court held that the officer had applied the proper legal standard and that substantial evidence existed in the record to support the officer\u2019s conclusion, which the majority affirms today.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">At the outset, it is important to identify precisely the party and the specific regulations that the plaintiff is challenging. Although medicaid<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is a joint program between the federal government and the states that elect to participate, and states that participate must follow the requirements mandated by the federal government; <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>150 F.3d 226, 227 (2d Cir. 1998); the defendant, a state agency, administers the program in Connecticut.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>I believe that the plaintiff suffered from an emergency medical condition and was therefore entitled to medicaid benefits under the definition set forth by the federal statute or by the state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The defendant is required, due to this state\u2019s participation in medicaid, to provide payment for medical treatment to those persons who are determined to be eligible under federal law. Under federal law, payment of federal funds generally is prohibited for medical services provided to unlawful aliens such as the plaintiff. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (1). Congress, however, has authorized payment for medical treatment provided to unlawful aliens if that treatment is for an emergency medical condition. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (A). An emergency medical condition is defined as \u201ca medical condition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in \u2014 (A) placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy, (B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit extensively discussed the meaning of \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 226. In that case, \u201cthree patients, [all who failed to meet the residency requirements to be eligible for medicaid benefits] suffered sudden and serious head injuries that necessitated immediate treatment and <em>ultimately left the patients with long-term debilitating conditions requiring ongoing care and daily </em>attention.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 228. The District Court, having found that the three patients had received treatment and had been stabilized prior to being moved to the plaintiffs facility, concluded that two of the patients were receiving emergency medical care and, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for providing medical services. Id., 230-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The Second Circuit, contrary to the result reached by the District Court, agreed with the defendants that emergency medical care does not include \u201ca condition requiring daily and regimented care for chronic conditions . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 232. Instead, in the context of a medical condition, the term \u201cemergency\u201d is defined by focusing on severity, temporality and urgency. Id. \u201cIn sum, <em>the statutory language unambiguously conveys the meaning that emergency medical conditions are sudden, severe and short-lived physical injuries or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>illnesses that require immediate treatment to prevent further harm.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">At the outset, I note my agreement with the majority that <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>sets forth the appropriate standard, under federal law, for determining whether an otherwise ineligible alien is entitled to medicaid coverage for an emergency medical condition. My disagreement stems from the application of that standard to the facts of the present case. I believe that the present case is factually distinguishable from <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>and, moreover, that the majority interprets the test to determine what qualifies as an emergency medical condition, as set forth in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The facts presented in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>concerned the issue of long-term medical care provided after a patient already had been stabilized. The period of treatment for stabilization of the patient was not, therefore, an issue in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>The three patients in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>suffered from chronic, debilitating conditions and required daily monitoring without a significant prognosis for improvement. The Second Circuit premised much of its opinion on the fact that the patients in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>required \u201cdaily and regimented\u201d custodial care. Id. Two of the treating physicians testified<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the patients were receiving chronic, as opposed to emergency, care. Id. Furthermore, the court acknowledged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>patient\u2019s initial injuries \u201cundoubtedly satisfied the plain meaning of [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1396b (v) (3).\u201d <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 232. It was only after they were stabilized and moved to the long-term care facility where the further direct harm from those injuries was removed that the emergency condition ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The Second Circuit concluded by establishing the standard for determining an emergency medical condition under the federal statute. \u201cAn \u2018emergency medical condition\u2019 must be manifested by acute, rather than chronic symptoms. <em>It must necessitate immediate medical treatment, without which the patient\u2019s physical well-being would likely be put in jeopardy or serious physical impairment or dysfunction would result.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 233; see also <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. 049558S (July 31, 2000) (27 Conn. L. Rptr. 653, 655) (stating that \u201cemergency\u201d under medicaid means medical emergency).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff, at the time he was admitted to the hospital, suffered from symptoms that required immediate medical treatment, without which his physical well-being certainly was placed in jeopardy. The only evidence regarding the plaintiffs disease was the letter written by Erichson that described acute myelogenous leukemia as \u201ca rapidly fatal disease\u201d and that \u201cin the absence of such therapy,\u201d the plaintiff would have, in all likelihood, died.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>on November 24, 1998, when he was admitted to the hospital and was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, was no different from the patients in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, </em>Inc., at the time they suffered head injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident, a gunshot wound and physical assault that necessitated immediate treatment prior to their arrival at the Greenery Rehabilitation Center. The plaintiff received aggressive treatment over the course of the next month<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and was discharged on December 26,1998. Thus, it is readily apparent that the type of care that he received was distinguishable from the long-term, daily regimented care that the patients in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>required.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Moreover, the hearing officer in the present case found that the plaintiff would not have immediately died on November 24, 1998, if he had not received treatment, that the treatment received by the plaintiff was not an emergency event and that there was no indication that the plaintiffs health would have been in serious jeopardy if treatment was not commenced on November 24,1998. Essentially, the test used by the hearing officer, subsequently endorsed and validated by the trial court and by the majority, required the plaintiff to show that he would have died if treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia did not start on November 24, 1998. The test seemingly injects a \u201ctrauma\u201d requirement into the standard established by the Second Circuit in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">I believe, therefore, that the majority has read the applicable federal law and <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>in too narrow a fashion and introduced an additional element. The hearing officer and the trial court placed great emphasis on the factual finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the plaintiff would not have immediately died on November 24, 1998, if he did not receive treatment. As set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), an emergency medical condition does not have an immediate death requirement. Instead, the plaintiff must show a condition, manifested by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, and that the absence of immediate medical attention <em>could reasonably be expected to result </em>in placing the patient\u2019s health in danger, serious impairment to bodily function or serious dysfunction of any organ or body part.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff demonstrated symptoms on November 24, 1998, that included intense pain, nausea and overall weakness. Although the plaintiff in the present case may not have died on November 24,1998, without receiving treatment, it is clear from the evidence that he suffered from a rapidly fatal disease that required an aggressive protocol of treatment that included chemotherapy and surgery, and that the absence of such treatment would have placed his health in danger and, in all likelihood, resulted in death. The letter written by Erichson established the severity of acute myelogenous leukemia, as well as the temporality and urgency of commencing treatment as soon as possible to prevent placing the plaintiffs health in further jeopardy. Such treatment was necessary to stabilize the acute condition of the plaintiff as of November 24, 1998. Furthermore, the treatment consisted of approximately one month of hospitalization, which is readily distinguishable from the chronic, and perhaps permanent, treatment required by the patients in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In summary, the plaintiff, on November 24,1998, was admitted to the hospital with an illness that was characterized by the onset of sudden and severe symptoms. His condition required immediate medical attention to prevent further harm. After approximately one month of treatment, the short-lived illness was stabilized. Accordingly, the plaintiffs condition met the definition of an emergency medical condition as set forth by the Second Circuit in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation </em>Group, <em>Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">I conclude, therefore, that the hearing officer used an improper standard, that the plaintiff suffered from an emergency medical condition as defined by federal law and that the department was required, due to this state\u2019s participation in medicaid, to provide benefits to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">I also would hold that the defendant, according to the language in the state regulations, has elected to provide additional benefits to unlawful aliens and that the plaintiff is entitled to benefits under the state regulations, independent of the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">It is well established that a state may accord its citizens additional protection and benefits beyond those provided by the federal government. Our Supreme Court, in the context of interpreting our state constitution, has frequently stated that \u201c[w]e have also, however, determined in some instances that the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State <em>v. Brocuglio, </em>64 Conn. App. 93, 101, 779 A.2d 793, cert. granted on other grounds, 258 Conn. 908, 782 A.2d 1247 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). In <em>Cotto </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>48 Conn. App. 618, 711 A.2d 1180 (1998), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>aff'd, 251 Conn. 1, 738 A.2d 623 (1999), we stated that \u201c[a] state may adopt, in its own constitution, individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the federal constitution and a state statute [or regulation] is, for that purpose, in the same category as a state constitution.\u201d Id., 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">I also note the difference that exists between interpreting federal statutes and regulations as opposed to state statutes and regulations. For example, in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>the Second Circuit stated: \u201cIn interpreting a statute, we must first look to the language of the statute itself. . . . [U]nless otherwise defined, individual statutory words are assumed to carry their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning. ... If the statutory terms are unambiguous, our review generally ends and the statute is construed according to the plain meaning of its words. . . . Only where doubt or ambiguity resides in a Congressional enactment . . . may legislative history and other tools of interpretation beyond a plain reading of the statute\u2019s words be used.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 231; see also <em>Freier </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>303 F.3d 176, 197 (2d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Until recently, the courts of this state also used the plain meaning method of statutory interpretation. Our Supreme Court, however, recently eschewed the plain meaning approach in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) (en banc). \u201cIn summary, we now restate the process by which we interpret statutes as follows: The process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In the present case, federal law merely sets the floor below which the state is prohibited from denying benefits, but the state, through its regulations, may provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>additional benefits. See, e.g., <em>Mercy Healthcare Arizona, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, </em>181 Ariz. 95, 97, 887 P.2d 625 (App. 1994) (\u201c[i]f a state chooses to extend treatment to other groups, the state assumes the cost of health care for those . . . individuals\u201d); <em>Crespin </em>v. <em>Kizer, </em>226 Cal. App. 3d 498, 504, 276 Cal. Rptr. 571 (1990). In <em>Dominguez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>226 Cal. App. 3d 524, 276 Cal. Rptr. 564 (1990), the California Court of Appeal addressed the issue of whether a state statute provided more benefits to undocumented aliens than did the federal counterpart.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cStates are . . . free to provide additional medical coverage without federal financial participation.\u201d Id., 528. The court also noted that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that the [state] may authorize broader health care services than those authorized by federal law.\u201d Id., 531 n.7. The court concluded that while the plaintiff could not receive benefits under federal law, he was eligible under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The majority, on several occasions, posits that the state regulation mirrors its federal counterpart. I cannot agree. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) is not duplicated and reproduced in the corresponding state regulation. Section 3000.01 provides that \u201c[a] medical condition is considered an emergency when it is of such severity that the absence of immediate medical attention could result in placing the patient\u2019s health in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>serious jeopardy. This includes emergency labor and delivery, and emergencies related to pregnancy, but does not include care or services related to an organ transplant procedure.\u201d Department of Social Services, Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 3000.01. Thus, a comparison of the two provisions reveals that the phrase \u201cacute symptoms of sufficient severity\u201d that is present in the federal law is absent from the state counterpart. Section 3000.01, by its language, defines an emergency medical condition as one with \u201csuch severity that the absence of immediate medical attention could result in placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy. ...\u201d Id. It is a tenet of statutory construction that \u201c[w]ords in a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning . . . unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended. . . . Where a statute does not define a term it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 224, 796 A.2d 502 (2002). On the basis of the text of \u00a7 3000.01, the regulation itself defines what, under that regulation, constitutes an emergency medical condition and obviates the need to look for the \u201c \u2018common understanding\u2019 \u201d; id.; as was done by the Second Circuit in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I also point out that General Statutes \u00a7 17b-260, which authorized the defendant to participate in the medicaid program, states that it <em>\u201cmay </em>administer the same [medical assistance programs] in accordance with the requirements provided therein . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Our legislature did not mandate that the defendant follow the requirements as set forth by the federal government. \u201cWe have consistently held that may is directoiy rather than mandatory. . . . The word may, unless the context in which it is employed requires otherwise, ordinarily does not connote a command. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Rather, the word generally imports permissive conduct and the conferral of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 531, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). Thus, it is clear that the defendant is not required simply to follow the federal government\u2019s lead, but has the discretion to provide additional benefits if it so chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finally, and most notably, the department, unlike some of our sister states that participate in medicaid, did not adopt the exact text of the federal statute or regulation. See, e.g., Ill. Admin. Code tit. 89, \u00a7 120.310; N.J. Admin. Code tit. 30, \u00a7 4D-6f; N.M. Admin. Code tit. 8, \u00a7 3.2.1.12; N.Y. Comp. Codes. R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, \u00a7 360-3.2. On the basis of all of the foregoing, I conclude that this state elected to provide coverage in excess of that required by the federal government. We must, therefore, independently interpret \u00a7 3000.01 as a matter of state law and, as a result, the opinion in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>while persuasive and instructive authority, is not binding on this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In the present case, it is clear that the plaintiff suffered from a severe medical condition, acute myelogenous leukemia. Furthermore, in the absence of immediate medical treatment on November 24, 1998, the plaintiffs health could have, and probably would have, been placed in serious jeopardy. As Erichson\u2019s letter stated, this type of cancer is characterized as a \u201crapidly fatal disease unless treated aggressively with chemotherapy.\u201d Section 3000.01 does not have a requirement that the plaintiff would have died that day if treatment had not started on the date of his admission to the hospital; it requires only that his health <em>could be placed in serious danger. </em>Furthermore, there was credible evidence in the record that absent treatment, the plaintiff would, in all likelihood, have died by June 7, 1999. The plaintiff needed that treatment to survive. Thus, the plaintiff suffered from a condition that, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>absence of immediate medical attention, caused his health, and in fact his life, to be placed in jeopar dy. His condition, therefore, met the definition of emergency medical care set forth by \u00a7 3000.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">I conclude, therefore, that under either the federal statutory scheme or the state regulation, the plaintiff was entitled to receive benefits because he suffered from an emergency medical condition and that it was improper for the court to deny his appeal. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> If the department\u2019s hearing officer had determined that the plaintiff had been eligible for the benefits he attempted to obtain, the state would have been required to contribute $22,386.56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> The complete text of the Erichson letter states: \u201cRegarding [the plaintiff] and his admission of 11/27/98 to 12/26/98.
