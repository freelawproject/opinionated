Martin, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of conspiracy to commit robbeiy in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (2), robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-133 and 53a-134 (a) (2), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. On appeal, the defendant claims, among other things, that the trial court improperly took judicial notice of the fact that Carlton Martin, the defendant\u2019s alleged coconspirator and accomplice, had been convicted of the crimes of felony murder, robbery in the first degree and five counts of tampering with a witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we agree that the court improperly took judicial notice of the conviction of the defendant\u2019s alleged coconspirator and accomplice, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In connection with the death of Robert Gallo during an alleged armed robbery at Gallo\u2019s liquor store in Danbury on January 18, 1999, the defendant pleaded not guilty to a long form information charging him with conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (2), robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-133 and 53a-134 (a) (2), and felony murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>count of the long form information, the state alleged that the defendant and his cousin, Carlton Martin, were coconspirators or accomplices.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 14, 2000, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts, and on February 16,2001, the court sentenced the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>dant to a total effective term of ninety years imprisonment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The defendant claims that the court, during its final instructions to the jury, improperly took judicial notice of the fact that Carlton Martin had been convicted of the crimes of felony murder, robbery in the first degree and five counts of tampering with a witness. The defendant argues that contrary to the court\u2019s determination, statements made by defense counsel during closing argument to the jury did not require the court to inform the jury that Carlton Martin had been convicted of crimes arising out of the same incident that prompted the defendant\u2019s trial. The defendant contends that the value of the court\u2019s instruction informing the jury of the conviction was outweighed by its prejudicial effect and deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial under the federal constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the state called Carlton Martin as a witness after he had been convicted in a separate trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>determined that because Carlton Martin had testified at his criminal trial, he could no longer invoke his privilege against self-incrimination at the defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nonetheless, when Carlton Martin was called to testify before the jury at the defendant\u2019s trial, he refused to answer any questions that could have placed the defendant in his company on January 18, 1999, or connected the defendant to the alleged murder weapon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> During the evidentiary phase of the defendant\u2019s trial, the jury was not informed of Carlton Martin\u2019s conviction or the disposition of any charges brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">During closing argument, defense counsel argued that the state had failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that the defendant and Carlton Martin committed the robbery and murder. Specifically, defense counsel emphasized the lack of blood evidence linking the defendant or Carlton Martin to the crime and stated: \u201c[The state] didn\u2019t have any of that [forensic blood evidence] because there isn\u2019t any of it, not on either Carlton Martin or [the defendant]. There is, on whoever was back there doing the shooting, not Carlton and not [the defendant], . . . And, I\u2019m asking you, why isn\u2019t there anything about all this blood? And, it\u2019s because the state can\u2019t explain it except to say Carlton and [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>defendant] didn\u2019t do it. Carlton and [the defendant] didn\u2019t do it and get into [the] car because the evidence would have been on Carlton or [the defendant\u2019s] clothes or in [the] car, and it\u2019s not there. And the only reason it\u2019s not there is because <em>they\u2019re not guilty.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In light of defense counsel\u2019s statement that the defendant and Carlton Martin were \u201cnot guilty,\u201d the state, before presenting its rebuttal argument to the jury, asked the court to take judicial notice of the fact that Carlton Martin had been convicted of robbery in the first degree, felony murder and five counts of tampering with a witness. Defense counsel objected, arguing that it would be \u201cincredibly prejudicial to the defendant\u201d to advise the jury that Carlton Martin already had been found guilty of the charges. Defense counsel maintained: \u201cIt will implant in the jurors\u2019 minds the fact that other jurors considered evidence and already made a decision, and why should they think about it independently, just go with what has already been presented and already concluded. And, the court will be advising them, if [it takes] judicial notice, that this is a fact. He\u2019s guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The court, in overruling the objection, concluded: \u201cThe state and the defense and the court have stayed away from the conviction of Carlton Martin as such. ... I think [defense counsel\u2019s] comment has invited the request of the state. Otherwise, [the jury is] left with the impression that . . . Carlton Martin was not convicted of anything or that he is not guilty, and that simply is not true. He was found guilty by a jury and sentenced by the court. So, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I will instruct the jury that I\u2019ve taken judicial notice of the fact that Carlton Martin was convicted of felony murder, robbery in the first degree and five counts of witness tampering on November 1, 2000, and they may, if they wish, take that as a fact, but I will also tell them that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>they\u2019re not required to accept that as conclusive. And, I\u2019m basing that statement I just made on \u00a7 2-1 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Thereafter, following the state\u2019s closing rebuttal argument,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court gave its final instructions to the jury. In instructing the jury, the court stated: \u201cI am now taking judicial notice of the fact that Carlton Martin, on November 1, 2000, was convicted of the crimes of felony murder, robbery in the first degree and five counts of tampering with a witness. That \u2014 those judicially noticed facts are not binding on you. They\u2019re not conclusive, but you may accept them as conclusive if you wish. I instruct [that] you are not to draw an inference that [the defendant] is guilty of the offense as charged simply because Carlton Martin was convicted of those offenses. You must judge [the defendant] on the evidence produced in this courtroom in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">We begin by setting forth certain legal principles that guide us in our review. \u201cJudicial notice . . . meets the objective of establishing facts to which the offer of evidence would normally be directed. . . . The underlying theory is that proof by evidence concerning a proposition may be dispensed with where the court is justified, by general considerations, in declaring the truth of the proposition without requiring evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>the party. . . . This theory goes no further, however, than to mean that the proposition is taken as true without an offer of proof by the party who should ordinarily have offered it.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Tomanelli, </em>153 Conn. 365, 368-69, 216 A.2d 625 (1966); see also <em>De Luca </em>v. <em>Park Commissioners, </em>94 Conn. 7, 10, 107 A. 611 (1919) (\u201c[j]udicial notice, in its appropriate field, displaces evidence, since, as it stands for proof, it fulfils the object which evidence is designed to fulfil, and makes evidence unnecessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of judicial notice is not a hard and fast one. It is modified by judicial discretion. . . . Courts are not bound to take judicial notice of matters of fact. Whether they will do so or not depends on the nature of the subject, the issue involved and the apparent justice of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>De Luca </em>v. <em>Park Commissioners, </em>supra, 94 Conn. 10; see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 2-1 (b); C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 2.2, p. 108. \u201cWhether to take judicial notice of a fact is a function of the exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pie Plate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>35 Conn. App. 305, 316, 645 A.2d 1044, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 935, 650 A.2d 172 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Thus, \u201ca trial court\u2019s determination [to take or] not to take judicial notice is essentially an evidentiary ruling. . . . Our role in reviewing evidentiary rulings of the trial court is settled. The trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on evidence and its rulings will be reversed only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Drabik </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>234 Conn. 390, 398-99, 662 A.2d 118 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">As previously set forth, the court determined that defense counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cthey\u2019re not guilty,\u201d exceeded the appropriate scope of final argument because, in essence, the statement suggested an inference from facts not in evidence, such as the verdict in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Carlton Martin\u2019s trial, and presented a matter that the jury had no right to consider.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to limit the scope of final argument to prevent the juiy from being influenced by improper matter that might prejudice its deliberations. We generally accord deference to a court\u2019s efforts to eliminate prejudice through a curative instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>55 Conn. App. 502, 517-18, 739 A.2d 732 (1999) (when court instructs jury to disregard counsel\u2019s improper comment, \u201cwe generally accord deference to [such] efforts to eliminate prejudice through a curative instruction\u201d), aff'd, 255 Conn. 828, 769 A.2d 697 (2001). The court, however, did not simply identify defense counsel\u2019s improper comment and instruct the jury to disregard the comment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, the court concluded that the comment \u201cinvited\u201d or opened the door for the court affirmatively to take judicial notice of Carlton Martin\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>\u201cIt is a well-accepted principle that evidence about the conviction of a co-conspirator is not admissible as substantive proof of the guilt of a defendant. . . . Indeed, improper use of a co-conspirator\u2019s conviction infringes on the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">\u201c[A] defendant is entitled to have the question of his guilt determined upon the evidence against him, not on whether a codefendant or government witness has been convicted of the same charge. . . . Generally, the guilty plea or conviction of a co-defendant or co-conspirator is not admissible at trial, and such guilty pleas and convictions are never admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 510-11; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 347-48, 441 A.2d 98 (1981) (fact that person jointly charged with crime pleaded guilty not admissible on trial of another person so charged to establish that crime was committed); <em>State v. Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 198, 187 A.2d 442 (1962) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">There are, however, certain permissible purposes for the use of guilty pleas and convictions of alleged coconspirators or accomplices at trial. For example, guilty pleas and convictions maybe used <em>to impeach the credibility </em>of a testifying coconspirator or codefendant so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>that the fact finder will have appropriate facts on hand to assess the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 511; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 343-48; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 198-99. In addition, a court may take judicial notice of a testifying accomplice\u2019s or witness\u2019 conviction or guilty plea <em>to a charge based on facts unrelated to those involved in the information against the defendant </em>for purposes other than proving the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>153 Conn. 72, 85-86, 214 A.2d 362 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 921, 86 S. Ct. 1372, 16 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In the present case, although Carlton Martin was called as a witness to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial, his conviction was not offered or used to impeach his credibility. Furthermore, Carlton Martin\u2019s conviction was not for crimes based on facts unrelated to those involved in the information against the defendant; rather, it was for crimes involving the same factual situation alleged in the information against the defendant, which specifically alleged that the defendant and Carlton Martin were participants in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Although the state maintains that defense counsel\u2019s remarks during closing argument invited or opened the door for the court to inform the jury of Carlton Martin\u2019s conviction, we note that the \u201copening the door\u201d or \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine \u201ccannot ... be subverted into a rule for injection of prejudice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>67 Conn. App. 643, 653, 789 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 938, 808 A.2d 1133 (2002); see footnote 15. Moreover, the court has inherent authority to <em>prevent </em>the jury from being influenced by matters that might prejudice its deliberations. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Dorans, </em>261 Conn. 730, 755, 806 A.2d 1033 (2002) (recognizing trial court\u2019s inherent authority to exclude conviction otherwise qualifying for admission when prejudicial tendency outweighs proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>tive value); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crnkovic, </em>68 Conn. App. 757, 764-65, 793 A.2d 1139 (court must undertake balancing test before admitting evidence of witness\u2019 conviction to determine if probative value outweighs any prejudicial impact), cert. denied, 260 Conn. 925, 797 A.2d 521 (2002); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 6-7 (a),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 4-3.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cEvidence is prejudicial when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>256 Conn. 429, 454, 778 A.2d 812 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>74 Conn. App. 129, 151, 810 A.2d 824 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 506-19, we held that a <em>prosecutor\u2019s </em>comment during closing argument regarding the outcomes of the trials of the defendant\u2019s coconspirators deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. We explained that in criminal cases, \u201creferring to what another jury may have done is clearly improper because the defendant\u2019s jury cannot permissibly rely on what they may assume a previous jury to have found. . . . Such conduct raises the concern that a defendant might be convicted based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>the disposition of the charges against the [co-conspirator], rather than upon an individual assessment of the remaining defendant\u2019s personal culpability.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The concerns discussed in <em>Butler </em>extend to cases where, as here, the disclosure of the coconspirator\u2019s conviction is made by the court; when the court provides the jury with such information, the potential for prejudice is substantial. \u201cA judge presiding at a jury trial occupies a role of inherent power and dignity that commands a deference from the jury impossible to appraise precisely. What he tells the jury . . . has great weight with them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Loughlin, </em>149 Conn. 21, 27, 175 A.2d 367 (1961). \u201cIt is enough to say that the trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during a trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>160 Conn. 47, 52, 273 A.2d 689 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>5 Conn. App. 500, 508, 500 A.2d 571 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">In light of the foregoing principles and the specific facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that the court abused its discretion by taking judicial notice of the conviction of the defendant\u2019s alleged coconspirator and accomplice during its final instructions to the jury, thereby providing the jury with unduly prejudicial matter for deliberation. The court\u2019s improper comment deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial and warrants a new trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> In addition to his claim regarding judicial notice, which is his third claim on appeal, the defendant also claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that the prerequisites for admissibility of certain evidence had been satisfied under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), when Carlton Martin refused to answer questions by reason of his fifth amendment privilege, (2) permitted Carlton Martin\u2019s invocation of his fifth amendment privilege to occur in the jury\u2019s presence (a) after an offer of proof made clear that the witness was going to invoke his privilege and (b) where the court\u2019s attempted curative instruction failed to remove the prejudice caused thereby, and (4) failed to charge the jury as requested by the defendant on the affirmative defense to felony murder set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, when sufficient evidence existed regarding the statutory prerequisites for that defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\"> Because we resolve the defendant\u2019s third claim regarding judicial notice in his favor, we do not address his remaining claims because they are not likely to arise in a new trial.

Counsel for both Carlton Martin and the defendant objected on several grounds, including the expected invocation by Carlton Martin of his privilege against self-incrimination. In an offer of proof, Carlton Martin was called as a witness for questioning, outside the presence of the jury, so that the court could rule on the admissibility of his testimony. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>259 Conn. 487, 490-93, 789 A.2d 979 (2002) (setting forth details involving Carlton Martin\u2019s invocation of privilege against self-incrimination while being questioned outside presence of jury at defendant\u2019s trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\"> Carlton Martin sought a writ of error from the trial court\u2019s determination, claiming that the court improperly rejected his assertion of his fifth amendment privilege <em>not to </em>testify and improperly held him in contempt for refusing to testify at the defendant's trial. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>259 Conn. 487, 489, 789 A.2d 979 (2002). Our Supreme Court agreed and determined that Carlton Martin \u201cproperly invoked his privilege\u201d at the defendant\u2019s trial. Id., 494. The court explained that a waiver of the privilege against self-incriroina\u00fcon in one proceeding does not affect the rights of a witness in another, separate proceeding; id., 496-99; and, accordingly, concluded that the trial court\u2019s determination that Carlton Martin could not invoke the privilege at the defendant\u2019s trial was improper. Id., 499-503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\"> The questions posed to Carlton Martin in the presence of the jury, to which he invoked his privilege against self-incrimination at the defendant\u2019s trial, are summarized in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>259 Conn. 487, 492-93, 789 A.2d 979 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\"> Section 2-1 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201c(a) Scope of section.

While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, <em>it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or even to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right, to consider.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.

As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Butter, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 502, however, the \u201copening the door\u201d or \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine does not stand for the proposition that \u201ctwo wrongs make a right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 512 n.5. \u201cThe doctrine of opening the door cannot ... be subverted into a rule for injection of prejudice. . . . The trial court must carefully consider whether the circumstances of the case warrant further inquiry into [or discussion of] the subject matter, and should permit it only to the extent necessary to remove any unfair prejudice which might otherwise have ensued from the original [discussion or] evidence.\u201d (Intemal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 653.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\"> Section 6-7 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201cFor the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness, evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime is admissible if the crime was punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.

See footnotes 1 and 2. As to his first claim, we note only that it is predicated on the court\u2019s determination that Carlton Martin could not invoke his privilege against self-incrimination at the defendant\u2019s trial and conclude that this issue is not likely to recur in the new trial in light of our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>259 Conn. 487, 499-503, 789 A.2d 979 (2002) (concluding that trial court\u2019s determination that Carlton Martin could not invoke privilege at defendant\u2019s trial was improper); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>footnote 9. Accordingly, we do not reach that claim. As to the defendant\u2019s second and fourth claims, we note that because we do not know the course of events that will transpire or what evidence will be presented at the defendant\u2019s new trial, we do not reach those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
