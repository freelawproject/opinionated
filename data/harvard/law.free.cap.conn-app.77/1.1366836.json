The respondent, having been adjudicated a delinquent child, was committed to the custody of the commissioner of the department of children and families (department) and placed at Long Lane School on March 28, 2001. In October, 2001, he was transferred to the Connecticut Juvenile Training School. In December, 2001, the department\u2019s special investigation unit began investigating an allegation that a department police officer had slammed the respondent\u2019s head into a glass wall.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 22, 2002, the department found that the claim was unsubstantiated. On June 28, 2002, the respondent filed his motion for review, which the court denied on July 8, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The sole issue to be determined in this appeal is whether the court properly denied the motion for review in that it lacked statutory authority either to adjudicate or to provide the relief sought pursuant to \u00a7 17a-16.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">There is no dispute that \u00a7 17a-16 sets forth the rights of children who are under the supervision of the commissioner of the department and allows an aggrieved child whose rights are violated to petition the Superior Court for appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, and that the petition must be treated as a juvenile matter. What is in question is whether the \u201cmotion for review\u201d that was filed in this matter is such a \u201cpetition\u201d as is authorized under \u00a7 17a-16 (i). We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth our standard of review. Because the claim involves one of statutory authority and raises a question of law requiring our interpretation of \u00a7 17a-16, our review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 146-47, 698 A.2d 297 (1997). Our duty, when the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, is to determine whether those conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts appearing in the record. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>68 Conn. App. 173, 177, 789 A.2d 1104, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 910, 796 A.2d 556 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Our review of \u00a7 17a-16 leads us to conclude that its language is clear and unambiguous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That being so, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>do not construe the statute by looking to its history or purpose; \u201cwe need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent\" <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). \u201c[The] legislative intent is to be determined by an analysis of the language actually used in the legislation\u201d; Vaillancourt <em>v. New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 391, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993); it is found not in what the legislature perhaps meant to say, \u201cbut in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Dana-Robin Corp. </em>v. <em>Common Council, </em>166 Conn. 207, 221, 348 A.2d 560 (1974). Further, in considering statutory construction including legislative intent, we must recognize that \u201cthe legislature is presumed to have intended a reasonable, just and constitutional result.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">A Juvenile Court is not precluded from exercising its authority under \u00a7 17a-16 to entertain a petition from an aggrieved child or youth. Such exercise of authority may include issuing orders that impose injunctive or other appropriate relief to protect such child or youth from harm while under state supervision. Such a court, however, must act under the authority of the statute, which is preconditioned on the filing of a petition by the aggrieved child and the setting forth of a claim of a violation of subsections (a) to (h) of \u00a7 17a-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The respondent argues that his motion for review is a petition, as required under \u00a7 17a-16. We do not agree. The motion for review was not made under oath,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>not invoke a judicial hearing and sought relief not contemplated under the statute. The filing of the motion did not allow interested parties, i.e., the department and the employee accused of abuse, to participate, by providing notice and the opportunity to appear, as would a petition filed properly under \u00a7 17a-16. The respondent sought to have the court review certain documents \u201cand reverse the Department\u2019s determination that the respondent was not abused by [a department] Police Officer.\u201d See footnote 1. No evidentiary or adversarial type of hearing was requested or required, as the matter was presented to the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The motion was, in effect, an appeal from an agency\u2019s determination and sought a reversal of that determination in an almost ex parte fashion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>sought to have the court substitute its judgment for that of the agency on the basis of that limited review.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Having reached this point in our analysis, we now consider whether the court properly declined to grant the respondent the relief he sought. \u201cAlthough related, the court\u2019s authority to act pursuant to a statute is different from its subject matter jurisdiction. The power of the court to hear and determine, which is implicit in jurisdiction, is not to be confused with the way in which that power must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 728, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999). The issues in this case do not raise any claim with respect to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. We note, nonetheless, that the court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction. Rather, we conclude that the court lacked the authority to act under the statute; it could neither appropriately review the department\u2019s decision nor grant the relief sought in the respondent\u2019s motion. If the court, acting on the present motion for review, had granted relief under the authority conferred on it by \u00a7 17a-16, it would have applied an incorrect rule of law to the situation. It would not have acted \u201cwithout jurisdiction, but in the erroneous exercise of its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Artman </em>v. <em>Artman, </em>111 Conn. 124, 130, 149 A. 246 (1930). The court lacked authority to entertain the motion for review pursuant to \u00a7 17a-16.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The form of the judgment is improper, the order denying the motion for review is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-11\"> The motion for review stated as follows: \u201cThe aforementioned respondent pursuant to the Connecticut General Statutes section 17a-16 (a) and (i), Article First, Sections Eight and Ten of the Constitution of the State of Connecticut and the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, hereby moves this Honorable Court to review the Department of Children and Families investigation of reported abuse against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">\u201cIn support of this motion the respondent represents the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b22-13\">\u201c(1) That on December 11, 2001, a Connecticut Juvenile Training School/ [department of children and families] employee contacted the D.C.F.
