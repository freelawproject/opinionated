The defendant further claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The record and transcript of the proceedings before the trial court reveal the following relevant facts. The defendant is the owner of three residential buildings located in Waterbury. On April 9, 2001, the defendant pleaded guilty under the doctrine of <em>North Carolina </em>v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), to reckless endangerment and various fire code and health code violations that occurred between October, 1999, and October, 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court canvassed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and found the plea to be entered knowingly and voluntarily. The plea of guilty to the violations was entirely conditioned on the defendant\u2019s abating the violations as well as the payment of a $3000 contribution to a nonprofit charity. The parties further agreed that if the defendant abided by the conditions of the plea agreement, and the court so found, the state would enter a nolle prosequi to the charges; if he failed to abide by the agreement, he would serve a two year prison sentence suspended after eighty four days, plus probation. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the court set July 2,2001, as the date by which the defendant had to complete the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Upon his return to court, the defendant had failed to take advantage of that time to correct the housing code violations cited by the fire department and health department. The court raised the defendant\u2019s bond to $40,000 with the understanding that he had until August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>8, 2001, to repair the remaining violations. The defendant still did not successfully complete the repairs, and on August 14, 2001, the court sentenced him to a term of two years imprisonment, suspended after eighty four days, followed by three years of probation. The defendant did not seek to withdraw his plea at any point. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly accepted his guilty plea because it was not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court did not adequately explain the terms of the plea agreement and improperly accepted his plea without first ascertaining whether he understood the elements of the charged offenses. He further argues that the court failed to inquire as to whether his counsel had advised him of the nature of each offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Because he did not attempt to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing, the defendant did not preserve his claim for appellate review. Accordingly, he requests that we review his claims under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), as refined by <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>that the defendant has satisfied the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for review, and the claim that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 418, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). We conclude, however, that his claim must fail because he has not demonstrated that the alleged due process violation \u201cclearly exists and clearly deprived [him] of a fair trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">An overview of the law governing guilty pleas is necessary for our disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the trial court judge bears an affirmative, nondelegable duty to clarify the terms of a plea agreement. [U]nless a plea of guilty is made knowingly and voluntarily, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>69 Conn. App. 738, 745, 796 A.2d 491, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 909, 806 A.2d 50 (2002). The United States Supreme Court delineated the requirements for a valid guilty plea in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243-44, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Benitez, </em>67 Conn. App. 36, 42, 786 A.2d 520 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 922, 792 A.2d 855 (2002). <em>\u201cBoykin </em>requires that before accepting a defendant\u2019s plea, a trial court must inform him of three core constitutional rights: His right to be free of compulsory self-incrimination, and his rights to a jury trial and to confront his accusers. . . . Those rights also are guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, as amended by article seventeen of the amendments.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) Id. Additionally, \u201c[t]he determination as to whether a plea has been knowingly and voluntarily entered entails an examination of all of the relevant circumstances [and] the plea may satisfy constitutional requirements even in the absence of literal compliance with the prophylactic safeguards of [Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>65 Conn. App. 234, 241-42, 783 A.2d 7, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 929, 783 A.2d 1031 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Finally, \u201c[w]e note that with respect to <em>Golding </em>review, we construe the question of whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered her plea based on her understanding of the binding nature of that plea as similar to questions of voluntariness of the plea raised in the context of a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the sentencing possibilities. . . . Therefore, to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding </em>in the present case, we must determine whether the defendant was aware of actual sentencing possibilities, and, if not, whether accurate information would have made any difference in his decision to enter a [guilty] plea.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>69 Conn. App. 691, 695-96, 796 A.2d 1238 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">With those principles in mind, we now address the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant contends that the record reveals that neither the court nor his counsel explained the essential elements of the housing code or fire code violations with which he was charged. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>fact that an allegation of noncompliance with [a rale of practice] may sometimes have constitutional dimensions does not . . . establish the existence of such a constitutional nexus in every case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wideman, </em>38 Conn. App. 581, 585, 663 A.2d 409, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 907, 665 A.2d 906 (1995). \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has stated that where a trial court does not inform a defendant during a plea proceeding about the elements of the crime charged, even without such an express representation, it may be appropriate to presume that in most cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[60 Conn. App. 575, 581-82, 760 A.2d 948, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 922, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000)], quoting <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 647, 96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1976).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>61 Conn. App. 855, 864, 767 A.2d 1250, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 955, 772 A.2d 153 (2001). Although the record does not support the presumption that defense counsel informed the defendant of the elements of the crimes charged,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> our review of the record reveals that the defendant was served with notice of the code violations and that the prosecutor recited the underlying facts that tracked those violations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wideman, </em>supra, 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Further, an examination of the transcript of the defendant\u2019s plea canvass indicates that the court did fully inform the defendant that by pleading guilty, he was waiving his privilege against self-incrimination, his constitutional right to a jury trial and his right to confront his accusers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Additionally, the record indicates that the defendant entered his guilty pleas of his own volition, without any force or threats by any other persons, and that he was certain that he wanted to plead guilty to the charges against him. Given the court\u2019s inquiries and the defendant\u2019s responses, the record demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that even if the court expressly had stated the elements of the crimes, the defendant\u2019s decision would not have been different. We conclude, therefore, that the court adequately informed the defendant of the terms of the plea agreement, and the court\u2019s failure to inform him explicitly of all the elements of the charges did not render his guilty plea to the violations unknowing or involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly found that he had breached his plea agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that a plea agreement is akin to a contract and that the well established principles of contract law can provide guidance in the interpretation of a plea agreement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 314, 699 A.2d 921 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Trotman, </em>68 Conn. App. 437, 444, 791 A.2d 700 (2002). Where the contract language relied on by the trial court is definitive, the interpretation of the contract is a matter of law and our review is plenary. <em>Empire Paving, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>57 Conn. App. 261, 265, 747 A.2d 1063 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The defendant asserts that he entered his guilty plea pursuant to his belief that he only had to substantially correct the housing violations cited by the fire department and health department, and because he had repaired all but four of the twenty-five violations, he did not breach the agreement. By substantially performing the obligations of the plea agreement, the defendant maintains that, in good faith, he made sufficient efforts to comply with its terms.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>We begin by pointing out that the primary goal of contract interpretation is \u201cto effectuate the intent of the parties .... Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Ginsberg, </em>70 Conn. App. 748, 761, 802 A.2d 137, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 905, 810 A.2d 271 (2002). A review of the plea agreement reveals that its plain words, as recited by the court during the plea colloquy, specified that \u201cany outstanding violations\u201d cited at the Dikeman Street<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and Easton Avenue apartment buildings had to be \u201cfinished,\u201d and that \u201cif [the defendant] did <em>everything, </em>everything gets thrown out.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In light of the clear and unambiguous terms of the plea agreement, we conclude, on the basis of our plenary review of that agreement, that the defendant\u2019s failure to cooperate fully, truthfully and completely was a breach of that agreement, as determined by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he claims that his counsel failed to make reasonable efforts to confirm and to ensure that he completely understood and appreciated the plea bargain offer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Initially, we note that the defendant failed to raise his claim before the trial court. \u201cOur Supreme Court has consistently concluded that the preferred vehicle for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is either a petition for a writ of habeas coipus or a petition for a new trial, not a direct appeal. . . . Absent the eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tiary hearing available in the collateral action, review in this court of the ineffective assistance claim is at best difficult and sometimes impossible. The evidentiary hearing provides the trial court with the evidence that is often necessary to evaluate the competency of the defense and the harmfulness of any incompetency.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>63 Conn. App. 245, 262, 775 A.2d 325, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 933, 776 A.2d 1151 (2001). Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (4)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provides, however, an exception to that general rule when ineffective assistance of counsel results in a guilty plea. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>63 Conn. App. 151, 161, 772 A.2d 747, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 934, 776 A.2d 1151 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Irala, </em>68 Conn. App. 499, 525, 792 A.2d 109, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 887, 123 S. Ct. 132, 154 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2002). \u201cOn the rare occasions that we have addressed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal, we have limited our review to allegations that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights had been jeopardized by the actions of the <em>trial court, </em>rather than by those of his counsel.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>262 Conn. 276, 285, 811 A.2d 705 (2003). That rare occasion did not arise here. There was no claim in the trial court of any problem between the defendant and counsel, and no allegation that the court should have inquired as to a claim that there had been ineffective assistance. No record was made, and there is no record in this proceeding from which this court could make a determination using the <em>Strickland-Hill </em>test.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Baillargeon </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>67 Conn. App. 716, 732, 789 A.2d 1046 (2002). Not only was there no claim in the trial court that the defendant was not advised of the elements of the charges, there is no indication that he would have acted differently had that occurred. The test simply is not satisfied here. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>67 Conn. App. 168, 177, 786 A.2d 1171 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">There is no factual record from which this court could determine that there was ineffective assistance or that any prejudice flowed from that representation. We conclude, therefore, that any such claim in this case cannot be made on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> \u201cSee <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
