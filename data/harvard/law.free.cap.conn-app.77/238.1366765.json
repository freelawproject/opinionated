We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The following facts and procedural histoiy are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. The Bloomfield police department received information from an informant that the defendant was selling crack cocaine in the greater Bloomfield area. The informant arranged a meeting between the defendant and an undercover officer. During the meeting, the officer purchased from the defendant a plastic bag containing a substance later determined to be crack cocaine. Subsequently, at a second meeting, the defendant was taken into custody and charged with the sale of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On August 20, 2001, the defendant entered a guilty plea as to the charge. Prior to accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the court canvassed the defendant. After informing the defendant of the consequences of his plea, the court accepted his plea of guilty. The defendant subsequently filed a motion to vacate his guilty plea. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and sentenced him to eighteen months incarceration, execution suspended, and three years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to vacate his guilty plea. Specifically, the defendant argues that (1) his plea was not voluntarily and knowingly entered because he did not fully appreciate the consequences of his plea, and (2) he was entitled to withdraw his plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-26.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. During the plea canvass, the following colloquy occurred between the court and the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u201cThe Court: If you are not a citizen, Mr. Stewart, I do have to advise you that conviction of the offense to which you are pleading guilty may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. Do you understand that, as well, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Before accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the court asked the defendant whether he understood that he was waiving his right to a trial. The defendant again responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The court accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea after he indicated that he understood the nature and consequences of his plea. The court found that the plea was voluntarily and understandingly made with the assistance of competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">On October 16, 2001, the defendant obtained new counsel and filed a motion to vacate his guilty plea on the ground that he did not fully appreciate the consequences of his guilty plea. After oral argument, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate, noting that the defendant had numerous opportunities to withdraw his plea while he was being canvassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">The defendant first argues that the court improperly denied his motion to vacate because his plea was not voluntarily and knowingly made. Specifically, he contends that his plea was not voluntary and knowing because he was unaware that there was a certainty, rather than a mere possibility, that he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>deported as a result of his conviction. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201cA guilty plea, once accepted, maybe withdrawn only with the permission of the court. . . . The court is required to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea upon proof of any ground set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 [39-27]. . . . Whether such proof is made is a question for the court in its sound discretion, and a denial of permission to withdraw is reversible only if that discretion has been abused.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gundel, </em>56 Conn. App. 805, 812, 746 A.2d 204, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 906, 753 A.2d 941 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe grounds for allowing the defendant to withdraw his or her plead of guilty after acceptance are as follows . . . (2) The plea was involuntary, or it was entered without knowledge of the nature of the charge or without knowledge that the sentence actually imposed could be imposed . . . .\u201d That provision is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding that acceptance of a guilty plea comports with due process only if the plea was voluntarily and knowingly made. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243-44, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). \u201cThe <em>Boykin </em>constitutional essentials for the acceptance of a plea of guilty are included in our rules and are reflected in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 [39-19 and 39-20<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]. . . . Those rules provide that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>must not accept a guilty plea without first addressing the defendant personally in open court and determining that the defendant fully understands the items enumerated in [Practice Book] \u00a7 39-19, and that the plea is made voluntarily pursuant to [Practice Book] \u00a7 39-20.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>253 Conn. 497, 504, 752 A.2d 49 (2000). \u201cThere is no requirement, however, that the defendant be advised of <em>every </em>possible consequence of such a plea.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 383, 521 A.2d 547 (1987). \u201cAlthough a defendant must be aware of the direct consequences of a plea, the scope of direct consequences is very narrow. . . . In Connecticut, the direct consequences of a defendant\u2019s plea include only [those enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (2), (3) and (4)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Irala, </em>68 Conn. App. 499, 519, 792 A.2d 109, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 887, 123 S. Ct. 132, 154 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2002). If a defendant is not informed of all possible indirect or collateral consequences, his plea is not thereby rendered unintelligent or involuntary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-1<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires the court to advise the defendant during his canvass that a conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the offense with which the defendant was charged <em>may </em>have the consequence of deportation. In this case, the court recited the statutory language with near precision. The defendant\u2019s affirmative responses to the canvass satisfied the requirements for ensuring voluntary pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u201cThe onus rests . . . with the defendant and [the defendant\u2019s] counsel to determine the final result applicable to [the defendant\u2019s] situation under federal immigration law before entering a plea.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Irala, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 520. The defendant in the present case concedes that he was clearly informed, in accordance with state law, of the possibility of deportation. We previously have held that such a warning is adequate and that the failure to inform a defendant that his or her conviction will certainly result in deportation does not render a plea unintelligent or involuntary in the constitutional sense. Id., 519-20. We therefore conclude that the court did not improperly deny the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his guilty plea on the ground that it was not voluntary and knowingly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The defendant next argues that he was entitled to withdraw his plea under Practice Book \u00a7 39-26. Specifically, the defendant argues that the intended purpose of Practice Book \u00a7 39-26 is to entitle the defendant to withdraw his plea for any credible reason that is not outweighed by any prejudice to the state. The defendant makes that argument for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cThe requirement that [a] claim be raised distinctly means that it must be so stated as to bring to the attention of the court the <em>precise </em>matter on which its decision is being asked.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>12 Conn. App. 427, 431 n.5, 531 A.2d 157 (1987). The defendant also has not requested review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim that he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The defendant next claims that his plea was erroneously made due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that his attorney provided ineffective representation by failing to inform him that his guilty plea would result in certain deportation. We decline to review that claim because it is unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">As previously stated, a claim must be distinctly raised at trial. In his brief, the defendant argues that he \u201ctangentially\u201d raised the issue at the oral argument on his motion to vacate by informing the court that his prior counsel had not alerted him to the danger of deportation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A claim briefly suggested is not distinctly raised. <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 164, 166, 438 A.2d 865 (1981). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s failure to raise distinctly in the trial court the grounds upon which he now relies effectively deprived the trial court of the opportunity to consider the matter in the first instance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>199 Conn. 453, 462, 508 A.2d 11 (1986). More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>over, the defendant has not requested review of his claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. \u201cIn the absence of such a request, we have, in the past, declined to review a defendant\u2019s claim under similar circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. App. 777, 787, 664 A.2d 291, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 918, 665 A.2d 610 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1084, 116 S. Ct. 799, 133 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1996). Therefore, this court declines to engage in that analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned . . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 39-26 provides: \u201cA defendant may withdraw his or her plea of guilty or nolo contendere as a matter of right until the plea has been accepted.
