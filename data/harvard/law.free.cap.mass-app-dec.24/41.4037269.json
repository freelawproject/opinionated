The issues were joined by a general denial and a plea of contributory negligence. Agency of the driver was not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s driver gave evidence that he was not at the time and place of the accident on any business of the plaintiff. Further, it could have been found on his evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>dence that the defendant driver was negligent and the judge rightly ruled on the plaintiff\u2019s requests that a finding for the plaintiff would be warranted. Most of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crequests\u201d were for findings of fact which were rightly denied.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b48-7\">Sidney Blumenthal of Boston for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The issue raised on argument involved the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s fourth request: \u201c(4) On establishing that the defendant\u2019s cab was operated negligently, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, as a bailor.\u201d This request was denied as inapplicable and the court made the following finding of fact in its denial: \u201cThe plaintiff did not sustain the burden of proof that the cab was operated negligently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Regardless of the issue of bailment, <em>Nash v. Long, </em>268 Mass. 407, the burden was on the plaintiff to prove negligence and rarely can it be ruled as a matter of law that the party having the burden of proof has sustained that burden. <em>Coleman v. N.Y.N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>215 Mass. 45, 47; <em>Winchester v. Missin, </em>278 Mass. 427, 428; <em>Hoffman v. Chelsea, </em>315 Mass. 54, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On this issue the court having found that the plaintiff failed to maintain his burden, the appeal cannot be sustained. \u201cFurther discussion would be superfluous in view of recent decisions in which the subject has been exhaustively treated with a full citation of cases.\u201d <em>Norton v. Tilton, </em>325 Mass. 79, 80. <em>Report dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
