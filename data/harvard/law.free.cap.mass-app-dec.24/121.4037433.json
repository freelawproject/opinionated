A father is liable for the expenses of his children born in lawful wedlock, including their nuturc, education and support. <em>Barry v. Sparks, </em>306 Mass. 80; C. <em>v. Briggs, </em>16 Pick. 203, 205; <em>Reynolds v. Sweetser, </em>15 Gray 78; <em>Mayhew v Thayer, </em>8 Gray 172; <em>Treas. </em>&amp; <em>Rec. Gen. v. Sermini, </em>229 Mass. 24, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">5. Necessaries, as respects a father\u2019s liability, are not confined to article of food or clothing required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to sustain life, but include such things for use by his children as are suitable to maintain them according to their father\u2019s property and condition in life, including their education. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. v. Cohen, </em>242 Mass. 245; <em>Rayned v. Bennett, </em>114 Mass. 424; <em>Gould v. Laurence, 160 </em>Mass. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>6. </em>A father can never, under our law, as long as he has pecuniary ability, be absolved from the obligation of relieving the necessities, and contributing to the maintainance and education of his children. <em>Reynolds v. Sweetser, </em>15 Gray 78; <em>Brown v. Brightman, </em>13<em>6 </em>Mass. 187, 8; <em>Dennis v. Clark, </em>2 Cush. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">7. A father is legally responsible for all charges thus necessarily incurred by his wife on his credit in procuring board, support and education for their common offspring. <em>Reynolds v. Sweetser, </em>15 Gray 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">8.

Drew, </em>247 Mass. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The Court ruled on the requests as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Finding for the plaintiff v. Mary E. Pandolf only, and assess damages in the sum of $438.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em>Plaintiff\u2019s Requests for Rulings\u2019. </em>1. Denied. 2. Allowed. 3. Denied. 4. Allowed as to the defendant Mary E. Pandolf. Denied as to the defendant Harold Pandolf. 5. Denied since stipulated and agreed at trial: (a) Value of services \u2014\u25a0 $560.50. (b) Services were rendered. 6. Denied \u2014 Same reason as #5 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\"><em>Defendant, Mary E. Pandolf s Requests for Rulings\u2019. </em>1. Denied. 2. Denied. 3. Denied. 4. Request #4 through #10 inclusive are allowed as a general statement or general principle of law only, but are inapplicable to the facts as found.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\"><em>Memorandum. </em>Count 1 \u2014 For plaintiff v. Mary E. Pandolf only for \u2014 $104.50. Count 2 \u2014 For plaintiff v. Mary E. Pandolf only for \u2014 $334.00. Count 3 \u2014 For plaintiff v. Mary E. Pandolf only. For the defendant, Harold Pandolf, on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The memorandum contains no statement of \u201cthe facts as found\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">The defendant, Mrs. Pandolf, duly filed a request for report, and a draft report which the trial judge, after hearing, disallowed. Thereupon and pursuant to her petition to establish a report, the report was established by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>It is contention of Mrs. Pandolf that when the trial court \u201callowed\u201d her request for rulings numbered 4 through 10, \u201cas a general statement or general principle of law only, but are inapplicable to the facts as found,n the court was required by Rule 27 of the District Courts (1952) as amended, to state the facts as found, and failure so to do was prejudicial error. See <em>Home Savings Bank v. Savransky, </em>307 Mass. 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The last paragraph of Rule 27 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACb\">\u201cWhenever any request for rulings, founded upon evidence, shall be refused upon the ground that it is inconsistent with or inapplicable to the facts found, or because the facts recited in the request are not found, the court shall state the facts found, or the facts recited which it does not find, upon which such refusal is based, unless the same appears from special findings filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The rationale of the procedure required of the trial judge by this rule becomes quite clear upon a consideration of the action taken by the trial judge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The trial judge in the District Court sits in a dual capacity; that is, he instructs himself as to the principles of law applicable and, guided by such rules, he finds the facts. He must adopt correct rules of law for his guidance and find facts as guided by these rules. A party has right by seasonable presentation of appropriate requests for rulings to know the principles of law which guided the judge in reaching his conclusions. If the requests presented are sound in law, pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>to the issues, applicable to the evidence, it is the duty of the judge to grant them and follow them in reaching his decision. <em>Bangs v. Farr, </em>209 Mass. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In such a situation a claim for report brings before the Appellate Court the question of law whether it was permissible on the subsidiary facts established to make the ultimate finding and whether it was arrived at by the application of the correct principles of law, and the statement of the subsidiary facts as found by the court must be sufficient to demonstrate whether the general findings were reached by the application of correct principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The general principles of law applicable to the issue of this case relates to the respective liability of the father and/or mother for the support and maintenance of the family unit. It requires no detailed statement of authority to state that it is the obligation of the father to provide those things which are \u201cnecessaries\u201d for the proper maintenance and support of his wife and minor children. This obligation comes into existence by the marriage, and his wife is authorized by implication of law to pledge his credit for this purpose. <em>Detore v. Demers Bros., Inc., </em>312 Mass. 531. <em>Fisher v. Drew, </em>247 Mass. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The statute removing the common law disability of, and empowering married women to enter into contracts (G. L. c. 209, \u00a76) has never abrogated the sole liability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the husband for \u201cnecessaries,\u201d and there is no contract binding her by implication of law. <em>Lavoie v. Dube, </em>229 Mass. 87. Under this statute empowering her contract, she may become liable for such services, provided it is shown that she contracted directly as a principal and pledges her own credit, <em>Cleary v. First National Stores, Inc., </em>291 Mass. 172; <em>Thibeault v. Poole, </em>283 Mass. 481; <em>Groce v. First National Stores, </em>268 Mass. 210; <em>Charron v. Day, </em>228 Mass. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The burden is on the plaintiff to establish this fact since the natural presumption is that she is acting for her husband in procuring those services which her husband is required to furnish.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">As to what are \u201cnecessaries\u201d, and whether the wife is acting for her husband or on her own credit, is in each instance generally a question of fact to be determined by the court. (As to \u201ceducation\u201d as a necessary, see <em>Moscow v. Marshall, </em>271 Mass. 302.) Applying these general principles to the evidence adduced in this case, the trial court could make one of two mutually incompatable ultimate findings, depending in each instance upon the determination by the court of the subsidiary facts. The court could find that the services were necessaries, in which case Mr. Pandolf would be liable. The court could find that Mr. Pandolf authorized and/or ratified his wife\u2019s actions as his agent in procuring these services, in which case he would be liable. The court could find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Mrs. Pandolf entered into a direct contract with the plaintiff on her own .credit, whereby she agreed to pay, in which case she could be found liable. There could not be a finding against both husband and wife jointly. (G. L. c. 209, \u00a77, is not applicable here). The only basis upon which the court could find as it did, in favor of the father and against the mother, was the court\u2019s determination (a) that services were not necessaries, and (b) that the father never authorized or ratified the wife\u2019s action in procuring these services, and (c) that the wife made a direct contract on her own credit with the plaintiff. All of these subsidiary facts had to be established in favor of the plaintiff to support the ultimate findings of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Mrs. Pandolf by her appropriate requests was entitled to have the trial judge state which of these subsidiary facts were established in his mind and which principles of law he applied, and in so doing the trial judge would have demonstrated whether he was, in fact, guided by these correct principles of law in making his ultimate findings. <em>Home Savings Bank v. Savransky, cited supra; Barry v. Sparks, </em>306 Mass. 80; <em>Muir Bros. Co. v. Sawyer Construction Co., </em>328 Mass. 413. Failure of the trial judge to state the facts found makes it impossible for the reviewing court to determine whether or not his assertion that requests were not in accord with facts found by him is correct. <em>Barry v. Sparks, cited supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The plaintiff argues that the general finding imports the finding of all subsidiary facts necessary to that conclusion warranted by the evidence. This is generally true, but this rule cannot be invoked to show that a refusal by the court of requests for rulings was proper in view of the facts or to show compliance with Rule 27. <em>Home Savings Bank v. Savransky, cited supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The failure of the trial judge to state the facts found by him which made Mrs. Pandolf\u2019s requests numbered 4 through 10 \u201cinapplicable\u201d was prejudicial error and she is therefore entitled to a new trial. <em>Barry v. Sparks, cited supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Mrs. Pandolf further contends that the evidence does not warrant a finding against her and requires a finding against her husband. We are not prepared to rule on the basis of the record before us that the evidence required such findings as .to each defendant as a matter of law. The record does not disclose from whom the evidence relating to the crucial issues of fact was adduced. We are, therefore, unable to make a judgment as to whether the evidence could be believed or disbelieved by the trial judge or whether it was testimony that bound either defendant as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\n<em>It is ordered that the findings of the trial fudge are vacated, and that the case stand for a nevo trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
