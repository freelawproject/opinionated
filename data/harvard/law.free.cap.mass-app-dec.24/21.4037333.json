The plaintiff took an exception and claims a report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b28-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>M. B. Neariss of Gloucester, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b28-8\">Davis &amp; Cahill, Segal <em>Sc </em>Flamm of Boston, for</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b28-3\">We are unable to find from the report before us whether the pleas in abatement should have been overruled or sustained. The declaration and the pleas are not included in the report, so that we do not know the nature of the plaintiffs claim and the grounds of the defendants\u2019 pleas in abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Furthermore, it appears that only a discussion was held before the Court who allowed the pleas in abatement \u201cwithout the introduction of evidence from either party\u201d. Before action can be taken thereon, the pleadings and the facts should be considered by the trial judge, and in the event of an appeal to the Appellate Division all this should be included in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">We learn from the defendants\u2019 brief some of the grounds for their pleas, but from the report we cannot find whether or not these were submitted to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The order of the Court allowing defendants' pleas in abatement is to be vacated and a new hearing held in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
