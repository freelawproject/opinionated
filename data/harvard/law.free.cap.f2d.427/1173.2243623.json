The defense of insanity was raised at trial but appellant offered no expert testimony on this issue. The government, however, did offer expert testimony, but such testimony was given in accordance with the insanity test then in effect in this Circuit, i. e., M\u2019Naghten plus irresistible impulse as set forth in Sauer v. United States (9 Cir. 1957), 241 F.2d 640, cert. denied 354 U.S. 940, 77 S.Ct. 1405, 1 L.Ed.2d 1539. The court\u2019s final instruction to the jury on the issue was also in accordance with this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-26\">An appeal was pending at the time this court announced its new insanity test in Wade v. United States, 424 F.2d 64 (9th Cir. Mar. 30, 1970). <em>Wade </em>provided for limited retroactivity, including cases pending on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-27\">The record indicates that appellant acquiesced in the insanity instruction given by the trial court. Such acquiescence,, however, did not amount to a waiver of his rights under <em>Wade. </em>Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>ed States v.
