His listed the aid of an attorney from Neigh-conviction was affirmed by this court over two claims of prejudicial error in the instructions given to the jury at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, he filed a series of <em>pro se </em>applications for postconvietion relief, all of which were denied without hearing or the appointment of counsel by the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1968, having enborhood Legal Services,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>present petition, which seeks relief primarily on the ground that certain incriminating statements introduced against him at trial were the product of an illegal arrest and an illegal period of detention; were elicited by government agents after his indictment and in the absence of counsel; and were in any event involuntary because appellant at the time lacked the mental capacity to make a voluntary statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Like the others, this petition was denied without a hearing. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The applicable principles may be briefly stated. A motion for postconviction relief may be denied without hearing only if \u201cthe motion and the files and records in the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief;\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> if the grounds for relief relied upon were previously determined, on the merits, adversely to the applicant after an adequate hearing, and \u201cthe ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits\u201d of the new application;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> if the government can show that a successive application for relief constitutes an abuse of the remedy;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or if the applicant has deliberately bypassed ordinary procedures for review available to him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">None of these discretionary<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> exceptions to the hearing requirement is applicable to the present case. The merits of appellant\u2019s claims were not reached on direct appeal from his conviction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> His previous <em>pro se </em>motions for relief were denied without either a hearing or the appointment of counsel. Denial of a motion for relief without a hearing cannot be taken as a denial on the merits for the purpose of determining whether a subsequent application based on the same ground may be summarily denied,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and it is doubtful whether even a full hearing on the merits may be deemed \u201cadequate\u201d for this purpose if the applicant was through no fault of his own not represented by counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event, at least one of appellant\u2019s claims rests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>upon an intervening change in the law,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which would entitle him to a new hearing even if the merits had been determined adversely to him prior to that time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Several other matters require brief mention. The government contends that appellant\u2019s motion was properly denied without a hearing because the statements whose introduction he challenges were not incriminating, but exculpatory; that they may be deemed \u201charmless error\u201d even if incriminating; and that, in any event, the matter is no longer open because a prisoner may not challenge on a \u00a7 2255 motion the admissibility of a confession at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\"><em>First. </em>We have some difficulty seeing how appellant\u2019s statements, some of which are set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> may fairly be characterized as \u201cexculpatory.\u201d But in any event, \u201c[i]f found to have been illegally admitted, reversible error will result, since the prosecution cannot on the one hand offer evidence to prove guilt, and which by the very offer is vouched for as tending to that end, and on the other hand for the purposes of avoiding the consequences of the error, caused by its wrongful admission, be heard to assert that the matter offered as a confession was not prejudicial because it did not tend to prove guilt.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\"><em>Second. </em>It is doubtful whether, under Chapman v. California,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the erroneous introduction of incriminating statements against a defendant may ever be deemed \u201charmless error.\u201d In the context of the present case, however, appellant\u2019s statement effectively eliminated any theory of accidental discharge of the gun \u2014 a theory that could not have been ruled out by other evidence in the case, as there were no witnesses who saw the actual shooting.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In consequence, we can hardly say that we are certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements challenged played no part in appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\"><em>Third. </em>The Government, relying on Hodges v. United States,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> would have us hold that the admissibility of a confession is not open to challenge on a \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are unable to perceive the basis for this argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Kaufman v. United States <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> makes clear that the relief available under \u00a7 2255 is at least as broad<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> as that available to state prisoners seeking federal habeas corpus: <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> save for those errors which may be considered harmless, trial errors of constitutional magnitude are cognizable on collateral attack.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Consequently, appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge to the admissibility of his statements is open in this proceeding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-14\">. Assault with intent to kill, assault with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a dangerous weapon, all charges arising out of the same incident. Appellant received concurrent sentences on all counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-15\">. Tucker v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 250, 318 F.2d 221 (1963). One of several subsequent petitions for rehearing <em>en bane </em>raised the issue, inter alia, of appellant\u2019s competence to stand trial. The court appointed an <em>amicus </em>to brief the issue and eventually, treating the petition as one for rehearing by the panel, denied it \u201cwithout prejudice to any proper application by appellant * * * pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, section 2255 * * *.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-25\">. The history of appellant\u2019s previous attempts to obtain postconviction review is long and complex.

Of course, \u201cit must be clearly understood that [this] standard * * * depends on the considered choice of the petitioner.

We need not now decide whether appellant\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of his statements under Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957), is cognizable in the present proceeding. <em>Mallory </em>was rested solely upon the construction of Fed.R. Crim.P. 5(a), and the Supreme Court in consequence had no occasion to decide whether the conduct proscribed by the Federal Rules was proscribed by the Constitution as well. Of course some errors not of constitutional magnitude are cognizable under \u00a7 2255, <em>see </em>Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962) (by implication), and the <em>Mallory </em>rule may be such a one. A contrary conclusion would of course require decision of the difficult question whether the result in <em>Mallory </em>is constitutionally required, particularly in light of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). That <em>Miranda </em>is not in general retroactive, Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), does not necessarily mean it has no application to conduct already known by the government to be unlawful for reasons not necessarily grounded in the Constitution.
