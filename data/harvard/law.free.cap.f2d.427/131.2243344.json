He now seeks to have his 1961 conviction on five counts of issuing worthless checks declared invalid and the amount paid in fines returned. Appellant pleaded guilty to the five charges and was sentenced to pay a $100.00 fine or serve 60 days in jail on each count. Appellant\u2019s aunt paid the fines plus $88.22 in costs. Appellant did not appeal the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Appellant alleges that he was sentenced without the benefit of counsel and was denied a trial by jury. We need not discuss the merits of these contentions since it is clear that the district court correctly held that the action was barred by the applicable state statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 95.11, Florida Statutes (1967), F.S.A. provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Actions other than those for the recovery of real property can only be commenced as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">***** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">(4) Within Four Years. \u2014 Any action for relief not specifically provided for in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">(5) Within Three Years.\u2014 (a) An action upon a liability created by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">The district court, in dismissing the complaint, cited \u00a7 95.11(4). It would appear, however, that the breadth of construction given \u00a7 95.11(5) (a) in the past, by this Court and the Florida courts, would make it applicable to the present case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our concern in the present case, however, is clearly academic since the action is time barred under either section of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-17\">The appellant does not allege, nor does it otherwise appear that the present death sentence was based upon the proceedings he now attacks, by way of enhancement of sentence or otherwise. There is therefore no basis, factual or legal, to consider the present complaint as a petition for habeas corpus or other collateral relief. See Cline v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 323, <em>cf. </em>Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-18\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-12\">. 42 U.S.O. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-13\">.
