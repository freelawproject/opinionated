After the information issued, Ortiz petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his arrest in Puerto Rico and return to the Virgin Islands were illegal. At the hearing on his petition, he also argued that the district court was required to set bail in accordance with the Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3146-52 (Supp. IV, 1969). The district court refused to issue the writ or to set bail, and Ortiz has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-10\">The victim of the alleged murder died of gunshot wounds inflicted on July 8, 1967 in St. Croix. The evidence developed at the habeas corpus hearing showed that Ortiz was implicated in the crime by statements taken from two alleged accomplices nearly two years later. At that time, Ortiz was living with his father in Puerto Rico. Two F.B.I. agents arrested him there and took him to La Princessa jail in San Juan. The next day, two Virgin Islands detectives removed Ortiz from La Princessa jail and took him to the Virgin Islands without a warrant and, so far as appears from the record, without extradition or removal proceedings of any kind. Ortiz was taken before a municipal court judge in St. Croix and held on a complaint for first degree murder. Before a preliminary hearing was held, the United States Attorney filed an information in the district court charging Ortiz with the same crime. He is now held for trial on that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">At the habeas corpus hearing, Ortiz indicated in response to questions posed by the court that he had submitted to arrest and removal from Puerto Rico in order to comply with the wishes of his father, who is a bodyguard for the Governor of Puerto Rico:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-15\">\u201cQ. All right, did you at any time tell them that you didn\u2019t want to come back to St. Croix? Did you protest being taken back here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-16\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-17\">Q. You did what they told you to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-18\">A. I must do what my father told me to do. Father is the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-19\">The government presented no evidence, and the district court made no finding, on the legality of the arrest and removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the district court found that Ortiz had returned to the Virgin Islands voluntarily, \u201cin the sense that he did not express opposition to returning * * *.\u201d Although there is some evidence that Ortiz did not consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>to his return to the Virgin Islands, the district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous. Moreover, even if Ortiz had been illegally arrested and forcibly brought within the jurisdiction, there are decisions of the United States Supreme Court which support the proposition that his detention and trial thereafter under a valid information would violate no constitutional guarantee. <em>See </em>Frisbie v. Collins, 1952, 342 U.S. 519, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541; Mahon v. Justice, 1888, 127 U.S. 700, 8 S.Ct. 1204, 32 L.Ed. 283; Ker v. Illinois, 1886, 119 U.S. 436, 7 S.Ct. 225, 30 L.Ed. 421.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">At the hearing on his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Ortiz urged the district court to set bail in accordance with the Bail Reform Act of 1966. Since first degree murder is not punishable by death in the Virgin Islands,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> application of the Bail Reform Act would have required the district court to release Ortiz on such conditions as reasonably would have assured his appearance at trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146 (Supp. IV, 1969). However, the government took the position that the Bail Reform Act should not apply when it conflicts with the bail provision contained in section 3 of the Revised Organic Act, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1561 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-11\"><em>\u201c </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-12\">All persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties in the case of criminal offenses, except for first-degree murder or any capital offense when the proof is evident or the presumption great.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-13\">* * <em>*99</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-14\">The district court denied bail in apparent reliance on this provision of the Revised Organic Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-15\">On this appeal, the government argues that the action of the district court was proper because the Bail Reform Act has been rendered inapplicable to the Virgin Islands by the \u201creenactment\u201d in 1968 of 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1561, including the bail provision, and by the addition of a clause repealing \u201c[a] 11 laws * * * inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection * * Virgin Islands Elective Governor Act \u00a7 11, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1561 (Supp. IV, 1969). The government would have us read \u201csubsection\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>repealer clause of amended section 1561 to mean \u201csection,\u201d so that the repealer would operate on laws inconsistent with all parts of section 1561. Ortiz, on the other hand, argues that the word \u201csubsection\u201d in the repealer clause refers only to the new paragraph added immediately before the repealer clause, extending certain provisions and amendments of the United States Constitution to the Virgin Islands. Under this view, the express repealer would have no effect on the \u201creenacted\u201d bail provision of section 1561.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">We think that Ortiz has construed the statute correctly. To begin with, section 1561 was not \u201creenacted\u201d in 1968, as the government contends. The last two paragraphs of 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1561 (Supp. IV, 1969) including only the constitutional provisions and the repeal-er clause, were added in 1968 by the Virgin Islands Elective Governor Act, Pub.L. No. 90-496, \u00a7 11, 82 Stat. 841. But the bail provision of section 1561 long antedated both that statute and the Bail Reform Act and was neither altered nor restated in 1968.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The probable purpose of the repealer clause was to insure that the statutory extension of constitutional safeguards to the Virgin Islands would not be nullified by existing laws in conflict with them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This legislative intent would have been clearer if the repealer clause had referred to \u201call laws inconsistent with the preceding paragraph.\u201d The word \u201csubsection\u201d probably was used inconsiderately in the process of making the Virgin Islands amendment conform with a virtually identical amendment of the Organic Act of Guam that was introduced, considered and enacted contemporaneously. <em>Cf. </em>Guam Elective Governor Act, Pub.L. No. 90-497, \u00a7 10, 82 Stat. 847.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-13\">The Guam amendment extends the same constitutional provisions and amendments to that territory that are extended to the Virgin Islands, and contains the same repealer clause. However, in the Guam amendment the constitutional provisions and the repealer clause are designated as a single subsection \u201cu\u201d, and are added to a section of the Organic Act of Guam which, unlike 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1561, is divided into subsections. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421b (1964) and 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421b (Supp. IV, 1969). Apparently overlooking this formal difference, Congress used \u201csubsection\u201d in both enactments, not noticing that \u201cpreceding paragraph\u201d would have been more accurate in the Virgin Islands amendment. Thus, it appears that Congress intended, as we now hold, that the repealer clause in the amendment to section 1561 should apply only to laws inconsistent with the constitutional provisions extended to the Virgin Islands by the same amendment, and not to laws inconsistent with other antecedent provisions of section 1561.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>Having decided that amended section 1561 does not repeal the Bail Reform Act insofar as it applies to first degree murder cases in the Virgin Islands, we now proceed in somewhat reverse logical order to determine whether the Bail Reform Act applies at all. The government tacitly assumed both in the district court and on this appeal that, except for the possible conflict discussed above, the Bail Reform Act would apply to this case. However, we have some difficulty with this assumption. Section 3(a) of the Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a) (Supp. IV, 1969) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-4\">\u201cAny person charged with an offense, other than an offense punishable by death, shall, at his appearance before a judicial officer, be ordered released pending trial [on certain conditions] .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Under the definition applicable to section 3146,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018judicial officer\u2019 means * * * any person or court authorized pursuant to * * * the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to bail or otherwise release a person before trial * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3152(1) (Supp. IV, 1969). The District Court of the Virgin Islands comes within this definition because the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including Rule 46 relating to bail, \u201capply to all criminal proceedings in * * * the District Court of the Virgin Islands * * Fed.R.Crim. P. 54(a) (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-12\">However, the term \u201coffense\u201d in section 3146 is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-13\">\u201cany criminal offense * * * which is in violation of an Act of Congress and is triable in any court established by Act of Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3152(2) (Supp. IV, 1969). Although the offense of first degree murder under 14 V.I.C. \u00a7 922(a) (1) (1964) is \u201ctriable in [a] court established by Act of Congress\u201d because the district court has jurisdiction under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1612-13 (1964), the offense is not \u201cin violation of an Act of Congress\u201d because the crime was created by an act of the Virgin Islands legislature. As this court has pointed out in another context, \u201cThe local laws enacted under the legislative power granted by Congress are * * * territorial laws, not laws of the United States.\u201d Harris v. Boreham, 3d Cir. 1965, 233 F.2d 110, 113.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-15\">Thus the Bail Reform Act does not by its own terms apply to cases where the offense charged is a violation of the Virgin Islands Code. Although counsel for the appellant assures us that the Act \u201cis consistently being invoked in the District Court of the Virgin Islands\u201d we find only one reported case in which it has been applied to a local offense in the Virgin Islands. In Virgin Islands v. Callwood, D.V.I.1969, 296 F.Supp. 943, Judge Higginbotham, sitting by designation, applied the Bail Reform Act in denying a motion for bail pending appeal from a robbery conviction, but so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>appears from the opinion, the applicability of the Act was not raised as an issue for the court to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">The legislative history of the Bail Reform Act does not disclose any intent to apply the Act beyond the limits imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3152 (Supp. IV, 1969). On the other hand, the legislative history does not indicate that Congress considered the problem of bail in the territories and decided to exclude territorial offenses from the purview of the Bail Reform Act. In fact it might be reasonable to hold that Congress intended such a major reform in federal 'bail procedures to apply to all situations in which Congress has the power to regulate bail, including the trial of territorial offenses in the District Court of the Virgin Islands, if it were not for the apparent obstacle presented in cases of first degree murder by the bail provision of the Revised Organic Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">However, that obstacle was removed before passage of the Bail Reform Act by Rule 46(a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 46(a) (1) requires that \u201c[a] person arrested for an offense not punishable by death shall be admitted to bail,\u201d and has the effect of making first degree murder under Virgin Islands law a bailable offense because it is not \u201cpunishable by death.\u201d As already noted, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure apply by their own terms to the trial of all criminal offenses in the District Court of the Virgin Islands.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> More importantly, Congress provided in the enabling act that \u201call laws in conflict therewith shall be of no further force and effect.\u201d Act of June 29, 1940, ch. 445, 54 Stat. 688 (now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771 (Supp. IV, 1969)). By the force of this legislation, Rule 46(a) (1) superseded the bail provision of section 3 of the Revised Organic Act, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7,1561 (1964), and created a right to bail before trial for first degree murder charged under territorial law in the District Court of the Virgin Islands. <em>Cf. </em>Mafnas v. Guam, 9th Cir. 1955, 228 F.2d 283, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">Under these circumstances, we think that if Congress had adverted to the situation, Congress would have included first degree murder and other territorial crimes tried in the District Court of the Virgin Islands within the definition of \u201coffense\u201d in the Bail Reform Act, 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 3152(2) (Supp. IV, 1969).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, even in the absence of a specific congressional mandate, we think it is proper and sensible that in the District Court of the Virgin Islands the right to pretrial bail conferred by Rule 46(a) (1) shall be determined and administered in accordance with the provisions and procedures of the Bail Reform Act. For \u201cthe Rule and the Act are complementary and form a unified system for dealing with pretrial release.\u201d Brown v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 212, 215-216 quoting at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">These considerations make it appropriate that we utilize our supervisory power to require that the standards and procedures of the Bail Reform Act be adopted and followed in the consideration and disposition of bail applications in the District Court of the Virgin Islands. <em>Cf. </em>Virgin Islands v. Lovell, 3d Cir. 1967, 378 F.2d 799, 805, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 964, 90 S.Ct. 440, 24 L.Ed.2d 428. We note that on March 3, 1970, the perceptive judge of the district court achieved the same result for the municipal courts of the Virgin Islands that we reach for the district court by exercising his rule-making power under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613 (1964) to prescribe that decisions as to release on bail prior to-trial in municipal court shall \u201cbe guided by * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>the appropriate provisions Reform Act\u2019 * * <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of \u2018The Bail</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-2\">The judgment of the district court denying appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus will be affirmed, but the case will be remanded to the district court for a hearing on bail under the Bail Reform Act of 1966.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">.

Although the district court stated that it would deny bail even under the Bail Reform Act, the district court failed to consider the conditions specified in section 3146, and the district court\u2019s language indicates that it relied at least in part on the test in the Revised Organic Act, namely, whether the proof is evident or the presumption great. The district court made the following statement of its reasons for denying bail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-18\">\u201cEven applying the Bail Reform Act, I would decline bail in this case because the murder was a particularly coldblooded, brutal and senseless one; and the proof is pretty evident and the presumption pretty great as was developed in the hearing in writs for habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-20\">Further, in the light of the probability or the certainty that a conviction will result in a mandatory life sentence in this case, I think it highly probable that any of these defendants would flee, flee further prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-21\">So on the basis of those findings, I will decline bail.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">.
