The Board has filed a cross-petition seeking enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\">Resolution of the contentions of the parties has required a detailed examination of the record below. We have made that examination, and we have concluded that the Board\u2019s challenged findings are adequately supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">No useful purpose would be served by reciting each detail of the evidence. The parties are aware of the contents of the record, their counsel know from the colloquy at oral argument that the court was well informed on the subject, and the recitation would be of no value as precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">The petition to set aside the Board\u2019s order is denied, and the Board\u2019s order is directed enforced in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
