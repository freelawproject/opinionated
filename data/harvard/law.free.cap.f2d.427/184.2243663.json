We affirmed their convictions in July 1967<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court on November 6,1967.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court issued its mandate affirming their convictions on November 20, 1967. Appellants filed a motion for a new trial on December 14, 1967 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that two government witnesses, Abramson and Hemken, committed perjury with the government\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Hemken did not give false testimony. The court further found that while Abramson did testify falsely, it was done without the knowledge of the government, and the false statements did not relate to a material issue in the trial and in no way contributed to appellants\u2019 convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On this appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial, Granza and Ferrara contend: (1) Abramson and Hemken committed perjury with the knowledge of the government. (2) The district court erred in refusing to produce Abramson, Hemken and one Randazzo at appellants\u2019 hearing on their motion for a new trial. (3) 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 is unconstitutional \u201cbecause of its self-incriminatory provisions.\u201d The contentions are without merit; the district court\u2019s denial of the motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">Appellants\u2019 first contention and argument totally ignore the adverse factual findings of the district court. Our scope of review of factual determinations on appeal from the denial of a motion for a new trial is very restricted. The rule is generally stated, \u201cThe trial court\u2019s resolution of fact issues on which there is conflicting testimony is not reviewable at all unless the findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An examination of the record in the instant case convinces us that the district court\u2019s findings are correct in every respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">Appellants\u2019 second contention is not supported either by argument or authority. The rule followed in this circuit is that a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial will be affirmed unless there has been error as a matter of law or a clear and manifest abuse of judicial discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s failure to require the production of the desired witnesses at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>hearing on the motion for a new trial constitutes neither an error of law nor an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"> We lack jurisdiction to decide the question raised by appellants\u2019 third contention. The only ground on which appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial may be granted is newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Motions for a new trial on any other ground must be made within seven days after verdict or finding of guilty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 recent \u201cdiscovery\u201d that the criminal statute may have constitutional defects does not qualify as \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\">.

When a conviction is appealed, a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence may only be made before or within two years after the issuance of the mandate of affirmance by the appellate court.

During appellants\u2019 trial, Abramson, a co-conspirator and witness for the government, testified that he did not know the name of the man to whom he had delivered quantities of heroin. In another trial, Abramson admitted that he did know the man\u2019s name and that they had traveled together from Texas to New York. This is the \u201cperjury\u201d of which appellants complain. Appellants raised this issue in their petition for rehearing, 381 F.2d 190 (5th Cir. 1967). This court stated in response :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-19\">It is clear to us, however, that Abram-son\u2019s testimony at appellants\u2019 trial with regard to the identification of the man to whom the heroin was delivered in San Antonio did not prejudice appellants in any way.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b249-20\">. 2 C.
