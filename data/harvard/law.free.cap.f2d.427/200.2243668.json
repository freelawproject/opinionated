(Kutsher\u2019s). The opinion of the Board is reported in 175 NLRB No. 76 (April 22, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">The subject matter of the controversy is the alleged denial by Kutsher\u2019s of access to its premises to nonemployee union organizers, who desire to communicate with Kutsher\u2019s employees for the purpose of organization. Since under the two principal decisions dealing with this question, NLRB v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 351 U.S. 105, 76 S.Ct. 679, 100 L.Ed 975 (1956) and NLRB v. S &amp; H Grossinger's, Inc., 372 F.2d 26 (2d Cir. 1967) opportunity for access to the employees appears to be the decisive factor in resolving the issue, the facts must be reviewed primarily from this point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-20\">Kutsher\u2019s operates a resort hotel in the Catskill Mountains about three miles from Monticello, New York. The hotel facilities are located on the north and south sides of a two-lane hard surface public road (Kutsher Road). On the north side is the main building accommodating primarily the guests in some 300 rooms and containing the dining rooms, recreation rooms, bar, night club and shops. Also, to the north are a lake, an ice rink, swimming pools, ski slopes and an 18-hole golf course. On the south side of the road are the employees\u2019 quarters (except for a few, 2-3 percent, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>have rooms on the north side) and additional outdoor recreational facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The number of employees varies with the seasons. In the summer season (July and August), there are some 350 employees and in the winter, 150 during the week and 250 on weekends. Most of the 120 rooms available for employees are located on the south side of the road. To reach their respective places of work, most of the employees \u2014 estimated at some 95 percent \u2014 have to cross the public road from their places of residence. These employees wear distinctive uniforms to and from their work stations and thus are capable of identification. Furthermore, their work hours are such that large numbers report at approximately the same hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The union\u2019s efforts to organize were minimal. There was no proof that the union made any effort during peak seasons or times to communicate with the employees. In early April 1968 union pamphlets and authorization cards were distributed on Kutsher Road between 11:00 a. m. and 2:00 p. m. There is no charge that the union\u2019s failure to receive any response from such solicitation was due to any anti-union activity by Kutsher\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Meetings were called at the union office in Monticello in September and November 1967 and February 1968, but no more than five employees attended. An advertisement in a local paper for four days in May 1968, inquiring as to employees\u2019 interest in organizing a union, resulted in no replies. Attempts to reach employees at local, bars were unproductive. There was a four-hour pamphlet and card distribution after Labor Day 1968 at Kutsher\u2019s main gate during which the union admits that very few pamphlets were handed out and these not well received. The union offered no proof that Kutsher\u2019s tried to prevent, or was hostile to, such distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On three occasions between April and September 1968, the union requested access to Kutsher\u2019s premises for the purpose of organizing its employees, which requests were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The Board urges the decisions in Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Grossinger\u2019s upon us as requiring the enforcement of the Board\u2019s order. In Babcock &amp; Wilcox the Supreme Court said: \u201c * * <em>* </em>if the location of the plant and the living quarters of the employees place the employees beyond the reach of reasonable union efforts to communicate with them, the employer must allow the union to approach his employees on his property.\u201d 351 U.S. at 113, 76 S.Ct. at 685. The Board has found a Section 8(a) (1) violation, in essence, that Kutsher\u2019s interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in the exercise of their rights by refusing to permit representatives of the union to enter upon its premises for union organizational purposes. In <em>Grossinger\u2019s </em>we recognized that there were two requirements necessary to sustain the Board\u2019s rulings (1) that they be \u201creached on findings of fact supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole\u201d and (2) that the conclusions not \u201crest on erroneous legal foundations.\u201d 372 F.2d at 30 (quoting Babcock &amp; Wilcox, 351 U.S. at 112, 76 S.Ct. 679).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Applying the <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox </em>test, we find that the location of the \u201cplant\u201d (Kutsher\u2019s Hotel) and the living quarters of the employees were such that there was no barrier to communication. Nor could the scant union efforts made here be characterized as \u201creasonable\u201d if an effective organizational campaign were being carried on. The \u201cother means\u201d were \u201creadily available\u201d to the union here. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, 351 U.S. at 114, 76 S.Ct. 679. From a factual point of view an <em>a fortiori </em>case to that in <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox </em>is presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">In contrast the situation in <em>Grossing-er\u2019s </em>was quite different. The employees lived on Grossinger\u2019s grounds, accessible from the public highway only through a main gate. Furthermore, <em>Grossinger\u2019s </em>presented the case of an employer actively hostile to a union, including anti-union circulars and speeches and threats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>to, and interrogation of, employees. There was further union discrimination evidenced by allowing entry onto Grossinger\u2019s grounds for solicitation for many other, except union, purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We cannot say to what extent Grossinger\u2019s obvious union hostility entered into that decision. However, here, except for a refusal to allow strangers to come upon its property for any solicitation purpose, there is no evidence of any action by the employer which could be characterized as anti-union.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Before permitting an invasion of private property for union organizational purposes, there should be \u201csubstantial evidence on the record as a whole\u201d to justify such an invasion. The record here not only does not show such evidence but does reveal evidence of adequate accessibility had there been reasonable union efforts to this end.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
