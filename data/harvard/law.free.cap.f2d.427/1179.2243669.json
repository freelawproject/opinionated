There is no merit to his contentions that the evidence failed to support the conviction and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>the giving of the \u201cAllen\u201d charge denied him due process. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\"> Since Wright failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at any time during the trial our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is limited to that necessary to avoid a manifest miscarriage of justice. \u201cSuch a miscarriage would exist only if it appears that the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d Garrett v. United States, 356 F.2d 921, 922, (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 975, 86 S.Ct. 1869, 16 L.Ed.2d 685 (1966). Substantial evidence pointing to Wright\u2019s guilt is apparent from the record. He appeared at the site of an illicit distillery shortly after it was raided, which fact creates a rebuttable presumption of guilt of the offense of which he was convicted. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601(b) (2); United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63, 85 S.Ct. 754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965). He was carrying three soft drinks, three tins of sardines, and two cans of beans, from which the jury could infer that he had come to provision the two men who were at the still at the time it was raided. Officers who arrested him and informed him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights testified that Wright admitted helping to run the still, but denied ownership. If mere unexplained presence at a still is sufficient to authorize conviction for carrying on a distillery, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601(b) (2), it follows that evidence of presence, carrying food, and admission of guilt is more than enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">The giving of the \u201cAllen\u201d charge to the deadlocked jury was accompanied by approved safeguards against coercion. This Court has recently given its approval to this procedure in circumstances similar to those presented by this case. United States v. Betancourt, 427 F.2d 851 [June 1, 1970], Sanders v. United States, 415 F.2d 621 (5th Cir. 1969). - Cf. Note, On Instructing Deadlocked Juries, 78 Yale L.J. 100 (1968). It was not error to give such a charge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 this ease is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
