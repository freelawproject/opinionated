Petitioner, who has avoided deportation since 1961, seeks discretionary relief from deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) on the ground that he will be subjected to persecution in Israel, the country to which he is to be deported, on account of his political beliefs and activities. This claim has been considered before, e.g., at an evidentiary hearing held in 1961, after which the inquiry officer recommended that the application to withhold deportation be denied, and by the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed that result. Schieber v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 347 F.2d 353 (9th Cir. 1965). We have reviewed the record, and are satisfied that petitioner has presented no additional evidence concerning alleged political persecution sufficient to require a reopening on that issue. Petitioner also seeks relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a) (1), which authorizes a discretionary suspension of deportation on grounds of extreme hardship for aliens who have continuously resided in this country for more than seven years. The Board did not abuse its discretion by refusing to act favorably on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
