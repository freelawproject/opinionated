We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-20\">Lauchli was sentenced to 2i/\u00e1 years imprisonment upon his conviction for several violations of the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5801 et seq. Sentence was suspended for other violations of the same Act, and he was placed on probation for four years to begin at the expiration of his sentence. Lauchli\u2019s probation began March 16, 1969. He was arrested on April 17, 1969 for similar offenses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, after a hearing, his probation was revoked. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-21\">At the revocation hearing a government agent testified to his dealings with Lauchli in March and April, 1969, during which he was shown submachine guns and silencers by Lauchli in the latter\u2019s home. He also testified that he purchased a number of these submachine guns and silencers from Lauchli. The agent test-fired two of the silencers. They worked. Later he purchased replacement barrels from Lauchli for the submachine guns, and test-fired them. They also fired properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">Lauchli admitted the sales. He contends here that if he had complied with the formal firearm law registration and transfer requirements, the information given would have forced him to incriminate himself in the revocation hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>in violation of his Fifth Amendment right; that the weapons purchased from him did not technically fall within the definitions of the statutes; that what he sold the agent were not silencers but were lawful sales of \u201cflash suppressors\u201d; that he \u201cclearly\u201d did not violate the Illinois act regulating possession of firearms; that various sections of the relevant federal statutes are unconstitutional in violation of the Second Amendment right to \u201ckeep and bear arms\u201d; that use of an electronic eavesdropping device in obtaining evidence against him violated his Fourth Amendment right; and that the court should not consider testimony taken at the probation revocation hearing since he was not then represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The government agent gave direct testimony of his dealings, observations and purchases with respect to Lauchli\u2019s weapons and silencers. It is of no relevance to the issue of revocation whether if Lauehli had complied with the law regarding registration and transfer of firearms, the information given might have been used against him. No self-incriminating evidence was introduced against him at the revocation hearing in violation of his Fifth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The government was not required, in order to sustain the revocation, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lauehli was guilty of the offenses for which he, as a probationer, was arrested. He was at liberty as a matter of grace, and the district court was empowered with discretion to determine whether, on the evidence, Lauchli\u2019s probation should be revoked. Burns v. United States, 287 U.S. 216, 220, 53 S.Ct. 154, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Lauehli admitted at the hearing that what the agent testified to was true. The court need not have decided that the guns were technically firearms under the statutory definition of firearms, or the \u201cflash suppressors\u201d were really silencers. Although the formal condition of probation was non-violation of \u201cany law,\u201d revocation is justified where Lauchli\u2019s conduct, so soon after probation was granted, was inconsistent with the reformation and rehabilitation objectives of probation policy. See Reed v. United States, 181 F.2d 141 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 879, 71 S.Ct. 116, 95 L.Ed. 639 (1950); Dillingham v. United States, 76 F.2d 35 (5th Cir. 1935). There is no abuse of discretion shown <em>on </em>this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">We cannot decide in this proceeding the constitutional validity of the statutes under which Lauehli was originally convicted. The only question for us is whether the district court abused its discretion in deciding that revocation will serve the ends of justice and the best interests of both the public and the defendant. Burns v. United States, 287 U.S. at 222, 53 S.Ct. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Furthermore, the issue of whether the government unlawfully used an eavesdropping device to gather evidence against Lauehli is beside the point here. If the device was used, no evidence gathered by its use was introduced at the revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Finally, we have not considered any transcript of the revocation proceedings at which Lauehli was not represented by counsel. <em>We </em>reject as unfair and ridiculous Lauchli\u2019s pro se brief claim that he was denied competent counsel at the revocation hearing. He was quite competently represented by court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Both Attorney Edward G. Coleman of Springfield, Illinois, who represented Lauehli in the district court and filed appellant\u2019s brief in this court, and Attorney Terence F. McCarthy of Chicago, who argued the appeal for Lauehli, have rendered highly professional and dedicated service as court-appointed counsel in behalf of Lauehli. The court expresses its thanks to each of the attorneys.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-23\">.
