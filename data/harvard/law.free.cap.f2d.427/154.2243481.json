Appellant has had a full opportunity to present his claims to the District Court and to us. However, neither the District Court nor this court has been authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>by any Act of Congress to decide the merits of appellant\u2019s claim. On the contrary, Congress, by the enactment of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) has expressly deprived the courts of any jurisdiction to do so. Under the circumstances, the District Court had no choice; the law required it to dismiss the action. The same law requires us to affirm the judgment. No possible benefit can come to appellant by the continuance of this litigation. It should now be brought to a close. For the same reason, appellant\u2019s motion, filed October 27, 1969, must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The judgment is affirmed. The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
