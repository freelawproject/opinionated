J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in which it was alleged that the decedent, Hudson, contracted cancer of the larynx and lungs as a result of smoking Defendant\u2019s cigarettes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Recognizing Lartigue v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 5 Cir., 1963, 317 F.2d 19, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 865, 84 S.Ct. 137, 11 L.Ed.2d 92, as an <em>Erie </em>lion in the street, the Plaintiff\u2019s counsel to secure below and here a definitive ruling on controlling legal issues acquiesced in the ingenious procedural device of answers to interrogatories as a means of restricting the claims to very specific contentions which thereby excluded all others. Those claims negatived scientific foreseeability, peculiar defects in the cigarettes, and cancer consequences to a substantial segment of the public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>After remand following an earlier appeal on limitations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant again moved for summary judgment on the ground that an implied warranty under Louisiana law covers only knowable, foreseeable risks. On the basis of <em>Lartigue </em>and Green v. American Tobacco Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 1166 (en banc), the Trial Court granted Defendant's motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the Trial Court erred in relying on <em>Lartigue </em>because it was erroneously decided, and erred in relying on <em>Green </em>because it is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Wholly without regard to <em>Green </em>which is a Florida case, we affirm on the basis of <em>Lartigue. Lartigue </em>presented exactly the questions presented by Plaintiff in this case and Plaintiff does not contend otherwise. We are bound by the <em>Lartigue </em>determination on this issue (see Manning v. M/V \u201cSea Road\u201d, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 603, 610-611, note 10) until, if ever, the Court en banc re-decides the question or the Louisiana courts hold differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-14\">. By suggestion of death the Court was advised that Appellant Elbert Berry Hudson died on February 18, 1970 in Bogalusa, Louisiana.
