Appellant\u2019s motion for convening a three-judge court was denied, and the complaint was dismissed. We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\">. Tlie delay in the nonjury calendar is 19 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-13\">. Appellant does not suggest the specific manner in which the situation should be corrected. As the district court states, the only way it could be done is by legislative action. In view of our disposition of the case, however, it is unnecessary to reach the question of the form any remedy should take.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
