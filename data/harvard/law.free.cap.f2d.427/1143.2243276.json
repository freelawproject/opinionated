Martin Pence, Chief Judge, District of Hawaii, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1208-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">Petitioner came to the United States in 1968 at age 36 as a student. He did not register for or attend school but instead began to work in violation of his student status. On December 11, 1963, he was directed to leave the United States. Since that date the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been attempting to accomplish that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-14\">In Talanoa v. Immigration and Naturalization Service (9 Cir., 1968) 397 F.2d 196, we considered the case in detail. The special inquiry officer had found petitioner ineligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255) but gave petitioner the privilege of voluntary departure. Petitioner\u2019s appeal was denied by the Board of Appeals. On petition for review we affirmed the officer and the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-15\">Petitioner then asked the Board to reopen and reconsider the previous order affirmed by this court. The Board denied the motion and petitioner again seeks to review the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-16\">He claims now that he is eligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 245 of the Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255); and that he does not need a labor certificate under \u00a7 212(a) (14) of the Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (14)) because 8 C.F.R. 212.8 (b) (4) exempts from the requirement of a labor certificate, \u201can alien who will engage in a commercial or agricultural enterprise in which he had invested or is actively in the process of investing a substantial amount of capital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-17\">In his affidavit, petitioner states it is his intention to engage in the business of sweeping commercial and shopping center parking lots. The record below shows he has entered an agreement with one Jarvis to purchase an industrial sweeper for $1000 and has made a down payment of $250. The purchase agreement specifies it shall become final only if the Board acts favorably on the petition to reconsider and to grant adjustment of status. Petitioner\u2019s affidavit also shows that his prior proposal, a gardening service and nursery business, failed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>Petitioner thus has no business, no customers, no substantial investment and no prospects. He has not brought himself within the terms of 8 C.F.R. 212.8(b) (4). Petitioner contends the regulation exceeds the permissible scope of a regulation based on \u00a7 212(a) (14) of the Act, (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (14)). We find this\u2019 contention totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">The order of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1208-12\">. Petitioner\u2019s appellate brief states that his sweeping business plans have been altered and that \u201che is now beginning a janitorial service.\u201d While this evidence was not before the Board of Appeals, it certainly does not aid petitioner\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
