BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">In this moonshine case Defendant was found guilty of possessing and controlling \u201ca still and distilling apparatus for the production of spirituous liquors set up without having the same registered as required by law\u201d in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5179(a) and 5601(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His sentence was suspended, and he was placed on probation for two years without supervision. The only issue on this appeal is whether the equipment Defendant had in his possession constituted a still. Or, in legal jargon, was the evidence sufficient to support the conviction? We find the evidence sufficient and affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-16\">The evidence in this case showed that Defendant\u2019s outbuilding, which was locked with the inside walls lined with hay bales so that no one could see in, contained two still pots situated on concrete blocks so that the pots were elevated above the floor about six to eight inches. On the floor directly below the pots was a tin covering. Also located in the building were burners, a butane gas cylinder, a water pump, a catch barrel, and a cap, all of which are commonly used to make moonshine whiskey. The investigating ATU agent also found some black plastic one-inch hose in the building and a water well about 75 feet away connected by pipe with the outside of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-17\">The agent, adequately qualified as an expert, testified that it had been some time (2 or 3 months) since the still had been operated although the blackened tin on the floor indicated that it had been operated in this building. He testified that one of the essential parts of a distillery, a condenser, was not there, that the burners were not under the pots, and that there was nothing connected between any pipes connected with the gas cylinder. Defendant contends that the absence of these three elements put his guilt of the crime of possessing a setup still beyond the pale of reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-18\">Since this is a case solely of statutory construction with no constitutional questions, the best place to start would be with the construction placed on the term \u201cset-up\u201d by the Congress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>surprisingly, there has been no legislative definition. On the other hand, there is a regulation dealing with this tricky question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-5\">\u201cA still will be regarded as set up and subject to registry when it is in position over a furnace, or connected with a boiler <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so that heat may be applied, although the condenser may not be in position. These instructions as to stills set up are intended merely as illustrations and are not expected to cover all types of stills or condensers requiring registration under the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhT\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 196.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">In the present case the still was up on concrete blocks so that heat could be applied, but the burners were not under it although they were nearby in the same locked building. The still was thus not \u201cin position over a furnace, or connected with a boiler\u201d within the regulation. But the second sentence of the regulation allows for situations other than these two in which a still will be deemed \u201cset up\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">The several cases on this question offer some help. The first, Colasurdo v. United States, 9 Cir., 1927, 22 F.2d 934, does not discuss the problem (and therefore probably did not consider it) but affirms conviction on these facts: A carefully concealed cave housed a brand new, elevated still, vats containing mash, and installed oil burners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-18\">Otto v. United States, 7 Cir., 1928, 29 F.2d 504, was the first case that squarely faced the problem. Affirmance of conviction was easily reached on these facts: The entire apparatus \u2014 still, condenser, etc. \u2014 was assembled except that the condenser was not connected to the boiler, but the dome of the boiler and the connection pipe were on the floor. Citing <em>Colasurdo, </em>the Court defined \u201cset up\u201d as \u201ccapable of being used\u201d. It held that since the dome and connection pipe had to be removed to fill the boiler with mash, the still was set up \u201cin the same sense as would be a tea or coffee pot with top removed for putting in the intended ingredients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">The next case chronologically is United States v. Forty-Six Bottles Alleged Home Brew Beer, E.D.N.Y., 1930, 39 F.2d 240. There the still was completely assembled, and to be made operable all that was necessary was to place a four-inch plug on top and screw down the stud nuts. The Court held simply that this constituted a set up still.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>A case similar to <em>Otto </em>in that the reason for partial disassembly was preparation for another run is United States v. Williamson, E.D.Tenn., 1953, 111 F.Supp. 411, aff'd, 6 Cir., 208 F.2d 692. In fact, the Defendant was caught in the act of putting bran and sugar in the \u201cstill or boiler\u201d. Its facts differ from <em>Otto </em>in that all the parts were not present (the cap and condenser were never found).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court opinion included a type of definition of \u201cset up\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-4\">\u201cIf this language [of the statute] contemplated only a still that was fully assembled for operation and at such times as it was so assembled, the operation of the statute would be intermittent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-5\">\u201cA more practical construction, and that which the Court believes to be the right one, is that a still comes within the purview of the act the moment it is once assembled and put in readiness for commencement of the distilling of spirits, and that it does not lose its status thereafter as a set-up still merely because it is dismantled in part in preparation of another run.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Ill F.Supp. at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">The Court of Appeals agreed that the fact that Appellants were putting ingredients into the boiler makes inescapable the conclusion that the missing parts were available when wanted. All these facts led to affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-13\">Another similar ease is Guy v. United States, 4 Cir., 1964, 336 F.2d 595. There the Court held that a still \u201cto some extent disassembled, whether more so than is necessary between each \u2018run\u2019 not being clear from the evidence\u201d was a set up still as a matter of law if all parts necessary to put the still in operation were found at the location. The \u201cfact that certain necessary parts had been temporarily removed and hidden nearby did not convert the apparatus from a still to something else. This was a question of law for the court and the court in effect charged the jury that the temporary removal of these parts (which were found nearby) did not convert the still into something else.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-14\">The only Fifth Circuit statement on the subject<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is in Dupoint v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 388 F.2d 39, where we held that the existence of a distillery was proved when \u201cThe enforcement officer said that the still was complete, and proceeded to name some, although not all, of its integral components. This was enough. When one says that he saw an automobile, it should not be necessary that he describe each and all of its mechanical parts in order to establish the existence of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-15\">388 F.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-16\">Not all the cases hold against Defendants. United States v. Cafero, 2 Cir., 1932, 55 F.2d 219, followed Treasury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>Reg. 3068 (Sept. 4, 1920) (note 3, <em>supra) </em>and held that a brand new still not connected with the boiler \u201cwas not set up * * * for it was not connected with the boiler so that heat might be applied, nor was it in position over a furnace.\u201d Although it appears that all the component parts of a still were present, the Court emphasized that they were not <em>and never had been </em>connected so that no still was set up. Considering the test of the ease with which a still can be made operable, see the regulation, note 3, <em>supra, </em>we would not follow this case and we doubt the Second Circuit would now in the light of the standards declared in <em>Moses, infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">In United States v. Moses, 2 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 358 the Second Circuit recognized that \u201ca still to be \u2018set up\u2019 does not have to be \u2018in operation,\u2019 see United States v. Forty-Six Bottles of Alleged Home Brew,\u201d <em>supra, </em>and that \u201cthe still must be \u2018capable of being used\u2019 * * * see Otto v. United States,\u201d <em>supra. </em>In <em>Moses </em>the government conceded that the still was not set up when police officers arrived but argued that it had been set up and that this was a crime. The Court apparently proceeded on this assumption and held that it was never set up because it was never \u201ccapable of being used\u201d as shown by the fact that it was disassembled to repair leaks and adjust the \u201ccolumn,\u201d which was too high to permit erection of the \u201cdephlegmator\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">The most recent reversal on this ground, \u201ccapable of being used\u201d and the case relied on most heavily by Defendant here, is Liverman v. United States, 4 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 284. The still parts found were \u201ca large steel still; an accumulation of mash on the floor; sixty feet of rubber hose; and twelve large barrels, in one of which was spent mash, and in another 160 gallons of live mash ready for distillation. There were a water well and fire bricks which evidently had been used. A gasoline-driven pump was pumping mash from a barrel into an open field. The still was not then in operation, and the officers discovered no boiler, condenser or coils. No whiskey was on the premises. Dried mash had been tracked through the house, and cakes of yeast were found in the refrigerator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">That a still had been operated was clear enough, but it was equally plain that essential parts of the apparatus had been removed before the officers\u2019 arrival, and that at the time of seizure the still was not ready to operate. Agents stated that with the distilling apparatus in the garage and various raw materials found on the premises, whiskey could be produced within two hours. However, this was explained to mean that to do so, it would have been necessary to connect the still to the domestic hot water heater, and to use the rubber hose as connecting pipe, and as a substitute for copper coils of a condenser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">260 F.2d at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\"><em>Liverman </em>rejected the argument that set up means \u201ccompletely set up and capable of being operated without a single part, however minor, missing or disconnected\u201d and adopted an amended <em>Otto </em>definition of \u201creadily capable of being set up in an operating state.\u201d The Court then found that these circumstances did not exist because without a boiler, condenser or coils more than minor adjustments would be needed to apply heat to the mash and produce whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">Now, armed with several definitions of \u201cset up\u201d, we come to the case at hand. Under all the definitions and the cases, and in light of the proved fact that condensers are often removed from the premises for tactical reasons, the absence of the condenser certainly does not make an otherwise set up still not set up. See both the present regulation, <em>supra, </em>at note 3, and the 1920 regulation, <em>supra, </em>3; Williamson v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Nor do we feel that the facts that the burners were not under the still and that they were not connected with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>the cylinder can deprive an otherwise set up still of its character. This record factually demonstrated that tasks of connecting the burners and sliding them under the still are readily accomplished. <em>Liverman </em>does not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">.
