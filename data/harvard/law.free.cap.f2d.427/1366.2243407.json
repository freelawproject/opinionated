John Leroy Guilbeau and his daughter, Sonyia Marie Guilbeau, were killed when the car which Mr. Guilbeau was driving collided with a Southern Pacific train in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana. The wife and son of Mr. Guilbeau brought actions for damages against the railroad. The cause was tried to a jury. The jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, and judgment was entered for the plaintiffs on the basis of the jury verdict. The railroad appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-16\">In its brief and oral argument appellant has advanced numerous assignments of error. We have carefully examined each of appellant\u2019s contentions in the light of the record to determine whether any error was committed that would require a reversal of the judgment. Having found no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
