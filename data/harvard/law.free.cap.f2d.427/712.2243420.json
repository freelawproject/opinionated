His appeal was originally scheduled to be heard in April, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>1969, but was postponed at his request. It came on again in March, 1970, at which time, also at his request, his original attorney was relieved and new counsel appointed. His new counsel was allowed time to file a supplemental brief, and the case was then submitted on the briefs without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Having carefully examined the briefs and record, including the supplemental brief filed by appellant\u2019s new counsel, we are convinced that Johnson\u2019s conviction must be affirmed. Although both counsel for appellant have argued very ably to the contrary in their briefs, it is the opinion of this Court that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior acts was properly admitted on the issue of intent. Fineberg v. United States, 393 F.2d 417, 419-420 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
