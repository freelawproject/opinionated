The publication of this article, in the March, 1967, issue of The Florida Bar Journal prompted this libel action by Dacey against Anderson. The article was basically a defense of the Florida probate system and a review of Dacey\u2019s book <em>How to Avoid Probate, </em>a book \u201cwhich has stirred some flapping of wings in the legal aviary.\u201d Dacey v. Florida Bar, Inc., 5 Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 195, 196. In his article Anderson wrote the following which Dacey alleges is libelous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-19\">Most lawyers, on the other hand, after reading a few pages of this best selling book <em>How to Avoid Probate </em>are ready to take up arms. Witness the Connecticut Bar, which became so incensed that it secured a conviction of unauthorized practice of law against the author, one Norman F. Dacey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>In its opinion upholding this conviction, the Connecticut Supreme Coux-t \u2022K * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">The Connecticut proceeding referred to in the article was, in fact, an action brought by the Bar of Fairfield County, to restrain Dacey from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. It did not charge Dacey with criminal conduct and there was, of course, no criminal conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">Following the publication of the article Dacey wrote Anderson that Dacey had never been charged with or convicted of the unauthorized practice of law and requested an immediate undertaking from Anderson to cause a complete retraction of the offending statement to be published in the next issue of <em>The Florida Bar Journal. A </em>clarification of the nature of the Connecticut proceeding was printed in the next issue of the <em>Journal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">Dacey then instituted the present action against Anderson and The Florida Bar, Inc. This Court affirmed the dismissal of The Florida Bar. Dacey v. Florida Bar, Inc., <em>supra. </em>In his amended complaint against Anderson, Dacey alleged that the article had been widely circulated and read by members of the Florida Bar and had been made available for reading by the general public; that it was libelous and that he was entitled to recover compensatory and punitive damages of one million five hundred thousand dollars because the language in the article was \u201cintended to convey that Plaintiff was convicted of the crime of unauthorized practice of law and that he was a criminal * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">In his answer Anderson denied the material allegations of the complaint and, among other defenses, asserted a claim of privilege under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-9\">A substantial x-ecord was established by interrogatories which were propounded and answered, and by the depositions of Dacey and Anderson. It appears that Anderson is a lawyer in Broward County, Florida, having a substantial probate practice. His father was formerly a probate judge there. Anderson had previously written an unfavorable critique and newspaper article about Dacey, and was asked by the Florida Bar to write a review of Dacey\u2019s book. Anderson was admittedly upset with Dacey\u2019s treatment of lawyers and probate judges, and unhappy about the probable diminution of probate income to attorneys as a consequence of the acceptance of the ideas expressed in Dacey\u2019s book. Anderson had researched much of the subject matter of the article and had read source material but had not, prior to the publication of his article, read the report of the proceedings by the Connecticut Bar against Dacey to enjoin him from illegally engaging in the practice of law which culminated in a judgment in favor of the Bar and which was affirmed on appeal. By way of explanation, Anderson said he used the word \u201cconvicted\u201d as meaning merely an adverse decision in a civil matter, that he did not intend to convey the idea that Dacey was convicted of any crime, and that he had \u201capologized to Mr. Dacey if it was considered he was convicted of a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">Dacey managed the first publication of his book in 1965 but because it became too involved for him he entered into a contract in 1966 with Crown Publishers to handle it. The book is in its thirty-second printing. Dacey receives a royalty of 75 cents per copy or 50 cents per copy on mail order sales. His income in 1964 was $15,900. In 1965, the first year of publication of the book (and when he was doing his own publishing), his income was $35,000. In 1966 his income was $292,960.00, and in 1967 he had an income of $232,570.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-12\">Dacey made at least two hundred television appearances to promote his book. He also spoke on radio, made personal appearances and wrote magazine articles. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>Through the media he criticized probate courts and lawyers specializing in the probating of estates and discussed the abuses that he had seen. In newspaper and magazine articles, he pointed out the fact that he had sued Anderson and other people because of the book. Admittedly, Dacey was considered a controversial person. He had an impression that there was a pattern of harassment and an attempt to discredit him and his book and that Anderson\u2019s criticism was a part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">On this record both parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court denied both motions and Anderson\u2019s interlocutory appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">Our inquiry succinctly stated is: Do the established facts make Dacey a public figure and, if so, do the established facts make applicable the standards of actual malice or highly unreasonable conduct as laid down by the Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 1964, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412, and Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 1969, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">In Time, Inc. v. McLaney, 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 565, cert. denied, 395 U.S. 922, 89 S.Ct. 1776, 23 L.Ed.2d 239, we agreed with the Ninth Circuit's view expressed in United Medical Laboratories, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 1968, 404 F.2d 706, cert. denied, 394 U.S. 921, 89 S.Ct. 1197, 22 L.Ed.2d 454, that when matters of great public interest are involved \u201c[t]he standard of New York Times was not to be regarded as having had \u2018its outer limits * * * marked out\u2019 so as not to be open to further definition.\u201d We concluded that the First Amendment privilege extends to discussions of specific individuals, not associated with any government, if those individuals are involved in matters of important public concern. <em>Id. </em>at 573; Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc. and Dan Jenkins, 5 Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 858. See also Pauling v. Globe-Democrat Publishing Company, 8 Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 188, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 909, 87 S.Ct. 2097, 18 L.Ed.2d 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">It is clear that Dacey\u2019s book, his many radio, television, and personal appearances, and the magazine and newspaper articles constituted \u201cpurposeful activity amounting to a thrusting of his personality into the \u2018vortex\u2019 of an important public controversy\u201d which \u201ccommanded a substantial amount of independent public interest at the time of the publications.\u201d <em>Butts, </em>388 U.S. at 154-155, 87 S.Ct. at 1991. Thus we hold that Dacey was a public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">We need not dwell long on the application of the established facts in this case to the standards of actual malice or highly unreasonable conduct enunciated in <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Butts. </em>Dacey is prohibited \u201cfrom recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his * * * conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. at 279-280, 84 S.Ct. at 725-726. Actual malice is not presumed \u201c \u2018but is a matter of proof by the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 84 S.Ct. at 728. The constitutional standard demands that the proof of actual malice be made with convincing clarity. <em>Id. </em>at 284, 84 S.Ct. at 710. \u201cThere must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d St. Amant v. Thompson, 1968, 390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">There is no evidence that Anderson had any knowledge or suspicion of the falsity of the statement made by him, nor is there any proof that he had before him any indication that his conclusions were incorrect. His statement that Dacey was convicted was literally false but his article was true in stating that an action had been brought against Dacey for the unauthorized practice of law. Even assuming reportorial negligence this does not meet the definition of actual malice in <em>Sullivan. </em>There was no evidence of \u201chighly unreasonable conduct\u201d on Anderson\u2019s part \u201cconstituting an extreme departure from the stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>ards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers.\u201d <em>Butts, </em>388 U. S. at 155, 87 S.Ct. at 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">It follows that the defendant was entitled to a summary judgment because there are no issues of material facts in dispute and there is no evidence \u201cwhich would permit a fact finder to conclude that the standard laid down by the Supreme Court had been met by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>McLaney, </em>406 F.2d at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">Reversed and remanded with directions that a summary judgment for the defendant be entered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">. That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-11\">When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order.
