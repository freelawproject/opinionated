It shows that, since 1950, Clairol has marketed products for tinting and dyeing hair under the mark \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d and the notation \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to beauty salons and various retail outlets, including drug stores. In 1956, Clairol\u2019s predecessor-in-title embarked on an extensive advertising campaign to promote the sale of its \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d hair color preparations, which included advertisements in national magazines, on outdoor billboards, and on car cards for bus and subway transit systems; mailing pieces; radio and television; and point-of-sale display material designed to be used by beauty salons and retailers as window or counter displays in association with the \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d product. The illus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>trative exhibits of record reflect a now familiar format for much of that advertising \u2014 a large, color photograph of an attractive woman, often accompanied by a young child; the question \u201cDoes she * * * or doesn\u2019t she?\u201d prominently imprinted on or above the photograph; the slogan \u201cHair Color So Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure\u201d also conspicuously imprinted on or below the photograph, and set apart from the other portions of the advertisement; the mark \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d in large type and the notation \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d in smaller type below the photograph; a representation of the packaged \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d hair coloring product; and, optionally, advertising text extolling, not unexpectedly, the virtues and advantages of use of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The record further shows that, in the period 1956-1966, Clairol sold over fifty million dollars worth of its \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d hair coloring product and expended some twenty-two million dollars for the above advertising material which contained the slogan sought to be registered. It is stipulated that, so far as the magazine and television media are concerned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">* * * During the same period, and considering the press runs of all the various periodicals involved, the total number of \u201cimpressions\u201d of all the different advertisements in this series in periodicals, all of them prominently displaying the slogan here opposed, have much exceeded 100 million (100,-000,000) (counting as a separate \u201cimpression,\u201d each copy of each periodical carrying one such advertisement).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-8\">* * * Conservatively estimated, there have been more than a billion audio impressions of this slogan on network television in the United States (one impression being one household having a TV set tuned to a given program at a given time).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">The record also shows that, with the exception of a single shipment of goods in 1962, the slogan has not been used on the containers in which the hair color preparation has been packaged or on the bottles of hair color preparation themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">The appeal presents several issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-11\">(1) Is the slogan \u201cHair Color So Nattura] Only her Hairdresser Knows for Sure\u201d \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of Clairol\u2019s hair coloring preparations within the meaning of \u00a7 2(e) (1) of the Trademark Act (15 USC 1052(e) (D).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-12\">(2) More broadly, is the slogan a \u201ctrademark\u201d at all as that term is used in the preamble of \u00a7 2 of the Act and is defined in \u00a7 45 of the Act (15 USC 1127). In particular, does it function to \u201cidentify\u201d the goods as Clairol\u2019s and \u201cdistinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others\u201d; and, if once \u201cmerely descriptive,\u201d has it nevertheless \u201cbecome distinctive\u201d of those goods in commerce, 15 USC 1052(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-13\">(3) Has \u201cuse in commerce\u201d been made of the slogan by Clairol as that expression is defined in \u00a7 45 of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">We shall deal with each of those issues seri\u00e1tim.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">A principal way of determining whether a particular expression is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d as applied to the goods is to ascertain the reaction of those to whom it is directed \u2014 the consumers. In re Colonial Stores, 394 F.2d 549, 55 CCPA 1049 (1968); Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastics Co., 294 F.2d 694 (2d Cir. 1961); Vandenburgh, Trademark Law and Procedure, 2nd Edition \u00a7 4.30 (1968). We must point out initially that Roux, though it pleaded the matter, has submitted no direct evidence that Clairol\u2019s slogan has <em>'merely </em>a <em>descriptive </em>significance to purchasers of hair coloring preparations, to the exclusion of either a suggestive connotation or any origin-indicating significance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Roux\u2019s position that the slogan, by reason of its very nature, speaks for itself in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Concentrating first on whether the slogan is <em>descriptive, </em>Roux maintains that the slogan is simply a laudatory advertising expression \u2014 a form of \u201ctrade puffery\u201d as it were \u2014 used to describe and promote the product sold and identified by the recognized trademark \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d; that \u201cthere has been no suggestion as to any meaning which could be attributed to this phrase except the obvious one\u201d; and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">In the instant case the phrase sought to be registered \u201cHAIR COLOR SO NATURAL ONLY HER HAIRDRESSER KNOWS FOR SURE\u201d tells the purchaser only</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-6\">(1) what the goods are \u2014 hair coloring preparations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-7\">(2) what their function is \u2014 to make the colored hair look natural,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-8\">(3) what their characteristics are\u2014 to color so expertly that only a hairdresser could detect the coloring, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-9\">(4) what their use is \u2014 to color the hair expertly and thus achieve a natural appearance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">The descriptiveness of the instant slogan is also shown, Roux contends, by the fact that both parties have used other expressions of similar meaning as part of their advertising copy to describe the purpose, characteristics and result of use of their respective products.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">Though not free of controversy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we will assume for purposes of discussion that the words \u201chair color\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d \u2014indeed, the words of the slogan in its entirety \u2014 were, at inception of their use, apt descriptive words used in an informative, story-telling manner to describe the goods, their function, use and characteristics. The question is still presented, however, whether the slogan remains <em>merely </em>or only descriptive, or whether it now serves an origin-indicating function <em>in addition to </em>suitably describing attributes of the goods. That question leads naturally to a discussion of the second, broader issue posed earlier\u2014 whether the slogan is a trademark within the purview of the preamble to \u00a7 2 and of \u00a7 45 of the Act, and, in particular, whether it has \u201cbecome distinctive\u201d of the goods within the meaning of \u00a7 2(f) so as to no longer be <em>merely </em>descriptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>of them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words \u2014 is it * * or isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">For its part, Clairol relies chiefly on the fact that it has used the slogan \u201cHair Color So Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure\u201d in nearly all of its extensive advertising of its \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d products in various media since 1956, including point-of-sale displays, to establish that the slogan has become well-known to the purchasing public and serves to point to Clairol as the source of the products in association with which the slogan is used. Clairol further contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-5\">* * * That the advertising referred to was highly effective in driving home the fact that the slogan mark here involved identifies the applicant, as the source of the goods in connection with which that mark is displayed, is very definitely established by Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 10 and 11, * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Those latter exhibits, illustrating many parodies on the slogan and for the most part written by or representing the views of persons in the advertising, newspaper and magazine professions, are of relatively little assistance as direct evidence in determining whether the slogan does serve as an indication of origin to the purchasing public, simply because the record does not establish to what extent, if any, those persons are members of the class who purchase Clairol\u2019s goods in the market. In re Duvernoy &amp; Sons, Inc., 212 F.2d 202, 41 CCPA 856 (1954). But that evidentiary void is not necessarily fatal to Clairol\u2019s case. See In re Hollywood Brands, Inc., 214 F.2d 139, 41 CCPA 1001 (1954). We are left, then, with the extensive advertising carrying the slogan and promoting its product that Clairol has sponsored over the years, and whatever inference can be drawn from that advertising and the remaining evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">Clearly, the board found an inference favorable to Clairol:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-21\">Based on the record herein, which also includes various references to and/or parodies on applicant\u2019s slogan both by the press and advertising trade, there can be no question that applicant has so extensively promoted its slogan that it <em>must have made some impact on the purchasing public as an indication of origin. </em>While op-poser urges that the advertising and promotion of the product is all directed to \u201cMISS CLAIROL\u201d, and that the phrase \u201cHAIR COLOR SO NATURAL ONLY HER HAIRDRESSER KNOWS FOR SURE\u201d is merely a laudatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>phrase which is directed to the character or quality of \u201cMISS CLAIROL\u201d hair coloring, we are not persuaded that this is, in fact, the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-4\">Applicant\u2019s slogan is no doubt laudatory and somewhat descriptive of the desired result to be obtained from the use of applicant\u2019s product. On the other hand, it is not so highly laudatory or descriptive as to be incapable of acquiring distinctiveness as a trademark. * * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXn\">While Roux does not challenge the registrability of slogans on the principal register as a general proposition, it does criticize the board\u2019s extensive, if not exclusive, reliance on Clairol\u2019s advertising campaign for its \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d product as circumstantial evidence establishing that the slogan is a trademark and has become distinctive of the goods in the public eye. Typical of Roux\u2019s variously-stated views are the following excerpts from its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-5\">* * * That the material submitted failed to indicate any distinctiveness will be pointed out, but it is believed that the phrase is so totally laudatory and descriptive that it could not have acquired any distinctiveness even if proof of trademark use had been submitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-6\">* * * -X- -X- -X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">No amount of money spent in advertising can change the inherent nature of this phrase and make it anything other than a generic advertising statement which merely describes the product. It is not an indication of origin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">The law provides for the registration of trademarks, not of advertisements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-9\">* -X- -X- -X- -X *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-10\">Use of a trademark in extensive advertising may, of course, be used as one type of evidence tending to show that a trademark has been widely used and has become recognized. It must, however, be a trademark and used as a trademark. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-12\">The attempt to establish distinctiveness omitted any proof of trademark use or recognition of the phrase in question as a trademark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-13\">-X -X -X- -X- -X -X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-14\">* * * Examination of the many advertisements, submitted in connection with the file wrapper and in the exhibits submitted with appellee\u2019s stipulated facts, does not indicate, or even tend to establish, that HAIR COLOR SO NATURAL ONLY HER HAIRDRESSER KNOWS FOR SURE was used as a trademark or is capable of functioning as such. True, in many of these advertisements, the phrase is prominently displayed. Mere size, however, does not change the obvious fact that the phrase describes and points to the claimed virtues of the hair coloring preparation sold as MISS CLAIROL and not to any HAIR COLOR SO NATURAL ONLY HER HAIRDRESSER KNOWS FOR SURE hair coloring preparation. Such a product, bearing the phrase here involved, was not available on the market at any time (except for the single shipment) and, even as to that, the phrase could have been only generically descriptive and would not have been recognized as a trademark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-15\">The claim that extensive advertising cost indicates distinctiveness of this phrase ignores the fact that the advertising is for the MISS CLAIROL hair color bath. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">The determination of whether a given slogan is a registrable trademark is a matter which historically has not been free of difficulty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor is it an easy task here. The mere fact that a combination of words or a slogan is adopted and used by a manufacturer with the intent Clairol has manifested here\u2014 that it identify its goods and distinguish them from those of others \u2014 does not necessarily mean that the slogan accomplishes that purpose in reality. See In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>re Standard Oil Co., 275 F.2d 945, 47 CCPA 829 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\"> The amount and character of the evidence, if any, required to establish that a given word or phrase is a trademark or \u201chas become distinctive\u201d of the goods necessarily depends on the facts of each case and particularly on the nature of the alleged mark. At the outset, as noted earlier, it is not clear to us that Clairol\u2019s preliminary contention that the slogan is a fanciful, arbitrary, or even highly suggestive expression which, without more, presumptively functions as a trademark to indicate origin is necessarily correct. On the other hand, we do disagree with Roux\u2019s position, as did the board, that the slogan is so highly descriptive or generic that it is utterly incapable of functioning as a trademark or acquiring distinctiveness, no matter what quantity of evidence of alleged distinctiveness or secondary meaning is submitted. It is true, of course, that mere advertising or other evidence of supposed secondary meaning cannot convert something unregistrable by reason of its being the common descriptive name or generic name for the goods \u2014 the antithesis of a trademark \u2014 into a registrable mark. In re G. D. Searle &amp; Co., 360 F.2d 650, 53 CCPA 1192 (1966); Weiss Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracker &amp; Specialty Co., 290 F.2d 845, 48 CCPA 1004 (1961); J. Kohnstam, Ltd. v. Louis Marx &amp; Co. et al., 280 F.2d 437, 47 CCPA 1080 (1960). That does not mean that extensive advertising considered with other factors cannot be used to show a developed distinctiveness in a mark perhaps originally having some degree of descriptive significance when applied to the goods but capable of distinguishing them from those of others.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See Standard International Corp. v. American Sponge &amp; Chamois Co., 394 F.2d 599, 55 CCPA 1155 (1968); Clinton Detergent Co. v. The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 302 F.2d 745, 49 CCPA 1146 (1962). Considering all the factors here \u2014 exclusive, prominent and repeated use of the slogan by Clairol for at least ten years in association with the goods, expenditures in that period of over 22 million dollars for point-of-sale displays and other advertising material resulting in over a billion separate audio and visual impressions of the slogan, and substantial sales of the product with which the slogan has been associated\u2014 we do not think the board erred in concluding that Clairol\u2019s slogan has made an impact upon the purchasing public as an indication of origin, separate from and in addition to the impact of its \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d mark. See In re Hollywood Brands, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In our view, Roux has not shown such an interest in the use of the particular slogan in issue in its business that damage to it will be presumed from registration by Clairol. It is apparent that the slogan is not in common use by Roux or others to describe the same or similar products, Clairol having used it exclusively for a number of years. Nor is it one that Roux finds or might find necessary to describe the features of its product in the ordinary course of business, the record showing that Roux has used several other descriptive expressions of somewhat similar import in its advertising copy to describe similar attributes of its goods. We agree with the board, as does Clairol, that damage to Roux cannot ensue from registration of the instant slogan inasmuch as that slogan is not merely descriptive and its registration will not prevent the continued use by Roux in its advertising of descriptive phrases like those it has used in the past. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b) (4); In re Chesapeake Corp. of Virginia, 420 F.2d 754, 57 CCPA (1970); In re Automatic Radio Mfg. Co., 404 F.2d 1391, 56 CCPA 817 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">One matter remains. We have assumed heretofore that the slogan has been used on the goods in commerce as defined in \u00a7 45 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>1127. As noted by the board, however, Roux argued below that Clairol is not entitled to registration because, as shown by its stipulated testimony, it made only a <em>single </em>shipment of goods in commerce bearing the slogan (the slogan appeared on the cardboard containers in which glass bottles containing Clairol\u2019s hair coloring preparations were placed) prior to the filing of its application in 1962, and it has <em>not </em>used the slogan on its <em>containers </em>since that time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, Roux embellishes on that argument, adding that there obviously \u201cwas no intent to continue use of the phrase on the package, the use was not continued, and there has been no suggestion of any such intent.\u201d It seems to be Roux\u2019s position that, even were the slogan otherwise capable of being a trademark, Clairol nevertheless has not made bona fide <em>use </em>of it <em>on its goods </em>in commerce \u2014 at least on its <em>containers </em>for the goods<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 adequate to support a registration, and thus is not an \u201cowner of a trademark used in commerce.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051; cf. Fort Howard Paper Co. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 390 F.2d 1015, 55 CCPA 947 (1968), cert. denied 393 U.S. 831, 971, 89 S.Ct. 99, 21 L.Ed.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Whatever the merits of Roux\u2019s stance may be with respect to Clairol\u2019s use of the slogan on containers, the board correctly observed that \u00a7 45 of the Act provides other means by which a mark may be used on goods in commerce than on their containers, viz. that a mark shall be deemed to be used in commerce on goods \u201cwhen it is placed in any manner * * * ' <em>On the displays associated therewith </em>* * * and the goods are sold or transported in commerce.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">On that point, Roux urges the board erred in concluding that Clairol\u2019s use of its slogan has fully complied with that provision of \u00a7 45. There is no suggestion in the evidence, Roux argues, that the point-of-sale display cards on which Clairol placed its slogan were actually used in association with the goods. It further contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-11\">That the language used in the definition in section 45 requires something more than a mere advertisement and necessarily must consist of something directly associated with the goods is apparent both from the language of the statute and the nature of trademark use. Otherwise, any advertisement which might be displayed in a shop would constitute trademark use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">However true the latter contention may be,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Roux\u2019s argument consistently overlooks paragraph 11 of Clairol\u2019s stipulated testimony<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and its accompanying photographic exhibits, particularly exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>items 5L2-5L4 and 5M. Those items, among others, were stipulated to be \u201ctypical of the many different displays of the same general character which were distributed to and displayed and used in beauty salons and retail stores\u201d during the period 1956 to 1966, and do in fact show the slogan prominently used on relatively large counter or window display cards of the stand-up type in close association with the goods. Like the board, we are satisfied that Clairol\u2019s use of the slogan in the aforementioned stipulated manner, though a use in a form of advertising to be sure, is nevertheless a use on \u201cdisplays associated\u201d with the goods and satisfies the provisions of \u00a7 45. See In re E. Kahn\u2019s Sons Co., 343 F.2d 475, 52 CCPA 1201 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In conclusion, then, although Clairol\u2019s slogan has been used in connection with the sale of its hair coloring preparations in a promotional advertising manner and may have some descriptive connotation with respect to them, at the same time we think it has come, by virtue of its use in extensive advertising together with its use in commerce on displays associated with the goods, to serve as a means by which the public can identify the goods as those from a particular source and can distinguish those goods from those of others. It has \u201cbecome distinctive\u201d of those goods. That being the case, it performs the basic function of a trademark as set forth in the Trademark Act and as commonly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-10\">.

Roux agrees that the following examples taken from the text of its advertising copy of record, and quoted by the board in its opinion, are typical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-13\">\u201c * * * only you and your hairdresser know where nature stopped and Roux began.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-15\">\u201c * * * beautifully, lustrously, with completely natural-looking effects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-17\">\u201c * * * to pick up where nature leaves off * * * natural-looking hair color.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-20\">\u201c * * * so matches nature\u2019s look that no one knows it\u2019s there!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-23\">\u201cThe essence of good haircoloring is to look so natural that <em>no one </em>knows you used a cosmetic.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b888-24\">. Nothing of record establishes that Roux or anyone other than Clairol has ever used the specific phrase \u201cHair Color So Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure\u201d here sought to be registered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b888-25\">. The expression \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d was found by this court to be the generic name by which Clairol\u2019s product was known to the public, not a mark \u201ccapable of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods,\u201d and hence unregistrable on the Supplemental Register under \u00a7 23 of the Lanham Act.

On the other hand, as we shall see later in this opinion, Clairol has submitted no worthwhile <em>direct </em>evidence, by way of customer letters or affidavits or surveys, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>that consumers who purchase its pi\u2019oducts do in fact think of the slogan as identifying the products of a particular, albeit anonymous, source, and employ it as one means whereby they can distinguish those products from others they do not know or do not want. Apparently, the parties are content to have us subjectively decide what we think the consumer\u2019s reaction to the slogan has been and would be in the market place and what use she would make of it, based on what inferences we can draw from the evidence that is of record, on the meaning of the words comprising the slogan, and on their respective arguments. We proceed accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\">. There may be some merit to Clairol\u2019s preliminary argument that the slogan is only suggestive of the desired result to be obtained from use of the goods, not descriptive. To the women who use \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d hair preparations to change their natural brown hair color to ash blonde or to return their now natural gray hair to something approaching its original color, it could be said that the slogan \u201cHair Color So Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure\u201d, x'ead literally, might not evoke a response which connotes description of the goods or of the result of their use because, as those women must fully realize, the hair color resulting from that use is not in fact \u201cnatural\u201d but artificial. True it is that, from the user\u2019s standpoint, the ersatz hair color obtained will hopefully be <em>natural-appearing </em>or <em>-looking, </em>but that arguably is the implicit suggestion, not literal description, of the desirable result or effect to be obtained that the slogan actually arouses. Indeed, in that sense, the slogan might well be characterized as TOisdescriptive of the result obtained on use of the goods in many if not most cases, though certainly not deceptively so. Perhaps it is, as one court put it in another <em>context </em>with respect to another mark, used suggestively as \u201ca euphemism for guile in making hair appear what it is not\u201d. See Clairol Inc. v. Gillette Co., 270 F.Supp. 371 (D.C.E.D. N.Y.1967), affirmed 389 F.2d 264 (2nd Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">.

While the board, curiously enough, characterized the question raised by Roux as \u201cex parte in nature\u201d even though it was pleaded in paragraph 10 of the Notice of Opposition, its decision on the matter appears to have been inter partes, perhaps in deference to this court\u2019s repeated admonitions not to render separate ex parte rulings in certain inter partes situations.
