Plaintiffs-Appellants appeal from that limitation and move this court for summary reversal or, in the alternative, an injunction of such restriction pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">While this court is fully cognizant of the district court\u2019s power and discretion in imposing conditions on equity fashioned relief, we cannot conduct meaningful review on a record which grants the relief prayed for in one part and substantially emasculates the effectiveness of that relief in another, all in the absence of findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">Accordingly, that portion of the district court\u2019s order restricting the plaintiffs\u2019 right of peaceful assembly to Wednesday afternoons is vacated and remanded with directions to promptly conduct an evidentiary hearing, if such is deemed necessary, on the necessity of the restriction so imposed. The determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>tion so made shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">This court will retain jurisdiction of the within cause on appeal and plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 motions for summary reversal or, in the alternative, injunctive relief pending appeal shall be held in abeyance pending receipt of formal findings by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Vacated in part, remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
