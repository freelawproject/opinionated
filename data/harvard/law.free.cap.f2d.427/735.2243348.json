The contracting officer\u2019s last letter (note 2, supra) shows that he erroneously thought that he was required to issue a final decision only if there were a disputed question of fact. On the contrary, the rule is that he should render such a decision on any question arising \u201cunder the contract\u201d and remediable \u201cunder the contract,\u201d regardless of the types of issue involved. This is necessary so that the contractor can know when to appeal, and from what date his appeal time runs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\">ON DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION AND PLAINTIFF\u2019S CROSS-MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<author id=\"b800-10\">DAVIS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Plaintiff Zidell Explorations, Inc. was the successful bidder, for $313,789.99, on a sale, in 1966, by the Defense Supply Agency of surplus Titan I missile equipment located near Larson Air Force Base in the State of Washington. Controversy has erupted over the defendant\u2019s requirement that Zidell turn over, and leave with, the Government certain large items (tanks, vessels or cylinders) which the contractor insists are an integral part of the lot purchased, and the Government characterizes as \u201cSave List Items\u201d which the sales contract called upon the purchaser to remove from place but to turn over to the Government as its property. After relinquishing the items under protest, plaintiff made a claim upon the defendant for a refund of the reasonable value of this property, alleged to be $445,500. This demand was made under Article AL of the Special Conditions of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-16\">Article AL: Withdrawal of Property After Award. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract to the contrary, and irrespective of the provisions of this contract relating to title to the property, the Government reserves the right to withdraw for its use any or all of the property covered by this contract, if a bonafide requirement for the property develops or exists prior to actual removal of the property from Government control. In the event of a withdrawal under this provision, the Government shall be liable only for the refund of the reasonable value of the property withdrawn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWsW\">Asserting that the property involved was never sold to plaintiff, and therefore not covered by the contract, the contracting officer rejected this request and later confirmed his refusal. Plaintiff filed suit here without appealing to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals. Each party has moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The only issue we consider and decide is whether plaintiff must exhaust its administrative remedy before coming to court. The defendant is plainly right that such exhaustion is a prerequisite to suit. If the contractor\u2019s interpretation of the sales contract is correct, the disputed objects formed part of \u201cthe property covered by this contract\u201d, but the Government still had the privilege, under the explicit terms of Article AL, <em>supra, </em>to withdraw those items \u201cfor its use * * if a bonafide requirement for the property develops or exists prior to actual removal of the property from Government control.\u201d In that event, defendant \u201cshall be liable only for the refund of the reasonable value of the property withdrawn.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s claim letter (dated July 27, 1966) expressly recognized the Government\u2019s right under this provision, and also confirmed that the contracting officer had \u201ccertified to us that the Government has a bona fide need for the tanks which you have now directed us to deliver to the Government * * The letter sought the reasonable value of the withdrawn property, \u201cas provided for under the terms of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">This contract provision, as plaintiff ackowledged at the outset, gives it a specific contractual remedy through which it can get all the relief to which it is entitled and asks. (Its petition in this court demands only the reasonable value of the items withdrawn, in precisely the same amount ($445,500) as it sought from the contracting officer.) Under long-settled law, it must pursue and exhaust that remedy before asking a court to intervene. United States v. Blair, 321 U.S. 730, 64 S.Ct. 820, 88 L.Ed. 1039 (1944); United States v. Joseph A. Holpuch Co., 328 U.S. 234, 66 S.Ct. 1000, 90 L.Ed. 1192 (1946); Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, 386 U.S. 503, 512, 87 S.Ct. 1177, 18 L.Ed.2d 256 (1967); Schlesinger v. United States, 383 F.2d 1004, 1007-1008, 181 Ct.Cl. 21, 26-28 (1967); Len Company &amp; Associates v. United States, 385 F.2d 438, 441-442, 181 Ct.Cl. 29, 36 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Though plaintiff did present its claim to the contracting officer under Article AL, it never appealed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals. Its only excuse is the ancient and fallacious one that its claim involves solely a question of law while the \u201cdisputes\u201d procedure is only for factual clashes. That type of reasoning has long been discarded. If relief can properly be granted under the contract, the administrative procedure must be followed, regardless of whether the dispute in the particular instance concerns issues of law, issues of fact, or both. See Len Company &amp; Associates v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and many recent decisions of this court in which claims \u201cunder the contract\u201d have concerned only legal questions. In this ease, if plaintiff is correct as a matter of law the Board could so decide and make an award under Article AL. If, on the other hand, the defendant is right and the tanks or vessels were \u201cSave List Items\u201d, not sold to plaintiff, then the Board can so determine and refuse relief. The situation is analogous to the \u201cconstructive change\u201d, so familiar under the standard Changes articles, whereby relief is available under the contract if the Board, on appeal, holds incorrect the contracting officer\u2019s interpretation that the challenged work is already part of the specifications or contract (and not a change). See, <em>e. g., </em>Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. United States, 345 F.2d 833, 837 n. 2, 170 Ct.Cl. 757, 763 n. 2 (1965). The appellate remedy, within the administrative hierarchy, must therefore be exhausted, as well as the <em>nisi prius </em>stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">We cannot agree with defendant, however, that plaintiff\u2019s failure to appeal bars its claim for all time. That has not been our usual practice, in recent years, where some acceptable reason is offered for the absence of an appeal. See, e. <em>g., </em>Robertson Electric Co. v. United States, 176 Ct.Cl. 1287, 1301-1302 (1966); Universal Ecsco Corp. v. United States, 385 F.2d 421, 427, 181 Ct.Cl. 10, 20-21 (1967); Schlesinger v. United States, <em>supra, </em>383 F.2d 1004, 1005-1006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>181 Ct.Cl. 21, 24 (1967). Especially in the past decade, when there has been much confusion among contractors (and within parts of the Government) as to the cases which properly fall \u201cunder the contract\u201d, and are therefore governed by the \u201cdisputes\u201d procedure, we have refrained from being so rigid and inflexible as to deny contractors all opportunity for seeking administrative relief every time they have failed (before bringing suit) to pursue that remedy to its end.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">In this case, there are two independent reasons why we should not foreclose the claimant entirely. The first is that the contracting officer never seems to have made the formal \u201cfinal decision\u201d which is a normal prerequisite to an appeal to the ASBCA. He first rejected the claim in a letter which explained his reasoning but did not say that it was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d or spell out the contractor\u2019s rights of appeal. Plaintiff then submitted an affidavit, and the contracting officer answered that \u201cthe submission provides no basis upon which I can alter the position stated\u201d in his prior letter. Again, there was no statement that he had made a \u201cfinal decision\u201d, or any reference to appeal rights. Plaintiff wrote still another time, and on that occasion the contracting officer\u2019s answering letter clearly indicated that no \u201cfinal decision\u201d had yet been rendered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"> Since the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (32 CFR \u00a7 1.314 (a) (ed. of Jan. 1, 1965), now 32 CFR \u00a7 1.314(d) (ed. of Jan. 1, 1969)) expressly require the contracting officer to say in his letter of decision the equivalent of \u201cThis is the final decision of the contracting officer\u201d, as well as to detail the contractor\u2019s appeal rights, we are justified in holding, first, that no final decision has yet been issued on the claim, and, second, that plaintiff is not precluded from appealing to the ASBCA once that decision is made in correct form (as it should promptly be). It is the Government\u2019s obligation, not the contractor\u2019s to see that a proper \u201cfinal decision\u201d is rendered once a claim has been tendered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">A second reason for referring the case back to the administrative process is the probable need for some factual findings. True, the basic issue turns on the interpretation of the sales contract, but it now appears that determination of that legal question could well be helped by investigation into certain subsidiary factual matters. One significant instance has already surfaced in the briefs and oral argument: \u2014 The \u201cSave List Items\u201d involved are Nos. 338 and 341, described in the list as \u201cTank, Storage\u201d, \u201cTank, Helium Storage\u201d, \u201cTank, GOX\u201d, or \u201cTank, Gaseous Oxygen\u201d. These are actually clusters, combinations, or assemblies of seven or eight vessels installed and joined together. The over-all issue is whether the \u201cSave List\u201d, which designated certain numbers of those items to be retained by the Government, referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>to the individual vessels (as claimed by the plaintiff) or to the entire cluster or assembly (the defendant\u2019s position). In support of its contention, the Government relies heavily on diagrams and descriptions of these items in a contemporaneous Defense Supply Agency publication (\u201cAerospace Ground Equipment\u201d, Excess List Number 65-B10, dated May 6, 1965). These descriptions give the nomenclature as \u201cTank, Gaseous Oxygen\u201d, or \u201cTank, Helium Storage\u201d, in the singular, and then set forth (among other data) dimensions, weight, and unit price. Defendant maintains that the designation of \u201cTank\u201d refers to the whole assembly as a unit, while the plaintiff\u2019s assertion is that that singular noun refers to each of the seven or eight vessels making up the cluster. In that connection, plaintiff tells us that the dimensions, weight, and unit price set out in the descriptions refer to the individual vessel or cylinder, not the whole entity. Defendant counters that there is nothing in the present record to support this assertion. There is, of course, nothing on this point in the scanty record now before us, but it seems obvious that the subject can be highly relevant, and is worthy of ventilation before the Board. There may well be other factual inquiries to be pursued. A return to the Board, the fact-finding tribunal, is therefore wholly appropriate, and not merely a formal obeisance to proper \u201cdisputes\u201d procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Although plaintiff does not make the contention, one could conceivably say, if one wished to be strictly technical, that, in view of the time which had elapsed without a proper \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the contracting officer since the claim was first presented to that official in July 1966, Zidell was justified in filing suit here in May 1968, without waiting any longer for the \u201cfinal decision\u201d \u2014 on the theory of cases like New York Shipbuilding Corp. v. United States, 385 F.2d 427, 180 Ct.Cl. 446 (1967), and Universal Ecsco Corp. v. United States, 385 F.2d 421, 424-426, 181 Ct.Cl. 10, 16-19 (1967), that by such undue delay the Government breaches the implied covenant to render a timely and appropriate decision. See, also, Clement Bros. Co. v. United States, 190 Ct.Cl. 50, 418 F.2d 1356 (1969). On that view, the whole case could be tried here, including any subordinate factual issues. We do not follow that route because (a) plaintiff has not chosen to ask for it, and was itself somewhat laggard in failing to push the contracting officer toward a proper \u201cfinal decision\u201d, and (b) the failure to render a \u201cfinal decision\u201d was formal, rather than substantial, since the contractor had promptly been made aware of the contracting officer\u2019s position on the claim. It is better, in these circumstances, to send the case back to the administrators than to hold that the Government has forfeited its contractual right to an initial administrative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\"> The question remains whether to suspend proceedings here to allow the parties to pursue the administrative path or to dismiss the petition (without prejudice) so that that can be accomplished. Under the court\u2019s present policy, the petition must be dismissed, without prejudice, since it prematurely seeks only relief \u201cunder the contract,\u201d relief which is obtainable through the \u201cdisputes\u201d procedure; the petition contains no truly separate claim for breach of contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff will not be harmed by this nonprejudicial dismissal; limitations does not commence to run until completion of the administrative process. Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, 386 U.S. 503, 87 S.Ct. 1177, 18 L.Ed.2d 256 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">On this basis, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied and defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted to the extent that the petition is dismissed, without prejudice, as premature. The petition is accordingly dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-12\">. Also invoked was Article AS :</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">\u201cArticle AS: Change in Contract Requirements. The Sales Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order and with notice only to the person or firm to whom the contract was awarded, make changes in the method by or the extent to which the property is to be scrapped, mutilated, or demilitarized; the method by or the extent to which Government property is to be stripped from the subject matter of the contract (to include the addition or deletion of property to be stripped) ; or the disposition to be made of the stripped property. If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the contractor\u2019s cost of performance of the contract or causes an increase or decrease in the market value of the property being disposed of, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the purchase price and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. Any claim by the contractor for an adjustment under this clause must be asserted in writing within 30 days from the date of receipt by the contractor of the notification of change unless the Sales Contracting Officer grants a further period of time before the final date for performance under the contract. If the parties fail to agree upon the adjustment to be made, the dispute shall be determined as provided in the \u2018Disputes\u2019 Clause of the contract; but nothing provided in this clause shall excuse the contractor from proceeding with performance as required under the change.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">.
