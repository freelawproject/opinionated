The prosecution, during cross-examination of appellant\u2019s wife, who was also his secretary, called upon her to produce certain files, which had been suppressed on appellant\u2019s motion prior to trial. Appellant\u2019s counsel waited until the following morning to interpose an objection outside the hearing of the jury. The trial judge sustained the objection, but ruled that as a matter of fairness to the government, the objection should be repeated in the presence of the jury. Appellant claims that by thus forcing to the attention of the jury the exercise of his privilege against self incrimination, his constitutional rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The problem appellant raises is not one of constitutional dimensions. The privilege against self incrimination is not a prohibition against all inquiry. See 8 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2268, at 402 (McNaughton rev. 1961). Specific instances of prosecutorial misconduct in the face of knowledge that the privilege will be asserted or of the creation of inferences adding critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case may be so prejudicial as to require reversal. See Namet v. United States, 373 U.S. 179, 185-190, 83 S.Ct. 1151, 10 L.Ed.2d 278 (1963). That, however, is not the case here. We do not believe the prosecution\u2019s request for the files evidenced a deliberate attempt to call to the attention of the jury appellant\u2019s prior exercise of his privilege against self incrimination. The prosecution had some basis for believing it was now entitled to inspect the files; appellant\u2019s wife admitted that she had studied the files in preparation for her testimony. In any event, the prosecution\u2019s conduct, if improper, represented only a \u201cminor lapse\u201d in the context of the entire trial. See United States v. Hiss, 185 F.2d 822, 832 (2d Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 948, 71 S.Ct. 532, 95 L.Ed. 683 (1951). Nor do we believe the jury could have drawn any inferences from the incident of critical importance to the prosecution\u2019s case. In calling for the files, the prosecution made no reference to the fact that appellant had previously exercised his privilege against self incrimination with regard to them. The court required appellant\u2019s counsel to make only a general non-specific objection to the production of the files, and accordingly counsel merely objected to the production of the files \u201cat this particular time.\u201d This was not a case where the jury was certain to infer that appellant had previously exercised his privilege against self incrimination. See United States v. Gross, 276 F.2d 816, 820-821, (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 831, 80 S.Ct. 1602, 4 L.Ed.2d 1525 (1960); Fletcher v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 332 F.2d 724 (1964). Even assuming the jury might have drawn an inference prejudicial to appellant, not only did appellant\u2019s counsel help create the situation by failing to make timely objection to a line of questioning obviously pointed towards a request for the files, see United States v. Five Cases, etc., 179 F.2d 519, 523-524 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 963, 70 S.Ct. 997, 94 L.Ed. 1372 (1950), but the court\u2019s careful instruction to the jury, upon sustaining the objection, that the files need not be produced \u201cas a matter of law\u201d and that the jury was to \u201cdraw no inferences from that one way or another,\u201d was sufficient to cure any prejudice inherent in the situation. See Namet v. United States, <em>supra, </em>373 U.S. at 187, 83 S.Ct. 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">The prosecution\u2019s examination of Leon Rosen, appellant\u2019s expert witness, did not exceed the permissible scope of cross-examination. Cross-examination elicited no more than that the witness was friendly with appellant and that he had previously testified as a defense ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>pert in two similar cases. The witness\u2019 friendship with appellant and his testifying as a defense witness in two similar cases were both relevant on the issue of bias. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in permitting this line of inquiry. See United States v. Lester, 248 F.2d 329, 334 (2d Cir. 1957); 3 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 949 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Count 5 charged that appellant corruptly endeavored to influence Lilleth Downer, a witness in a proceeding before the INS. Mrs. Downer testified at the trial that her employer, a Mrs. Gittelman, had died and that appellant told her not to divulge Mrs. Gittelman\u2019s death to the INS but to claim that she was still working for her. When she sought to carry out appellant\u2019s instructions she found that the INS investigator was aware of Mrs. Gittelman\u2019s death. Upon being taxed with lying Mrs. Downer told the investigator the whole story including Abrams\u2019 role. When later she reported to Abrams what had happened he tried to persuade her to go to the INS and recant her statement to the investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Although appellant did not object to the charge given on Count 5, he now claims that it was so prejudicially erroneous as to constitute plain error cognizable under Rule 52(b), Fed.R. Crim.P. The crux of appellant\u2019s argument is that the jury, by its acquittal on Count 4 which charged appellant with advising Mrs. Downer to lie to the INS about her employer\u2019s death, indicated that it convicted appellant on Count 5 even though it found that appellant had sought only to obtain a statement from Mrs. Downer of what had happened. This, appellant concludes, shows that the court's charge did not sufficiently apprise the jury of what it had to find in order to convict on Count 5 and that the error sufficiently influenced the verdict as to constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Appellant\u2019s argument is untenable. The acquittal on the related count shows no more than a possible inconsistency in the jury\u2019s verdict and cannot be used to undermine the correctness of a conviction on another count. See Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932); United States v. Carbone, 378 F.2d 420 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 914, 88 S.Ct. 242, 19 L.Ed. 2d 262 (1967); United States v. Kahn, 366 F.2d 259, 262 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, sub nom. Pacelli v. United States, 385 U.S. 948, 87 S.Ct. 321, 17 L.Ed.2d 226 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The trial court\u2019s charge, which included an instruction to the effect that appellant must be found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have acted, \u201ccorruptly,\u201d defined as \u201cwith improp\u00e9r motive, a bad and evil purpose,\u201d was adequate to apprise the jury that appellant could not be convicted for attempting to obtain what he believed to be a true statement. There is no basis for a finding of reversible error. See United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965) (en banc), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Appellant contends that in any event it was error to submit Count 5 to the jury, since there was no evidence that he intended to influence an agency proceeding. The offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 (1964) is to influence a witness, not necessarily to directly influence the proceeding itself, and there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant on this charge. Nor do we think there can be any doubt that an application for voluntary departure is a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the intent of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\"> Although appellant did not request a special instruction on accomplice testimony, he now claims that the failure to give such a charge also constituted plain error. It is preferable to charge the jury that accomplice testimony should be scrutinized with special care and caution. However this circuit does not require that the charge be given unless substantial prejudice results from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>omission. See United States v. Cianchetti, 315 F.2d 584, 592 (2d Cir. 1963). The trial judge gave the usual instruction concerning the weight to be given to the testimony of witnesses as affected by their bias or interest in the case, and under the circumstances of this case, the omission of the special instruction on accomplice testimony does not justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">There was sufficient evidence to convict appellant on the count charging that he had caused the making of a false statement in an affidavit relating to an application for an extension of stay. The affidavit, purportedly made by a client\u2019s son, stated that the client intended to depart the United States on a scheduled date and had made plans for such departure. Although appellant may not have been specifically aware of what his client\u2019s plans for departure we^e, the jury could have found from the evidence that appellant acted with reckless disregard of whether the statements made were true and with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth. See United States v. Simon, 425 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. Nov. 12, 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1006, 90 S.Ct. 1235, 25 L.Ed.2d 420 (1970); Bentel v. United States, 13 F.2d 327, 329 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Amos v. United States, 273 U.S. 713, 47 S.Ct. 109, 71 L.Ed. 854 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Finally, appellant contends that his conviction for causing an alien to fail to have personal possession of his certificate of alien registration rests upon an unconstitutionally vague application of the statute requiring possession, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(e) (1964). He claims that since the INS required the certificate, here the 1-94 form, to be submitted with various applications made by an attorney on behalf of his client and since the INS invariably returned the 1-94 to the attorney rather than to his client, he has been convicted for what the government, by its action, gave him reason to believe was entirely proper. We cannot agree. Appellant kept the I-94\u2019s in question for over a period of three years. No legitimate reason justified their retention over this prolonged period. Appellant was on notice that such retention was illegal. In fact he was specifically instructed by an agent of the INS to return the forms to his clients. Under the circumstances, we believe appellant was made sufficiently aware of the illegality of his conduct so as to preclude any claim that his conviction on these counts represented a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Furthermore, the 1-94 form is clearly a \u201ccertificate of alien registration\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(e) (1964). The 1-94 was properly designated as an alien registration form in 8 C.F.R. 264.1(b) (1969), pursuant to statutory authority contained in 8 U.S.C.' \u00a7 1304(d) (1964). <em>Amicus </em>claims to the contrary are rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\">. Appellant <em>was </em>originally indicted on 60 counts, charging various offenses in connection with his practice of immigration law. Twenty-eight of these counts were severed prior to trial. Appellant was acquitted on twenty-seven counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Appellant was sentenced to a term of one year\u2019s imprisonment on each of the two counts charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and on the count charging a violation of 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 1505. A term of one month\u2019s imprisonment was imposed on each of the two misdemeanor counts charging a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(e) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 The sentences run concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
