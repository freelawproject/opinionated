A composition of matter consisting essentially of 7-[3-hydroxy-2- (3-hydroxy-l, 5-octadienyl) -5-oxo-cyclopentyl]-5-heptenoic acid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-9\">Both compounds, termed PGE2 and PGE3, respectively, are members of a family of compounds known collectively as prostaglandins. According to the specification, both are useful in stimulating smooth muscle and in lowering blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-10\">Some background information will be helpful in understanding the issues raised by the decisions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-11\">It appears from the record that scientists have known for many years that certain secretions and extracts obtained from human and animal male accessory genital glands possessed the pharmacodynamic effects of lowering blood pressure and stimulating smooth muscle. One Kurzrok, for example, observed in 1930 that human seminal plasma augmented or decreased tone and spontaneous movements in isolated strips of human uterus. A few years later, Goldblatt and von Euler observed that human seminal fluid, human prostate secretions, and secretions of the vesicular gland of sheep produced hypotensive activity and stimulated the smooth muscle in isolated rabbit\u2019s intestine. Von Euler also examined extracts of prostate gland and sheep vesicular gland (obtained by subjecting the organ to alcohol extraction, concentrating the extract by evaporation of alcohol and eliminating lipoids, as required, by a further ether extraction) and found similar pharmacodynamic activity. As von Euler then noted, \u201c[t]he attempt to identify the active substance with known substances has thus far been unsuccessful,\u201d although he thought that \u201cto all appearances the substance is an independent basic compound.\u201d Shortly thereafter, von Euler appears to have determined that the \u201cactive principle\u201d in the above secretions and extracts \u201chad acidic character,\u201d and he named it \u201cprostaglandin.\u201d He was able to free it from associated material \u201cto a certain extent\u201d to obtain \u201csemi-purified extracts,\u201d having found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-14\">after extraction with ethanol and evaporation of the ethanol, prostaglandin could be taken up in ether from an acid solution and subsequently extracted with alkaline water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-15\">In the late 1950\u2019s, appellants Bergstrom and Sjovall isolated two distinct chemical compounds in essentially pure crystalline form \u201cfrom crude materials, such as von Euler prostaglandin, or directly from accessory genital materials such as prostate glands and sperm.\u201d Their discovery of those compounds, which were originally known as PGE and PGF (now PGEi and PGFi) is described in their earlier application serial No. 738,514, now patent No. 3,069,322, issued Dec. 18, 1962, and the two pure compounds form the subject matter of some of the claims of that patent. Both compounds were found to have a smooth muscle stimulating effect, but only PGE has hypotensive activity. As described in similar language both in the patent and in the present application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-16\">These compounds [PGE1 and PGF1] are associated in the source materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>and in crude extracts thereof with antigens and pyrogens, for example, tissue fragments, lipids, cellular debris, foreign proteins, and the like, and are not useful for parenteral applications. The isolation of these compounds free of antigens and pyrogens made it possible to utilize their pharmacodynamic effects without undesirable side effects or reactions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">To isolate PGEi and PGFi, it appears from the Bergstrom et al. patent and the present application that appellants first prepared a crude extract containing PGEi and PGFX by subjecting sheep prostate gland to alternate alcohol, ether and alkaline phosphate buffer extractions somewhat in the manner of von Euler. A solid residue obtained upon drying a final ether extraction was then given a preliminary purification by subjecting it to a \u201cfive stage countercurrent distribution\u201d between ether and phosphate buffer, and the resultant ether and buffer phases were dried. Certain of the dried ether and buffer phases were then pooled and subjected to two different \u201creversed phase partition chromatography\" procedures employing two different solvent systems. Certain fractions of the eluate obtained from that purification procedure yielded crystals of essentially pure PGEi andPGFi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">In 1960, appellants also published a description of their work relating to the isolation of PGEi and PGFi in Acta Chemica Scandinaviea, <em>H, </em>1693-1705 (1960). The procedure with respect to the isolation of PGEi was described thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-6\">We have described the isolation of prostaglandin F from vacuum dried sheep prostate glands in the preceding paper * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-15\">In that work it was noticed that a more lipid soluble factor was sometimes present which showed activity both on intestinal strips and on rabbit blood pressure. It has been found that this fraction is responsible for most of the activity of the fresh or frozen glands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-16\">The isolation of this factor, prostaglandin E (PGE) in crystalline form, will be described in this paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-17\">* * * -X- -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-18\"><em>Extraction procedure. </em>The frozen glands were minced in a meat grinder. After addition of 4 liters of 95% ethanol per kg, the suspension was stirred mechanically for one hour and then left to sediment over night. The extract was separated and concentrated * * *. The crude concentrate was then extracted into ether and transferred into phosphate buffer \u25a0S' \u2018X- 'X*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-21\"><em>Partition chromatography. </em>In this work, we left out the counter-current distribution procedure for the preliminary purification of the crude extract. Instead, this extract was directly subjected to reversed-phase chromatography with 50% methanol/water as moving phase and 50% \u00bfsooctanol/chloform as stationary phase, supported on Hostalen (Hoeehst). In most cases the extract from 12.5 kg of prostate glands weighed 5-7 g and this material was put on a column with 67 ml of stationary phase on 100 g of Hostalen. The result of such a chromatography is shown in Fig. 1. The peak of physiological activity appeared at about 1.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>1 effluent. * * * A 10 to 30-fold purification of the active material was obtained with the reversed phase chromatography.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-6\">The material obtained was found to lower rabbit blood pressure. This effect is not obtained with previously isolated PGF. It was found, however, that PGE, although being eluted somewhat later than PGF, was not separated from this compound. Therefore, a second reversed-phase chromatography was run using 35% (v/v) methanol/water saturated with <em>Vio </em>of its volume of 40% (v/v) isoamyl acetate/chloroform as moving phase. The hydrophobic phase was used as stationary phase, 4 ml being supported on each 4.5 g of silane treated kieselguhr. With this system, PGF is eluted just after the front, separated from PGE which is eluted at about 50 ml effluent from a 4.5 g column. * * * an approximate 4-fold purification was obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-9\">* * * * -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-10\"><em>Crystallization of prostaglandin E. </em>The fractions from the second reversed phase chromatography, containing the last half of the active band, were combined as also were those containing the first half. After evaporation to dryness <em>in vacuo, </em>the residues were dissolved in a few ml of ethyl acetate and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. Needle-shaped crystals were usually obtained from the material contained in the last half of the active band * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1461-11\">In Examples 4 and 5 of the present application, appellants describe a procedure for separate isolation of PGE2 and PGE3 in addition to PGEi which closely resembles the process described in their 1960 publication up to the point where the second reversed-phase chromatography run was begun. Thereupon, appellants changed their procedure and subjected the pooled effluent fractions from the first chromatography run to a different chromatographic process. They obtained three separate fractions having physiological activity from which pure PGEi, PGE2, and PGE3 were individually isolated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-12\">Faced with that set of facts, the examiner rejected claims 23 and 53 under \u00a7 101. Inasmuch as the \u201cclaimed compounds are naturally occurring,\u201d said the examiner, they therefore \u201care not \u2018new\u2019 within the connotation of the patent statute,\u201d citing Ex parte Snell, 86 USPQ 496 (1950). In support of her rejection, and in contrast to appellants\u2019 contention that both claims are directed not to naturally occurring materials but to pure compounds which do not exist in pure form in nature, the examiner noted that she could not \u201cdetermine from the claims exactly what is included or excluded.\u201d She thought the language of both claims sufficiently broad to embrace and not distinguish from either (1) the mother liquors which apparently inherently contain PGE2 and PGE3 and from which PGEj. is crystallized, as described in the 1960 Bergstrom et al. publication, or (2) those compounds as they inherently occur in previously known crude extracts or even in nature. In view of that, and because the smooth muscle-stimulating, blood pressure-depressing functions of <em>something </em>\u2014 an unidentified active material \u2014 in the sheep prostate glands and crude extracts thereof (from which appellants isolated PGE and other active components) was known by von Euler and others in the art prior to appellants\u2019 isolation of them and discovery of precisely what they were, the examiner felt that \u201c[mjerely determining the structure of the active components of Von Euler\u2019s \u2018Prostaglandin\u2019 does not make the <em>claimed </em>products new.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-13\">The board approached the issue in quite a different manner. At the outset, we observe that it apparently disagreed with the examiner\u2019s interpretation of the claims and agreed with appellants that their claims are directed to pure chemical compounds, variously referring in its opinion to \u201cthe claimed pure mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>rials,\u201d \u201cthe claimed pure compounds,\u201d and \u201cthe pure products claimed.\u201d After summarizing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> its understanding of the examiner\u2019s rejection, the board noted that appellants had not denied that PGE2 and PGE3 were <em>in fact </em>inherently present in the glandular material, extracts and liquors described in the Bergstrom publication. Indeed, when it compared the procedure described in Examples 4 and 5 of appellants\u2019 specification for obtaining a product from the first partition chromatography with that described in the Bergstrom reference, heretofore quoted under the heading <em>\u201cPartition chromatography,\u201d </em>it found \u201ca striking similarity of procedure <em>up to that point\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]. \u201cAccordingly,\u201d said the board, \u201cif appellants\u2019 material with a \u2018peak of physiological activity * * * at about 1500 ml.' contains PGE2 and PGE3, then the corresponding material of the reference with a \u2018peak of physiological activity * * * at about 1.5 1.\u2019 must likewise contain PGE2 and PGE3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Having firmly established inherency to its satisfaction \u2014 a \u201csound and unrefuted basis for holding that PGE2 and PGE3 are present in the material obtained from the first partition chromatography of the publication\u201d- \u2014 the board then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-6\">* * * the issue remaining to be decided is whether the <em>claimed pure </em>materials are <em>novel </em>as compared with the <em>less pure </em>materials of the reference. Here we must consider the various decisions cited by appellants and the Examiner, most of which were reviewed by us in the case of <em>Ex parte </em>Reed et al., 135 USPQ 34 (on reconsideration, 135 USPQ 105). The consistent principle, and the one which we follow, is that a claim to a purified material cannot be allowed unless the purified material exhibits properties and utilities not possessed by the unpurified material. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-11\">On review of that matter, the board found no new properties for the pure materials claimed that the impure materials of the reference do not also have\u2014 namely, both stimulate smooth muscle and lower blood pressure \u2014 and affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">Appellants petitioned the board for reconsideration, voicing objection to the manner in which the board had used their own specification to establish both inherency of the presence of PGE2 and PGE3 in the materials of the Bergstrom publication, and the subsequent asserted anticipatory effect of that reference. They argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-13\">But appellants again insist that there is no evidence whatever in the Bergstrom et al. article or elsewhere in the Patent Office record of this appealed application that the art knew or should have known that PGE2 and PGE3 could be isolated in pure form from the same animal tissues from which PGEi had been isolated. This is a point which has been presented again and again to the Patent Office in writing and orally. Nowhere in the record has the Patent Office discussed or even acknowledged this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">The board responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-15\">The issue involved in the Examiner\u2019s rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is the <em>inherent </em>presence of PGE2 and PGE3 <em>in the material of the reference. Neither the Examiner nor we have held that the publication explicitly spells out the presence of these two substances. </em>On the question of the inherent existence of PGE2 and PGE3 any evidence may be used, pro or con, and appellants are free to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>negative, just as we used circumstantial evidence to demonstrate the affirmative in * * * our decision. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">A preliminary question has arisen concerning the status of the 1960 Bergstrom et al. publication as \u201cprior art\u201d in the case. Both the examiner and board cited it as a \u201creference,\u201d presumably to serve as an evidentiary basis <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for their rejection of the claimed subject matter as not \u201cnew\u201d or as \u201clacking in novelty.\u201d The only statutory basis stated by them for so employing it was not 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 but 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The situation thus presented to us is rather unique, the only comparable one in recent years that comes to mind being In re Seaborg, 328 F.2d 996, 51 C.C.P.A. 1109 (1964), where a reference was used by the Patent Office to support a rejection under \u00a7 101 on the basis that the subject matter claimed, though not described, nevertheless was inherently present in material produced by the reference process and therefore was not new. The solicitor seeks to explain the position taken below this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-6\">With regard to the prior art, it should be noted that neither the examiner nor the Board relied upon the Bergstrom et al. article or any other reference under S102. In fact, appellants appear to have the benefit of the filing date of their 1958 application as to the subject matter of their 1960 publication which is also disclosed by the 1958 application. However, the examiner and Board did rely upon the 1960 publication as evidence of the prior art in accordance with the Court\u2019s holding in In re Wilson, 50 CCPA 773, [311 F.2d 266], 135 USPQ 442.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">We note, however, that neither the examiner nor the board relied on the case cited by the solicitor in support of his hypothesis, or the exceptional circumstances illustrated therein, to explain or justify their use of the Bergstrom publication here. In any event, it should also be observed that the subject matter of the present claims is not \u201cdisclosed in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section 112\u201d in appellants\u2019 1958 parent application, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120. Inasmuch as the Bergstrom article appears to have been published more than one year prior to the date of any application by appellants which <em>does </em>describe the subject matter of the present claims, it is <em>eligible </em>as a <em>timewise </em>statutory bar under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), <em>if </em>indeed the present invention was \u201cdescribed\u201d in or rendered obvious <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>publication. To that matter we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">Appellants argue that the subject matter of the claims \u2014 pure PGE2 and pure PGE3 \u2014 is \u201cnew.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tested by the conventional evidentiary criteria or \u201cconditions for patentability\u201d relevant to the present factual situation which Congress has expressed in the various provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102, appellants are undoubtedly correct, for the Patent Office has not been able to cite \u2014 or supply evidence under \u2014 any of those statutory provisions to establish that the claimed subject matter lacks \u201cnovelty.\u201d Indeed, the board concedes that \u201c[n] either the Examiner nor we have held that the [Bergstrom] publication explicitly spells out the presence of these two substances,\u201d making it apparent that the claimed pure compounds were not \u201cdescribed in a printed publication in * * * a foreign country\u201d more than one year prior to the filing date of appellants\u2019 present application. As far as the record shows, then, the claimed subject matter is descx-ibed and made known to the public for the first time only in the present application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">The question remains whether there is some other, perhaps exti\u2019a-statutory criteria standing apart from \u00a7 102 for determining whether given subject matter is \u201cnew\u201d in the sense Congress has utilized that term in \u00a7 101 or, to put it another way, whether the Bergstrom publication can be used as evidence to support a rejection under \u00a7 101 in a manner different and apart from what would have been its normal use to support a rejection under \u00a7 102, had it in fact described the claimed subject matter. The board and solicitor seem to have taken an affirmative view on those matters, but for rather different reasons. The solicitor says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-12\">The only reasonable conclusion from the evidence of record is that the compounds claimed by appellants are present in some form in the prior art extracts. Appellants argue that such a fact has no legal significance because not even the impure compounds were known to exist and to be in pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>session of the public * <em>* *. </em>However, prior knowledge is a requirement of S102, but there is no requirement that a naturally occurring compound must be known or in possession of the public to negate novelty under S101. Certainly, an unknown compound or composition of materials merely discovered from nature is not patentable. Funk [Funk Bros. Seed Co.] v. Kalo [Kalo Inoculant Co.], 333 U.S. 127 [68 S.Ct. 440, 92 L.Ed. 588] 76 USPQ 280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZg\">The solicitor\u2019s position seems to hark back to the examiner\u2019s view, heretofore summarized, that the present compounds, as claimed, are \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d and therefore not \u201cnew.\u201d At the outset we would observe that what appellants claim \u2014 pure PGE2 and pure PGE3 \u2014 is not \u201cnaturally occurring.\u201d Those compounds, as far as the record establishes, do not exist in nature in pure form, and appellants have neither merely discovered, nor claimed sufficiently broadly to encompass, what has previously existed in fact in nature\u2019s storehouse, albeit unknown, <em>or </em>what has previously been known to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">But quite apart from those considerations, the criteria for determining whether given subject matter is \u201cnew\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 101 are no different than the criteria for determining whether that subject matter possesses the \u201cnovelty\u201d expressed in the title of \u00a7 102. The word \u201cnew\u201d in \u00a7 101 is defined and is to be construed in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 102.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, that which possesses statutory novelty under the provisions of \u00a7 102 is also new within the intendment of \u00a7 101. We have found no evidence of Congressional intent to define the word \u201cnew\u201d as used in \u00a7 101 in any different manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-15\">Failing to find pure PGE2 and PGE3 described in the Bergstrom publication, the board in turn seems to have premised its decision on the inherency of an <em>impure </em>form of PGE2 and PGE3 in products resulting from certain procedures that are described in that reference. Appellants argue here, and below, that the board improperly used their own application as \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d of that fact. It is appellants\u2019 view that the <em>fact </em>of inherency was hidden from the world until they discovered it, and disclosed it in the present application. We need not decide the merits of that matter,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for the fundamental error in the board\u2019s position, as we see it, is the analysis and answer it gave to the sole issue it accurately posed \u2014 \u201cwhether the <em>claimed </em>pure materials are <em>novel </em>as compared with the less <em>pure </em>materials of the reference.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] It seems to us that the answer to that question is self-evident: by definition,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>pure materials necessarily differ from <em>less </em>pure or impure materials and, if the latter are the only ones existing and available as a standard of reference, as seems to be the situation here, perforce the \u201cpure\u201d materials are \u201cnew\u201d with respect to them. As this court stated in In re Williams, 171 F.2d 319, 36 CCPA 756 (1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-4\">In support of the rejection on the ground of lack of novelty, the examiner and the board point out that the compound of the Monatschefte publications is a racemic mixture and, therefore, necessarily contains both dextro rotary and laevo rotary components. It is the position of the Patent Office tribunals that, in view of that fact, the laevo rotary compound, having existed as part of the racemic mixture, cannot be novel. The appealed claim, however, calls for the laevo rotary form \u201csubstantially free from the dextro rotary form\u201d and it is evident that the laevo rotary form did not exist in this condition in the mixture of the Monatschefte publications. <em>The existence of a compound as an ingredient of another substance does not negative novelty in a claim to the pure compound, </em>although it may, of course, render the claim unpatentable for lack of invention [now obviousness, \u00a7 103]. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">Moreover, whether the claimed pure materials have the same usefulness or assortment of properties as the impure materials of the prior art, as the board here found, is a question having no bearing on the factual and legal matter whether pure materials are new visa-vis impure materials within the meaning of \u00a7 101, although it is but one of the factors to be considered in determining their obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. In re Cofer, 354 F.2d 664, 53 CCPA 830 (1966). As we observed earlier, no rejection under \u00a7 103 appears to be presented, and it thus becomes unnecessary to consider the cases discussed in <em>Cofer </em>and in Ex parte Reed, cited by the board, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">We conclude that the subject matter claimed by appellants is \u201cnew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1459-12\">.

As we recently pointed out in In re Land, 368 F.2d 866, 54 CCPA 806 (1966), quoting from In re Hilmer, 359 F.2d 859, 53 CCPA 1288 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-12\">Much confused thinking could be avoided by realizing that rejections are <em>based </em>on statutory provisions, not on references, and that the references merely supply the <em>evidence </em>of lack of novelty, obviousness, loss of right or whatever may be the ground of rejection.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">.

See, for example, In re Foster, 343 F.2d 980, 52 CCPA 1808 (1965), cert. denied 383 U.S. 966, 86 S.Ct. 1270, 16 L.Ed.2d 307; In re Hassler, 347 F.2d 911, 52 CCPA 1546 (1965); In re Ruscetta, 255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>F.2d 687, 45 CCPA 968 (1958). As is evident from the decisions below, appellants and the solicitor are on sound ground in agreeing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFnF\">* * * obviousness of the claimed pure compounds is not an issue here since there is no rejection under <em>35 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1464-9\">. Appellants also insist that the Patent Office has not established that those in the art were even in possession of <em>impure </em>PGE2 and <em>impure </em>PGEa, and consequently that those substances too are new. To a certain extent, we suppose, their contention has some merit, but primarily for the reason that appellants were evidently the first to ascribe the names \u201cPGE2\u201d and \u201cPGEs\u201d (or the more standard systematic nomenclature reflected in the claims) to what they isolated in pure form either from sheep prostate gland or particularly from von Euler\u2019s \u201csemi-purified\u201d prostaglandin. Moreover, appellants say, the art knew nothing of the existence of PGE2 and PGE3 prior to their isolation of them, and the skilled worker would attribute all the activity of the known secretions and extracts, such as von Euler\u2019s prostaglandin, to the presence of PGEa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">On the other hand, the examiner pointed out that the art knew full well that <em>something </em>in impure form existed in von Euler\u2019s prostaglandin which possessed smooth muscle-stimulating, blood pressure-lowering activity. She apparently tiiought that claiming <em>that </em>something in terms of a newly discovered formula or structure in a manner sufficiently broad to dominate it wherever and however found, including the impure form in the known semi-purified extracts of von Euler, would not make that claimed subject matter new because workers in the art in fact already had possession of it as claimed that broadly, albeit they did not know precisely what its structure was and had not given it the name appellants have given it. See In re King, 107 F.2d 618, 27 CCPA 754 (1939). The examiner\u2019s position seems to have been, in other words, that \u201ca rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-15\">IVe need not further discuss the merits of appellants\u2019 argument, or the examiner\u2019s position as reiterated by the solicitor here, in light of appellants\u2019 agreement with the board\u2019s finding that the claims are directed to pure, rather than impure, PGEa and PGE3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">. That such is the case is clear, we think, from House Report No. 1923 and Senate Report No. 1979, 82ncl Congress, 2nd Session, accompanying H.R. 7794 which became the 1952 Patent Act. Both reports state in identical language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-8\">Section 101 sets forth the subject matter that can be patented, \u201csubject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d The conditions under which a patent may be obtained follow, <em>and section 102 covers the conditions relating to novelty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-9\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-10\">Section 102 in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) repeats the conditions in the existing law <em>relating to novelty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-11\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-12\"><em>Section 102, in general, may he said to describe the statutory novelty reguired for patentability, and includes, in effect, an amplification and definition of \u201cnew\u201d in section 101. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1465-17\">The revision notes to section 101 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnY_\">The corresponding section of existing statute [RS 4886] is split into two sections, section 101 relating to the subject matter for which patents may be obtained, and <em>section 102 defining statutory novelty </em>and stating other conditions for patentability.
