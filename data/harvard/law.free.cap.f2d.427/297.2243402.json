Harry Tice was served with the summons and complaint at his home in New Jersey. Pride Manuafacturing, Inc. (Pride), a Texas corporation and holder of the challenged patents, Billy J. Graham, a Texas resident and Pride\u2019s president, and National Pride of Texas, Inc., a Texas corporation and an independent distributor of Pride, were joined as defendants and served by registered mail in Texas and by personal service upon Tice, as their \u201cauthorized agent.\u201d The three nonresident defendants moved for dismissal of the complaint against them for several reasons, including lack of jurisdiction over them; these motions were granted on the basis of lack of jurisdiction by a District Court order of July 1, 1969. Only the dismissal as to Pride is before us on this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">Because Tice was not authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process in New Jersey for Pride, F.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (3), Bernardi predicates the validity of its service upon the law of New Jersey. F.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (7) and 4(e); see 2 J. Moore, Federal Practice, ff 4.32 [1], at 1226 n. 2 (2d Ed. 1967). New Jersey Civil Prac. Rules, R.R. 4:4-4(d) [now R. 4:4-4(c) (1)] provides that where service upon a foreign corporation cannot be made by personal service upon an officer, agent or servant located within the state, service may be made \u201csubject to due process, by mailing the summons and complaint to * * * its principal place of business, or to its registered office.\u201d This Rule recognizes no limitations on extraterritorial service other than that imposed by the United States Constitution. E. g., Roland v. Modell\u2019s Shoppers World, Inc., 92 N.J.Super. 1, 7, 222 A.2d 110, 113 (App.Div.1966). Therefore, the question presented in this appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>whether the United States Constitution would permit New Jersey or federal courts in New Jersey to exercise jurisdiction over Pride. See Partin v. Michaels Art Bronze Co., 202 F.2d 541, 543 (3rd Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The constitutional power of states to assert jurisdiction over non-resident corporations has been discussed in a multitude of cases and articles. Although no precise test has been devised for ascertaining the limits of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction, four Supreme Court eases do provide us with the governing principles. In International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), the Court held that while \u201cthe casual presence of the corporate agent or even his conduct of single or isolated items of activities in a state in the corporation\u2019s behalf\u201d would not be sufficient to allow the state to assert jurisdiction over the foreign corporation, <em>id. </em>at 317, 66 S.Ct. 159, jurisdiction would lie if the corporation had \u201ccertain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 66 S.Ct. at 158. The Court found that the \u201csystematic and continuous\u201d shipment of orders into the state, which orders had resulted from solicitation within the state by the defendant\u2019s salesmen, together with a liability arising out of those activities (unpaid contributions to the state unemployment compensation fund based on the salesmen\u2019s commissions) provided the necessary \u201cminimum contacts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 66 S.Ct. 154. In Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 72 S.Ct. 413, 96 L.Ed. 485 (1952), the Court held that jurisdiction would lie over a foreign corporation, even though the liability sued upon did not arise within the state, where the corporation\u2019s activities within the state included directors\u2019 meetings, business correspondence, banking, stock transfers, payment of salaries, and purchasing of machinery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957), the Court, noting the decreased burden in defending a suit away from home, held a corporation amenable to process in a state where it had never conducted business because the contract sued upon \u201chad substantial connection with that State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 78 S.Ct. at 201. Finally, in Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958), after reasserting the \u201cterritorial limitations on the power of the respective States\u201d to assert personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants, <em>id. </em>at 251, 78 S.Ct. at 1238, the Court summarized the <em>International Shoe </em>test, as it had developed, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cThe unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State. The application of that rule will vary with the quality and nature of the defendant\u2019s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1239-1240.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Professor Currie has generalized this <em>Hanson </em>test as requiring \u201cthat the defendant must have taken voluntary action calculated to have an effect in the forum state.\u201d Currie, The Growth of the Long Arm: Eight Years of Extended Jurisdiction in Illinois, 1963 U.Ill.L.F. 515, 549, quoted with approval, Rosenblatt v. American Cyanamid Co., 86 S.Ct. 1, 4, 15 L.Ed.2d 39, 44 (1965) (Goldberg, J., as single Justice denying motion for stay).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Under these cases, therefore, it is necessary to examine the record to determine if the cause of action had a \u201csubstantial connection\u201d with New Jersey under <em>McGee </em>or if Pride \u201cpurposefully avail [ed] itself of the privilege of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ducting activities\u201d in New Jersey under <em>Hanson.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Pride is a manufacturer of automatic car wash equipment and supplies. Its office and factory are located in Texas, as are its records and principal officers. Pride\u2019s products are distributed in Texas and several other states by independently owned and operated distributors, who purchase the products from Pride at a discount for resale to the ultimate users. Pride has no distributor in New Jersey, although a Pennsylvania distributor of its products is authorized to sell in parts of New Jersey. Neither Pride nor its distributors have ever sold any of Pride\u2019s products in New Jersey or for use in New Jersey, and there has been no solicitation of prospective purchasers in New Jersey. There is no evidence that any of Pride\u2019s officers or employees has ever visited New Jersey, other than three \u201csocial\u201d visits by its president on Tice, during which visits no contacts were made with potential customers or distributors. Indeed, the agreement under which Tice was employed to work for Pride was orally made in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On this record, the only connection of Pride with New Jersey is Tice, whose home, which also serves as his office, is located there. Tice is Pride\u2019s exclusive \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s representative\u201d for the northeastern states, including New Jersey. In this capacity he endeavors to locate suitable distributors for Pride\u2019s products by telephone calls from his home and elsewhere and by personal visits. Names of potential distributors are submitted by Tice to Pride at its offices in Texas, Tice having no power to bind Pride to any contract. The distributors, once approved, submit their orders either directly to Pride or to Pride through Tice. Tice is not an employee of Pride, conducting his solicitation of distributors entirely independently of Pride; he determines which states and cities to visit and what time to devote to solicitation, pays his own expenses without reimbursement, and is free to enter into any other agreements regarding his services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tice receives a commission on all sales made to distributors in his assigned area; no other salary or corporate benefits are extended him by Pride. His only solicitation in New Jersey on behalf of Pride was a preliminary contact with a friend, from which solicitation no firm offer resulted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tice made no sales of Pride\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>products in New Jersey and he received no commissions for sales made in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Bernardi, a Pennsylvania corporation with offices and factory in Pennsylvania, also manufactures automatic car wash equipment. In support of its unfair competition claim, affidavits of two of its distributors were submitted. One distributor, located in Washington, D. C., stated that he had been approached in Washington, D. C., Illinois, and Maryland by Tice and possibly Graham, and told that Bernardi had \u201cstolen\u201d Pride\u2019s patents, but that \u201cBernardi has not lost one sale from me as a result of these representations.\u201d The other distributor, located in New York, was told in New York by Tice that Bernardi was infringing Pride\u2019s patents. He stated his belief that his one New York purchaser of Pride equipment may have been influenced by Tice\u2019s representation of Bernardi\u2019s infringement of Pride\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Bernardi makes no claim in this appeal that the cause of action had any substantial connection with New Jersey.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, it argues that the solicitation by Tice through phone calls originating from New Jersey of distributors in other states <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on behalf of Pride gave Pride the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d required for assertion of jurisdiction. We find this argument without merit. Even aside from Tice\u2019s complete independence from Pride,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there is nothing in the record to indicate that any of Tice\u2019s activities on behalf of Pride had any effect in New Jersey whatever.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pride has not \u201cpur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>posefully avail [ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities [in New Jersey],\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and thus neither the state courts nor the federal court in New Jersey can assert jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The District Court\u2019s July 1,1969, order dismissing the action as to Pride for lack of jurisdiction over it will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\">. No appeal was taken from the dismissal of the complaint as to National Pride of Texas, Inc. The appeal taken from the dismissal of the complaint as to Billy J. Graham was withdrawn on March 10, 1970, after oral argument before this court. The District Court order of July 1, 1969, was subsequently \u201crevised <em>nuno pro tuno\" </em>as of July 1, 1969, to contain the certificatio n provided for in F.R.Civ. P. 54(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\">. The president of the corporation resided in the forum State and conducted the affairs of the corporation for a period from his home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 47 (Proposed Official Draft, 1967) suggests these criteria :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">\u201c(1) A state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over a foreign corporation which does business in the state with respect to causes of action arising from the business done in the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201c(2) A state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over a foreign corporation which does business in the state with respect to causes of action that do not arise from the business done in the state if this business is so continuous and substantial as to make it reasonable for the state to exercise such jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Comment a to \u00a7 47 defines \u201cdoing business\u201d as \u201cdoing a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary profit, or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act for such purpose with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Professors von Mehren and Trautman suggest a more functional methodology, \u201cby directing attention to the relationship of the parties and of the controversy to the forum, and by taking other litigational and enforcement considerations into account.\u201d Von Mehren &amp; Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 1122, 1166 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b364-13\">. Tice also represents a manufacturer of prefabricated steel buildings in a capacity similar to his position with Pride.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-14\">. Bernardi submitted an affidavit from a New Jersey purchaser of its equipment, stating that such purchaser\u2019s operations had been shown by Tice to \u201ca customer for car wash equipment.\u201d Tice stated that it was possible that, prior to his employment with Pride, he may have taken the same friend to the car wash who was later informally solicited for a Pride distributorship, but this admission, together with the affidavit, does not establish sufficient evidence of New Jersey conduct to serve as a basis for jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Pride. See Transo Envelope Co. v. Murray Envelope Co., 227 F.Supp. 240 (D.N. J.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. If Bernardi\u2019s affidavits support jurisdiction of Pride in a foreign forum at all, see Transo Envelope Co. v. Murray Envelope Co., <em>supra </em>note 5, based on the damage incurred, the proper forum would appear to be New York. See Nugey v. Paul-Lewis Laboratories, Inc., 132 F.Supp. 448 (S.D.N.Y.1955); Singer v. Walker, 21 A.D.2d 285, 250 N.Y.S.2d 216 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. Throughout its brief, Bernardi asserts that Tice, by telephone calls from or to New Jersey, \u201cregularly solicited, induced and for all practical purposes, consummated sales\u201d of Pride products to its distributors. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support this contention. Once distributors (admittedly solicited by Tice) had been accepted by Pride, their orders depended on the needs of their customers. Tice did accept orders from the distributors as a \u201cconvenience\u201d to them, but there is no evidence of sales promotion by him other than the preliminary negotiations leading to a distributorship contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. Numerous cases have held that the activity of a distributor, under strict control of a foreign corporation, can form the basis for assertion of jurisdiction over that corporation. E. g., Florio v. Powder Power Tool Corp., 248 F.2d 367 (3rd Cir. 1957); Volkswagen Interamericana, S. A. v. Rohlsen, 360 F.2d 437 (1st Cir. 1967); Sanders Associates, Inc. v. Galion Iron Works &amp; Mfg. Co., 304 F.2d 915 (1st Cir. 1962); Fiat Motor Co. v. Alabama Imported Cars, Inc., 110 U.S.App.D.C. 252, 292 F.2d 745 (D.C.Cir. 1961). However, the control must be substantial, at least in cases where the cause of action does not arise within the state: \u201cIf activity by a distributor over whom there is no control other than a mutual right to discontinue the distributorship is to be regarded as on behalf of the defendant, state lines will essentially cease to exist for every manufacturer whose goods move in interstate commerce.\u201d Venus Wheat Wafers, Inc. v. Venus Foods, Inc., 174 F.Supp. 633, 636 (D.Mass.1959); accord, Air Devices, Inc. v. Titus Mfg. Corp., 167 F.Supp. 1 (D.N.J.1958), aff\u2019d per curiam, 269 F.2d 837 (3rd Cir. 1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b365-15\">. In states with stricter- jurisdictional standards than New Jersey, it has been held that solicitation without more is insufficient to establish jurisdiction. E. g., Fraley v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry., 294 F.Supp. 1193 (W.D.Pa.1969); Metropolitan Staple Corp. v. Samuel Moore &amp; Co., 278 F.Supp. 85 (S.D.N.Y.1967). <em>Compare, </em>e. g., Corporate Development Specialists, Inc. v. Warren-Teed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 102 N.J.Super. 143, 245 A.2d 517 (App.Div.1968). Applying New Jersey\u2019s standard, solicitation in New Jersey leading to relationships with a foreign corporation outside New Jersey might permit a. constitutional assertion of jurisdiction, but only because the New Jersey residents solicited are affected. Oliff v. Kiamesha Concord, Inc., 106 N.J. Super. 121, 254 A.2d 330 (Law Div.1969) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>(by active solicitation in New Jersey, through brochures and travel agents, New York resort \u201cseeks to profit from the resident of the forum state,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 126, 254 A.2d at 332); see Fraley v. Chesapeake <em>&amp; </em>O. Ry., 397 F.2d 1 (3rd Cir. 1968). The writing of letters, the making of phone calls, or the transfer of documents from the forum state to persons outside the forum does not affect the state. See Purdy Co. v. Argentina, 333 F.2d 95 (7th Cir. 1964); Chassis-Trak, Inc. v. Federated Purchaser, Inc., 179 F.Supp. 780, 781 (D.N.J.1960); Webb v. Stanker &amp; Galetto, Inc., 84 N.J.Super. 178, 201 A.2d 387 (App.Div.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b366-23\">. Hanson v. Denckla, supra; see, e. g., Japan Gas Lighter Ass\u2019n v. Ronson Corp., 257 F.Supp. 219, 229-236 (D.N.J.1966). It can be possible that once Tice begins an active campaign of solicitation in New Jersey, Pride may avail itself of the privilege of conducting business in New Jersey. But the more existence of that possibility is, of course, no basis for the assertion of jurisdiction. See DeLear v. Rozel Packing Corp., 95 N.J.Super. 344, 231 A.2d 232 (App.Div.1967) (possibility that foreign creditor may have to avail itself of New Jersey\u2019s protections to secure collateral located in New Jersey does not establish sufficient contact for <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
