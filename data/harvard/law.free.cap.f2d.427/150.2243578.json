United States, 1969, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57, Part I, the conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4744(a) (2) cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">The district court charged the jury upon the statutory presumption growing out of the possession of marihuana provided for in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a. For this reason, the convictions under this- section cannot be sustained in the present posture of the case. <em>Leary, </em>Part II. The possibility remains however that upon retrial, convictions may be obtained for violation of \u00a7 176a. The only effect of <em>Leary </em>upon this section was the invalidation of the presumption arising from possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">The appellants contend that all counts of the indictment should be dismissed on the ground that the warrant-less border search was unconstitutional. This argument has been previously advanced to this Court in United States v. Briones, 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 742; and Ramirez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1959, 263 F.2d 385. In light of those cases we hold that the search of the appellant\u2019s automobile and seizure of the marihuana was not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-18\">The decision of the district court admitting into evidence the seized marihuana is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-19\">The case is reversed and remanded for retrial on counts 1 and 2 of the indictment and dismissed as to count 3.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
