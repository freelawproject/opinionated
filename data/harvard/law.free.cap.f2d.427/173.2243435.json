Byrne, Senior United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b238-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Portillo, a federal prisoner, sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court, concluding that an evidentiary hearing was not required, denied Portillo\u2019s petition, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">On August 3, 1967, Portillo pleaded guilty to the offense proscribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4724(a). At the time of his plea, he was represented by counsel. He was awarded the mandatory minimum sentence of five years confinement with the court\u2019s recommendation \u201cthat he receive treatment as a narcotic addict at a Public Health Institution.\u201d The guilty plea was entered after the Government filed a superseding Information charging the offense to which the plea was entered. He was first charged with having violated the provisions of 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 174. Since he had previously been convicted of a similar offense, the court would have been required, had Portillo been convicted under that section, to prescribe a minimum period of confinement of not less than ten years. In his section 2255 petition, Portillo made several contentions, only three of which are worthy of mention. These were to the effect that he was inadequately represented by counsel, that he was incompetent to enter his plea of guilty because he was suffering from narcotic withdrawal symptoms at the time, and that the District Court inadequately advised him of the consequences of his plea. We have carefully examined the record, and it wholly belies these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-18\">It appears that the efforts of Portillo\u2019s attorney were not only conscientious but also most beneficial to his client. It is obvious that it was through the attorney\u2019s efforts that the court, over the Government\u2019s initial objection, permitted a substitution of an accusation which allowed the court to award a more lenient sentence than would have, in the beginning, been possible. With reference to this, there was an extended colloquy between the court and counsel in open court and at a time when Portillo was present. During this colloquy, and after the supplemental Information was filed, the court specifically advised Portillo that if he pleaded guilty, he \u201ccould be sent to prison for a period of twenty years * * *.\u201d The court further advised the accused that he \u201ccould not receive the benefit of either probation or parole * * In the course of the colloquy, the court acceded to the request of Portillo\u2019s counsel that there be a recess in order that the attorney might more fully explain the proceedings to his client. Portillo twice stated to the court with respect to the consequences of his plea, \u201cI understand now.\u201d When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>court inquired, \u201cIs this plea now on your part voluntary?\u201d, Portillo replied, \u201cYes, it\u2019s voluntary.\u201d The record reveals a much more searching inquiry by the sentencing judge, as well as more solicitous explanation, than that approved by our court\u2019s majority opinion in Hodge v. United States, 414 F.2d 1040 (9th Cir. 1969). Finally, Portillo was questioned specifically concerning his physical condition. While he indicated that he was then feeling somewhat ill, he adamantly insisted that his judgment was not in any way impaired. Furthermore, his attorney informed the court that Portillo had been able to \u201ccommunicate * * * very satisfactorily.\u201d See Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (May 4, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">From the whole record, we conclude, as did the District Court, that Portillo knowingly and intelligently entered his plea after having been fully advised of its consequences and that he was adequately, if not more than adequately, represented by competent counsel at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
