He has not done so. Nonetheless, examination of the file and record prompts the conclusion that the single question presented is so unsubstantial as not to warrant further argument. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed for the reasons stated in its Order (D.Colo.1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
