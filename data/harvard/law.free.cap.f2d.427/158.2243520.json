Given this right of sale, the court found that the leasehold in itself had no value on the open market.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-27\">The District Court also found that appellant had failed to prove loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>net profits with sufficient certainty, since the evidence he offered was confined largely to estimates of gross yield per acre, without regard to rent and other production expenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">After reviewing the record before us we find ourselves in agreement with the District Court. Certainly its findings were not clearly erroneous. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-13\">. Under Idaho law, special damages must be established \u201cwith reasonable certainty.\u201d Harrington v. Hadden, 69 Idaho 22, 27, 202 P.2d 236, 238-239 (1949). In Williams v. Bone, 74 Idaho 185, 189, 259 P.2d 810, 812 (1953), it was held that evidence of expected gross income, without any showing of deductions for costs and production expenses, was insufficient to establish loss of net profits. Under these cases appellant here failed to sustain his burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
