It recited :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">\u201c* * * Licensor represents that he has invented certain new and useful improvements in the art of extracting juice and peel oil from citrus fruit, for which he has filed the following applications for U.

On July 16, 1946, the individual plaintiffs assigned to The Exchange National Bank all their right, title and interest in the proceeds to be derived by them from such License Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Pipkin and Henry L. Smith made a joint invention which related to an improved mechanism for rapidly feeding whole citrus fruit into an automatic whole citrus fruit juice and peel oil extractor. Smith assigned his entire interest in such invention to PMC. Application for such patent was filed on February 1, 1947. The patent issued on December 23, 1952, as No. 2,622,733. Its expiration date was December 23, 1969. FMC exercised its option, referred to above, to have \u201cthe terms of this agreement * * * extended to include and apply to such\u201d patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">It clearly appears that after May 20, 1964, FMC used or employed in any way only the inventions embodied in the claims of expired patents. It did not use or employ after that date any of the inventions embodied in the claims of No. 2,420,680, No. 2,540,345, or No. 2,622,-733.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">At the hearing on the motion, both plaintiffs and FMC contended that the License Agreement was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The court concluded that the License Agreement was unambiguous; that the term thereof expired February 6, 1968; that FMC did not manufacture, use, lease or sell any machine that embodied or employed the inventions in any of the patents included in the Agreement which had not expired on May 20, 1964, and therefore FMC incurred no obligation to pay royalties after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">The question of whether a contract is unambiguous is one of law for the determination of the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">Where a contract is unambiguous, its interpretation is a question of law, to be determined by the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">By the granting provision of the License Agreement, the term thereof was to terminate at the expiration date of the last U. S. Patent to issue on any of the four applications described in such Agreement, \u201cincluding any substitutes, divisions, continuations or re-issues thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">Patent No. 2,622,733 was an improvement patent. It clearly was not a substitute, division, continuation or reissue of Patent No. 2,540,345, the last patent to expire of the patents issued on such four applications, nor of any of them. Hence, it did not come within the clause last-above quoted and has no relevancy now.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the term of the License Agreement expired February 6, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">The royalty provision of the License Agreement obligated FMC to pay royalties only \u201con each machine manufactured,, used, leased or sold\u201d by it \u201cwhich embodies or employs the inventions comprehended by this agreement.\u201d The machines which FMC manufactured, used, leased or sold after May 20, 1964, were ones which embodied or employed only inventions embraced in the claims of patents which expired on that date. None of such machines embodied or employed inventions which were within the claims of any patent here involved which had not expired on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">The License Agreement granted to FMC \u201cthe <em>exclusive </em>right, license and privilege to manufacture, use, lease and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sell machines embodying or employing the inventions disclosed in the * * * patent applications,\u201d described in such Agreement. (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">When a patent expires, anyone is free to use the invention embodied in its claim or claims. After the expiration of the patent, there can no longer be an exclusive right, license or privilege to use the invention embodied in its claim or claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Moreover, from the provisions of the License Agreement above set out, with respect to patent protection, abatement of royalties, and termination for patent invalidity, it clearly appears that the parties intended that FMC\u2019s obligation to pay royalties was conditioned on patent protection. An expired patent affords no patent protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Absent a clear expression to the contrary in the licensing agreement for the use of the invention embodied in a patent, it will be presumed that the parties did not intend the licensee should pay royalties for such use after the expiration of the patent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The License Agreement not only contained no expression manifesting that the parties intended that FMC should pay royalties for the use of the invention embodied in any one of the patents here involved, after it had expired, but by its provisions affirmatively manifested that they did not so intend.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Moreover, in Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U.S. 29, 32, 85 S.Ct. 176, 179, 13 L.Ed.2d 99, the court held \u201cthat a patentee\u2019s use of a royalty agreement that projects beyond the expiration date of the patent is unlawful <em>per se,\u201d </em>and we should avoid a construction of the License Agreement that would render it invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Since after May 20, 1964, FMC did not manufacture, use, lease or sell any machine that embodied any of the patents embraced in the License Agreement which had not expired, but used only inventions embodied in expired patents, we hold it did not incur any obligation to pay royalties after May 20, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-38\">.
