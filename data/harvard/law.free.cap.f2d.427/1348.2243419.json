Counts one and three charged Ferra with violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) by dispensing and distributing a narcotic not in or from the original stamped container; counts two and four charged him with selling, bartering, exchanging and giving away a narcotic drug in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ferra pleaded not guilty at his arraignment and subsequently filed several pre-trial motions including a motion to dismiss based on the following grounds: (1) The indictment fails to state facts sufficient to constitute an offense against the United States; (2) the statutes in question are unconstitutional. Following the district court\u2019s denial of his motions, Ferra pleaded guilty to counts one and three. His plea of guilty was accepted after careful and cautious interrogation of Ferra by the court in the presence of his counsel. He assured the court that his guilty plea was made freely, voluntarily and understandingly after consultation with his counsel in whom he expressed complete confidence. In our judgment the record clearly shows that the guilty plea was properly accepted by the court. Counts two and four were dismissed. On this appeal, Ferra raises the same basic questions advanced in his motion to dismiss, with the exception that he now relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Turner v. United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to bolster his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>contention that \u00a7 4704(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is unconstitutional. After a careful consideration of these issues, we are convinced that Ferra\u2019s conviction must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">Ferra's first contention, that the counts charging a violation of \u00a7 4704 (a) fail to allege sufficient facts to constitute a crime, is based solely on the fact that the indictment fails to give the name of the transferee to whom the narcotics were dispensed or distributed. The Fifth Circuit has aligned itself with a majority of the circuits which hold that such a failure is not reversible error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The fact that the defendant made a pre-trial discovery motion requesting the name of the transferee does not alter our conclusion. In a related case, Barbee v. United States, where the government refused to supply the name of the victim of a confidence game, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-5\">Although we question the nicety of the government\u2019s lack of cooperation, we find no reversible error. The indictment sufficiently informed the appellants of the nature of their charges even though no victim\u2019s name was mentioned. Mount v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 39, 42-43, cert. den., 379 U.S. 900, 85 S.Ct. 188, 13 L.Ed.2d 175; Rua v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 321 F.2d 140, 141, Cf. Borroto v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 338 F.2d 60; Snowden v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 384 F.2d 357; Escobar v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 388 F.2d 661.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">We would also note that the principal case relied on by Ferra, Lauer v. United States,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was reversed <em>en banc </em>by the Seventh Circuit in Collins v. Markley, where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-14\">We are now informed that the Courts in some twenty-five different cases from six Circuits have considered our decision in Lauer. In none of them has the Lauer decision been approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-15\">We now conclude that we were in error in our decision and holding in Lauer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-16\">In our opinion this excerpt forecloses Ferra\u2019s argument that <em>Lauer </em>is distinguishable from <em>Collins </em>on the ground that in the former the defendant made a pretrial motion for discovery of the transferee\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-17\">Appellant\u2019s attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 4704(a) is two-pronged. His first contention is precisely the same as that raised by the motion to dismiss. In essence, Ferra contends that Congress lacks the constitutional authority to prohibit the dispensing or distribution of a narcotic not in or from the original stamped package. He argues that Congress may only proscribe the <em>sale </em>of a narcotic not in or from an original stamped container. We have examined the authorities cited by appellant and find no support from this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-18\">The second prong of Ferra\u2019s constitutional attack focuses exclusively on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Turner v. United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ferra insists that the Court\u2019s invalidation of the 4704(a) presumption as applied to cocaine requires reversal of his eonvie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>tion. We reject this argument as merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">The defective presumption was not employed in appellant\u2019s conviction. It is important to understand that the Court in the <em>Turner </em>decision did not invalidate the criminal provisions contained in \u00a7 4704(a). Only the evidentiary presumption contained in 4704(a) as applied to cocaine was found unconstitutional,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and as we stated, this presumption was not used in any way in the instant ease. The elements of the crime defined in \u00a7 4704(a) were admitted by Ferra when he pleaded guilty. Except for a vague \u201cdenial of due process\u201d allegation, appellant fails to suggest any way in which his conviction was prejudiced by the unused evidentiary presumption. Similarly, Ferra never intimates that his guilty plea was in any way influenced by the presence of the presumption in 4704 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-8\">Furthermore, considering the nature of the case against Ferra,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we are unable to imagine any way in which the presumption might have influenced his guilty plea. The gravamen of the charges against Ferra was that he sold cocaine to Special Agent Rafael Castillo on two occasions. The formal charges stated that Ferra dispensed and distributed a narcotic drug not in or from the original stamped package. The agent\u2019s testimony alone was sufficient to prove the elements of the crime charged. Use of the presumption in such a situation would be superfluous. The presumption has practical value only where the evidence shows that the defendant merely <em>possessed </em>narcotics. The presumption permits the jury to infer from possession that the defendant was either purchasing, selling, dispensing or distributing a narcotic not in or from the original stamped package. We seriously doubt that the presumption would have been used if the not guilty plea had remained and the instant case had gone to trial. If it were used in our hypothetical situation, it would probably constitute only harmless error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The important point here is that because _ of the evidence against Ferra, the presumption was simply not a factor to be considered in determining whether to enter a plea of guilty. We have endeavored to consider every conceivable way in which Ferra might have been prejudiced by the presumption set out in \u00a7 4704(a). We find none. The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1413-13\">. Only counts one and three are involved in this appeal.
