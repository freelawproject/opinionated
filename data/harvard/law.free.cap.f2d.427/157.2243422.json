No appeal was taken. In this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, petitioner asserts that on the principles announced in Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969) and like cases, with respect to his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, his conviction and sentence should be vacated. Petitioner did not allege that the self-incrimination issue was raised as a defense at the trial of the case. The motion was denied without a hearing. The sole question presented in this appeal then becomes whether the petitioner in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding must affirmatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>allege that he asserted the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination under <em>Leary, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We have held that the privilege against self-incrimination cannot be raised for the first time in post-conviction proceedings. Sepulveda v. United States, 415 F.2d 321 (10th Cir. 1969). The failure to allege that the Fifth Amendment privilege was asserted at the trial is fatal to the petitioner\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hilliard v. United States, 345 F.2d 252 (10th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-14\">. In its order denying the motion, the trial court found that \u201cthe record conclusively shows that petitioner made no plea based on the privilege against self-incrimination. * * * \u201d The record here does not disclose the basis for this finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
