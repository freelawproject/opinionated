This reference, which is acknowledged in appellant\u2019s specification, also sets forth a procedure for preparing ATMP and describes the product as a <em>\u201cglassy solid\" </em>(emphasis added). \u201cGlassy\u201d we take to mean like glass and glasses is an amorphous, i. e., now-crystalline, material.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The Kosolapoff and Bersworth refererences are relied on \u201cas showing crystalline amino phosphonic acids,\u201d and Pikl and Bersworth as showing \u201cthe use of amino substituted phosphonic acids as softeners, sequesterants or chelating agents * * Irani, which is <em>not </em>prior art with respect to appellant\u2019s application, is cited as showing that \u201clittle modification of the Petrov * * * process will produce a crystalline material * *</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">Claim 1 was rejected by the examiner \u201cas obvious under 35 U.S.C. 103 over Petrov et al who disclose amino-tri (methlyenephosphonic acid) which is considered to suggest the instantly claimed material * * Notwithstanding that the examiner, and the board, referred only to Petrov in stating this rejection, it is abundantly clear that significant reliance was and is placed on the Kosolapoff, Pikl, and Bersworth references. Appellants, however, do not now complain of this and we will therefore consider the rejection as applied rather than as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\">The examiner was of the opinion that one skilled in the art knowing of Petrov\u2019s \u201cglassy solid\u201d form of ATMP would be motivated to attempt the preparation of crystalline anhydrous ATMP by the knowledge that some amino phosphonic acids exist in crystalline form (Kosolapoff and Bersworth) and that some amino phosphonic acids are useful as softeners, sequesterants, or chelating agents (Pikl and Bersworth).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-20\">Purporting to place less reliance on the secondary references than did the examiner, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-21\">Despite the fact that the Examiner has referred to three additional patents and one additional publication, the essential point is the obviousness of the \u201ccrystalline anhydrous\u201d form of the claimed compound in view of the Petrov et al. disclosure of \u201ca glassy solid\u201d form of the same compound. As we view the comparative properties in Table 1 * * * of appellants\u2019 specification, * * * the general indication is that the Petrov et al. material is an impure form of amino tri (methylenephosphonic acid). The amorphous appearance, the broad range of melting point, the reduced titration, and the diminished sequestering activity all point to an impure state. The relative dissolution rates have little meaning in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>information concerning particle size, and hygroscopicity is frequently caused by impurities. Color is likewise often the result of impurities. However, we are not convinced that the claimed material is unobvious, inasmuch as it is still a solid product having the same useful property (sequestration) as the Petrov et al. product. It is recognized that Petrov et al. do not refer to sequestration activity, but the property is inherent in the compound whether explicitly described or not. Moreover, the other cited art would clearly suggest sequestering activity for a compound of this nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">Appellants may have devised a process which easily and readily results in a crystalline product, although it is evident from Example 1 of Irani (3,-234,124) that little modification of the Petrov et al. process will produce a crystalline material, but we are here concerned only with the unobviousness of the claimed product over the prior art product. So far as we can ascertain, the claimed material is no more than a purer form of the Petrov et al. product, with no patentably significant change in properties or utility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOq\">* * * the impurity of the Petrov et al. product would be immediately evident to a chemist of no more than ordinary competence. It is also to be noted that the product here claimed does not exhibit any unexpectedly different characteristics as compared with the impure product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Appellants point out that Petrov does not suggest that ATMP could exist in any form other than a glassy solid one, does not disclose any physical or chemical properties of his glassy solid product, does not suggest that it was especially impure, nor suggest any utility for it. Citing In re Lunsford, 357 F.2d 380, 53 CCPA 986 (1966), appellants complain of the board\u2019s use of their application for its disclosure of various properties of Petrov\u2019s product (since none are disclosed in the prior art), and argue that without knowledge of these properties, the impurity of Petrov\u2019s product would not have been evident. It is also contended that \u201cappellants\u2019 material is more than a pure form of Petrov\u2019s material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Appellants concede that the other references show that some aminophosphonic acids can exist in crystalline form and that some can be used as sequesterants. They contend, however, that none of the compounds disclosed in these references is so closely related to ATMP that the two would be expected to have similar properties and that a method for making crystalline anhydrous ATMP would not have been obvious from these references. Appellants further urge that the anhydrous character of their product was unexpected and that its degree of utility as a sequesterant of metal ions was unexpected in comparison with that of Petrov\u2019s product.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">For the reasons stated in <em>Lunsford, </em>supra, we agree with appellants that the board\u2019s use of information which is only to be found in appellants\u2019 application was improper. Furthermore, we are not convinced that without this information, \u201cthe impurity of the Petrov * * * product would be immediately evident to a chemist of no more than ordinary competence.\u201d Moreover, and regardless of whether this would be evident, we are not convinced that the references of record would lead one of ordinary skill in the art to expect that ATMP could exist in a crystalline, anhydrous form or, assuming such an expectation, that the references would render obvious a method by which such ATMP could be produced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To support the first of these conclusions, the Patent Office relies on the following generalization by Kosolapoff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-13\">Primary and secondary phosphonic acids are, as a rule, crystalline sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>stances that have, respectively, dibasic and monobasic functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">This reference goes on to disclose a number of amino alkylenephosphonic acids and their properties. However, all have only one alkylenephosphonic acid radical on the nitrogen atom (compared with three in ATMP), the most similar to ATMP being amino methylenephosphonic acid (\u201cAMP\u201d). Kosolapoff reports that AMP has, inter alia, the following properties: \u201cCrystals, m. over 300\u00b0 (from water); only moderately soluble in cold water.\u201d Pikl also discloses that AMP can be obtained as crystals. As stated above, Bersworth is relied on to show that some amino phosphonic acids are crystalline. This reference, however, is concerned with \u201cN-alkyl-substitutedalkylene polyamine methylene phosphonic acids\u201d which are markedly different in structure from ATMP. In any event, the four phosphonic acids for which Bersworth reports physical properties were described, respectively, as \u201cpartly crystalline,\u201d \u201ccrystalline,\u201d \u201csyrupy,\u201d and \u201cwaxy solid.\u201d Certainly such a disclosure would not provide a basis for predicting with reasonable certainty that ATMP could exist in a crystalline anhydrous form.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Appellants also cited two publications in the Patent Office to show that crystalline, anhydrous ATMP could not have been predicted from what was known in the prior art. Freedman and Doak, Chemical Reviews, Vol. 57, No. 3, p. 484 (1957), outline various methods of synthesizing aminoalkylphosphonic acids and with reference to products obtained with one such method state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">The free aminophosphonic acids * * are colorless, high-melting substances which crystallize from water <em>with one or two molecules of solvent of crystallization. </em>[Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADxt\">Fields, Journal of American Chemical Society, Vol. 74, pp. 1528-1531 (1952), which also discusses methods of preparing substituted amino phosphonic acids states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-11\">It was difficult to obtain the free aminophosphonic acids in pure form. <em>Generally, non-crystallizing hygroscopic sirups resulted. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">Upon due consideration of all these reference disclosures concerning the physical forms in which various known aminophosphonic acids exist, we think the most definite conclusion that can be reached is that some of these acids can be obtained in crystalline form and some cannot, and that of the former group some can be obtained with ease by conventional procedures and some only with great difficulty by specially devised techniques. This being the case, we cannot conclude that it would have been obvious that crystalline, anhydrous ATMP could exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">As stated above, even assuming that one.skilled in the art could have predicted with reasonable certainty that crystalline anhydrous ATMP could be produced, we are not convinced by this record that it would also have been obvious <em>how </em>this could be achieved. We note that neither the examiner nor the board has contended that a suitable process would have been obvious. The closest that either has come to such a contention is the examiner\u2019s statement, based on the disclosure in the Irani patent, that, as it turns out, \u201clittle modification of the Petrov * * * process will produce a crystalline material * * * \u201d Obviousness, however, must not be judged by hindsight, and a \u201clittle modification\u201d can be a most unobvious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">In view of the foregoing we need not consider appellants\u2019 arguments regarding the differences in properties between appellants and Petrov\u2019s forms of ATMP (supra, note 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-18\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. A table in appellants\u2019 application compares the following properties of the two products: physical appearance, hygroscopicity, melting point, rate of dissolution in water, \u201cactive\u201d concentration, sequestration of calcium ions, ease of purification, and ease of milling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-16\">.
