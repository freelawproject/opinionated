The judicially approved school desegregation plan, with the acceptance of both parties in the court below, was ordered into effect on May 19, 1969. Petitioners did not seek to intervene until October 16, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">This court cannot say that the representation afforded by the United States Attorney General for the black students and parents of Carroll County was inadequate as a matter of law, thus allowing intervention as a matter of right. Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">Moreover, the finding by the district court that the motion to intervene was not timely filed in view of the present posture of the case does not evidence an abuse of discretion requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">Accordingly, the motion of ProposedIntervenors for summary reversal of the order of the district court is denied and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
