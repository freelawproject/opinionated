P &amp; G challenged the validity of the patents and sought attorneys\u2019 fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The district court held that P &amp; G used the processes claimed by the patents for more than a year before Chemithon filed its applications, and that its use was public within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). Consequently, the court held the patents invalid. It also held that P &amp; G had not misappropriated Chemithon\u2019s trade secrets, but it denied P &amp; G\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. In reaching these conclusions the district judge applied correct principles of law to findings of fact that are amply supported by the evidence. Finding neither error nor abuse of discretion, we affirm on the opinion of the district court. Chemithon Corp. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 287 F.Supp. 291 (D.Md.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
