The District Court remanded the action to the state court because of appellant\u2019s apparent failure to comply with a District Court order that he file proof that he had served a copy of his petition for removal on the State of California. Schneider now appeals from the order remanding his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-25\">Upon examination of the record, we conclude that appellant fully complied with the District Court\u2019s order, and that the District Court had jurisdiction of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-26\">Proceeding to the merits of the petition, we determine that appellant is not entitled to relief. He alleges that the California state statute under which he has been prosecuted violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>Amendment to the United States Constitution by permitting \u201cdifferent punishments for the same acts, committed under the same circumstances, by persons in like situation.\u201d Nothing in the Constitution requires that persons convicted of the same crime receive identical penalties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-5\">\u201cAll murderers do not die, nor is every speeder arrested, or if fined, fined a similar amount.. Disparity of sentences is the subject of much discussion these days but no one has suggested that the discretion of the trial judge as to the sentences to be given in all cases should be eliminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Marcella v.
