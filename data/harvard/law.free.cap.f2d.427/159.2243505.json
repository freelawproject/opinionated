The case was tried by the district court without a jury, and at the conclusion of Krodel\u2019s evidence the court found against Krodel and in favor of the defendants on the ground that Krodel had failed to carry his burden of proof of the alleged fraud and deceit. The court announced from the bench its findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-25\">We have carefully considered the record, briefs and oral argument and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
