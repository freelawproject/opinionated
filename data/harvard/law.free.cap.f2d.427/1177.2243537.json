Plaintiff was substituted as party-plaintiff when claimant died during the pendency of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-27\"> If there is substantial supporting evidence on the record as a whole for the Secretary\u2019s decision, that decision will not be overturned. Laws v. Celebrezze, 368 F.2d 640 (4 Cir. 1966). Here, there is medical evidence which indicates that, although claimant\u2019s August 9, 1960, heart attack restricted his activities to some extent, it did not result in heart enlargement, irregular heart rhythm, heart murmurs or significant heart impairment. Claimant stated to the Veterans\u2019 Administration physician that his doctor had told him he could do eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>hours of light work per day. In short, there is ample evidence to support the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that claimant made a normal and satisfactory recovery from his heart attack and that the residuals of this condition would not have prevented claimant from engaging in substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">On this record the Secretary\u2019s denial of disability benefits will not be disturbed. The judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
