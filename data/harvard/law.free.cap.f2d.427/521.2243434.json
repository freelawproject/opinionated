Appellant has sought exemption from the draft repeatedly and on various grounds. He first claimed exemption because of dependency of his mother and sister, and was for a time classified 3-A. He subsequently filed for conscientious objector status, was granted 1-0 classification, and ordered to report for civilian work. Thereafter he refused to comply with such order, and informed his Selective Service Board that he had married and that his wife had undergone brain surgery prior to marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">When the Board declined to reopen his case, appellant refused to report for work at a hospital designated by the Board. Following his conviction for violation of <em>50 </em>U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), <em>the </em>District Judge suspended imposition of sentence and placed appellant on probation for a period of thirty months on condition that he would accept employment for a period of twenty-four consecutive months at the hospital previously designated by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">The history of appellant\u2019s case before the Selective Service Board is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">January 22, 1964 \u2014 Classified 1-A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agn\">April 15, 1964 \u2014 Notified Board of dependency of mother and sister; reclassified 3-A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7B\">August 10, 1965 \u2014 Notified Board of mother\u2019s dependency; sister now employed; continued in 3-A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZu\">February 10, 1966 \u2014 Reclassified from 3-A to 1-A; apparently no appeal taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aam\">April 4, 1966 \u2014 Filed for conscientious objector status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">April 13, 1966 \u2014 Reclassified 1-A; appeal taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKd\">July 22, 1967 \u2014 Married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALy\">August 16, 1967 \u2014 Informed Board of marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag8\">September 29, 1967 \u2014 Classified 1-0 by Appeal Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGF\">November 24, 1967 \u2014 Notified Board that he could not accept civilian work because of hardship to family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2L\">December 5, 1967 \u2014 Informed Board of dependency of mother and wife, and of wife\u2019s brain operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP-\">December 6, 1967 \u2014 Board advised Baird that his case would not be reopened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnY\">January 16, 1968 \u2014\u25a0 Baird appeared before Board and said he could not accept civilian work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aud\">September 10, 1968 \u2014 Ordered to report to hospital on September 20, 1968.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Appellant argues first that the Board acted arbitrarily in reclassifying him from 3-A to 1-A in February, 1966. The Board\u2019s action was based on evidence that appellent lived in a household with his mother and sister; that his sister was out of school and working; that his mother had earnings from part-time work; and that another sister and her husband had moved into the home and both had jobs. Clearly, there was substantial basis in fact for the Board\u2019s action; that being so, it is not within a court\u2019s prerogative to interfere. Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellant also contends that the Board arbitrarily and wrongfully refused to reopen his case in December, 1967, to consider his claim to a 3-A classification (extreme hardship to dependents). This argument is based primarily on the fact that appellant had informed the Board that his wife had undergone brain surgery prior to their marriage, and that she was unable to work. The only evidence before the Board about the wife\u2019s operation was appellant\u2019s own statement. He did not submit this information until after he had been requested to select a civilian work assignment and even then he failed to furnish any written information to substantiate a claim of dependency. He did not request or file a dependency form. There was nothing before the Board to show the nature or seriousness of the brain surgery or the extent of disability. Appellant was permitted to appear personally before the Board and its action was taken after due consideration of the information he presented. There was basis in fact for the Board\u2019s action and the failure to reopen did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">It is argued in conclusion that the judgment should be reversed because appellant was denied the assistance of legal counsel before the Board. No effort was made by appellant to have assistance of counsel before the Board and this question is raised here for the first time. Reliance is placed on the recent case of United States v. Weller, 309 F.Supp. 50 (N.D.Cal.1969), review granted, 397 U.S. 985, 90 S.Ct. 1118, 25 L.Ed.2d 394, which holds that the regulation denying a registrant the right of counsel before a draft board [32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1624.1 (b)] is invalid. Prior to Weller, several circuits had held to the contrary. Haven v. United States, 403 F.2d 384 (9th Cir. 1969); Merritt v. United States, 401 F.2d 768 (5th Cir. 1968); Fults v. United States, 395 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1968); Nickerson v. United States, 391 F.2d 760 (10th Cir. 1968). Since this question was not raised before the Board or the District Court, we decline to decide it on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
