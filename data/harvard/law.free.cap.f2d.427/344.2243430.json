We now do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">The Company distributed two pre-election publications along with the letter of February 9, 1967. One publication was entitled \u201cAn Important Message for You.\u201d Inside, there were reproductions of newspaper articles depicting strike violence along with statements reading: \u201cInnocent People Suffer Most,\u201d \u201cNo Value on Human Lives,\u201d \u201cWeeks Without Pay,\u201d \u201cInvestigation,\u201d \u201cDouble Cross\u201d and \u201cThousands Idled.\u201d The other pamphlet was entitled \u201cWhat The Union Can Do For You\u201d and contained only blank pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">We agree with petitioner that neither of these two publications can be raised to the level of an 8(a) (1) violation. The publication entitled \u201cAn Important Message For You\u201d is permissible, though strong propaganda. There is no indication that the events depicted were not true or misrepresented. This publication is nothing more than a pessimistic prediction of what the employer thought unionism would lead to. Such predictions, within limits, are allowable. Southwire Company v. N.L.R.B., 5th Cir. 1967, 383 F.2d 235. The pamphlet entitled \u201cWhat The Union Can Do For You\u201d was nothing more than a comic attempt at propaganda. Therefore, in regard to these and like publications the Board\u2019s order to cease and desist does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Likewise, the petitioner\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s cease and desist order is too broad is well taken. The Board order calls for the Company to cease violations of the Act \u201cin any other manner.\u201d As in Southwire Company v. N.L.R.B., <em>supra,, </em>the record does not warrant such prohibition of future conduct. We therefore limit the Board\u2019s Order to cease and desist to conduct of a \u201clike or related manner\u201d to that previously found to be violative of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The other points raised by petitioner do not merit reconsideration. Therefore, it is ordered that the petition for rehearing filed in the above entitled and numbered cause be and the same is hereby denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
