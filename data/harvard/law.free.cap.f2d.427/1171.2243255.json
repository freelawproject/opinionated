L. &amp; T.), United Loan and Investment Company and Savings Guaranty Corporation (Savings) to settle a claim against Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, the fidelity bond carrier of A. L. &amp; T. and Savings. The facts involved in this dispute are reported at 297 F.Supp. 73 and need not be discussed here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-27\">The appellants claim that the trial court incorrectly interpreted the fidelity bond involved in this case, and therefore erred in approving the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number> Any action by a trial court in supervising an equity receiver is committed to his sound discretion and will not be disturbed unless there is a clear showing of abuse. In re Albert Harris, Inc., 6 Cir., 313 F.2d 447, 449; In re California Associated Products Co., 9 Cir., 183 F.2d 946, 949; MacDonald v. Aetna Indemnity Co., 88 Conn. 571, 92 A. 154, 157; Gordon v. Hartford Sterling Co., 319 Pa. 174, 179 A. 234, 237-238. Under this rule, we need not pass on the merits of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the bond beyond a finding that there has been no abuse of discretion. We have reviewed the record in this case and find. no abuse of discretion in the approval of the receiver\u2019s settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The judgment of the trial court approving the settlement is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1235-28\">.
