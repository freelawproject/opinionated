The only question remaining for our consideration, therefore, is whether or not the marks of the parties, as applied to the related goods, are so similar as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-26\">The testimony in the record bears out the fact that there is no evidence of actual confusion in the past between the marks \u201cVitafoam\u201d and \u201cVitalon\u201d. Further, it appears that Vitalon products are sold directly to manufacturers or distributors or jobbers who, in turn, resell to manufacturers. Such customers would be highly discriminating purchasers in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-27\">Having considered appellant\u2019s argument and reviewed the evidence in the record as stated above, we conclude that the board was correct in holding there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>would be no likelihood of confusion or mistake when the marks are applied to the goods of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-17\">.
