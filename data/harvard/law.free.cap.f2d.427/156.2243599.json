That board rejected his claim. (A Selective Service officer had suggested he do so inasmuch as an appeal was pending from the local board in Karlock\u2019s student classification.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Selective Service having invited him to make such a claim, we conclude Karlock was entitled to some ruling or notice that would have enabled him to request a personal appearance before the local board. This was not done and we regard it as fatal to the conviction for refusing to be inducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">If he was entitled to any consideration of his claim, he was entitled to it at the beginning level, as well as the appellate level. That is all we hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
