He reported on that date, but \u201cqualified\u201d his Security Questionnaire (DD Form 398) by stating that a relative had once been a member of the Communist Party. He was sent home and his local board was notified by an officer at the induction center that his records were being \u201cheld in abeyance\u201d pending the completion of a security investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">On November 6, 1967, defendant filed a Special Form for Conscientious Objection (SSS Form No. 150) with his local board. Eight days later, the local board notified defendant that it had voted not to reopen his classification because \u201cit did not specifically find there has been a change in circumstances over which you had no control,\u201d as required by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 as a condition to the reopening of a classification after the mailing of an induction order. The board further informed defendant that theretofore his induction date had been temporarily postponed \u201c[pjursuant to the provisions of part 1632 of Selective Service Regulations,\u201d but that he was to report for induction on December 6,1967. Defendant reported and refused to submit to induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\"> 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.2 authorized the local board to postpone defendant\u2019s induction for a period of up to 120 days. Instead the board postponed defendant\u2019s induction indefinitely \u2014 as it turned out, for a period of 328 days. The board\u2019s action had the effect of cancelling the induction order. <em>See </em>Hamilton v. Commanding Officer, 328 F.2d 799, 802 (9th Cir. 1964). <em>Compare </em>United States v. Evans, 425 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1970), which does not cite <em>Hamilton, </em>and may be distinguishable on the ground that the local board did not purport to act under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.2 as the local board did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-19\">The local board therefore erred in applying 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 and refusing to reopen defendant\u2019s classification to consider his conscientious objector claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-20\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
