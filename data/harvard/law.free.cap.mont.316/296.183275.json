We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether Hendricks\u2019 constitutional and statutory rights were violated when he was held for more than 72 hours without bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in relying on hearsay testimony in determining that Hendricks violated the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">\u00b65 On June 27, 1996, Hendricks was charged by amended information with theft, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA (1995). Hendricks pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced on February 29, 2000, to a commitment of five years to the Department of Corrections, with all time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">\u00b66 A petition for revocation of suspended sentence, with supporting affidavit and report of violation, was filed on June 18,2001. Probation and Parole Officer Michael Touchette (Touchette) alleged in his report that Hendricks had violated the conditions of his suspended sentence by failing to report to Touchette since April 27, 2001, and by faffing to keep Touchette informed of Hendricks\u2019 whereabouts. Hendricks answered \u201cnot true\u201d to the alleged violations at an answer hearing held on August 23, 2001. At that time, the District Court, in and for Cascade County, ordered Hendricks\u2019 bail to remain at $10,000. On August 27, 2001, the District Court reduced Hendricks\u2019 bail to $2,500 and authorized Hendricks\u2019 release on bond. Hendricks posted the bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>on September 2, 2001, and was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b67 On September 5, 2001, Hendricks was arrested in Missoula County for driving with a revoked license, leaving a property damage accident, assault of a detention officer, and theft of the truck he was driving. Bond was set at $20,000. However, when appearing at the revocation hearing in Cascade County on October 31,2001, Hendricks asserted that a \u201cno-bond hold\u201d had been placed upon him by Touchette which prohibited Hendricks from posting bail and obtaining release from the Missoula County detention center. Neither the Cascade County Attorney nor the District Court had any knowledge about the no-bond hold, and no documentation of the hold was in the court file, or provided by Hendricks. A discussion ensued among the parties at the hearing, and the District Court then ordered that any no-bond hold be released. Hendricks asserted he had not appeared before a magistrate between September 5, 2001, and October 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b68 No witness testimony was offered about the no-bond hold during the revocation hearing. Touchette testified, but neither the State nor Hendricks\u2019 attorney asked Touchette any questions about the probation hold. Neither did Hendricks testify or produce any evidence regarding the probation hold. Hendricks did not move the District Court to dismiss the petition to revoke his suspended sentence or request the District Court to rule that the no-bond hold violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b69 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court revoked Hendricks\u2019 suspended sentence and sentenced him to five years to the Department of Corrections with credit for time served. Hendricks now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b610 Were Hendricks\u2019 constitutional and statutory rights violated when he was held for more than 72 hours without bond?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b611 Hendricks claims the he was denied his constitutional right to due process and his right against excessive bail when he was held on the probationary, no-bond hold for more than 72 hours. Section 46-23-1012(3), MCA, authorizes a detention center to hold a probationer without bail for 72 hours and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">(3) A probation and parole officer may authorize a detention center to hold a probationer arrested under this section without bail for 72 hours. Within 72 hours following the probationer\u2019s detention, the probation and parole officer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">(a) authorize the detention center to release the probationer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(b) hold an intervention hearing pursuant to 46-23-1015; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">(c) arrange for the probationer to appear before a magistrate to set bail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b612 According to Hendricks, he was held on the no-bond hold from approximately September 5, 2001, to October 31, 2001, well over the 72-hour limit in \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA. Hendricks asserts that Touchette failed to authorize the detention center to release him or arrange for his appearance before a magistrate to set bail, and consequently, his state and federal constitutional rights were violated, requiring reversal of his sentence revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b613 However, there is no factual record to support these allegations. The State properly counters that Hendricks waived his objection to the asserted violation of his constitutional rights by failing to make an objection during the hearing. Hendricks did not object to the continuation of the hearing or offer a motion to dismiss the proceedings. Relying on our holding in <em>State v. Azure, </em>2002 MT 22, 308 Mont. 201, 41 P.3d 899, the State argues that Hendricks\u2019 failure to adequately raise the issue in the District Court and create a factual record prohibits review of the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b614 It is well settled that we will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal when the appellant has had an opportunity to make an objection in the trial court. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 21, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 21, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 21. \u201cThe reason for the rule is clear: if the defendant has an objection, there is an obligation to call the matter to the court\u2019s attention so the trial judge will have an opportunity to remedy the situation.\u201d <em>State v. Cain </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 509, 514-15, 717 P.2d 15, 19, <em>citing Estelle v. Williams </em>(1976), 425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126. We have held that failure to object in the trial court proceedings constitutes a waiver of the objection, unless the circumstances come within one of the exceptions of \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. <em>Azure, </em>\u00b6 34. Here, Hendricks does not argue that any of those exceptions apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b615 In <em>Azure, </em>the defendant asserted on appeal that his jury had been illegally impaneled. However, Azure had failed to raise an objection in the district court to the manner in which the jury was impaneled, leaving an inadequate record for review by this Court. <em>Azure, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 38. We held that \u201cthis Court\u2019s review of allegations on direct appeal is confined to the record,\u201d <em>Azure, </em>\u00b6 38, and concluded that \u201c[bjecause we cannot determine from the record what procedure the clerk of court used in summoning the jury, we decline to review this issue further.\u201d <em>Azure, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\u00b616  As in <em>Azure, </em>the facts from which we could reach a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>conclusion are not in the record before us because Hendricks did not make an appropriate objection before the District Court. Consequently, we cannot consider the merits of Hendricks\u2019 due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab8\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err in relying on hearsay testimony in determining that Hendricks violated the conditions of his probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b618 Hendricks claims that the State was required to produce witnesses who had observed his drug use firsthand, and could not rely on the hearsay statements of Touchette in the revocation hearing. In his brief, Hendricks\u2019 counsel acknowledges that \u201cthere appears to be no legitimate legal grounds upon which to successfully argue this issue\u201d but that he feels duty bound to give this Court notice of the issue, citing <em>Anders v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b619  Hendricks did not object to Touchette\u2019s testimony at the revocation hearing. \u201cWhen the district court was not give an opportunity to rule on the admission of a statement or to correct itself if admission was not proper, \u2018we will not put the trial court in error where it has not been given such a chance.\u2019\u201d <em>Azure, </em>\u00b6 44, citing <em>State v. Rodgers </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 413, 419, 849 P.2d 1028, 1032. Therefore, we conclude Hendricks waived his right to an appellate review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b620 Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
