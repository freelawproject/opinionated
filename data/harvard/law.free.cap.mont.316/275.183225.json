We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u00b62 Turnsplenty raises the following issue on appeal: whether Turnsplenty\u2019s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">\u00b63 At 10:00 p.m., on January 11, 2001, Officer Jamie Schillinger (Schillinger) was patrolling on Jackson Street in Billings, Montana, when he observed a vehicle turning onto the street in front of him. The vehicle was being driven in an erratic manner, making quick darting maneuvers as it proceeded. The vehicle\u2019s rear license plate light was not illuminated as required by law. At the next intersection, Schillinger observed the vehicle quickly accelerate when the traffic light turned green, and then initiate a left turn onto State Street, following behind another vehicle. Schillinger observed the leading vehicle properly turn and enter the closest lane of State Street, but that the suspect vehicle \u201cquickly shot around that car without using a turn signal and went all the way over to the wrong lane of traffic.\u201d Schillinger activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to initiate a traffic stop. In response, the suspect vehicle turned onto Third Avenue South and pulled over. The vehicle was driven by Turnsplenty.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">\u00b64 Speaking with Turnsplenty, Schillinger noticed a strong oder of alcohol coming from inside the vehicle and on Turnsplenty\u2019s breath, and that Turnsplenty\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Following an investigation at the scene, including field sobriety tests, Turnsplenty was placed in custody and transported to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility. He was charged by information with driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">\u00b65 On May 21, 2001, Turnsplenty went to trial before a jury on the charge. During voir dire, a question and answer exchange between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>defense counsel and panelist Boyer included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">Counsel: So do you believe that [Native Americans] have a lower tolerance for alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">Mr. Boyer: I don\u2019t know if they have a lower tolerance. I know it seems like they have a great deal of consumption of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Counsel: So we probably encounter more DUIs with Native Americans than with Caucasians?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">Mr. Boyer: I would think the odds of that are pretty good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">Counsel: Because Daniel is a Native American and the charge, you\u2019ve already indicated that you have great concerns about drinking, do you think you might have something of a predisposition in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">Mr. Boyer: I might.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">Counsel: So do you think that it\u2019s-do you think he\u2019s being arrested for being under the influence of alcohol, he\u2019s Native American, and in your experience do you think that he\u2019s guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">Mr. Boyer: I think I would go back, and the young man\u2019s going to have to state his case and prove his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">Counsel:.,Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">\u00b66 Defense counsel did not follow up this exchange with any additional questions or an explanation of the State\u2019s burden of proof, and did not challenge Boyer for cause, but used a peremptory challenge to exclude Boyer from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">\u00b67 Under questioning by the prosecutor, Panelist Deming stated that a member of his community had a son killed by a drunk driver which had \u201calmost killed his mother,\u201d and that the family had not gotten over the devastation. Deming, whose brother-in-law had been a patrol officer, further indicated that he had seen too many DUIs and believed the law should be more strict, particularly on repeat offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">\u00b68 Panelist Miller told the prosecutor that she was familiar with the fatal accident referenced by Panelist Deming, as the individual killed therein was her friend and a classmate. Miller stated that she believed drinking and driving was wrong, and that the DUI law in Montana was not strict enough because she had heard of repeat offenders who were \u201cgetting away with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">\u00b69 Panelist Waage related that his wife and daughter were involved in a vehicle accident caused by a drunk driver who \u201cjust plowed into them, and he didn\u2019t really take time to look,\u201d but that they were not hurt in the accident. Waage expressed frustration over the driver in that matter leaving the state, and although the driver paid the damages, Waage indicated that repeat offenders should be off the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b6 10 Defense counsel did not ask further questions of Panelists Deming and Miller about the fatal accident they had referenced, nor about their ability to be impartial. Similarly, Panelist Waage was not asked about his ability to judge the matter impartially. Defense counsel did not challenge Deming, Miller or Waage for cause, or exclude them by way of peremptory challenge, and all three of them served on the jury. Further, defense counsel did not voir dire the jury concerning burden of proof, presumption of innocence, and a defendant\u2019s right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b611 Turnsplenty was convicted by the jury. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b612 Did Tumsplenty\u2019s trial counsel provide ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\u00b613 Turnsplenty claims his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during voir dire by failing to correct Panelist Boyer\u2019s statement that Turnsplenty would have to \u201cstate his case and prove it;\u201d by failing to ask follow-up questions of Panelists Deming, Miller and Waage about their possible bias, and for allowing them to serve on the jury; and by failing to conduct voir dire concerning basic criminal law concepts such as burden of proof and presumption of innocence. The State argues that Tumsplenty\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not record based and that his conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\u00b614  In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims, this Court has adopted the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, \u00b6 37, 304 Mont. 47, \u00b6 37, 15 P.3d 970, \u00b6 37 (overruled on other grounds). Under the first prong, the defendant bears the burden of showing that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>St. John, </em>\u00b6 37. In so doing, the defendant must overcome a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s defense strategies and trial tactics fall within a wide range of reasonable and sound professional decisions. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 18, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 18, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 18. The second prong requires the defendant to establish prejudice by demonstrating that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 19. A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must ground his or her proof of facts within the record and not on conclusory allegations. <em>St. John, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u00b615 Tumsplenty argues that the record adequately supports his claims of ineffective assistance, and that his counsel\u2019s errors are more egregious than those which occurred in <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 61, 947 P.2d 57. In <em>Chastain, </em>we considered defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge for cause or to exercise a peremptory challenge to a juror who had indicated strong feelings unfavorable to Chastain. Reviewing the record on Chastain\u2019s appeal from his conviction, we concluded that, \u201cwhere, as here, defense counsel abandons his client\u2019s right to challenge a juror for no apparent reason, error must be attributed to the lawyer.\u201d <em>Chastain, </em>285 Mont. at 65, 947 P.2d at 60. \u00b616 Recently, in <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738, we revisited our holding in <em>Chastain, </em>and determined that \u201cin <em>Chastain, </em>it was a mistake for the Court, based on the lack of a reason \u2018apparent\u2019 on the record, to determine that counsel was ineffective in voir dire examination.\u201diZerrmcm, \u00b6 28. <em>Herrman </em>involved a defense counsel\u2019s failure during voir dire to ask follow-up questions to panelists who had expressed reservations about being impartial, or to challenge them for cause. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 20. Concerning defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge a panelist for cause, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">[I]t is a mistake to assume that we can determine from a cold record whether there was a tactical reason for not exercising a challenge. The reasons for counsel\u2019s actions or inactions should not be \u201cassumed\u201d but should be the subject of a postconviction evidentiary inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we overrule <em>Chastain\u2019s </em>holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to challenge prospective jurors in voir dire can be determined from a record which is silent as to the lawyer\u2019s reasoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"><em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30, 33. We further concluded that none of Herrman\u2019s claims regarding his counsel\u2019s actions during voir dire could be addressed without considering matters outside the record, and were therefore appropriate for postconviction relief, citing our holding in <em>State v. St. John:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">When the record does not provide the basis for the challenged acts or omissions of counsel, a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel more appropriately makes his claims in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>St John, </em>\u00b6 40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\"><em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u00b617 In <em>Harris </em>we explained that for a claim to be adequately documented for review on direct appeal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">the record available to this Court on appeal must afford sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>understanding of the reasons for counsel\u2019s act or omission to answer the threshold question of whether the alleged error expresses a trial strategy or tactical decision. [Citations omitted.] If the record does not supply the reason for counsel\u2019s act or omission, the claim must be raised by petition for post-conviction relief. <em>St. John, </em>\u00b6 40 [citations omitted]. In deciphering the use of the record and the appropriate forum for adjudicating ineffective assistance claims, we explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">Though not easily distilled into a formula, the definitive question that distinguishes and decides which actions are record and which are non-record, is why? In other words, if counsel fails to object to the admission of evidence, or fails to offer an opening statement, does the record fully explain <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action? If not, then the matter is best-suited for post-conviction proceedings which permit a further inquiry into whether the particular representation was ineffective. Only when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b618 The voir dire errors claimed by Turnsplenty, i.e., that his counsel failed to ask follow-up questions and to challenge panelists who indicated possible bias, failed to inquire about basic criminal concepts such as burden of proof and presumption of innocence, and failed to correct a panelist\u2019s misstatement of the law, are similar to the claims of error asserted in <em>Herrman. </em>Further, the inadequacy of the record here requires us to the reach the same conclusion as we did in <em>Herrman. </em>We cannot address Tumsplenty\u2019s claims without considering matters outside of the record, and therefore, they are appropriately raised within a postconviction relief proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b619 The Court has enunciated a clear rule which can be applied consistently, whether on direct appeal from a conviction, or within a postconviction relief proceeding. Recently, in <em>Watson v. State, </em>2002 MT 329, 313 Mont. 209, 61 P.3d 759, we held that the district court abused its discretion in summarily dismissing Watson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. Watson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was based on his counsel\u2019s failure to question whether Watson suffered from a mental disease or defect rendering him unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law for sentencing purposes. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6 8. The district court concluded that Watson should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>raised his claim on direct appeal and denied his petition. However, we determined the record did not contain any information about why defense counsel failed to question whether Watson suffered from a mental disease or defect during the sentencing hearing. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6 16. \u201cAs was the case in <em>Harris, </em>we do not know whether the alleged errors in this case reflect a coherent trial strategy or whether they were reasonable and deserve deference and we refuse to speculate.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6 15, quoting <em>Soraich v. State, </em>2002 MT 187, \u00b6 24, 311 Mont. 90, \u00b6 24, 53 P.3d 878, \u00b6 24. Without being able to answer <em>why </em>defense counsel failed to question Watson\u2019s mental state from the record, we concluded that the district court erred by holding that Watson could have raised the issue on direct appeal from his conviction, and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to answer the question. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b620  In this matter, the record on appeal establishes that Turnsplenty\u2019s counsel committed the claimed errors, but does not reveal whether counsel\u2019s inaction was a reasonable tactical decision or a mistake. Because the record is void of any evidence as to <em>why </em>defense counsel did not take such actions, Tumsplenty has improperly raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b621 We hold that Turnsplenty\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are not record based, and we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
