Lesko (Lesko) appeals from the order of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, affirming the conviction and sentence entered by the Missoula Municipal Court (Municipal Court). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the City of Missoula (City) did not fail to meet its discovery obligations and, on that basis, in affirming the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">\u00b63 Missoula Police Department officers cited Lesko into Municipal Court for driving under the influence of alcohol. After a pretrial conference, counsel for the City and for Lesko, as well as the Municipal Court judge, signed a pretrial order stating that the City had disclosed all evidence required by \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">\u00b64 At the outset of his bench trial, Lesko objected to evidence and witnesses to be offered by the City, beyond those included in a Notice of Intent to offer Montana Crime Laboratory reports and a related witness. He moved to exclude any other evidence against him on the basis that such evidence had not been disclosed as required by \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, and the pretrial order. The Municipal Court denied the motion and, after a bench trial, convicted and sentenced Lesko.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">\u00b65 Lesko appealed to the District Court, and the parties briefed the issue of whether the Municipal Court erred by allowing certain witnesses to testify without having been disclosed during discovery. The District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s decision. Lesko appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in concluding that the City did not fail to meet its discovery obligations and, on that basis, in affirming the Municipal Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">\u00b67  Appeals to district court from municipal court are limited to record reviews and questions of law. A \u201cdistrict court may affirm, reverse, or amend any appealed order or judgment....\u201d Section 3-6-110, MCA. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law-such as whether a statute or pretrial order was violated-to determine whether the conclusions are correct. <em>See State v. </em>McNally, 2002 MT 160, \u00b6 5, 310 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Mont. 396, \u00b6 5, 50 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b68 Section 46-15-322, MCA, requires that, \u201c[u]pon request,\u201d a prosecutor must make available for examination and reproduction certain material and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession and control, including names, addresses, and statements of intended prosecution witnesses and \u201cany evidence in the particular case....\u201d In this regard, the first question on the pretrial order signed by the Municipal Court and both counsel is \u201cHas prosecution disclosed all evidence required by M.C.A. 46-15-322.\u201d The \u201cyes\u201d answer is marked with an \u201cx.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b69 Lesko contends the City failed to disclose all its witnesses and other evidence in advance and, as a result of the City\u2019s failure to meet its discovery obligations, he was entitled to have the undisclosed witnesses and evidence precluded from trial. With regard to the pretrial order, Lesko urges that, by signing the order, the City represented that everything required by \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, had been disclosed and it could not present-and the District Court could not admit-additional evidence at trial. The City argues that, because its practice is to make all material in its file available to defense counsel in a criminal case, Lesko\u2019s failure to \u201crequest\u201d discovery or to exercise his right to view and copy the City\u2019s case file is not the equivalent of a discovery abuse by the City. We previously have adopted the City\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b610 In <em>State v. Matt </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 208, 799 P.2d 1085, the defendant was convicted of domestic abuse and tampering with a witness. <em>Matt, </em>245 Mont. at 209, 799 P.2d at 1086. He argued on appeal that, because the prosecution had violated the district court\u2019s discovery order by not supplying him with certain statements and photographs until the eve of the trial, the district court should have declared a mistrial or forbidden the prosecution from utilizing the undisclosed evidence. <em>Matt, </em>245 Mont. at 212, 799 P.2d at 1088. The prosecution contended that \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA, required it to \u201cmake available to the defendant for examination and production\u201d the relevant documents, and that it had complied with the statute by allowing defense counsel full opportunity to examine its files. <em>Matt, </em>245 Mont. at 212, 799 P.2d at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\u00b611 We determined that defense counsel\u2019s failure to exercise the right to examine the prosecutor\u2019s files \u201ccannot form a basis to support [the defendant\u2019s] contentions that the State willfully suppressed evidence or refused to abide by the trial court\u2019s discovery order.\u201d We further noted there was \u201cno evidence that the State refused any request by defense counsel to examine any relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>245 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>212-13, 799 P.2d at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b612 As in <em>Matt, </em>the record before us does not indicate-and Lesko does not assert-that he ever requested discovery from the City. The pretrial order indicated that the City had disclosed all evidence \u201crequired\u201d by \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, which, as set forth above, requires only that certain evidence be made available to the defendant \u201c[u]pon request.\u201d <em>Matt </em>is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b613  Lesko argues that he was improperly bound to the representations of the City, which signed the pretrial order indicating it had provided all discovery \u201crequired\u201d by \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA. As discussed above, however, the statute only required the City to make available that which Lesko requested. Stated simply, since Lesko\u2019s counsel also signed the pretrial order stating the City had provided the statutorily-required discovery, he cannot now be heard to assert that he was not also bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b614  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that the City did not fail to meet its discovery obligations and, on that basis, correctly affirmed the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-8\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
