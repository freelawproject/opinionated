The Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, entered summary judgment in favor of Gallatin County. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it entered summary judgment in favor of Gallatin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u00b63 On May 9, 2000, Leanne Miller obtained a temporary order of protection from the District Court. The order prohibited Leanne\u2019s husband, Tommy Miller, from coming into contact with Leanne, her property, or their children outside the presence of law enforcement, unless ordered by the court. At all times pertinent to the events in question, Leanne resided in a rental property owned by Bos.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u00b64 On June 2, 2000, following multiple violations of the restraining order, Tommy was arrested and booked into the Gallatin County Detention Center. After learning of Tommy\u2019s arrest, Leanne requested that the Detention Center contact her upon Tommy\u2019s release, pursuant to Detention Center policy. At approximately 5:45 p.m. on June 2, 2000, Tommy posted bail and was released from the Detention Center. The Detention Center did not contact Leanne per her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u00b65 In the early morning hours of June 3, 2000, Tommy went to Leanne\u2019s residence, killed Leanne, and set fire to the home. In an ensuing confrontation with local authorities, Tommy was shot and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\u00b66 On May 9, 2001, Bos filed a negligence action against Gallatin County. Bos sought damages for the destruction of real and personal property which allegedly resulted from Gallatin County\u2019s failure to contact Leanne upon Tommy\u2019s release. On April 17, 2002, Gallatin County moved for summary judgment under the theories that (1) Gallatin County owed no duty to Bos with regard to Tommy\u2019s release and (2) \u00a7 46-24-105, MCA, precludes recovery against Gallatin County for its failure to notify Leanne of Tommy\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">\u00b67 Following a hearing on the motion, the District Court concluded that Gallatin County owed no common law duty to Bos and that \u00a7 46-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>24-105, MCA, bars Leanne from recovering against Gallatin County on the negligence claim. Accordingly, the District Court entered its Order Granting Summary Judgment on July 9, 2002. Bos appeals from the court\u2019s order of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same evaluation under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as the district court. <em>Vivier v. State Dept. of Transp., </em>2001 MT 221, \u00b6 5, 306 Mont. 454, \u00b6 5, 35 P.3d 958, \u00b6 5. This Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5z\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264-65, 900 P.2d 901, 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it entered summary judgment in favor of Gallatin County?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u00b610 Section 46-24-203, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">Prompt notification to victims and witnesses of certain offenses. (1) A person described in subsection (2) who provides the appropriate official with a current address and telephone number must receive prompt advance notification, if possible, of proceedings relating to the person\u2019s case, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">(b) the release of the accused pending judicial proceedings^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">(2) A person entitled to notification under subsection (1) must be a victim or witness of a felony offense or a misdemeanor offense involving actual, threatened, or potential bodily injury to the victim, a relative of a victim or witness who is a minor, or a relative of a homicide victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">Similarly, \u00a7 46-24-104(2), MCA, provides that the prosecuting attorney in a criminal case shall consult with the victim of a felony or misdemeanor offense involving bodily injury, actual or potential, to obtain the victim\u2019s views about the accused\u2019s release pending judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>proceedings. Finally, \u00a7 46-24-105, MCA, provides that \u201c[n]othing in this chapter may be construed to create a cause of action for damages against the state or one of its political subdivisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b611 Bos devotes a large portion of his opening brief to purported factual disputes with respect to the elements of negligence. As for \u00a7 46-24-105, MCA, Bos simply states that his \u201cclaim is a common law negligence claim.\u201d Bos insists that his cause of action does not derive from Title 46, Chapter 24, MCA. Therefore, Bos argues that the proscription contained in \u00a7 46-24-105, MCA, does not apply to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b612 In his Complaint, Bos alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">19. The Gallatin County Detention Center had a duty and responsibility to use ordinary and prudent care in the conduct of its affairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">20. By the Gallatin County Detention Center\u2019s actions or inaction, on or about June 2, 2000, the Detention Center caused injury to Plaintiff by failing to contact Leanne Miller of Tommy Miller\u2019s release in order that evasive action or precautions could have been undertaken to avoid what occurred that evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">21. As a direct and proximate cause of the Detention Center\u2019s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered injury, entitling Plaintiff to compensatory and consequential damages, interest and costs. Defendant is responsible for the Detention Center\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00b613  The Complaint does not reference an independent duty which extends from Gallatin County to Bos. The Complaint is simply couched in terms of Gallatin County\u2019s duty owed to the victim. Further, Bos cites no compelling authority on appeal that would impose a common law duty upon Gallatin County with respect to Bos. Without a prevailing common law theory, when broken down to its fundamental root, Bos\u2019s cause of action derives solely from \u00a7\u00a7 46-24-104 and -203, MCA, regardless of whether he specifically cited the provisions or not. As such, \u00a7 46-24-105, MCA, precludes Bos from recovering against Gallatin County based on its failure to notify Leanne of Tommy\u2019s release. We hold that the District Court did not err when it entered summary judgment in favor of Gallatin County. Accordingly, we need not examine the negligence issues raised by Bos on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
