Cereal Food\u2019s insurer at that time, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (\u201cNationwide\u201d), found the occupational disease compensable. Abfalder suffered several flare-ups and other injuries, subsequent to his original 1994 injury. Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois (\u201cTravelers\u201d) served as Cereal Food\u2019s insurer at the time of Abfalder\u2019s flare-ups and subsequent injuries. Travelers seeks indemnification from Nationwide for Abfalder\u2019s post-1994 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b62 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that Travelers is entitled to indemnification by Nationwide. Nationwide appeals. We affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">\u00b63 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">\u00b64 1. Was the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision supported by a correct application of the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">\u00b65 2. Was there substantial credible evidence to support the factual determinations made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">\u00b66 Abfalder worked as an employee of Cereal Food. In 1994, Abfalder\u2019s job duties required him to lift 50-pound bags from a conveyer belt and carry them three feet to a pallet. He worked 10-hour days. Abfalder was first injured on the job in 1994. He was diagnosed as suffering an occupational back disease as a result of his continuous heavy lifting. Nationwide was the insurer for Cereal Food at the time of Abfalder\u2019s initial injury in 1994, and Nationwide accepted Abfalder\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u00b67 Abfalder continued working, with restrictions imposed by the doctor. Despite this, he suffered multiple flare-ups of his injury, which were found to be compensable by Cereal Food\u2019s subsequent insurer, Travelers. After each flare-up, Abfalder was able to return to work, with restrictions. In December of 1999, Cereal Food imposed additional physical requirements on Abfalder. Since these additional requirements were outside of Abfalder\u2019s restrictions, Cereal Food laid him off.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b68 The parties to this case do not dispute that Abfalder\u2019s claim is compensable. At issue is whether Nationwide or Travelers is liable for compensating Abfalder for his post-1994 injuries. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held Nationwide was liable for Abfalder\u2019s condition, and ordered Nationwide to indemnify Travelers. Nationwide appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b69 We review a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to determine whether that court correctly interpreted the law as it applies to the facts of the case at issue. <em>Lockhart v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 205, \u00b6 13, 295 Mont. 467, \u00b6 13, 984 P.2d 744, \u00b6 13. When determining whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct, this Court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Thompson v. CIGNA, </em>2000 MT 306, \u00b6 17, 302 Mont. 399, \u00b6 17, 14 P.3d 1222, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b610 We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they Eire supported by substantial credible evidence, not whether there may be contrary findings. <em>Caekaert v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 105, 110, 885 P.2d 495, 498. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact. <em>Mennis v. Anderson Steel Supply </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 180, 184, 841 P.2d 528, 530. Where there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, this Court cannot overturn them. <em>See Perry v. Tomahawk Transp. </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 318, 320, 735 P.2d 308, 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\u00b611 Was the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision supported by a correct application of the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">\u00b612 When an employee has been disabled due to an occupational disease, and suffers a second injury or disability, the first insurer is liable for the claim only if the disability or injury is a recurrence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>initial disability or injury. <em>Caekaert, </em>268 Mont. at 111, 885 P.2d at 499. This rule is known as the \u201clast injurious exposure doctrine.\u201d <em>Caekaert, </em>268 Mont. at 111, 885 P.2d at 499. In Montana, this doctrine is codified at \u00a7 39-72-303, MCA. Section 39-72-303, MCA, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">Which employer liable. (1) Where compensation is payable for an occupational disease, the only employer liable is the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">(2) When there is more than one insurer and only one employer at the time the employee was injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease, the liability rests with the insurer providing coverage at the earlier of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">(a) the time the occupational disease was first diagnosed by a treating physician or medical panel; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">(b) the time the employee knew or should have known that the condition was the result of an occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b613 Nationwide relies on <em>Belton v. Carlson Transport </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 384, 658 P.2d 405, and its progeny, <em>Stangler v. Anderson Meyers Drilling </em>Co. (1987), 229 Mont. 251, 746 P.2d 99, in support of its position. In both cases, claimants were injured on multiple occasions, while working for different employers. This Court was asked to determine whether the claimants had reached maximum healing, which was key to the determination of which employer\u2019s insurer was liable. In both cases, we found that the claimants reached maximum healing after their first injuries and before their alleged second injuries, thus holding that the first insurers were not responsible for the second injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\u00b614  <em>Belton </em>and <em>Stangler, </em>however, are distinguishable from the present case. First, we note that both <em>Belton </em>and <em>Stangler </em>involved two employers, whereas here, only one employer is involved. Second, <em>Belton </em>and <em>Stangler </em>have been superceded by subsection (2) of \u00a7 39-72-303, MCA, which the Legislature added to the statute in 1993. As we stated above, \u00a7 39-72-303, MCA, applies to situations in which there is more than one insurer but only one employer, as is the case here. Furthermore, pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-303(2), MCA, liability rests with the insurer providing coverage at the earlier of the time the occupational disease was first diagnosed or the time the employee knew or should have known that the condition was the result of an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b615 Nationwide also contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred by improperly shifting the burden of proving the cause of Abfalder\u2019s disability to Nationwide. Nationwide argues that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Belton, </em>the burden of proof is placed on the insurance company which is at risk at the time of the accident in which a compensable injury is claimed. <em>Belton, </em>202 Mont. at 392, 658 P.2d at 409-10. Nationwide argues further that, \u201cWhen a subsequent injury has arguably aggravated a preexisting condition, the second insurer avoids liability for that condition only upon proving the claimant had not reached maximum medical healing with respect to his prior workers\u2019 compensation injury or that the second injury did not in fact permanently aggravate the underlying condition for which the prior insurer was liable.\u201d <em>Stacks v. Travelers Property Casualty, </em>2001 MTWCC 9, \u00b6 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b616 Nationwide is correct regarding upon which party the burden of proof is placed. However, the record in this case does not demonstrate that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court improperly placed the burden on Nationwide. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court heard extensive evidence from both Nationwide and Travelers regarding Abfalder\u2019s injuries. Nationwide has not shown that Travelers failed to meet its burden of proof. We find Nationwide\u2019s contention on this issue to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b617 Nationwide also argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred by ruling that an occupational disease is continuing and that no new occupational disease can develop after maximum medical improvement is reached. Nationwide, however, mischaracterizes the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s ruling. In its Order, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Nationwide\u2019s argument that the original disease ended upon claimant reaching MMI in 1995 and that a new disease began thereafter makes little sense in the context of this case. Since the disease was a continuous process involving repetitive trauma, under that theory the claimant would reach MMI at the end of each day and a new occupational disease would commence the next morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b618 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not hold that no new occupational disease can develop after maximum medical healing is reached. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court made a determination that <em>in this case, </em>Abfalder\u2019s condition was caused by repetitive trauma, and that he did not suffer from a new disease subsequent to healing from his 1994 injury. As we discussed above, the facts of Abfalder\u2019s case support this conclusion of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u00b619 Was there substantial credible evidence to support the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>determinations made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b620 In its brief, Nationwide contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court disregarded testimony of Abfalder, Abfalder\u2019s wife, and Doctors Schumann and Rizzolo. We restate that we review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial credible evidence, not whether there may be contrary findings. <em>Caekaert, </em>268 Mont. at 110, 885 P.2d at 498. Furthermore, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, as the finder of fact, is in the best position to assess witnesses\u2019 credibility and testimony. <em>Kloepfer v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 495, 498, 916 P.2d 1310, 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b621 Here, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court <em>did </em>address the testimony of the Abfalders and both doctors, albeit not to the extent Nationwide may have liked. Nationwide points out that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not discuss the Abfalders\u2019 testimony or their credibility. However, as we have stated, it is not our job to assess whether there may be contrary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b622  The record is replete with facts supporting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s factual findings. For example, Dr. Schumann, Abfalder\u2019s treating physician, testified that Abfalder\u2019s post-1994 claims only had temporary effects on the pre-existing degenerative condition. Despite farther injuries and flare-ups, Abfalder\u2019s impairment has not increased since 1995. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court also discussed the testimony of Dr. Rizzolo, an orthopedic surgeon who saw Abfalder at the request of Travelers, noting that Dr. Rizzolo stated that Abfalder\u2019s subsequent injuries seem to materially, substantially, and permanently aggravate his condition. Furthermore, Abfalder was not laid off due to any increase in the restriction or impairment, or to deterioration of his condition; he was laid off because Cereal Food increased his work requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b623 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
