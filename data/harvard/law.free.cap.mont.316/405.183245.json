We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u00b62 Vandersloot raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony of Trent Burke?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Vandersloot\u2019s medication sign-out sheet into evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">\u00b65 3. Did sufficient evidence support the jury\u2019s verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">\u00b66 On August 15, 1999, Trent Burke, an inmate trustee at the Big Horn County Jail in Hardin, Montana, reported witnessing Vandersloot and Samuel Big Hair, Jr., snorting lines of pinkish-white powder in the jail\u2019s dayroom. Although the jailors on duty observed nothing suspicious on the surveillance monitors, the section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>dayroom in which Vandersloot and Big Hair allegedly sat was a surveillance \u201cdead zone\u201d that was not covered by the dayroom\u2019s video camera. When Big Hair\u2019s probation officer questioned him regarding his reported drug use, Big Hair admitted that he had stolen two \u201cblack and orange capsules\u201d from the jail\u2019s medication box, swallowed one and snorted the other. An investigation of Burke\u2019s allegations by Deputy Sheriff Carey Hert revealed that Dexedrine was the only inmate medication at the time of the alleged snorting that closely matched Big Hair\u2019s capsule description. Nineteen-year-old Vandersloot was the only inmate with a prescription for Dexedrine, which had been prescribed to treat his attention deficit disorder. Big Hair denied that Vandersloot sold, bartered or otherwise provided him with Dexedrine or any other drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b67 The Big Horn County prosecutor charged Vandersloot with criminal sale of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA, on September 10,1999. Vandersloot pled not guilty and was represented by court-appointed counsel. The District Court denied his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of jail trustee Burke and a two-day trial ensued in February 2000. The jury returned a guilty verdict. The court sentenced Vandersloot to a 25-year term in Montana State Prison to run consecutively to his 20-year term on two prior counts of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b68 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2002 MT 263, \u00b6 10, 312 Mont. 249, \u00b6 10, 59 P.3d 387, \u00b6 10 (citing <em>State v. Enright, </em>2000 MT 372, \u00b6 21, 303 Mont. 457, \u00b6 21, 16 P.3d 366, \u00b6 21). The authority to grant or deny a motion <em>in limine </em>\u201crests in the inherent power of the court to admit or exclude evidence and to take such precautions as are necessary to afford a fair trial for all parties.\u201d <em>State v. Krause, </em>2002 MT 63, \u00b6 32, 309 Mont. 174, \u00b6 32, 44 P.3d 493, \u00b6 32 (quoting <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 15). A district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and absent an abuse of discretion, this Court will not overturn that court\u2019s ruling. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 10. We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict in a criminal trial to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 17, 305 Mont. 123, \u00b6 17, 23 P.3d 216, \u00b6 17 (citing <em>State v. Merrick, </em>2000 MT 124, \u00b6 7, 299 Mont. 472, \u00b6 7, 2 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>242, \u00b6 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b69 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony of Trent Burke?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b610 Vandersloot contends that Burke concocted his testimony about inmate drug use in order to gain personal advantage and early release from jail. He does not assert that Burke was not competent to testify, but argues that as a \u201cconvicted liar\u201d Burke was unfit to present his story to the jury. Vandersloot claims that the District Court erred by denying his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Burke\u2019s testimony at trial on the grounds that its probative value was outweighed by its tendency to mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b611 Burke had been arrested in Big Horn County in October 1997, and charged with second offense DUI; possession of alcohol in a commercial vehicle; and falsification of commercial records. He pled not guilty but failed to appear at trial. The court sentenced Burke <em>in absentia </em>to six-months in the county jail and a $1560 fine. Over one year after Burke\u2019s conviction, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest. He was apprehended in Mineral County and returned to Big Horn County to serve his sentence in August 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u00b612 At the Big Horn County Jail, Burke became an inmate trustee, which entailed completing certain housekeeping tasks, assisting with food and medication delivery and performing other services for the jailors. As a trustee, Burke was free to move around the facility and he was given a private cell. On August 15, 1999, which was Burke\u2019s first day as a trustee, he reported witnessing Vandersloot and Big Hair snorting a powdery substance in the jail\u2019s dayroom. On September 27, 1999, the Big Horn County prosecutor deposed Burke to preserve his testimony. Later that day, Burke appeared before the court and entered guilty pleas on the charges for which he had been convicted <em>in absentia </em>15 months earlier. The comb resentenced Burke, which resulted in his fine being forgiven, over four months being cut from his term and his release from jail that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u00b613 On appeal, Vandersloot cites no authority to support his contention that evidence should be excluded from the jury when it appears that the prosecution wrested testimony from a witness in exchange for a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. Instead, he relies upon <em>Havens v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 195, 945 P.2d 941, to illustrate an instance when this Court excluded probative evidence because it was likely to mislead and confuse the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">\u00b614 In <em>Havens, </em>an accident victim sought to prove that a city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>negligently failed to erect a stop sign at a dangerous intersection. As a defense, the city attempted to enter evidence of the driver\u2019s alcohol consumption prior to the accident. This Court held that, in the absence of testimony linking the driver\u2019s intoxication as a contributing cause of the accident, evidence of alcohol intoxication was irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial and likely to confuse the jury. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 200, 945 P.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b615 Vandersloot\u2019s reliance on <em>Havens </em>as support for excluding Burke\u2019s testimony is misplaced. In <em>Havens, </em>this Court excluded evidence of the plaintiffs alcohol consumption on the basis of lack of relevancy, likely prejudicial effect on jurors and tendency to divert or confuse jurors regarding the negligence of the city, which was the only issue presented for jury determination at trial. Nothing in our <em>Havens </em>decision indicates that a jury should be shielded from relevant evidence presented by a witness who may be motivated to provide false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b616  Our rules of evidence define relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid. Relevant evidence is generally admissible. Rule 402, M.R.Evid. However, Rule 403, M.R.Evid., creates an exception to the general admissibility standard of Rule 402 by allowing relevant evidence to be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b617 Unlike evidence of the plaintiffs alcohol consumption in <em>Havens, </em>Burke\u2019s eyewitness testimony was clearly relevant to the State\u2019s case against Vandersloot. The exception created by Rule 403, M.R.Evid., for the exclusion of relevant evidence due to its prejudicial or potentially misleading impact on the jury, does not embrace competent eyewitness testimony describing the commission of the offense for which the defendant is on trial. In denying the motion <em>in limine, </em>the District Court invited Vandersloot to question Burke thoroughly on cross-examination regarding his criminal history and whether a link existed between his sentence reduction and his testimony against Vandersloot. Vandersloot took advantage of this opportunity and fully explored Burke\u2019s motives for testifying against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b618  As we have stated on many occasions, the trier of fact is in the best position to observe the witnesses, including their demeanor and credibility. <em>Matter of Seizure of $23,691.00 in U.S. Currency </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 474, 485, 905 P.2d 148, 155 (citing <em>State v. Black </em>(1995), 270 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Mont. 329, 337, 891 P.2d 1162, 1167). See also <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 189, 860 P.2d 89, 94. A witness\u2019s appreciation of his duty to tell the truth is not necessarily diminished by prior violations of the law. <em>State v. Haskins </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 202, 208, 887 P.2d 1189, 1193. The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are exclusively the province of the trier of fact and, in the event of conflicting evidence, it is within the province of the trier of fact to determine which will prevail. <em>Flack, </em>260 Mont. at 189, 860 P.2d at 94. Therefore, we conclude that Burke\u2019s testimony was properly before the jury for the jury to determine witness credibility and the weight of the evidence. We affirm that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Vandersloot\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b619 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Vandersloot\u2019s medication sign-out sheet into evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b620 At trial, the State questioned Deputy Hert, the investigating officer, regarding the Big Horn County Jail\u2019s medication sign-out sheet for Vandersloot\u2019s Dexedrine prescription. Defense counsel raised the following objection: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m going to ask that this be in evidence before it\u2019s testified from. I don\u2019t believe this individual\u2019s the keeper of this record. If I could <em>voir dire </em>him and perhaps bring out the nature of my objection.\u201d The court then allowed defense counsel to question the witness, which established that Deputy Hert played no role in the creation of the medication sign-out sheet; did not observe Vandersloot signing the sheet; and could not verify the dates on which the signatures were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b621 Following defense counsel\u2019s questioning, the District Court invited the State to lay additional foundation for the admission of the medication sign-out sheet into evidence. Deputy Hert testified that the sheet was kept in the regular course of business at the Big Horn County Jail and that jailors followed an established protocol in creating this record to document the delivery of Vandersloot\u2019s prescription medication while he was a jail inmate. The State then moved for the admission of the sheet into evidence. Defense counsel did not object or assert that the foundation laid by the prosecutor was inadequate. The court overruled Vandersloot\u2019s earlier objection and admitted the sign-out sheet into evidence without further comment by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u00b622 Vandersloot argues on appeal that the District Court erred by allowing the State to enter the medication sign-out sheet into evidence through the testimony of Deputy Hert because the prosecution failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>to qualify Deputy Hert as the custodian of the record; Deputy Hert could not identify or verify any signatures; and Deputy Hert had limited knowledge of the process involved in creating the record. Vandersloot also contends that the sheet did not qualify under the business records exception to the hearsay rule because subsequent testimony established that the protocol for creating the document was not consistently followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b623 Whatever problems might have existed with the admission of the medication sign-out sheet into evidence, the record must show that defense counsel raised a timely objection. An appellant must establish that an objection was made at trial on the same basis as the error asserted on appeal. <em>State v. Davis, </em>2000 MT 199, \u00b6 38, 300 Mont. 458, \u00b6 38, 5 P.3d 547, \u00b6 38. Requiring a defendant to specifically raise the objection at trial gives the prosecution and trial court an opportunity to avoid or correct the purported error. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 38. Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection, except as provided in \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA. Section 46-20-701(2), MCA, states that jurisdictional or constitutional errors may be excepted from the waiver rule under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b624 Vandersloot argues that the District Court violated his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses by admitting the medication sign-out sheet. He urges this Court to extend the protections afforded criminal defendants in <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766, to the facts of this case. In <em>Clark, </em>we held that a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental right to confront adverse witnesses at trial encompassed the technicians at the State Crime Lab because the incriminating results of tests conducted on evidence are often a critical component of the State\u2019s case that carries extraordinary weight in a criminal trial. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 25. We also held in <em>Clark </em>that due process requires the State to shoulder the burden of presenting State Crime Lab technicians as expert witnesses for cross-examination regarding testing methods, findings and chain of custody. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b625 The sign-out sheet for Vandersloot\u2019s Dexedrine prescription was generated by Big Horn County Jail personnel to verify the daily delivery of medication over a period of weeks. The jailors generally followed an established protocol in creating the document to insure that the inmate received his prescribed medication according to schedule. Vandersloot was on notice that the prosecution planned to enter the sheet into evidence. Had he reason to question specific jailors regarding the delivery of medication or about the creation of the sheet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>he could have subpoenaed them as trial witnesses. While the foundation laid for the admission of Vandersloot\u2019s medication sign-out sheet arguably may have been less than adequate, the State\u2019s burden in presenting the sheet simply does not require the trial testimony of every jailor whose acknowledgment appears on the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b626 In <em>Clark, </em>we held that the special hearsay exception for State Crime Lab reports was an unconstitutional abrogation of the right to confront one\u2019s accusers and that due process required the State to present Lab technicians as expert witnesses for cross-examination. Vandersloot offers this Court no rational basis for extending the constitutional protections afforded criminal defendants faced with incriminating State Crime Lab reports to the facts of this case. Moreover, we perceive no constitutional violation of Vandersloot\u2019s fundamental rights to due process or \u201cto meet the witnesses against him face to face,\u201d ensured by Article II, Section 17 and Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, by the admission of his medication sign-out sheet into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b627  After the District Court overruled defense counsel\u2019s nonspecific objection to the direct examination of Deputy Hert regarding Vandersloot\u2019s medication sign-out sheet, defense counsel asserted no new objection on the basis of inadequate foundation, hearsay, or any other grounds. The court then entered the sheet into evidence and defense counsel again failed to object. We conclude that defense counsel, by remaining silent, waived his objection to the admission of the sheet and failed to preserve an issue for appeal. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the medication sign-out sheet into evidence in the absence of a timely objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b628 Did sufficient evidence support the jury\u2019s verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u00b629 Vandersloot claims that insufficient evidence supported his conviction on the charge of criminal sale of dangerous drugs. We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 17 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\u00b630 Big Hair testified that he stole two \u201cblack and orange capsules\u201d from the Big Horn County Jail medication box, the contents of which, in part, he snorted. Burke stated that he observed Big Hair and Vandersloot snorting lines of a pink-colored powder in the j ail dayroom on August 15,1999. Frank Tikka, another jail inmate, testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>saw Big Hair using a straw to snort a powder in the dayroom that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b631 Deputy Hert conducted a follow-up investigation, which revealed that Vandersloot was the only inmate of the Big Horn County Jail on August 16,1999, who had a prescription for a medication that closely matched Big Hair\u2019s description of black and orange capsules. Pharmacist Don Raymond testified that Vandersloot\u2019s prescription for Dexedrine was prepared as small white and pink pellets packaged in capsules that are half-black and half-clear. Raymond stated that the pellets may be crushed into a pink-colored powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b632 According to the medication sign-out sheet, Vandersloot was issued a new 30-dose bottle of Dexedrine on July 15, 1999. Deputy Hert seized the bottle on August 16,1999. He testified that the seized bottle contained three capsules, which he retained in police custody. Vandersloot\u2019s Dexedrine sign-out sheet showed that 27 capsules were delivered to Vandersloot between July 15 and August 16,1999. Deputy Hert stated that he had accounted for all 30 Dexedrine capsules from Vandersloot\u2019s prescription bottle, which refuted Big Hair\u2019s claim that he stole the black and orange capsules from the jail\u2019s medication box.</p>\n<p id=\"A-o\">\u00b633 The prosecution entered into evidence Big Hair\u2019s written request to the jailors that $30 be transferred from his account to Vandersloot\u2019s account on August 12, 1999. Big Hair stated that this money was to pay for audio tapes that he ordered through Vandersloot\u2019s mother. Vandersloot\u2019s mother testified that she had not been asked to order any tapes for Big Hair. Furthermore, Vandersloot never returned the money to Big Hair. Thus, the $30 may have changed hands for an another, unexplained purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b634  To convict Vandersloot of the offense of criminal sale of dangerous drugs, pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-101(3), MCA, the State needed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Dexedrine is a dangerous drug and that Big Hair obtained the Dexedrine from Vandersloot, with or without the exchange of money. Pharmacist Raymond testified that Dexedrine is the commercial name for dextroamphetamine, which is an amphetamine that is formulated to last longer in the body. Amphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant and is listed as a Schedule II drug under \u00a7 50-32-224(3), MCA. Viewing the circumstantial evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a jury could reasonably find that the black and orange capsules that Big Hair admitted snorting in the Big Horn County Jail dayroom on August 15, 1999, were Dexedrine and reasonably determine that Big Hair could only have obtained the capsules from Vandersloot. Therefore, we conclude that sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b635 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Vandersloot\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Trent Burke; we affirm the admission of Vandersloot\u2019s medication sign-out sheet in the absence of a defense objection; and we hold that sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
