We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is: Did the District Court err in refusing to issue a writ to prohibit the Department of Corrections from transferring Wright from the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge, Montana, to another correctional facility?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJB\">\u00b63 On June 11,1996, the Thirteenth Judicial District Court convicted Wright of deliberate homicide and use of a firearm. The sentencing court ordered that Wright \u201cbe punished by imprisonment in the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, Montana, for the term of seventy five (75) years.\u201d The court sentenced Wright to an additional five years for using a firearm during the crime and declared that he be ineligible for parole, placement in any supervised release program, or for placement in any program or facility besides the Montana State Prison (MSP) for the first twenty years of the sentence. After the conviction, Wright was transferred to MSP in Deer Lodge, Montana. Since then, the Department of Corrections (DOC) has placed Wright at various institutions, including out-of-state correctional facilities and in-state regional detention and private correctional centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">\u00b64 Wright filed a writ for prohibition with the Thirteenth Judicial District Court in order to prevent the DOC from housing him in any correctional facility other than MSP. The District Court declined to issue a writ of prohibition. Wright appeals the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b65 When this Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding the application of a statute, our standard of review is \u201cwhether the tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, \u00b6 5, 310 Mont. 396, \u00b6 5, 50 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 5; <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6 17, 307 Mont. 172, \u00b6 17, 36 P.3d 922, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted). <em>See also, State v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 188, \u00b6 19, 306 Mont. 243, \u00b6 19, 32 P.3d 750, \u00b6 19 (stating that our standard of review is plenary when reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, and that we must determine whether the conclusions are correct as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u2022 <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b66 Wright argues that, by the terms of his written judgment, the statutory definition of \u201cstate prison\u201d and by virtue of his liberty interest in not being transferred, the DOC does not have the authority to transfer him from the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, Montana. First, Wright contends that the plain language of the District Court\u2019s \u201cJudgment and Commitment\u201d mandates his placement in MSP for the first twenty years of his sentence. In support of this proposition, Wright directs us to the language of the judgment where the District Court ordered that Wright be \u201cpunished by imprisonment in the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, Montana,\u201d and \u201c[in]eligible for parole, placement in any \u2018 supervised release program or for placement in any program or facility besides Montana State Prison for the first twenty (20) years ....\u201d Furthermore, Wright submits that he may not be imprisoned anywhere other than at the prison located in Deer Lodge for at least the first twenty years of his sentence because \u00a7 53-30-101, MCA (1995), in effect at the time of his sentencing, designated \u201c[t]he institution at Deer Lodge [a]s the state prison ....\u201d It is important to note that, at the time of Wright\u2019s sentencing in 1996, the facility in Deer Lodge was the only adult male correctional facility in Montana. Although Wright recognizes that the statutory denomination of \u201cstate prison\u201d has since been expanded to now include the Montana state prison, the Montana women\u2019s prison, a detention center in another jurisdiction detaining inmates from Montana pursuant to \u00a7 50-30-106, MCA, and a private correctional facility <em>(see </em>\u00a7 53-30-101, MCA (2001)), he insists that any application of the amended statute to his sentence is unconstitutionally <em>ex post facto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXd\">\u00b67 Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution prevents state legislatures from enacting <em>ex post facto </em>legislation. Article II, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Section 31 of the Montana Constitution prohibits the same. <em>See State v. Leistiko </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 32, 36, 844 P.2d 97, 99. The constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws is concerned with laws that retroactively make innocent action criminal, enlarge the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts. <em>See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 499, 504, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1601, 131 L.Ed.2d 588, 594. The Montana Code states: \u201cNo law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\u201d Section 1-2-109, MCA. This Court uses the two-part <em>Leistiko </em>test to determine whether a statute violates the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws: (1) the law must be retrospective, and (2) it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 29, 300 Mont. 381, \u00b6 29, 6 P.3d 453, \u00b6 29 (citing <em>Leistiko, </em>256 Mont. at 36-37, 844 P.2d at 100). However, changes in procedure which do not affect substantial rights do not implicate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 155, \u00b6 28, 306 Mont. 83, \u00b6 28, 31 P.3d 340, \u00b6 28. Therefore, this Court will apply the above-mentioned test only if Wright\u2019s substantial rights are implicated by the application of the amended statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b68  Wright asserts that the application of the amended definition violates both his. constitutional due process right to liberty and his state-created liberty interest. We first turn to Wright\u2019s argument regarding his constitutional liberty interest. While the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, it is nevertheless well-settled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">[G]iven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty to the extent that the State may confine him and subject him to the rules of its prison system so long as the conditions of confinement do not otherwise violate the Constitution. The Constitution does not require that the State have more than one prison for convicted felons; nor does it guarantee that the convicted prisoner will be placed in any particular prison if, as is likely, the State has more than one correctional institution .... The conviction has sufficiently extinguished the defendant\u2019s liberty interest to empower the State to confine him in <em>any </em>of its prisons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\"><em>Meachum v. Fano </em>(1975), 427 U.S. 215, 224-25, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 2538 , 49 L.Ed.2d 451, 458-59. Additionally, \u201c[j]ust as an inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within a State, he has no justifiable expectation that he will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>incarcerated in any particular State.\u201d <em>Olim v. Wakinekona </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 238, 245, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 1745, 75 L.Ed.2d 813, 820. Clearly, Wright does not have a constitutional right to be imprisoned in any particular facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b69 Nevertheless, Wright maintains that even if he does not have a federal constitutional due process right to be imprisoned in a particular correctional facility, he does have a state-created liberty interest in not being transferred from MSP. Wright submits that Montana laws in effect at the time of his sentencing created this liberty interest. In order for a state to create a liberty interest, it must first enact a law that establishes a \u201cright of real substance;\u201d however, even then statutorily-defined liberty interests are restricted to freedom from \u201catypical and significant hardships in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d or restraints which \u201cinevitably affectD the duration of the prisoner\u2019s confinement.\u201d <em>McDermott v. Montana Dept. of Corrections, </em>2001 MT 134, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 462, \u00b6 11, 29 P.3d 992, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b610 Other than \u00a7 53-30-101, MCA (1995), Wright does not list which Montana laws in effect at the time of his sentencing established a \u201cright of real substance.\u201d However, even if this Court determined that the 1995 definition of \u201cstate prison\u201d did confer a right of real substance, this right is restricted to freedom from \u201catypical and significant hardships in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d or restraints which \u201cinevitably affect[] the duration of the prisoner\u2019s confinement.\u201d <em>McDermott, </em>\u00b6 11. Being transferred from one prison to another, even out of state, is neither an \u201catypical and significant\u201d hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, nor does it \u201cinevitably affect the duration\u201d of Wright\u2019s confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"A90\">\u00b611 For example, in <em>Olim v. Wakinekona </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 238, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813, a Hawaii prisoner, who had been transferred to a prison in California, claimed that the transfer violated his state-created right to be imprisoned in Hawaii. The prisoner argued that Hawaii\u2019s prison regulations had created a liberty interest and a corresponding due process right. In concluding that Hawaii had not created such a liberty interest, the United States Supreme Court asserted that a State does not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest unless it has \u201cconferred [a] right on the prisoner to remain in the prison to which he was initially assigned, defeasible only upon proof of specific acts of misconduct.\u201d <em>Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. at 248-49, 103 S.Ct. at 1747, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 822 (quoting <em>Meachum, </em>427 U.S. at 226, 96 S.Ct. at 2539, 49 L.Ed.2d at 460). We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Wright has not persuasively shown that Montana laws in effect at the time of his sentencing \u201cconferred [a] right on the prisoner to remain in the prison in which he was initially assigned, defeasible only upon proof of specific acts of misconduct.\u201d Like Hawaii in <em>Wakinekona, </em>Montana retains the discretion to transfer a prisoner for whatever reason or no reason at all; the laws in effect at the time of Wright\u2019s sentencing did not impose conditions on its discretionary power to transfer prisoners. Like the prisoner in <em>Wakinekona, </em>Wright does not have a state-created liberty interest in not being transferred to or from any correctional facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b612 Therefore, because none of Wright\u2019s substantial rights are implicated by his being housed at a correctional facility other than the prison in Deer Lodge, we need not apply the two-pronged <em>Leistiko </em>test. However, even if this Court did apply this test, Wright would fail its second prong because the amended statute neither alters the definition of a crime nor increases the punishment. <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 31, 300 Mont. 381, \u00b6 31, 6 P.3d 453, \u00b6 31. Here, as in <em>Duffy, </em>\u201c[t]he conduct of which [the defendant] was accused was illegal and punishable both before and after\u201d the amendment. Moreover, the District Court\u2019s design in declaring that Wright be \u201c[inteligible for parole, placement in any supervised release program or for placement in any program or facility besides Montana State Prison for the first twenty years,\u201d was to ensure that Wright would serve at least twenty years in prison, not to confer to Wright a special privilege to serve in any particular prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b613 The facts presented in this case are similar to those in <em>California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 499, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588. At issue in <em>Morales </em>was a statute that had amended parole procedures to allow the Board of Prison Terms to decrease frequency of parole suitability hearings under certain circumstances. Like Wright, the defendant in <em>Morales </em>contended that the application of the amended parole procedures to his prison sentence violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause because he had been convicted prior to the amendment. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant. The United States Supreme Court, however, granted <em>certiorari </em>and reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision. The Court based the reversal on its application of a version of the <em>Leistiko </em>test and its determination that the amended parole procedures did not \u201cretroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>514 U.S. at 504, 115 S.Ct. at 1601, 131 L.Ed.2d at 594 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court also noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>under Morales\u2019 expansive view, the Clause would forbid any legislative change that has any conceivable risk of affecting a prisoner\u2019s punishment. <em>Morales, </em>514 U.S. at 508, 115 S.Ct. at 1602-03, 131 L.Ed.2d at 596. Here, Wright\u2019s expansive view would similarly preclude any legislative change that would have any possible chance of affecting a prisoner\u2019s punishment, as well as frustrate the DOC\u2019s efforts to prevent overcrowding at its facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b614 Lastly, in his opening brief, Wright asserts that the application of the amended definition of \u201cstate prison\u201d violates his Equal Protection rights; however, Wright failed to make an equal protection argument to the District Court in his petition for a writ of prohibition. Given that \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to fault the ... court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he general rule is that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal,\u201d we decline to address this argument. <em>Montana Fair Housing, Inc. v. Barnes, </em>2002 MT 353, \u00b6 24, 313 Mont. 409, \u00b6 24, 61 P.3d 170, \u00b6 24 (quoting <em>Day v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276-77, 929 P.2d 864, 866).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b615  Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, chiefly that Wright has neither a federal nor a state constitutional liberty interest in being housed exclusively in the state prison located in Deer Lodge, Montana, we conclude that the DOC has the authority to transfer Wright from that facility. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER and RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE NEILL, sitting for former JUSTICE TRIEWEILER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b205-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ai_\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b616 The trial court\u2019s sentencing order in this case is absolutely clear. Wright was to be \u201cpunished by imprisonment in the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, Montana, for the term of SEVENTY-FIVE (75) YEARS.\u201d As the majority concedes, in June of 1996, at the time Wright was sentenced-and at the time he committed his crime on or about August 7, 1995- there was no other adult male correctional facility other than the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, and that is where the District Court ordered Wright to serve his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b617 The governing law is equally clear. The law in effect at the time of the commission of the crime controls as to the possible sentence. <em>State v. Azure </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 281, 282, 587 P.2d 1297, 1298; <em>State v. Stevens </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 452, 455, 904 P.2d 590, 592; <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 26, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 26, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"AmT\">\u00b618 For these reasons, Wright must serve his sentence at the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>State Prison at Deer Lodge. That is what the District Court ordered, and the law in effect at the time Wright committed his crime and was sentenced required that Wright be incarcerated at the Montana State Prison. Accordingly, the Department of Corrections has no authority under the trial court\u2019s sentencing order and under our jurisprudence to remove Wright from the Montana State Prison to some other correctional facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b619 I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis and the decision.' The discussion and analysis are irrelevant, given the trial court\u2019s sentencing order and our case law requiring application of the law in effect in August 1995. The Court\u2019s decision ignores both and, as a consequence, we reach the -wrong result.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b620 I would reverse and order the trial court to grant the writ of prohibition. I dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE COTTER join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
