The jury returned a verdict for the City and the District Court entered judgment on the verdict. Janice appeals from various evidentiary rulings by the District Court and from the judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b62 Janice presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in permitting the City\u2019s expert to render an opinion based on medical articles that were not applicable to the facts of the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">2. Did the District Court err in permitting the City\u2019s expert to testify from a medical article the existence of which he had previously denied and from articles that had not been disclosed?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">3. Did the District Court err in permitting paramedic, Kendall Neff, to estimate the time lapse from arrival of the ambulance to intubation based on \u201chabit\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">4. Did the District Court err in refusing to instruct the jury on concurring, independent causes, which was a central theory of Janice\u2019s case?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">5. Did the District Court err in refusing to instruct the jury on the burden of proof in the case of a single indivisible injury, which was a central theory of Janice\u2019s case?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">6. Did the District Court err in excluding evidence of a cover-up which related to the dispatcher\u2019s credibility?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">7. Did the District Court err in excluding testimony of the paramedics regarding the resuscibility of Ron Christofferson at the scene?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">8. Did the District Court err in excluding the testimony of Janice\u2019s economist on the value of loss of enjoyment of life?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">\u00b64 By way of its cross-appeal, the City questions whether the District Court erred in deciding that hedonic damages are a proper element of damages in a survival action where the decedent survived, but did not consciously experience a loss of enjoyment of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b65 Shortly after midnight on April 3,1998, Ron Christofferson, who suffered from asthma, experienced a respiratory arrest and collapsed, unable to breathe. His wife, Janice, called 9-1-1 and reported that her husband was \u201cnot breathing.\u201d She told the dispatcher that her address was 1909 2nd Street South. Rome Toren and Pam Bramlett, 9-1-1 dispatchers for the City of Great Falls, took the call and dispatched an ambulance. Bramlett erroneously dispatched the ambulance to 1909 2nd Avenue South. Upon arriving at the 2nd Avenue address, the paramedics notified the dispatchers of the mistake. The dispatchers provided the correct address and immediately notified the police of the emergency at the Christofferson\u2019s home. A police officer on patrol near the home arrived seven minutes after the original dispatch. Upon arrival, the police officer and Janice performed CPR until the ambulance arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b66 The paramedics and the ambulance arrived approximately 12.5 minutes after the original dispatch. At the time the paramedics arrived, they were able to discern a weak pulse and observed that Ron was experiencing a slow heart beat, known as a bradycardia heart rhythm. They also recognized that Ron had vomited and aspirated vomitus into his lungs. Paramedic Pat Songer cleared Ron\u2019s mouth and airway and intubated him. Paramedic Kendall Neff administered the necessary intravenous drugs and handled the heart monitor. Once Ron was stabilized, the paramedics transported him to the hospital. Ron never recovered consciousness and died approximately two and one-half days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b67 Prior to trial, the City admitted its negligence but denied that its negligence caused Ron\u2019s death. A jury trial was held on June 4, 2001. On June 11, 2001, the jury issued a special verdict in which it held that the City\u2019s negligence in dispatching the ambulance to the wrong address was not a substantial factor in causing Ron\u2019s death. The court subsequently entered judgment in favor of the City. Janice appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b68 We review a court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 19, 313 Mont. 376, \u00b6 19, 61 P.3d 153, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). Absent a showing of such abuse we will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision. <em>Bingman, </em>\u00b6 19. Moreover, \u201cthe trial court is vested with <em>great </em>latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony.\u201d <em>Baldauf v. Arrow Tank and Engineering, </em>1999 MT 81, \u00b6 22, 294 Mont. 107, \u00b6 22, 979 P.2d 166, \u00b6 22 (emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>original)(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b69 A district court has discretion regarding the instructions it gives or refuses to give to a jury and we will not reverse a district court on the basis of its instructions absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Kiely Const. L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 62, 312 Mont. 52, \u00b6 62, 57 P.3d 836, \u00b6 62 (citation omitted). In reviewing whether a particular jury instruction was properly given or refused, we consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial. <em>Kiely, \u00b6 </em>62. The party assigning error to a district court\u2019s instruction must show prejudice in order to prevail, and prejudice will not be found if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 62. <em>See also, Barnes v. City of Thompson Falls, </em>1999 MT 77, \u00b6 8, 294 Mont. 76, \u00b6 8, 979 P.2d 1275, \u00b6 8 (A trial court is imbued with broad discretion to determine whether or not it will give a proposed instruction to the jury....).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b610 The first two issues we address are whether the District Court erred in permitting the City\u2019s expert to 1) render an opinion based on medical articles that were not applicable to the facts of the case, and 2) testify from a medical article the existence of which he had previously denied and from articles that had not been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b611 We begin our analysis of evidentiary rulings pertaining to expert witness testimony with the recognition that the determination of the qualification of an expert witness is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial judge and such a determination will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Custody of Arneson-Arneson, </em>2001 MT 242, 307 Mont. 60, 36 P.3d 874. Additionally, we note that expert opinion testimony is subject to several caveats. Under Rule 702, M.R.Evid., opinion evidence from a qualified expert is admissible if specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Such expert testimony requires that a proper foundation be established. Expert testimony must also satisfy the relevancy rules set forth in Article IV of the Montana Rules of Evidence. Moreover, full disclosure during discovery -under Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., is designed \u201cto eliminate surprise and to promote effective cross-examination of expert witnesses.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. Harney, </em>2003 MT 58, \u00b6 21, 314 Mont. 384, \u00b6 21, 66 P.3d 305, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b612 In the case before us, both Janice and GF called medical expert witnesses. The parties presented the necessary foundation to qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>these medical professionals as experts in their field and the court accepted both Drs. Knapp and Watson as experts. Janice maintains that Dr. Knapp, GF\u2019s expert witness, based his opinion of Ron\u2019s survivability on medical articles that were irrelevant and/or undisclosed prior to trial. She claims that the disclosed articles relied upon by Knapp were written to address incidents of cardiac, rather than respiratory, arrest. As a result of the inapplicability of the articles\u2019 conclusions, she contends, Knapp gave irrelevant but prejudicial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b613 Our review of the voluminous transcript reveals that Janice\u2019s expert, Dr. Watson, provided testimony that directly refuted Knapp\u2019s testimony as to the relevancy and applicability of these articles to Ron\u2019s condition. Moreover, Janice aggressively cross-examined Knapp.</p>\n<p id=\"A2O\">\u00b614  For a court to abuse its discretion, it must act arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceed the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Perdue v. Gagnon Farms, Inc., </em>2003 MT 47, \u00b6 8, 314 Mont. 303, \u00b6 8, 65 P.3d 570, \u00b6 8. In the case before us, both parties\u2019 expert witnesses presented extensive testimony and both parties were allowed to fully cross-examine the other party\u2019s expert. Additionally, the District Court instructed the jury that they were not bound by either expert\u2019s opinion and that they were to determine the weight to be given to each expert\u2019s testimony based upon the expert\u2019s qualifications and credibility. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b615 Janice further asserts that Knapp gave testimony based on articles that had not been disclosed prior to trial and that, as a result of this \u201csurprise\u201d testimony, she was unprepared to effectively cross-examine Knapp and was therefore further prejudiced. The trial transcript reveals, however, that Jardee did cross-examine Knapp on one of the undisclosed articles, during which Knapp admitted he had not previously disclosed the existence of the article. Furthermore, Janice effectively attacked both the relevancy of the article and Knapp\u2019s credibility on the basis of the article. As to the second undisclosed article Janice challenges, Janice\u2019s expert testified that he was familiar with the article and discredited its relevancy when he explained that articles deriving from cardiac arrest were not pertinent or applicable to Ron\u2019s condition. Again, under these circumstances, we cann\u00f3t conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by permitting Knapp to testify from these articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b616 We next determine whether the District Court erred in permitting paramedic Kendall Neff to estimate the time lapse from arrival of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ambulance to intubation based on \u201chabit.\u201d Janice alleges that this testimony was irrelevant, without foundation and clearly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"AAI\">\u00b617 Two paramedics for the City of Great Falls responded to the 9-1-1 call from Janice-Kendall Neff and Pat Songer. Upon their admittedly delayed arrival, both experienced paramedics proceeded to assess Ron\u2019s condition and begin treating him. The paramedics testified that when two paramedics respond to an emergency call, the required medical duties are divided between them. In Ron\u2019s case, Songer intubated Ron while Neff secured the heart monitor and administered intravenous medication. Songer testified generally that after clearing a patient\u2019s airway, which was required in Ron\u2019s case, it usually takes him less than thirty seconds to intubate. Neff testified that he did not witness Songer intubate Ron, but had no reason to dispute the time it took for Songer to intubate Ron.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b618 In addition to questioning Neff about Songer\u2019s performance at the Christofferson home, GF questioned Neff generally about the manner in which Neff himself performed various emergency paramedic techniques, including how Neff cleared a patient\u2019s airway and intubated a patient. Janice claims that Neff testified it would have taken between two and five minutes to intubate Ron after arriving at the residence, and that this testimony undercut the testimony of the paramedic who actually performed Ron\u2019s intubation. Our review of the following testimony suggests that this is a slight mischaracterization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASvm\">Cross Examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">GF: And I would also like you to assume that you have someone who has aspirated and you had to perform suction prior to intubation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">Neff: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">GF: And based upon these assumptions, would you agree that from the time you entered the door of the residence until intubation was complete it would take two to five minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">Neff: I would guesstimate it would take right around two minutes to do. But that\u2019s with everything else being done, oxygenation, suctioning, bag valve maskings, CPR, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">GF: So you would agree, in fact you told me, didn\u2019t you, given these assumptions, that it would take two to five minutes based upon your experience in doing this previously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">Neff: Yes. With me being the only paramedic out there, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-15\">GF: And we know that it would have taken a little bit longer with [Ron] because someone has to go back to the ambulance and get the battery-operated suction device, don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">Neff: No. I think actually it would be shorter with [Ron] with two paramedics there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">Re-direct Examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Janice: Is that a two-minute estimate, Kendall, based upon one person doing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">Neff: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">Janice: Of course, that wasn\u2019t the case here, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">Neff: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">\u00b619  Janice asserts that the District Court abused its discretion by allowing this testimony. We disagree. Even assuming that Janice\u2019s concerns of relevancy and \u201chabit\u201d foundation have merit, given that the jury had the benefit of Songer\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the admission of this testimony does not rise to a reversible abuse of discretion. \u201cAn abuse of discretion in an evidentiary ruling does not necessarily constitute reversible error.... \u2018Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits ... evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected\u2019 (citation omitted). In other words, \u2018a reversal cannot be predicated upon an error in admission of evidence, where the evidence in question was not of such character to have affected the result.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re A.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 55, 298 Mont. 237, \u00b6 55, 995 P.2d 427, \u00b6 55. From the transcript excerpt quoted above, it appears that Neffs testimony did not contradict or undercut Songer\u2019s testimony in any significant fashion. Moreover, Janice cross-examined Neff, further establishing for the jury that the extended time for intubation was inapplicable to the instant situation involving two paramedics. We therefore conclude that Janice has failed to show that her substantial rights were affected by the admission of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">\u00b620 We next address whether the District Court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on concurring, independent causes, which was a central theory of Christofferson\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">\u00b621 Both parties submitted proposed jury instructions for the court\u2019s approval and presentation to the jury. The transcript contains several pages of jury instruction discussions, held outside of the presence of the jury, that took place over multiple days. In one such discussion, Janice offered several alternate jury instructions addressing the concept of concurring, independent causes of Ron\u2019s death. Specifically, her proposed jury instruction No. 10 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">Except as stated in sub-section (2), the City of Great Falls\u2019 negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to Ron Christofferson or Jan Christofferson if the harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>would have been sustained even if the City of Great Falls had not been negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">(2) If two forces are actively operating, one because of the City of Great Falls\u2019 negligence, the other not because of any misconduct on the City of Great Falls\u2019 part, and each of itself is sufficient to bring about the injury to Ron Christofferson or Jan Christofferson, then the City of Great Falls\u2019 negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing the injury about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b622 GF challenged this jury instruction, arguing that it was inapplicable and inappropriate under the facts of this case. GF asserted that the language in sub-section (2) of the proposed instruction requires that each force, of the two actively operating forces, had to be independently sufficient to bring about Ron\u2019s death. GF maintained that but for Ron\u2019s pre-existing illness causing a respiratory arrest, the delay of the ambulance did not matter. In other words, without the respiratory arrest, the delay of the ambulance could not have caused any harm; therefore the ambulance delay, by itself, was not sufficient to cause Ron\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b623 Following several minutes of discussion on this particular proposed instruction, the court asked Janice\u2019s attorney to respond, at which point, the following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">Janice: Know what, Judge, everyone has convinced me. I\u2019m going to withdraw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">Court: You are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">Janice: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">Court: What are you withdrawing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">Janice: Well, 10 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">Court: Let me just get my list. 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">Janice: 11, 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">(Instructions 11 and 12 were simply variations on the theme of Instruction No. 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">\u00b624 On appeal, Janice argues that 1) she has no recollection of withdrawing Proposed Instruction No. 10; 2) she thought its offer had been denied; 3) the court reporter\u2019s punctuation made it appear that it had been withdrawn; and 4) if such a withdrawal did occur, it was inadvertent. GF argues on appeal that Janice withdrew the proposed instruction and should not now be allowed to claim she did not. In the alternative, GF argues that, even if not withdrawn, the proposed instruction was still inapplicable and the instruction issued by the District Court was a correct statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">\u00b625 The record reflects that Janice did in fact withdraw her Proposed Instruction No. 10. However, even if we assume for the sake of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>argument that she did not, we cannot read section (2) of the proposed instruction as Janice wants us to do. The plain language of the instruction compels us to conclude that GF\u2019s interpretation is correct. Each of the two forces addressed in this section must, by definition, be \u201cof itself... sufficient\u201d to bring about the harm to Ron. The delay in the arrival of the ambulance, standing alone, would not be sufficient to harm Ron-indeed, the ambulance would not have been needed at all but for Ron\u2019s respiratory arrest. Therefore, the instruction simply does not fit the facts before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b626 The District Court did instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">City of Great Falls is liable if its negligence was a cause of injury or death to Ron Christofferson or a cause of injury to Jan Christofferson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">The City of Great Falls\u2019 conduct is a cause of Ron Christofferson\u2019s injury or death or a cause of injury to Jan Christofferson if it is a substantial factor in bringing the injury or death about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We conclude that, given the facts of this case, this was a correct statement of the law. As noted above, we will not reverse if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b627 The next issue before us is whether the District Court erred in refusing to instruct on the burden of proof in the case of a single indivisible injury, which was a central theory of Christofferson\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"AABK\">\u00b628 Janice argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to give two jury instructions shifting the burden of proof from her to GF upon her prima facie showing that GF\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in causing harm to Ron. As we indicated above, a district court has broad discretion regarding the instructions it gives or refuses to give to a jury and we will not reverse a court on the basis of its instructions absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 62. Moreover, an abuse of discretion is not reversible error absent prejudice. <em>In re A.N., </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b629 The requested and denied jury instructions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnI\">Proposed Instruction No. 14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">If you find that the negligence of City of Great Falls was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury or death to Ron Christofferson, and if you find that such negligence has contributed to the confused situation that makes it difficult to prove whether the injury or death were caused by City of Great Falls\u2019 negligence or by Ron Christofferson\u2019s preexisting condition, then the City of Great Falls is liable for the entire amount of damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Proposed Instruction No. 15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-3\">Where a preexisting condition exists which has been aggravated by another\u2019s negligence, it is your duty, if possible, to apportion the damage between that caused by the preexisting condition and that cause by the negligence. But if you find that the evidence does not permit such an apportionment, then the City of Great Falls is liable for the entire amount of the damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">These instructions went to damages and were dependent upon the jury first finding that GF\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in Ron\u2019s injury and death. Because the jury found that GF\u2019s negligence was not a substantial factor in Ron\u2019s death, the court\u2019s refusal to give the jury instructions did not prejudice Janice. <em>See Stenberg v. Neel </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 333, 339, 613 P.2d 1007, 1011 (reversible error cannot be predicated on damage instructions when the jury\u2019s verdict is such that the jury does not reach the issue of damages). We therefore affirm the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b630 We next address whether the District Court erred in excluding evidence of a cover-up which related to the dispatcher\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"ASd\">\u00b631 Dispatcher Rorrie Toren took Janice\u2019s 9-1-1 call the night her husband fell ill. He testified that he correctly relayed the address to Dispatcher Pam Bramlett but Bramlett inadvertently conveyed the wrong address to emergency responders. Toren, who was the shift supervisor that night, testified in the presence of the jury that he did not report this error to his supervisor, did not prepare a written report of the error, and did not preserve the tape of the 9-1-1 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b632 Janice testified that she did not learn the reason for the ambulance\u2019s delay until several months after Ron\u2019s death. She now alleges that the City engaged in a \u201ccover-up\u201d of this event. She argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it granted a motion <em>in limine, </em>following Toren\u2019s above-described testimony, prohibiting her from \u201celiciting any testimony or arguing to the jury that the City, following the dispatch of the ambulance to the wrong address, made no report, made no report to the supervisor, that [Toren\u2019s supervisor] took no action, or that no action was taken against Pam Bramlett, who was the individual that made the wrong dispatch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b633 In support of its motion <em>in limine, </em>GF argued that such testimony was irrelevant. It maintained that the purpose of this case was to determine whether GF\u2019s admitted negligence in dispatching the ambulance to the wrong address caused Ron\u2019s death, and that a dispatcher\u2019s failure to generate a report of the error after it occurred was irrelevant to causation. Moreover, GF argued that such testimony was inflammatory and designed to imply that the City did not care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>enough about Janice or Ron Christofferson to generate a report of their error. Janice countered that such testimony went to Toren\u2019s credibility and, therefore, was relevant under Rule 401, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b634  Without explaining its decision, the District Court granted the City\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Upon review of the transcript and the parties\u2019 arguments, we fail to see the relevancy of the \u201ccover-up\u201d testimony. Relevant evidence is defined at Rule 401, M.R.Evid., as that\"... having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Given that GF admitted its negligence, Toren\u2019s failure to report the address snafu to his supervisor does not make the City\u2019s negligence or liability for Ron\u2019s death any more or less probable. More to the point, given the admission of negligence, we cannot conclude that the credibility of the dispatcher, even if damaged by the revelation, would have any bearing on the case, nor has Janice informed us how the impairment of his credibility would matter. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b635 The seventh issue before us is whether the District Court erred in excluding the testimony of the paramedics regarding the resuscibility of Ron Christofferson at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b636 In their depositions, both Neff and Songer testified that had they been correctly dispatched, they would have arrived at the Christofferson home and begun resuscibility procedures on Ron several minutes earlier, thus enhancing his chances of survival. Prior to trial, GF moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude this testimony. The City argued that Ron\u2019s prospects of survival are properly a subject for expert testimony and that such testimony by Neff and Songer lacked foundation and was speculative. Janice, on the other hand, argued that the paramedics were entitled to testify to these matters as lay witnesses under Rule 701, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b637 Rule 701, M.R.Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">Opinion testimony by lay witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">\u00b638 Rule 702, M.R.Evid., on the other hand, addresses expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">Testimony by experts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b639 In the case before us, we must decide whether the District Court abused its discretion when it determined that the paramedics would be precluded from offering essentially lay medical opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b640 There can be little question that an opinion to the effect that the ambulance\u2019s delay greatly reduced Ron\u2019s resuscibility chances is relevant to the primary issue of the case, and thereby satisfies Rule 701(b), M.R.Evid. The question, therefore, is whether such an opinion may be given by a lay witness, or must be presented only by an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b641 Janice argues that <em>Onstad v. Payless Shoesource, </em>2000 MT 230, 301 Mont. 259, 9 P.3d 38, and <em>Hislop v. Cady </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 243, 862 P.2d 388, support her position, while GF argues that these cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b642 In <em>Onstad, </em>a Payless Shoesource employee was physically and sexually assaulted by a stranger who had previously \u201cflashed\u201d other female employees at the same store and at another Payless store location. Onstad sued Payless, alleging it was negligent in not warning her based on these prior incidents, and in not providing her with a safe and secure workplace. Onstad presented the testimony of three police officers who investigated the assault. Payless challenged the officers\u2019 opinions as to the efficacy of security precautions taken in the particular Payless store, and the predictability of an escalation in severity of a sexual offender\u2019s actions. Payless claimed that such testimony was inadmissible lay testimony. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b643 Payless argued that under <em>Massman v. City of Helena </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 234, 773 P.2d 1206, and <em>Rocky Mountain Ent. v. Pierce Flooring </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 282, 951 P.2d 1326, lay witnesses may not give opinions on topics requiring specialized skill or training. <em>In Massman, </em>an assistant fire chief was questioned about the effect of certain firefighting methods used to contain the fire at issue. The trial court denied introduction of the testimony, ruling that such testimony constituted expert testimony, not lay witness testimony. This Court affirmed the trial court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">His opinion, about the most effective methods for combating such a fire, was based on that specialized, technical knowledge obtained from his fire training and work as an assistant fire chief. As such, the substance of his opinion constituted an expert opinion rather than a lay witness opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u00b644 <em>In Rocky Mountain, </em>the District Court precluded the testimony of a business owner who, after being forced to close his business, attempted to testify as a lay witness as to his business\u2019 future lost profits. The District Court held that projecting lost profits required the skills of an expert, and that the company owner had produced no evidence of having the specialized skill and training of an economist. <em>Rocky Mountain, </em>286 Mont. at 292, 951 P.2d at 1332. We affirmed the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b645 The trial court in <em>Onstad, </em>after weighing the arguments presented by both parties, ultimately concluded that the officers\u2019 lay testimony was admissible, noting that it \u201csprang from their work and experience as police officers.\u201d <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 41. One officer testified that it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that employee safety increases when two employees are present rather than just one. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 41. The other officers testified that a police officer would not have advised a crime victim that the assaulter\u2019s previous \u201cflashing\u201d incidents indicated he was merely a \u201charmless pervert,\u201d as alleged by Payless. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 41. Lastly, the District Court found significance in the fact that Payless had raised the matters at issue in its opening statement, thus opening the door. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 42. Payless appealed and this Court affirmed the trial court. We observed that the District Court had responded to Payless\u2019 objections in a \u201ccareful and considered fashion\u201d and had correctly attributed significance to Payless\u2019 raising of the issue in its opening statement. As a result, this Court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the lay testimony. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b646 Jardee also relies on <em>Hislop, </em>in which a police officer testified at trial that the cause of an accident in which a pedestrian was killed was the fact that he was wearing dark clothes and standing in the highway in the middle of the night, and therefore not visible to oncoming traffic. On appeal, relying on <em>Hart-Anderson v. Hauck </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 444, 781 P.2d 1116, we held that based upon the officer\u2019s \u201cextensive experience in investigation,\u201d he was \u201cproperly qualified through training and experience to testify as to his opinion regarding the cause of the accident.\u201d <em>Hislop, </em>261 Mont. at 249, 862 P.2d at 392. In <em>Hart-Anderson, </em>we similarly concluded that an officer\u2019s testimony regarding the cause of an automobile accident was admissible based upon the officer\u2019s extensive experience as an investigator of \u201cseveral hundred automobile accidents.\u201d <em>Hart-Anderson, </em>239 Mont. at 448-49, 781 P.2d at 1118-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b647 While we did not expressly state in either <em>Hislop </em>or <em>Hart-Anderson </em>that the officers\u2019 testimony was properly admitted as expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>testimony -under Rule 702, as opposed to lay testimony under Rule 701, the language of those cases certainly supports that inference. Then, in 1997, we confirmed that such opinion testimony as to causation from a police officer constitutes expert testimony, affirming the district court\u2019s conclusion that, given the officer\u2019s extensive experience and training, she qualified as an expert under Rule 702, M.R.Evid. <em>State v. Gregoroff </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 1, 951 P.2d 578. We clarified that a law enforcement officer may offer an expert opinion about the cause of an accident, as long as a sufficient foundation for the opinion is offered under Rule 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">\u00b648 More recently, in <em>State v. Nobach, </em>2002 MT 91, 309 Mont. 342, 46 P.3d 618, we held that whether a defendant\u2019s ability to drive safely was diminished as a result of his consumption of drugs required expert opinion testimony. <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6 22. We rejected the police officer\u2019s lay opinion to the effect that the defendant had been impaired by drug consumption, and concluded that the district court had abused its discretion in admitting his <em>lay </em>testimony on this issue. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASz\">Moreover, we are not persuaded that lay people are sufficiently knowledgeable about common symptoms of drug consumption, much less the effects of drug consumption on a person\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle safely, to offer lay opinion testimony on those subjects, based on personal observations, under Rule 701. In addition, [the officer\u2019s] opinions that Nobach\u2019s ability to drive safely was diminished by the consumption of drugs and as to the effect of two depressants purportedly were based on his training and experience, subjects which generally relate to expert opinion testimony. <em>See </em>Rule 702, M.R.Evid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6 17. Significantly, we further concluded that there was insufficient foundation for the acceptance of the officer\u2019s opinion as to drug impairment, because he did not have the training necessary to testify as to the effects of particular drug consumption. Thus, the opinion would not qualify as an expert opinion under Rule 702, and it was therefore error for the district court to admit the evidence. <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b649  Here, plaintiffs argue that the paramedics should have been permitted to offer <em>lay </em>testimony as to the prospects of success of an earlier intubation of Ron, had the ambulance been properly dispatched. Such proposed testimony clearly extends beyond the mens\u2019 observations at the scene or a description of their actions, and into the realm of expert medical opinion. While in <em>Onstad, </em>the officers were not offering scientific opinions, here the paramedics were being called upon to do just that. Our case law clearly requires that a foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>establishing the expertise of a witness to give such opinions must first be laid, pursuant to Rule 702. We conclude that the opinions Neff and Songer gave as to the likelihood of resuscibility had they arrived earlier could not be based on common knowledge, general experience or scene observation, but rather required extensive specialized training and experience. As a result, their testimony fell within the realm of expert testimony requiring foundation, and preclusion of it as lay opinion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b650 The last issues we address concern damages. Janice maintains the District Court erred in excluding the testimony of Christofferson\u2019s economist on the value of loss of enjoyment of life. GF argues on cross-appeal that the District Court erred in deciding that hedonic damages are a proper element of damages in a survival action where the decedent survived, but did not consciously experience a loss of enjoyment of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b651 These final issues relate to the damages that would have been awarded to Janice had the jury determined that GF\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in Ron\u2019s death. Because the jury did not make such a determination, these issues are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b652 Having concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in deciding the foregoing issues, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b510-9\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AYx\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">\u00b653 I concur with the Court\u2019s opinion. However, though I agree with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue 2, I do not condone in any way the actions of the City in regard to the testimony of its expert witness, Dr. Joseph Knapp.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">\u00b654 In his deposition, Knapp testified that he was not aware of \u201cany studies\u201d that pertained exclusively to the survival rate for someone who had suffered a pre-hospital respiratory arrest. However, on cross-examination at trial, when asked the identical question, Knapp testified that he was aware of such studies \u201conly in children.\u201d Knapp had neither corrected his previous deposition testimony nor supplemented his other discovery responses and expert disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"AuE\">\u00b655 Plaintiffs counsel allowed this discrepancy to pass during the remainder of his cross-examination, but objected when defense counsel questioned Knapp about the children\u2019s studies on re-direct examination. Defense counsel responded by arguing that Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>counsel had \u201copened the door\u201d by his single question about existing studies-the question which Knapp had answered differently in his deposition. The District Court overruled Plaintiffs objection, and defense counsel then extensively questioned Knapp concerning the studies and, further, referenced the studies in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">\u00b656 I find that the City\u2019s tactics were unfair, that Plaintiff was ambushed by Knapp\u2019s inconsistent testimony, and it should not have been admitted. However, the Court essentially concludes, and I agree, that no prejudice accrued to Plaintiff by the error, primarily because of Plaintiffs counsel\u2019s astute cross-examination of Knapp and his effective countering of Knapp\u2019s opinion. For the simple reason that I cannot conclude that the outcome of a trial saturated with conflicting expert testimony was affected by this evidentiary error, I concur in the decision to affirm on this issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b511-4\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b657 I respectfully dissent. Believing that instructional error mandates a new trial, my dissent focuses only on Issue 4, the refused causation jury instruction discussed at \u00b6\u00b6 20-26 of the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b658 First, as a preliminary matter, I believe J anice properly preserved this issue for appeal. The majority holds at \u00b6 25 that Janice withdrew Proposed Instruction No. 10 as indicated by the transcript and the docket hearing entry of June 8, 2001. However, the transcript discussion after Janice\u2019s supposed withdrawal clearly indicates Janice wished to preserve the issue for appeal because her attorney continued to discuss and emphasize the application of the multiple cause theory to Janice\u2019s case. Therefore, although it appears from the record that J anice\u2019s attorney inadvertently withdrew Proposed Instruction No. 10, his substantive argument makes clear that he wished to preserve this issue for appeal. The majority implicitly concedes this point by stating at \u00b6 25 \u201ceven if we assume for the sake of argument that [Janice preserved the issue for appeal].\u201d Further, by actually addressing the refusal of the jury instruction, the majority is unclear whether or not the rest of \u00b6\u00b6 25 and 26 is dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b659 Turning to the merits of whether the causation jury instruction offered by Janice should have been given, I believe Janice raises an important issue this Court has not previously addressed and that must be addressed on the facts of this case. According to the record, the parties to this case agreed that duty, breach, and the existence of damages were undisputed. Therefore, the only liability issue submitted to the jury in this case was causation: whether or not the City of Great Falls\u2019 negligence caused Ron\u2019s death. The disputed instruction offered by Janice was directly addressed to the issue of causation and, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>majority notes at \u00b6 20 in its framing of the issue, the instruction was central to the theory of Janice\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b660 In order to determine whether refusal to give the instruction was an error, some background on the purpose and structure of cause-in-fact tests is appropriate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Normally, causation is determined by the \u201cbut for\u201d test. In other words, a defendant is not liable unless the damages suffered by the plaintiff would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d the defendant\u2019s negligent breach of duty. When there are joint or concurrent negligent causes of a victim\u2019s harm, but none of the acts standing alone would have been sufficient to cause the harm, the but for test is used because the victim would still not have suffered the harm but for each cause with the combined conduct viewed as a whole. See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts, \u00a7 41 p. 268 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter KEETON). However, the burden shifts to the defendants to prove proportional responsibility once the plaintiff proves that each defendant was a possible negligent cause. KEETON, \u00a7 41 p. 270-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b661 In contrast, when two or more causes could have each <em>independently </em>brought about a plaintiffs damages, the \u2018Taut for\u201d test is inadequate because it allows a negligent defendant to escape liability, i.e., \u201cbut for\u201d the defendant\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff might still have suffered the same damages because of the other cause. As a result of this failing, the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test has developed to allow a finding of causation when a defendant\u2019s negligence was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the plaintiffs harm. KEETON, \u00a7 41 p. 266-67. This test allows a jury to find causation, and therefore liability, when any one of the possible causes alone would have been sufficient to cause the injury. The example typically used to illustrate this scenario is a fire with two possible causes. A lightening bolt and sparks from a train each ignite different foliage and join to become a fire destroying the victim\u2019s property. Using the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test rather than the \u201cbut for\u201d test to judge causation allows a jury to find the railroad\u2019s negligent maintenance of foliage caused the victim\u2019s damages even though the lightening bolt may have caused the same damage anyway-i.e., the railroad\u2019s negligence alone could have caused the same damages. KEETON, \u00a7 41 p. 266-67; <em>Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S. S. M. Ry. Co. </em>(Minn. 1920), 179 N.W. 45, 46-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u00b662 In sum, when discussing the causation in fact aspects of a claim, the terms \u201cbut for\u201d and \u201csubstantial factor\u201d are used as terms of art to indicate the basic type of situation involved and the contrasting causation in fact tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">\u00b663 In this case, the parties agree that Montana has adopted both of these causation tests, as is reflected in the Montana Pattern Jury Instructions (MPI). <em>See </em>MPI 2.06A and 2.06B. Further, the City agreed to a substantial factor instruction under the facts of this case because Ron could have died either from his illness or from the City\u2019s negligence. And, as the majority notes, the District Court gave a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d instruction. However, the issue Janice raises is not whether a substantial factor instruction should have been given instead of a but for instruction. Rather, the issue Janice raises is whether or not specific wording in a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d instruction must be given in order to properly explain to the jury what can constitute a \u201csubstantial factor.\u201d This issue has never been addressed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b664 In support of her argument, Janice and amicus Montana Trial Lawyers Association (MTLA) assert the jury should have been given an instruction patterned after Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 432 (1965). Based on this section and Montana\u2019s case law dealing with \u201csubstantial factor,\u201d Janice points to a critical error implied by this Court in <em>Rudeck v. Wright </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 41, 709 P.2d 621, then made explicit in Nyriss <em>v. State </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 162, 707 P.2d 5, and, finally, carried through in numerous cases since. <em>See </em>\u00b6 <em>12 infra </em>(citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b665 In <em>Rudeck, </em>Montana was first presented with a case demonstrating the \u201cbut for\u201d test for causation does not properly address every situation. After discussing the inadequacies of the \u201cbut for\u201d test under the facts of that case, the Court properly concluded the substantial factor test was appropriate. <em>Rudeck, </em>218 Mont. at 52-54, 709 P.2d at 628-29. However, in adopting the substantial factor test, the Court erroneously adopted a jury instruction which used the language of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 431 (1965), which is actually not the Restatement\u2019s version of the substantial factor test. Further, the Court made this conclusion regarding the substantial factor test even though the briefs of the parties indicate that what was really at issue was whether or not a proximate cause instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>should have been given because of alleged intervening causes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Then, to compound the error, this Court in <em>Kyriss </em>explicitly stated that the language of \u00a7 431 was the proper language for a substantial factor instruction. <em>Kyriss, </em>218 Mont. at 168, 707 P.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b666 By incorrectly adopting the language of \u00a7 431, the Court set the stage for the error at issue in this case. As mentioned, \u00a7 431 of the Restatement is NOT the Restatement\u2019s articulation of the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test. Indeed, the Restatement does not even use \u201cbut for\u201d and \u201csubstantial factor\u201d as terms of art. <em>See Callahan v. Cardinal Clennon Hosp. </em>(Mo. 1993), 863 S.W.2d 852, 860-63 (fully explaining the difference between the Restatement\u2019s terms of art and Keeton\u2019s terms of art). Rather, the Restatement uses the phrase \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in \u00a7 431 simply as its explanation that causation is a required element of a claim in tort.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 431 reads: \u201cThe actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if... his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>MPI 2.06B. The Restatement then goes on to articulate its versions of the \u201cbut for\u201d test and the substantial factor test in the next section, \u00a7 432. The \u201cbut for\u201d test is in \u00a7 432(1): \u201cExcept as stated in subsection (2), the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.\u201d The \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test is in \u00a7 432(2): \u201cIf two forces are actively operating, one because of the actor\u2019s negligence, the other not because of any misconduct on his part, and each of itself is sufficient to bring about harm to another, the actor\u2019s negligence maybe found to be a substantial factor in bringing it about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b667 As the language of these two sections shows, the but for test and the substantial factor test have specific, but different, requirements. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Further, the substantial factor test is used when two or more forces could each independently bring about the harm. By relying on the language of \u00a7 431 rather than \u00a7 432(2) and by failing to address the Restatement\u2019s use of the term \u201csubstantial factor,\u201d the opinions in <em>Rudeck </em>and <em>Kyriss </em>fail to address the critical distinction between the \u201cbut for\u201d test and the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test, even though both opinions adopted the substantial factor test.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b668 Further, our later cases relying on <em>Rudeck </em>and <em>Kyriss </em>exacerbate the problem by allowing the substantial factor test to be applied anytime there is more than one cause, rather than only when there are multiple causes which <em>independently </em>could have brought about the result. <em>Compare White v. Murdock </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 386, 392, 877 P.2d 474, 478 (\u201ceach of several acts, <em>alone, </em>could have caused the damages\u201d)(emphasis added); <em>Bickler v. Racquet Club Heights Assocs. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 19, 23, 850 P.2d 967, 970 (\u201cbecause the conduct of one or more others <em>would have been sufficient </em>to produce the same result\u201d)(emphasis added); <em>Kitchen Krafters, Inc. v. Eastside Bank </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 155, 167, 789 P.2d 567, 574 (\u201cIf two causes concur to bring about an event, and either one of them, alone, would have been sufficient to cause the identical result, some other test is needed. In response to this problem, the courts have developed the \u2018substantial factor test.\u2019\u201d); <em>Young v. Flathead County </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 274, 282, 757 P.2d 772, 777; and <em>Juedeman v. Montana Deaconess Med. Ctr. </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 311, 318, 726 P.2d 301, 305; <em>with Busta v.

Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 364, 916 P.2d 122, 135 (\u201cif two or more causes concur to bring about an event, then cause-in-fact is established by the \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test\u201d); <em>Roe v. Kornder-Owen </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 287, 293, 937 P.2d 39, 43 (\u201cwhen multiple causes of an event are alleged, the test of causation is whether the conduct in question was a substantial factor in bringing about the event\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b669 Despite the lack of precision in the above Montana cases regarding the substantial factor test, other states have dealt with these causation issues by simply ignoring the distinction between the \u201cbut for\u201d and \u201csubstantial factor\u201d tests altogether. For example, California uses the substantial factor instruction, i.e., the general instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>articulated by Restatement \u00a7 431, for all cases no matter what the type. <em>See </em>1BAJI, CALIFORNIA JURY INSTRUCTIONS, 3.76, 3.77 (9th ed. 2002); <em>see also Callahan, </em>863 S.W.2d at 863 (Missouri uses \u201cdirect\u201d causation language for all cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b670 For whatever merit there may be in the straightforward approach of using one test, at this point in time Montana endorses both a but for test and a substantial factor test. If we are to continue to use both tests, I would address the distinction between the two as articulated by the Restatement and Keeton and hold that the substantial factor test is allowed only when two causes could each <em>independently </em>bring about the eventual harm. Further, I would hold that our current substantial factor instruction as articulated in MPI 2.06B is inadequate because it does not define \u201csubstantial factor\u201d for the jury as an independent cause. While I believe the language of \u00a7 432(2) is a correct statement of the substantial factor test, I believe other similar language would also suffice, i.e., \u201cif this possible cause alone would have been sufficient to cause the injury, it may be a substantial factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAL\">\u00b671 Turning to the facts of this case, Janice argues that a substantial factor instruction patterned after \u00a7 432(2)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was necessary because Ron might have died solely from the City\u2019s negligence rather than from his preexisting condition. Because the intubation successfully restored oxygen to Ron\u2019s blood and because Ron did not suffer any further oxygen deprivation due to his own symptoms before his death, Janice asserts the City\u2019s negligence in failing to arrive at the scene earlier was the sole cause of Ron\u2019s death. Accordingly, Janice asserts the City\u2019s negligence could have independently caused Ron\u2019s death even though his preexisting condition might also have caused it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Janice asserts that the jury did not understand it could find the City\u2019s negligence a cause even though Ron\u2019s preexisting condition was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>a possible cause.</p>\n<p id=\"A4a\">\u00b672 As the facts of this case indicate, where there is a preexisting condition combined with subsequent medical negligence, it is difficult to view the subsequent negligence as a purely independent cause for the reason that medical care is not sought unless there is some already existing problem that could end in harm. For example, in this case, the dispatcher\u2019s admitted negligence would not have even occurred if not for Ron\u2019s preexisting condition-i.e., Janice would not have needed to call for help except that Ron was in respiratory arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b673 The Restatement annotations to \u00a7 432 indicate that courts have generally endorsed the use of a substantial factor test for causation in these sorts of cases. <em>See Bromme v. Pavitt </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 1992), 7 Cal.Rptr.2d 608, 614 (because death could have been caused by preexisting cancer or failure to diagnose it, substantial factor test applies and plaintiff had to establish \u201creasonable medical probability\u2019 that the negligence was sufficient of itself to bring about the death, i.e., the death was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d the result of the negligence); <em>Hilden v. Ball </em>(Idaho 1989), 787 P.2d 1122, 1143 (the substantial factor instruction applies to medical negligence case, but it was harmless error to give a \u201cbut for\u201d instruction when only one doctor\u2019s negligent failure to administer oxygen before surgery was at issue). However, it appears that while the case law endorses a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test, many of the cases go on to use the general \u00a7 431 test rather than the specific test in \u00a7 432(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b674 Further, various discussions also indicate that these types of cases are better addressed using a loss of chance type instruction because such an instruction logically follows the fact scenario involving a preexisting condition. <em>See, e.g., Kyriss, </em>218 Mont. at 166, 707 P.2d at 7 (instruction given that \u201cIf you find that any negligent medical practice on the part of the Defendants substantially reduced the chances for saving Plaintiffs leg, then such a reduction in chance can be a part of the legal cause as defined in this instruction.\u201d); <em>Aasheim v. Humberger </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 127, 695 P.2d 824 (adopting loss of chance instructions, citing Joseph H. King, Jr. <em>Causation, Valuation, and Chance in Personal Injury Torts Involving Preexisting Conditions and Future Consequences, </em>90 Yale L.J. 1353, 1363 (1981) and discussing the causation difficulties presented by such cases); <em>Hamil v. Bashline </em>(Pa. 1978), 392 A.2d 1280 (discussing application of Restatement \u00a7 323 to loss of chance situation where hospital failed to have operable EKG and victim died of heart attack); <em>Battista v. Olson </em>(N.J. Super. Ct. 1986), 516 A.2d 1117, 1125 (substantial factor test applied and plaintiff had to prove \u201cdefendants\u2019 negligent conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>negated a substantial possibility that prompt rescue efforts would have been successful, thereby constituting a substantial factor in causing decedent\u2019s death\u201d in case over police failure to summon medical aid); KEETON, \u00a7 41 Supp. p. 44-45 (discussing how causation and burden of proof are confused in loss of chance cases). Further, loss of chance instructions allow for recovery by the plaintiff victim even when the plaintiff cannot meet the more likely than not burden of proof that the medical negligence caused the death. <em>See Aasheim, </em>215 Mont. at 131-33, 695 P.2d at 827-28. Like the substantial factor test, the ultimate purpose of loss of chance instructions is to provide a causation test that will not allow defendants to unfairly escape liability. However, since a loss of chance instruction was not presented for review on appeal and is not included in the record of this case, that type of instruction is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b675 As to the issue of whether a proper substantial factor type instruction was given, I conclude that the District Court erred. Under the applicable standard of review, as cited by the majority at \u00b6 9, Janice must demonstrate prejudice by showing that the jury instructions in their entirety did not state the applicable law of the case. The majority\u2019s statement at \u00b6 25 that \u201c[t]he delay in the arrival of the ambulance, standing alone, would not be sufficient to harm Ron,\u201d ignores that the delay might in fact have been the cause of Ron\u2019s death. I would hold that because Montana currently distinguishes between the but for test and the substantial factor test and because \u00a7 432(2) properly articulates the substantial factor test, the jury was not given instruction that properly defined the substantial factor test. Consequently, the jury instructions in their entirety did not state the applicable law of the case. Because causation was the only issue submitted to the jury, the instructions were critical to proper jury deliberations. Therefore, I would hold that this case must be reversed and remanded for a new trial with proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b676 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">This dissent is only focused on causation in fact. It does not address issues of legal cause, also called proximate cause, as that is not at issue (and is only at issue in intervening cause cases). <em>See Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 916 P.2d 122.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In <em>Rudeck </em>the defendant doctor Wright who left a lap mat in Rudeck during surgery alleged intervening negligence by the hospital nurses for failure to count surgical sponges and by another doctor for failure to see the lap mat in Rudeck\u2019s abdomen on a subsequent X-ray. However, after joining the nurses and doctor through cross claims, Wright also moved to sever the case into three separate trials; one regarding his negligence to the victim, one regarding the nurses\u2019 negligence and one regarding the other doctor\u2019s negligence. When Wright then sought a proximate cause instruction to address the intervening negligence of the severed parties, the trial court refused such an instruction because it had granted his motion to sever. This Court then affirmed holding that the nurses\u2019 negligence was concurrent and the other doctor\u2019s negligence was foreseeable. However, in discussing the jury instructions this Court contrasted the substantial factor instruction against a but for instruction rather than the proximate cause instruction put at issue by Wright. <em>Rudeck, </em>218 Mont. at 44-46, 50-54, 709 P.2d at 623-24, 627-29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Again, this dissent assumes proximate cause is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Our opinion in <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 357-73, 916 P.2d at 131-41, was primarily addressed to the issue of proximate cause. However, while <em>Busta </em>clarifies previous case law with respect to proximate cause, it does not address the disparity in previous case law regarding causation in fact. Therefore <em>Busta </em>represents proper authority with respect to proximate cause in the cases cited in \u00b6 12, but it does not clarify the variations in cause in fact instructions in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Janice and MTLA assert that \u00a7 432 in its entirety, including subsection (1) and subsection (2), should have been given to the jury. <em>See </em>\u00b6 21 of the majority Opinion. At the same time, MPI 2.06A and 2.06B note that it is error for a District Court to give both a but for and a substantial factor instruction because the two tests are mutually exclusive alternatives. For purposes of this dissent, I assume Janice asserts only that \u00a7 432(2) should have been given to the jury. However, I note here that if language similar to \u00a7 432 is used so that it is clear to the jury that only one of two possible tests can apply, (i.e., subsection (1) applies in every case except where subsection (2) can apply), I would not hold it error to give both tests as instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">As the parties apparently agreed, the but for test is inadequate here because Ron\u2019s preexisting condition might have been the cause as well as the City\u2019s negligence. In other words, while one could ask the jury \u201cbut for the Citjf s negligence, would Ron have been saved,\u201d the jury could conclude under this formulation that but for the City\u2019s negligence, Ron might have died anyway.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
