Lane, Jr., has petitioned this Court pursuant to Rule 17, M.R.App.P., for supervisory control over the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District in Missoula County, and the Honorable John W. Larson, presiding. In support of his Petition, Lane contends that the District Court has erred by denying his motion for summary judgment based on principles of res judicata in an action brought against him by Kimble Properties, Inc., in Missoula County District Court Cause Number DV-01-410. We accept supervisory control and affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">\u00b62 There are two issues presented for this Court\u2019s consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">\u00b63 1. Is this an appropriate case for the exercise of supervisory control?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it concluded that the Plaintiffs claim is not barred by principles of res judicata?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">\u00b65 The Plaintiff, Kimble Properties, Inc., brought this action in the District Court to enforce a judgment recovered against H-D Irrigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Company, Inc., in the District Court for the Sixth Judicial District in Sweet Grass County, Cause Number DV 92-26. In this action, it sought to pierce the corporate veil by alleging that H-D Irrigating was the mere agent or alter ego of William Lane, Jr., its president and sole shareholder. To understand the issue in this case, it is necessary to briefly summarize the facts which form the basis for Kimble\u2019s judgment against H-D Irrigating. The following facts are taken from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>H-D Irrigating v. Kimble Properties, </em>2000 MT 212, 301 Mont. 34, 8 P.3d 95, in which we considered the parties\u2019 appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment entered in the Sixth Judicial District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b66 On February 13,1991, William H. Lane, Jr., agreed with Hobble Diamond Cattle Company and Kimble Properties to purchase land from Hobble Diamond Cattle Company for $1,650,000 and irrigation equipment from Kimble Properties for $350,000. <em>H-D Irrigating, </em>\u00b6 10. Subsequently, on April 1,1991, Lane assigned his rights and his duties regarding the irrigation equipment to H-D Irrigating. Lane was the president of, and sole shareholder in, H-D Irrigating. On May 24,1991, in accordance with the purchase agreement, H-D Irrigating paid Kimble Properties $150,000 and executed a promissory note in the amount of $200,000. <em>H-D Irrigating, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b67 Slightly more than a year later, on June 16,1992, H-D Irrigating and Lane sued Kimble Properties, and Lloyd Kimble, its president, in the Sixth Judicial District Court for alleged misrepresentation and breach of a duty to disclose. They alleged that Kimble falsely represented the condition of the irrigation system and that they had been damaged by its inadequacy. Kimble Properties and Kimble counterclaimed for the balance due for the irrigation equipment. In their counterclaim, the sellers alleged that H-D Irrigating was a mere sham and the alter ego of William H. Lane, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b68 While it is not clear what happened during the entire course of the proceeding, it is clear that Kimble\u2019s alter ego claim was not pursued in its contentions in the pretrial order. It was not discussed in either the plaintiffs\u2019 or defendants\u2019 Proposed Findings of Fact or Conclusions of Law, nor was it discussed in the District Court\u2019s Findings, Conclusions or Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b69 H-D Irrigating\u2019s claim and Kimble\u2019s counterclaim went to trial on March 1,1995. Following trial, the District Court found and concluded that Kimble had made a material misrepresentation upon which Lane reasonably relied and by which Lane was damaged in the amount of $99,575. The District Court also found and concluded that H-D <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Irrigating owed Kimble $200,000 for the irrigation equipment and, after deducting the amount of H-D Irrigating\u2019s damage and adding interest, entered judgment for Kimble in the amount of $123,940.96.</p>\n<p id=\"ARa\">\u00b610 Kimble appealed and H-D Irrigating and Lane cross-appealed the judgment of the District Court. We reversed in part and affirmed in part that judgment on August 10, 2000, and remanded to the District Court for entry of judgment in favor of Kimble and against H-D Irrigating in the amount of $237,495.71. An amended judgment was entered in the District Court on December 4, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b611 On May 29, 2001, Kimble Properties filed this action in the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District in Missoula County to collect its judgment from William H. Lane, Jr., personally. In its complaint, it recited the particulars of the original agreement to purchase irrigation equipment; it noted that shortly after the agreement was entered into, Lane assigned his obligations to H-D Irrigating; and, it pointed out that a judgment had been collected against H-D Irrigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b612 Kimble then alleged that following entry of judgment, it sought to compel Lane to testify regarding H-D Irrigating\u2019s assets but that rather than appear, Lane filed a petition for bankruptcy on behalf of H-D Irrigating pursuant to Chapter 7, Title 11 of the United States Code and received a stay of further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b613 In this action, Kimble has alleged that H-D Irrigating\u2019s only business was related to purchase of the irrigation equipment; and, that it was formed by Lane, who was its sole shareholder and president, for the sole purpose of avoiding his obligation to pay for that equipment. Kimble alleged that H-D Irrigating had not been adequately capitalized to fulfill its obligations under the agreement and that it sold the irrigation equipment, along with the ranch, in 1995 or 1996, without preserving sufficient funds to pay for the equipment. Kimble further alleged that H-D Irrigating had at least $125,000 of liquid assets as recently as July 29,1998, but that schedules attached to its bankruptcy petition indicate that its only remaining assets have a value of $2618.30. Finally, Kimble alleged that H-D Irrigating was the mere agent or alter ego of William H. Lane, Jr., and formed solely for the purpose of enabling him to avoid his contractual obligations. It asks, as a matter of equity, that Lane be held personally responsible for satisfying Kimble Properties\u2019 judgment against H-D Irrigating.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">\u00b614 Lane moved the District Court to dismiss Kimble\u2019s complaint based on principles of res judicata. He alleged that because Kimble had alleged alter ego in his original counterclaim, and because the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Court had not pierced the corporate veil in the Sixth Judicial District Court action, that claim was extinguished and barred by the previous judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b615 In reliance on the four-part test for application of res judicata established by this Court in <em>Phelan v. Lee Blaine Enterprises </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 296, 716 P.2d 601, the District Court concluded that Kimble\u2019s claim had not been extinguished by the prior judgment because the subject matter of this action and the issues raised by this action were different from those decided by the Sixth Judicial District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b616 Lane contends that the District Court has made a mistake of law which, if uncorrected, would cause a significant injustice by requiring that Lane defend against an action which is barred as a matter of law. Lane, therefore, contends that appeal is an inadequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b617 Is this an appropriate case for the exercise of supervisory control?</p>\n<p id=\"A59\">\u00b618  In <em>Plumb v. Fourth Jud. Dist. Court </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 363, 368-69, 927 P.2d 1011, 1014, we concluded that supervisory control is appropriate where the district court is preceding under a mistake of law and, in so doing, is causing a gross injustice. In this case, Lane contends that he is being asked to re-defend against a claim that was previously made and extinguished by a previous judgment of another district court. If he is correct, he is entitled to summary judgment. If the district court was wrong when it denied his motion for summary judgment, requiring that he defend against the same claim a second time and incur the attendant delay and expense, would cause a gross injustice. Therefore, we conclude that the issue raised by Lane is appropriate for resolution by way of supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err when it concluded that the Plaintiffs claim is not barred by principles of res judicata?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u00b620 Lane asks that we review and reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for summary judgment. We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny summary judgment de novo. <em>Spinler v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 348, \u00b6 14. We consider the same criteria on which the district court relies and which are found at Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., where it states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b621 Lane contends that the doctrine of res judicata bars Kimble\u2019s action because Kimble previously sought to hold Lane personally liable for H-D Irrigating\u2019s debt on the basis of alter ego and that the current action has been filed on that same basis. Lane relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hall v. Heckerman, </em>2000 MT 300, 302 Mont. 345, 15 P.3d 869. Lane contends that the District Court erred by holding that principles of res judicata do not apply based on the fact that alter ego had not actually been litigated in the first action because this Court held in <em>Hall </em>that actual litigation of an issue is not determinative. Lane contends that the doctrine of res judicata bars not only issues litigated, but also those which could have been litigated in the former action and that that includes Kimble\u2019s alter ego claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b622 Kimble Properties contends that the District Court correctly denied summary judgment because its current alter ego claim was not previously adjudicated and, therefore, is not barred by the doctrine of res judicata. It relies on <em>Phelan v. Lee Blaine Enterprises </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 296, 716 P.2d 601. The District Court concluded that <em>Phelan </em>was controlling; that it had not been specifically overruled by our decision in <em>Hall, </em>and that <em>Phelan </em>required denial of Lane\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Phelan, </em>the claimant filed an action in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to set aside a previous settlement agreement based on mutual mistake of fact. The trial court dismissed her action as barred by principles of res judicata because of a prior petition in the same court which sought a determination that the amount of her settlement was insufficient in light of her disability. This Court noted that even though she had previously sought a determination that her settlement had been inadequate, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s previous judgment dealt only with her disability status at that time. We set forth the following test for whether Phelan\u2019s claim was barred by principles of res judicata:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u2018These criteria are: (1) the parties or their privies must be the same; (2) the subject matter of the action must be the same; (3) the issues must be the same, and must relate to the same subject-matter; and (4) the capacities of the persons must be the same in reference to the subject-matter and to the issues between them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">Of the four criteria set out in <em>Smith, </em>the parties agree the important one in the present case is criteria (3) which is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>identity of the issues. The rule regarding the identity of the issues is simple. If the issues in the second case were not raised <em>and determined </em>in the first case, then the judgment of the first case does not bar the second action....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><em>Phelan, </em>220 Mont. at 299, 716 P.2d at 602-03 (citing <em>Smith v. County of Mussellshell </em>(1970), 155 Mont. 376, 378, 472 P.2d 878, 880).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b624 For the foregoing reason, we held that Phelan\u2019s claim to have her settlement set aside as inadequate was not barred by principles of res judicata because, even though raised, that issue had not been decided in the previous action. <em>Phelan, </em>220 Mont. at 301, 716 P.2d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b625 <em>la. Hall, </em>the plaintiffs sought to establish a prescriptive easement over the defendant\u2019s property parallel to an easement they had been awarded in prior litigation, but which they subsequently learned did not cross the defendant\u2019s property. The defendant moved to dismiss based on the doctrine of res judicata and that motion was granted by the district court. On appeal, Halls contended that the elements of res judicata had not been established because the subject matter and issues raised in the second action were not the same. We held, however, that res judicata bars not only those issues which were actually determined but those which could have been determined. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 17. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">We have held that the doctrine of res judicata bars \u201cnot only the issues litigated in the former action, but also issues which might have been litigated in the former action.\u201d <em>Mills v. Lincoln County </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 283, 286, 864 P.2d 1265, 1267. A judgment is \u201cbinding and conclusive between all the parties to the suit and their privies and successors in interest, as to all matters adjudicated therein and as to all issues which could have been properly raised irrespective of whether the particular matter was in fact litigated.\u201d <em>Orlando v. Prewett </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 478, 481, 771 P.2d 111, 113, <em>quoting Kramer v. Deer Lodge Farms Co. </em>(1944), 116 Mont. 152, 156, 151 P.2d 483, 484.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b626 We concluded that Halls could have claimed the easement by necessity in their original action and that, therefore, the issues and subject matter were the same in their second action. On that basis, we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claim based on the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u00b627 Based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Phelan, </em>which the District Court noted had not been reversed in <em>Hall, </em>the District Court concluded that Kimble\u2019s alter ego claim was not barred, even though raised in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>previous action, because it had not been decided in the previous action, nor was it part of the same transaction that was decided. The District Court relied on <em>Travelers Insurance Co. v. St. Jude Hospital, </em>(5th Cir. 1994), 37 F.3d 193, 196-97, for application of the \u201ctransactional test\u201d to determine whether the subject matter of the first action and this action are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b628 We acknowledge that depending on the facts of each case, language in <em>Phelan </em>could lead to a result different than one based on the language in <em>Hall. </em>We also agree that there is merit to the transaction test applied by the District Court and set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u00a7 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b629 However, for purposes of resolving the issue before us, it is not necessary to establish preference for a <em>Phelan </em>approach or a <em>Hall </em>approach. We conclude that Kimble\u2019s claim against Lane is barred under neither approach. Kimble\u2019s alter ego claim was neither decided in the previous litigation nor, based on the facts alleged in this case, could it have been decided in the previous litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b630  To pierce a corporate veil requires not only proof that H-D Irrigating was the agent or alter ego of William H. Lane, Jr., but that the corporate entity was created to further a wrongful purpose. In <em>Berlin v. Boedecker </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 444, 458, 887 P.2d 1180, 1188, we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">We have defined a two-prong test for piercing the corporate veil. First the trier of fact must find that the defendant was either the alter ego, instrumentality, or agent of the corporation. <em>Drilcon, Inc. v. Royal Energy Corporation, Inc. </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 166, 176, 749 P.2d 1058, 1065. Second, the trier of fact must find evidence that the corporate entity was used as a \u201csubterfuge to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, or perpetrate fraud.\u201d <em>Drilcon, </em>749 P.2d at 1065.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b631 Although Kimble alleged in the first cause of action that'H-D Irrigating acted as the alter ego of William H. Lane, Jr., it did not allege the second prong of the test for piercing the corporate veil, nor could it have done so. It is apparent from Kimble\u2019s complaint in this action that the facts which give rise to the second prong did not even occur until final judgment in the first cause of action was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"AU4\">\u00b632 The District Court\u2019s original Findings, Conclusions and Order, were entered in the Sixth Judicial District Court action on July 14, 1998. Kimble alleges in this complaint that H-D Irrigating still had at least $124,000 of liquid assets in its possession as of July 29, 1998, based on an offer of settlement tendered by H-D Irrigating\u2019s attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>on that date. However, at some subsequent date, Kimble alleges that H-D Irrigating, under Lane\u2019s control, liquidated all but $2618.30 of its assets without providing for payment of Kimble\u2019s judgment and then filed for bankruptcy protection. All these facts are critical to Kimble\u2019s effort to pierce the corporate veil. However, none of these facts were known to Kimble until it sought to examine Lane following entry of the District Court\u2019s second amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b633 Our decision is consistent with the approach taken in other jurisdictions where parties have sought to bar efforts to collect judgments by piercing the corporate veil based on the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b634 For example, in <em>Backus v. Watson </em>(Ala. 1993), 619 So.2d 1342, the plaintiff, after recovering a judgment for damages against an incorporated club, filed an action against the club\u2019s previous owner to have him held personally liable for the judgment by piercing the corporate veil. The former owner relied on the doctrine of res judicata as an affirmative defense. In Alabama, as in Montana, the doctrine of res judicata bars a subsequent suit between the same parties on, not only those issues which were litigated, but those which could have been litigated. However, the Alabama Supreme Court held under circumstances similar to those in this case, that the doctrine of res judicata did not bar Backus\u2019s action to pierce the corporate veil. The court noted that it was not until postjudgment proceedings that Backus realized that the former owner may have ignored the club\u2019s corporate existence and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">Backus\u2019s present action against Watson was based on a cause of action entirely different from the one in which her action against the club was based, and in the present action she sought to litigate an issue that was not litigated, and could not have been litigated, under the pleadings in her action against the club, even though Watson appeared at the trial of that action and apparently participated in the club\u2019s defense. The litigation of the central issue presented in this action-whether the club was operated as Watson\u2019s alter ego and therefore, whether the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d should be pierced-has not been foreclosed by a previous judgment binding as between these parties. Therefore, the trial court could not have properly relied on the doctrine of res judicata as a basis for its judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>Backus, </em>619 So.2d at 1344-345 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b635 In <em>Wells v. A.V. Davis </em>(Kan. 1979), 603 P.2d 180, the Supreme Court of Kansas came to the same conclusion even though alter ego <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>had been pled in the original action. In that case, Wells had Originally sued a moving van company and its principal owner for wages and recovered a judgment against the company. He had alleged that the company was the individual defendant\u2019s alter ego. However, that claim was not litigated and no judgment was returned against the individual stockholder. Following entry of the first judgment, Wells attempted to satisfy the judgment but was unsuccessful due to the company\u2019s insolvency. He then brought a second action against the same individual owner, again alleging that the company had been his alter ego. The individual owner moved to dismiss the second claim based on a theory of res judicata and the district court granted that motion. However, after noting that in Kansas, as in Montana, the doctrine of res judicata forbids re-litigating not only claims actually presented and considered, but those which might have been presented and decided, the Supreme Court of Kansas concluded that the doctrine did not apply in the facts of that case. The Kansas court concluded it was significant that Wells had no prior knowledge of the company\u2019s insolvency and that the premature joinder of the former owner, based on the original alter ego claim, was not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b636 In <em>Macris &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Neways, Inc. </em>(Utah 2000), 16 P.3d 1214, 1221, the Supreme Court of Utah arrived at the same result based on its conclusion that the plaintiff was not required to bring an alter ego claim in the original action in which damages were required if unaware of the facts which gave rise to the alter ego claim, and for the additional reason that the original claim for damages and the alter ego claim were based on different sets of facts and evidence. Other courts have held that the subsequent alter ego claim is not barred by res judicata because it is not a re-litigation of the original claim but simply an effort to collect the original judgment. <em>See Matthews Construction Co., Inc. v. Rosen </em>(Tex. 1990), 796 S.W.2d 692, and <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Mmahat </em>(5th Cir. 1992) 960 F.2d 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"AXy\">\u00b637  We conclude that the action brought in the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District to pierce the corporate veil on the basis that H-D Irrigating, was or is the alter ego of William H. Lane, Jr., is not barred by the doctrine of res judicata because it was neither adjudicated previously in the Sixth Judicial District Court nor were the facts upon which it is based known to Kimble Properties, at the time the complaint and counterclaims were filed in that action, or at any other time during the course of that action. For these reasons, we affirm the order of the District Court denying the motion of William H. Lane, Jr., for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u00b638 This case is remanded to the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District for farther proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b91-4\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, COTTER, RICE and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b91-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ARM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b639 As in our recent case of <em>Truman v. Eleventh Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 91, 315 Mont. 265, 68 P.3d 654 (Gray, C.J., dissenting), I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision on Issue 1, and concede that I erred in joining the Court\u2019s February 26,2002, order concluding that this matter is appropriate for supervisory control. In my view, supervisory control was improvidently granted. My dissent in the present case is based on grounds similar to those set forth in my <em>Truman </em>dissent, and is premised on my growing concerns over the frequency of our exercise of supervisory control over matters pending in the district courts, especially when we cannot keep up with our \u201cstock in trade\u201d case load of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b640 In <em>Truman, </em>the Court based its exercise of supervisory control jurisdiction on the fact that the case presented an issue of first impression in Montana. My dissent pointed out that if we accepted every question of first impression arising in Montana on supervisory control, we would become a court of first resort, rather than last resort, far too often. Here, the Court concludes at \u00b6 18 that exercising supervisory control over a trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on the matter of whether <em>res judicata </em>controls is appropriate because, if the trial court erred in denying summary judgment, Lane would have to defend against the same claim a second time, with the attendant delay and expense, thereby causing a gross injustice. While purporting to rely on <em>Plumb, </em>it is clear the Court is now abandoning both the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d and \u201cinadequate remedy of appeal\u201d factors in that case. In other words, it appears that this Court will now-whenever it chooses-exercise supervisory control over any legal ruling in any trial court on an issue of law when delay and expense might accompany finishing the trial court proceedings and pursuing an appeal. This is a far cry from what I believe <em>Plumb </em>intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b641 In <em>Truman, </em>the Court also included within its exercise of supervisory control discretionary acts by the trial court relating to the admission of evidence. The numbers of pretrial discretionary rulings by trial courts across Montana every year must surely be in the tens of thousands. Will we spend this Court\u2019s limited time resource entertaining ever-increasing numbers of petitions for supervisory control and responses based on discretionary pretrial rulings, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>take considerable time to read even in the event we deny supervisory control, and at the same time intrude ever more into the trial courts\u2019 proceedings, authority and scheduling difficulties?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b642 At the bottom line, the Court is using supervisory control jurisdiction to transform the traditional structures and roles of the trial courts and this Court. A \u201cgross injustice\u201d apparently now means only an erroneous-or potentially erroneous-ruling or an alleged pretrial abuse of discretion which, if not corrected by this Court\u2019s intervention, will permit the proceedings in the trial court to proceed in their normal course with their associated delays and expenses. In the future, will any rational attorney refrain from petitioning for 'supervisory control on any nonappealable ruling at any stage in trial court proceedings? On what grounds will the Court ever find reason to deny supervisory control? And how in the world does such an approach comport with either the trial courts\u2019 general authority to control the proceedings before them or our primary role as an appellate court?</p>\n<p id=\"Ate\">\u00b643 In the past, we commonly denied supervisory control in cases involving an interlocutory, nonappealable order reviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Kosena v. Dist. Ct. </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 21, 560 P.2d 522. In cases such as this one, which involve a ruling denying summary judgment on legal grounds, the rationale for rejecting review via supervisory control is that an order denying summary judgment is subject to later review by the trial court if circumstances warrant. \u201c[I]n the usual case good judicial administration requires freedom of action by the district court prior to trial and noninterference on our part at this stage.\u201d <em>See Kosena, </em>172 Mont. at 22, 560 P.2d at 523. We also observed in <em>Kosena </em>that only extraordinary and compelling circumstances-'beyond simply requiring a party to proceed to triaT\u2019-should warrant review via supervisory control. <em>See Kosena, </em>172 Mont at 22-23, 560 P.2d at 523. The same rationale is appropriate with regard to a trial court ruling granting summary judgment. Indeed, it is my view that the <em>Kosena </em>reasoning is as valid-and as critical to the proper administration of justice in Montana-today as it was in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b644 I admit that I joined the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Plumb </em>in November of 1996. I thought the Court meant <em>all </em>the things said therein, including the necessity of extraordinary circumstances and gross injustice. And I have joined in any number of opinions since that time which, with the hindsight which is so often more accurate, seemed like appropriate exercises of supervisory control at the time. I cannot undo those decisions; but I can refrain from joining in increasing numbers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>of such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b645 In the six-year period from 1991 through <em>1996-Plumb </em>having been decided on November 22, 1996-this Court granted supervisory control, in whole or in part, in 35 cases. In the six years following <em>Plumb-that </em>is, 1997 through 2002-we did so in 60 cases. I see no signs of the numbers declining and, as I suggested in my <em>Truman </em>dissent and above, such a decline is altogether unlikely when the Court continues to show such a lack of restraint in addressing cases seeking supervisory control. Indeed, I submit that the numbers will continue to increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b646 Looking at the opinions on <em>appeals </em>issued by this Court for the relatively short period from the beginning of 2001 to early this month provides a frightening picture of where we may be headed if the Court continues expanding the cases in which it determines supervisory control jurisdiction is appropriate. Approximately 39 cases involved an issue relating to the grant or denial by a trial court of a motion to dismiss in a civil case. The same number of cases involved an issue relating to the denial by trial courts of motions to dismiss in criminal cases. An additional 11 appeals raised the issue of whether a trial corut erred in denying a speedy trial challenge by a criminal defendant. These 90 or so cases on <em>appeal </em>involved pretrial, interlocutory legal rulings by trial courts properly raised on appeal. Under the Court\u2019s expanded view of supervisory control, it appears that all of these issues can now be presented via a petition for supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b647 In addition, over the same short time frame, we have addressed a trial court\u2019s <em>res judicata </em>ruling, such as that involved and accepted for supervisory control in the present case, in 13 appeals. Similarly, from January of 2001 until early April of 2003, we issued opinions on <em>appeal </em>addressing the grant or denial of summary judgment in approximately 100 cases. Presumably, all <em>res judicata </em>and summary judgment rulings now may be raised in petitions for supervisory control and will be considered by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b648 Finally, <em>Plumb </em>requires not just a gross injustice, but a mistake of law by a trial court. In the present case, the Court <em>affirms </em>the District Court\u2019s legal ruling. Neither a gross injustice nor a mistake of law is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b649 I simply cannot agree with the Court\u2019s ever-expanding definition of whether cases are appropriate for our exercise of what is supposed to be \u201cextraordinary\u201d supervisory control jurisdiction. It is far too intrusive into our trial courts\u2019 appropriate spheres of action. It is far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>too unfair to the litigants who have proceeded through trial court proceedings, who are before this Court on appeal awaiting the \u201cend of the road\u201d in their long-standing legal disputes, and who must wait even longer because of the excessive numbers of supervisory control petitions the Court is accepting. And finally, if we intend to continue to increase our work load by encouraging ever more numerous petitions for supervisory control, we should have the decency to quit speaking publicly about our crushing work loads and the long hours we put in.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b650 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
