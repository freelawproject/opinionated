We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AIi\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b63 (1) Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Kullicks do not have an implied easement by existing use over Skyline Drive;</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u00b64 (2) Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Kullicks do not have an implied easement by necessity over Skyline Drive; and</p>\n<p id=\"b175-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u00b65 (3) Whether Skyline Homeowners Association is entitled to costs and attorney fees pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AiT\">\u00b66 This appeal concerns the Kullicks\u2019 claim that they hold an easement for ingress and egress over and across Skyline Drive, a road located in the Skyline Development east of Hamilton. Defendant and Respondent, Skyline Homeowners Association, is a corporation vested with authority over roads within the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b67 In 1973, Harold and Marilyn Mildenberger purchased several hundred acres of ranch land from a Mr. Mahoney. The Mildenbergers then sold a 216-acre section of the property to Dee Shook and James Mildenberger. Shook and Mildenberger used the property to create the Skyline Development, a residential development that currently consists of 24 tracts. The development is bordered to the north by a state highway, to the east by the Ward Ranch, and to the west by the Arrowhill Ranch. The Ward and Arrowhill ranches are the remaining parcels owned by the Mildenbergers.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b68 In 1991, the Mildenbergers sold approximately 13 acres of the Ward Ranch to the Kullicks on a contract for deed. The northwest corner of the Kullicks\u2019 property terminates at the southeast corner of the Skyline Development. Skyline Drive ends at a cul de sac located at this junction. The Kullicks access Skyline Drive at the cul de sac and use Skyline Drive to access the state highway. In 1994, the Kullicks and the Skyline Homeowners Association entered into a one-year revocable license agreement, under which the Kullicks were permitted to use Skyline Drive for residential ingress and egress to their property for consideration of $100. The Kullicks executed one-year renewals of the license in 1995 and 1996. The license expired in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b69 The Kullicks\u2019 contract for deed contains a clause, which provided for the creation, by the Mildenbergers, of an alternative access route to the Kullicks\u2019 property in the event that the Kullicks\u2019 access to Skyline Drive was lawfully challenged and terminated within six years of the date of the contract. This guarantee expired in 1998. Currently, there are several dirt roads connecting the Kullicks\u2019 property to the Ward Ranch and the ranch to the state highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b610 Skyline Homeowners Association sued the Mildenbergers in 1994, claiming that the Mildenbergers did not have an easement to use Skyline Drive as a matter of law. Although the Kullicks were also using Skyline Drive pursuant to the license agreement, they were not named as defendants in the suit. In 1996, the Twenty-First Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>District Court, Ravalli County, held that no express or reserved easement existed, and permanently enjoined the Mildenbergers from using Skyline Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b611 Following the expiration of their license agreement in 1997, the Kullicks sued the Homeowners Association, claiming that they were the owners of an easement for ingress and egress over Skyline Drive by virtue of written grant, necessity, and/or estoppel. The Homeowners Association filed an answer and counterclaim, requesting a declaratory judgment that the Kullicks did not have an easement to use Skyline Drive. Following subsequent filings, the Homeowners Association moved for summary judgment on grounds that the Kullicks\u2019 action was barred under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel by the District Court\u2019s 1996 judgment against the Mildenbergers, in which the court determined that the Mildenbergers did not have an easement over Skyline Drive. In addition, the Association argued that the Kullicks\u2019 various theories for the existence of an easement were without merit. The Kullicks filed a response and argued that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel were irrelevant, and that the existence of an easement was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b612 The District Court granted the Association\u2019s motion and dismissed the Kullicks\u2019 easement claim. The court also permanently enjoined the Kullicks from using Skyline Drive. The Kullicks appeal from that portion of the judgment dismissing their claim for an implied easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b613 The standard of review for a grant of summary judgment is <em>de novo. </em>This Court will apply the same evaluation as the trial court under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. The moving party must establish both the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Gonzales v. Walchuk, </em>2002 MT 262, \u00b6 9, 312 Mont. 240, \u00b6 9, 59 P.3d 377, \u00b6 9. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must, in order to raise a genuine issue of material fact, present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of its case rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements. <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6 9. In addition, our standard of review of a question of law is whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions are correct. <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Adx\">Issue One</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b614 First, we consider whether the Kullicks have an implied easement by existing use over Skyline Drive. We conclude that under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, the Kullicks\u2019 claim that such an easement exists is barred because this issue was litigated and ultimately resolved by the District Court in the 1994 action between Skyline Homeowners Association and the Mildenbergers.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b615 In <em>Hoyem Trust v. Galt, </em>1998 MT 300, \u00b6 22, 292 Mont. 56, \u00b6 22, 968 P.2d 1135, \u00b6 22, we stated that \u201can easement implied from existing use, arises only if, prior to the time the title or tract is divided, a use exists on the \u2018servient part\u2019 that is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the \u2018dominant part,\u2019 and a court determines that the parties intended the use to continue after division of the property.\u201d We noted that \u201c[f]or a use to give rise to an implied easement from existing use, it must be apparent and continuous at the time the tract is divided.\u201d <em>Hoyem Trust, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b616 The District Court rejected the Kullicks\u2019 claim for an implied easement by existing use on grounds that the issue was litigated in the prior action brought by Skyline Homeowners Association against the Mildenbergers in 1994, and that the Kullicks\u2019 claim was, therefore, barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. According to the court, the Kullicks\u2019 proposed implied easement by existing use could only have existed if the Mildenbergers had established, in 1994, that an easement existed over Skyline Drive for their own benefit. The Mildenbergers, however, were unsuccessful in their attempt to establish such an easement in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b617  Res judicata and collateral estoppel are based on a judicial policy favoring a definite end to litigation. <em>Rausch v. Hogan, </em>2001 MT 123, \u00b6 14, 305 Mont. 382, \u00b6 14, 28 P.3d 460, \u00b6 14. Res judicata bars a party from relitigating a matter that the party has already had an opportunity to litigate. <em>Olson v. Daughenhaugh, </em>2001 MT 284, \u00b6 22, 307 Mont. 371, \u00b6 22, 38 P.3d 154, \u00b6 22. Res judicata applies if the following four elements have been satisfied: (1) the parties or their privies are the same; (2) the subject matter of the present and past actions is the same; (3) the issues are the same and relate to the same subject matter; and (4) the capacities of the persons are the same in reference to the subject matter and to the issues between them. <em>Hall v. Heckerman, </em>2000 MT 300, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 345, \u00b6 13, 15 P.3d 869, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b618  Collateral estoppel is a form of res judicata, and bars the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>reopening of an issue that has been litigated and resolved in a prior suit. <em>Finstad v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>2000 MT 228, \u00b6 28, 301 Mont. 240, \u00b6 28, 8 P.3d 778, \u00b6 28. Collateral estoppel has three elements: (1) the identical issue raised was previously decided in a prior adjudication; (2) a final judgment on the merits was issued in the prior adjudication; and (3) the party against whom the plea is now asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication. <em>Finstad, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b619  The Kullicks\u2019 claim for an implied easement by existing use is derivative of the Mildenbergers\u2019 1994 easement claim. The Kullicks continue to argue that Skyline Drive was the existing access between the state highway and the Ward Ranch at the time they acquired their lot from the Mildenbergers. The Kullicks maintain that they can use Skyline Drive because the Mildenbergers intended for use of the road to extend to the them. The validity of this theory depends entirely upon the legitimacy of the Mildenbergers\u2019 use of Skyline Drive-an issue litigated in 1994 and resolved in Skyline Homeowners Association\u2019s favor by the District Court in 1996. We conclude that the Kullicks are attempting to raise an issue previously adjudicated and conclusively resolved adversely to Mildenbergers, their predecessors in interest. Accordingly, the Kullicks\u2019 claim is barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Issue Two</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b620 We next consider whether the Kullicks have an implied easement by necessity over Skyline Drive. We conclude that because there was no unity of ownership of the parcel sold to the Kullicks and the property on which the proposed easement exists, the Skyline Development, the Kullicks do not have an implied easement by necessity over Skyline Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b621 As <em>Hoyem </em>indicates, an easement by necessity may exist under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">[wjhere an owner of land conveys a parcel thereof which has no outlet to a highway except over the remaining lands of the grantor or over the land of strangers, a way of necessity exists over the remaining lands of the grantor. Similarly, a way of necessity is found when the owner of lands retains the inner portion conveying to another the balance, across which he must go for exit and access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\"><em>Hoyem Trust, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u00b622 <em>Hoyem </em>also set forth the following basic elements of an easement by necessity as (1) unity of ownership, and (2) strict necessity at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>time the unified tracts are separated. <em>Hoyem, </em>\u00b6 18. Thus, \u201c[a] right-of-way by absolute necessity is created by implied grant over the remaining lands of the seller when the owner of a tract of land sells a part of the tract that has no outlet to a public road except over the other lands of the seller.\u201d <em>Hoyem Trust, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">\u00b623 In the present case, the District Court rejected the Kullicks\u2019 argument and concluded that even if Skyline Drive currently provides the only outlet to the state highway from the Kullicks\u2019 property, the easement claimed by the Kullicks-to use Skyline Drive-runs across property not owned by the the Kullicks\u2019 grantors, the Mildenbergers. According to the court, there was no common ownership of the Skyline Development (the potential servient tenement) and that portion of the Mildenbergers\u2019 property sold to the Kullicks (the potential dominant tenement) prior to the Kullicks\u2019 purchase in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b624 On appeal, the Kullicks maintain that, for purposes of determining whether unity of ownership existed, the relevant severance occurred not in 1991 when the Mildenbergers sold a portion of the Ward Ranch to the Kullicks, but in 1973 when the Mildenbergers sold that parcel on which the Skyline Development in now located. According to the Kullicks, this 1973 severance is the \u201ckey event giving rise to [the] Kullicks\u2019 claim.\u201d The Kullicks contend that the implied easement by necessity was created at that time between the Skyline Development and the property retained by the Mildenbergers. They note that prior to 1973, a roadway existed across the Skyline property that provided access to the Mildenbergers\u2019 property, including that portion later sold to the Kullicks. This roadway, now Skyline Drive, was used by the Mildenbergers to access their property. The Kullicks assert that the roadway was \u201creadily apparent to anyone viewing the property ... and was obviously being used to access the western portion of the Mildenbergers\u2019 ranch for numerous years ....\u201d They also contend that the Mildenbergers intended to preserve an easement for their remaining property, including the future Kullick parcel. They conclude that this implied easement passed to future owners of parcels severed from the Ward Ranch, including their parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b625 The Kullicks\u2019 argument demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the unity of ownership requirement of an implied easement by necessity. The Kullicks suggest that the concept of an implied easement by necessity is broad enough to apply not only between the grantee claiming an easement and his grantor when the grantor retains the potential servient tenement, but also between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>grantee and a third party to whom the grantor already conveyed the potential servient tenement. As Skyline Homeowners Association observes, this proposition contradicts the general rule that the creation of an implied easement by necessity requires that the easement be granted over the <em>grantor\u2019s land, </em>and never over the land of a third party or stranger to the title. <em>Schmid v. McDowell </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 233, 238, 649 P.2d 431, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b626 The Kullicks fail to distinguish <em>Schmid. </em>In <em>Graham v. Mack </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 165, 175, 699 P.2d 590, 596-97, we affirmed <em>Schmid </em>and rejected the very argument raised by the Kullicks in the present case. <em>Graham </em>involved circumstances similar to those presented here. Graham purchased a lot from Collingson, which contained a railroad grade that could have provided access from Collingson\u2019s remaining lots to a nearby highway. At the time of the sale, Graham requested assurances from Collingson that the grade would not be used as an access route between the highway and Collingson\u2019s other lots. In addition, Graham placed obstructions, including a fence and several logs across the grade to prevent its use. Several years later, Collingson sold one of his remaining lots to Mack, who then removed the fence erected by Graham, and began using Graham\u2019s lot to access the highway. <em>Graham, </em>216 Mont. at 168-70, 699 P.2d at 591-93. When Graham sued Mack to quiet title, Mack argued that an implied easement by necessity existed over Graham\u2019s property. <em>Graham, </em>216 Mont. at 175, 699 P.2d at 596. We determined that no such easement existed because Mack had failed to make the requisite showing of unity of ownership. <em>Graham, </em>216 Mont. at 176, 699 P.2d at 597. This conclusion was based, in part, on the fact that Graham was \u201ca complete stranger\u201d to the title obtained by Mack from Collingson. <em>Graham, </em>216 Mont. at 176, 699 P.2d at 597. At the time Mack purchased his lot, Collingson did not have the power to grant Mack an easement over the lot Collingson had sold to Graham years before. <em>Graham, </em>216 Mont. at 176, 699 P.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b627  <em>Graham </em>applies in the present case, where the Kullicks\u2019 argument for an implied easement by necessity assumes that there was unity of ownership. Their argument fails because such an easement requires unity of ownership of the servient and dominant tenements by the grantor <em>at the time of the grant. </em>The District Court appropriately reasoned that because the Kullicks\u2019 parcel was not severed from the Skyline Development, but from the remaining portion of the Ward Ranch owned by the Mildenbergers, there was no unity of ownership of the proposed respective servient and dominant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>tenements at the time of that severance. The Skyline Development and its owners were complete strangers to the 1991 conveyance between the Mildenbergers and the Kullicks. In the absence of unity of ownership of the servient and dominant tenements, there is no implied easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Issue Three</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b628 We finally consider whether Skyline Homeowners Association is entitled to costs and attorney fees. Rule 32, M.R.App.P., provides that \u201c[i]f the supreme court is satisfied from the record and the presentation of the appeal in a civil case that the same was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, such damages may be assessed on determination thereof....\u201d Rule 32 sanctions may be appropriate if an appeal is \u201centirely unfounded and intended to cause delay ....\u201d <em>Greenup v. </em>Russell, 2000 MT 154, \u00b6 24, 300 Mont. 136, \u00b6 24, 3 P.3d 124, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"A6a\">\u00b629  The Homeowners Association argues that the Kullicks brought this appeal in bad faith, and for the sole purpose of perfecting a claim against the Mildenbergers. In light of the preceding discussion of the Kullicks\u2019 claims, we disagree. Although the Kullicks\u2019 arguments are unsound, there is no evidence that these arguments were made in bad faith. Neither does the Homeowners Association assert that the appeal is unfounded or that it was intended to cause delay. The Association only speculates as to the purpose of the appeal. Such speculation is insufficient grounds for awarding Rule 32 sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b630  In summary, we conclude that the Kullicks\u2019 claim for an implied easement by existing use is barred under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, and that their claim for an implied easement by necessity is not supported by a showing of unity of ownership. The Kullicks have not presented substantial evidence that they hold an implied easement over Skyline Drive, either by existing use or by necessity. Thus, the Kullicks have not raised a genuine issue of material fact, and have not satisfied their burden of opposing summary judgment. For these reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Skyline Homeowners Association.</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
