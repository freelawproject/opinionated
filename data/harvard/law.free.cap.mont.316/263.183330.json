We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Earl\u2019s motion to continue filed three days prior to the jury trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court properly instruct the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the State present sufficient evidence for the jury to convict Earl of sexual assault against T.W. and A.W.?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">\u00b66 4. Are Earl\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel record-based and, therefore, subject to review on direct appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">\u00b67 On July 31, 2000, the State filed an Information charging Earl with two counts of sexual assault, both felonies, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. Count one alleged that Earl subjected T.W., a six year old girl, to sexual contact without consent during the month of November or December 1998. Count two alleged that Earl subjected A.W., a twelve year old girl, to sexual contact without consent some time between August 1, 1997, and March 31, 1998. Earl pled not guilty to both counts and the District Court set a jury trial for December 20, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">\u00b68 Prior to trial, Earl moved the court to continue the matter and waived his right to a speedy trial. The District Court granted Earl\u2019s motion and set a new trial date for April 24, 2001. On April 17, 2001, Earl again moved the District Court to continue the matter. The District Court granted Earl\u2019s second motion to continue and reset the trial for May 14, 2001. On May 11, 2001, Earl filed a third motion to continue. The District Court granted Earl\u2019s motion and later rescheduled the trial for January 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">\u00b69 On January 25,2002, Earl filed a Motion to Dismiss or Continue. Earl argued that the State violated the omnibus hearing order in that it \u201chas not produced the Statements of ANY witnesses let alone their witnesses in chief.\u201d On the morning of trial the District Court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Earl\u2019s motion and the case proceeded to trial. At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Earl moved the court for a directed verdict. The District Court denied Earl\u2019s motion. On January 29, 2002, the jury found Earl guilty of both counts of sexual assault. Following a sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Earl to twenty years in the Montana State Prison on count one and ten years in the Montana State Prison on count two. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively. On June 14,2002, Earl filed a Notice of Appeal from the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADO\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b610 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Earl\u2019s motion to continue filed three days prior to the jury trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b611 In March 1999, Undersheriff Dan Ames contacted and interviewed several people with regard to the alleged sexual assaults on T.W. and A.W. During the course of his investigation, Ames elicited statements from various witnesses. On January 25, 2002, three days prior to trial, Earl learned of the existence of the witness statements and discovered that he did not have copies of the statements. Therefore, Earl moved the court to continue the trial to give him additional time to investigate the content of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b612 In his motion, Earl argued that the court\u2019s prior omnibus order obligated the State to provide Earl with the names, addresses, and statements of all of its witnesses. He maintained that the State failed to convey the statements justifying dismissal of the charges or, at the very least, a continuance. On appeal, Earl argues that his trial counsel was left with only three days to consider and react to the statements\u2019 content. Earl asserts that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d justified a continuance and, now, compel reversal of the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b613 A ruling on a motion to continue is subject to the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. Borchert </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 320, 324, 934 P.2d 170, 173. We review discretionary district court rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Borchert, </em>281 Mont3. at 324, 934 P.2d at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u00b614 Section 46-13-202, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">Motion for continuance. (1) The defendant or the prosecutor may move for a continuance. If the motion is made more than 30 days after arraignment or at any time after trial has begun, the court may require that it be supported by affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">(2) The court may upon the motion of either party or upon the court\u2019s own motion order a continuance if the interests of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>so require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">(3) All motions for continuance are addressed to the discretion of the trial court and must be considered in the light of the diligence shown on the part of the movant. This section must he construed to the end that criminal cases are tried with due diligence consonant with the rights of the defendant and the prosecution to a speedy trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b615 On the morning of trial, the District Court entertained oral argument on Earl\u2019s motion to continue. The State notified the court that: this is not a case where the State rejected the defense\u2019s request for a document; it had a transmittal letter dated May 19, 2000, indicating that the State sent a copy of Ames\u2019 report to Earl; \u201cfor quite some time\u201d prior to trial Earl had in his possession a psychosexual evaluation, conducted in March 2001, which referenced the witness statements; it maintains an open file policy which would have permitted Earl to copy the statements at any time throughout the pendency of the charges; and it faxed the statements to Earl on January 25, 2002. Based on this information, the Stillwater County Attorney concluded, \u201cit\u2019s my belief that he had it all, but even if he didn\u2019t have it, I think it was incumbent upon the defendant to come in and check and make sure he had everything we had in our file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b616 Earl acknowledged the State\u2019s open file policy but, nevertheless, \u201cassumed that all of the documents had been sent.\u201d Earl\u2019s trial counsel conceded that \u201cthe Court\u2019s admonition to me on Friday that I maybe ought to have looked a little closer is well-taken.\u201d Further, Earl\u2019s trial counsel claimed that he never received the May 19, 2000, transmittal letter or accompanying documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b617 Following the parties\u2019 arguments, the District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Based on arguments of counsel, it\u2019s clear to the Court that the Stillwater County Attorney\u2019s Office does have an open file policy. Wherein, the defendant can, as I understand it, come and review all of the evidence that\u2019s in the State\u2019s file and make such copies and reproductions of the materials in that file as the defendant deems warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">Furthermore, the Court is very aware that this case has gone on for almost two years .... And there has been an abundance of time for counsel to make such discovery as counsel needs to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">Also, the omnibus hearing order provides that if discovery is not made, that a motion can be brought to the Court to compel such discovery as may be necessary. Clearly, to make such motion the Friday before the Monday of trial is not a timely motion in the Court\u2019s view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Further, I would, for the record, state that the statute says that, \u201cThe State shall make available to the defendant for examination and reproduction ... the materials which the defendant has referred [sic].\u201d And clearly, based on what\u2019s before the Court here, the State has discharged its statutory obligation. For those reasons, the motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b618  In addressing Earl\u2019s motion to continue, the District Court was to consider \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d and \u201cthe diligence shown by the movant.\u201d The record suggests something other than a diligent effort on the part of Earl\u2019s trial counsel to obtain the requisite information. Further, Earl has not presented a compelling argument that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d mandated a continuance. For these reasons, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Earl\u2019s fourth motion to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b619 Did the District Court properly instruct the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b620 Upon settling jury instructions, the State offered sixteen instructions. Earl objected to only one instruction, instruction number twelve which defined \u201csexual contact.\u201d Initially, Earl offered only one instruction. However, Earl withdrew the instruction following the court\u2019s decision to utilize instruction number twelve over Earl\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b621 On appeal, Earl states that the District Court erred when it failed to: instruct the jury on the elements of sexual assault; instruct the jury about a factor which would increase the maximum statutory penalty; and properly instruct the jury on the definitions of \u201csexual contact,\u201d \u201cwithout consent,\u201d and \u201cknowingly.\u201d Earl concedes that his trial counsel objected to the \u201csexual contact\u201d instruction only. However, Earl insists that we should address all of the allegedly erroneous instructions pursuant to the common law plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\u00b622  In criminal cases, jury instructions must be reviewed as a whole, and if they fully and fairly present the law to the jury, the jury has been properly instructed. <em>State v. Detonancour, </em>2001 MT 213, \u00b6 57, 306 Mont. 389, \u00b6 57, 34 P.3d 487, \u00b6 57. The test to be applied is whether, when an instruction is considered as a part of the whole body of instructions, the instruction is prejudicial to the appealing party. <em>Detonancour, </em>\u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u00b623 Section 46-16-410(3), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] party may not assign as error any portion of the instructions or omission from the instructions unless an objection was made specifically stating the matter objected to, and the grounds for the objection, at the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of instructions.\u201d Generally, an appellant must establish that an objection was made at trial on the same basis as the error asserted on appeal. <em>State v. Davis, </em>2000 MT 199, \u00b6 38, 300 Mont. 458, \u00b6 38, 5 P.3d 547, \u00b6 38. Requiring a defendant to specifically raise the objection at trial gives the prosecution and trial court an opportunity to avoid or correct the purported error. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 38. Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b624 With respect to the jury instructions, four out of five of Earl\u2019s assignments of error have been raised for the first time on appeal. Earl does not assert that we should consider his untimely objections pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. Instead, Earl submits that we should entertain his assignments of error pursuant to the common law plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b625 We have stated our standard of review for plain error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">[T]his Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstanding the inapplicability of the \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. The plain error doctrine is to be employed sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to the narrow circumstances articulated in <em>Finley. Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215. Plain error review should not act as \u201ca prophylactic for careless counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 284, \u00b6 23, 312 Mont. 458, \u00b6 23, 59 P.3d 1122, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b626 Based on our review of the record and the arguments presented, we do not believe that failing to review the four previously unraised objections will result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of fundamental fairness of the trial, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. Since we decline to invoke our discretionary plain error review and since Earl did not lodge an objection to four of the five assignments of error at trial, Earl did not preserve those issues for our consideration on appeal. Earl did object to the \u201csexual contact\u201d instruction at trial. Therefore, we will proceed to analyze the validity of that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b627 The District Court utilized Montana Criminal Jury Instruction 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>107 (1999) in instructing the jury on the definition of \u201csexual contact.\u201d That instruction provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cSexual contact\u201d means the touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The comment to the above instruction states that \u201c[t]he definition in this instruction only applies to offenses committed on or after October 1, 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b628 Prior to October 1,1999, the Legislature defined \u201csexual contact\u201d as \u201cany touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of either party.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-101(65), MCA (1997). As the 1997 definition does not contain the \u201cdirectly or through clothing\u201d language and as Earl committed the alleged offenses prior to October 1, 1999, Earl argues that \u201cthe amended definition of \u2018sexual contact\u2019 did not apply to the facts of this case, and, therefore, the jury was improperly instructed upon the definition of\u2018sexual contact.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b629 In <em>State v. Olson </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 364, 951 P.2d 571, the defendant argued that the prosecution did not prove its sexual assault charge beyond a reasonable doubt, in part, because the victim had clothing on at the time of the alleged sexual contact. We rejected this argument, stating \u201cOlson did not have to have direct contact with T.H.\u2019s vaginal area underneath her clothing to have sexual contact with her. His rubbing T.H.\u2019s vaginal area on the outside of her clothing was sufficient evidence to prove sexual contact.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>286 Mont. at 374, 951 P.2d at 577 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b630  Upon objection to the State\u2019s \u201csexual contact\u201d instruction, the court and Earl\u2019s trial counsel engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">Court: Well, Mr. Johnson, what would be wrong with such an instruction in light of State versus Olson ...?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">Mr. Johnson: Well, Your Honor, in State versus Olson, they\u2019re talking about...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">Court: It seems to be the same kind of conduct alleged here. And I don\u2019t know how-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-12\">Mr. Johnson: I will at this point concede that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-13\">Court: I\u2019m going to give Plaintiffs Offered Instruction No. 12 because I believe it\u2019s a correct statement of the law of Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9p\">We conclude that, pursuant to <em>Olson, </em>the \u201csexual contact\u201d instruction given to the jury accurately represented the law. Therefore, the jury was properly instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b631 Did the State present sufficient evidence for the jury to convict Earl of sexual assault against T.W. and A.W.?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b632 For various reasons Earl contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had \u201csexual contact\u201d with T.W. and A.W. We review the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction by viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and then determining whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Haser, </em>2001 MT 6, \u00b6 18, 304 Mont. 63, \u00b6 18, 20 P.3d 100, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b633 Section 45-5-502(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] person who knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent commits the offense of sexual assault.\u201d As indicated above, the court instructed the jury that \u201csexual contact\u201d meant \u201cthe touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b634 With regard to T.W., Ames testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">[Earl] also admitted that he\u2019s touched her in the crotch area before, but it wasn\u2019t-I think he phrased it, \u201cin that sort of manner.\u201d Then he said several times during the interview that he never touched her skin-to-skin. Also, during the interview he made a comment something like that it\u2019s a shame that he liked a 6-year-old more than he did his wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Further, T.W. testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">Q: Can you tell us-what did you tell the undersheriff when you talked to him, do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">A: Well, that [Earl] molested me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">Q: Now, do you remember an incident when you were watched by Mr. Earl?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">Q: And so what happened with that incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">A: I\u2019m not sure, but he just started ... touching me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">Q: When you say he started to touch you, do you know what area of your body he did touch you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-17\">A: (Witness nods.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-18\">Q: And where would that be? [T. W.], would it be easier to show us instead of saying it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-19\">A: No. Down below the waist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Q: And so how did that make you feel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">A: Uncomfortable, very uncomfortable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">Q: Did you say anything to him then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">A: I told him to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">Q: And what did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">A: He stopped it, but it kept going on. After a few days, he started to do it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">Q: Now, did he say anything about whether or not you should tell anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">A: He told me not to tell anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\u00b635 As for the alleged sexual assault on A.W., A.W. testified that on one particular evening when she was thirteen Earl bought a bottle of alcohol for her and Earl\u2019s girlfriend, Lynette. After consuming the alcohol, Earl, Lynette, and A.W. all laid down on a bed. Then, according to A.W., they \u201cwere all laying on the bed, next thing you know I felt a hand going down my pants and I kind of rolled over and it happened again.... I rolled off the bed to get away from him.\u201d Earl testified on his own behalf at trial and denied T.W. and A.W.\u2019s accounts of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\u00b636  As we stated above, the standard of review for challenges to the sufficiency of evidence supporting a conviction is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. This standard \u201cgives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 453, 457, 781 P.2d 281, 284. Based on a review of the foregoing testimony, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that the State proved the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">\u00b637 Are Earl\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel record-based and, therefore, subject to review on direct appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">\u00b638 Earl argues that the assistance he received from his trial counsel \u201cfell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d Earl cites fifteen instances where the actions or inactions of his trial counsel evince the purportedly ineffective representation. To more efficiently address Earl\u2019s allegations, we have recharacterized the ineffective assistance claims and divided them into two categories: (1) inadequate investigation, failure to prepare a defense, lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>familiarity with the law, failure to inform Earl of his rights and options, inadequate jury instructions, and inadequate voir dire; and (2) failure to object to witness testimony, inadequate opening statement, and inadequate cross examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b639 In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal or in postconviction proceedings, we apply the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Pursuant to the <em>Strickland </em>test, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>See Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 10, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 10 (citations omitted). Before we will address the merits of ineffective assistance claims, we must determine whether the claims are properly before the Court or whether they are procedurally barred. Where ineffective assistance claims are based on facts of record they must be raised on direct appeal. <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 12, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 12, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 12. Conversely, where the ineffective assistance allegations cannot be documented from the record, the claims must be raised by petition for postconviction relief. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b640 In <em>White, </em>we stated that \u201c[a]s for those clearly non-record based areas of representation, this Court has identified counsel\u2019s failure to adequately investigate, or failure to prepare a defense, or failure to familiarize him or herself with critical areas of the applicable law.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 18. Further, we concluded that \u201cthe failure to fully inform a defendant of the consequences of his various options and rights may constitute a non-record ineffective assistance claim-although the prejudicial results of the ineffectiveness appear on the record.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 18. We also stated that the \u201cfailure of counsel to offer a particular jury instruction, generally, will be a non-record matter as well.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 19. Finally, we recently concluded that \u201c[t]he reasons for counsel\u2019s actions or inactions [during voir dire] should not be \u2018assumed\u2019 but should be the subject of a postconviction evidentiary inquiry.\u201d <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 30, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 30, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 30. Based on the foregoing, all of Earl\u2019s ineffective assistance claims which we have assigned to the first category are non-record based claims and, therefore, are not properly before us on direct appeal. We now turn to the second category of ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b641  Generally, an alleged failure to object to witness testimony constitutes a record-based action and, therefore, appropriate for direct appeal. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 15. Alternatively, decisions regarding the timing and number of objections lie within counsel's tactical discretion and, thus, should not be considered on direct appeal. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 16. Rendering an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>improper opening statement or closing argument may qualify as a record-based instance of ineffective assistance. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 17. However, we have also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">Though not easily distilled into a formula, the definitive question that distinguishes and decides which actions are record and which are non-record, is <em>why </em>? In other words, if counsel fails to object to the admission of evidence, or fails to offer an opening statement, does the record fully explain <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action? If not, then the matter is best-suited for postconviction proceedings which permit a further inquiry into whether the particular representation was ineffective. Only when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>White, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b642  As for the second category of ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we conclude that the record simply does not explain why Earl\u2019s trial counsel undertook the allegedly insufficient actions. That is, the record does not indicate why Earl\u2019s trial counsel: presented a brief opening statement to the jury, cross examined A.W. and Lynette the way he did, and did not object to certain expert and lay witness testimony. Accordingly, we hold that the second category of ineffective assistance claims are non-record based and, therefore, cannot be reviewed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b643 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b300-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
