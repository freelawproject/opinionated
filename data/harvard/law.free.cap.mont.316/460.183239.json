During and after the move, the units sustained damage. The Kellys filed negligence and breach of contract claims against Hall. Hall counterclaimed against the Kellys for breach of contract. Following a non-jury trial, the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, concluded that the Kellys failed to establish that Hall negligently moved the units. Further, the court determined that both parties breached the House Moving Agreement and, as such, neither party could recover against the other. Both parties appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b62 The parties present the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it concluded that the Kellys failed to establish their negligence claim against Hall?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it concluded that each party breached the House Moving Agreement and, therefore, neither party could recover under their respective breach of contract claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b65 In January 2000, Laura and John Kelly purchased four fourplex residential units (designated 706A, 706B, 718A, and 718B) for investment purposes. The units stood on a site where Walmart intended to build a new store. Thus, the Kellys purchased the units with the knowledge that they would have to be relocated. Toward this end, in February 2000, the Kellys contracted with O\u2019Neil House Moving of Williston, North Dakota, to move the units. The Kellys experienced difficulty securing a temporary storage location which resulted in termination of the arrangement with O\u2019Neil.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b66 Thereafter, George Hall of Rocon House Moving approached the Kellys about moving the units. The Kellys agreed to pay Rocon $9500 to move each unit. In turn, Hall agreed to obtain $75,000 cargo insurance on each unit in the event the units sustained damage in the move. The agreement required Rocon to move the units twice, first to a temporary storage site and then to permanent foundations.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b67 On March 10, 2000, Rocon proceeded to move the structures. During the move, the trailer transporting 706B dropped into a water or sewer line trench causing considerable damage to the unit. A wrecker had to pull the trailer and 706B out of the predicament. Further, the Kellys assert that the units hit trees, telephone poles, streetlights, delineator posts, and mailboxes during the move, damaging the siding, gutters, soffits, and shingles on 706A and 706B. Ultimately, Rocon transported the four units to a temporary site north of Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b68 After the move to the temporary site, the Kellys sought remuneration for the damaged structures. At that point, the Kellys discovered that Hall procured cargo insurance for only two of the units, 706A and 706B. The Kellys submitted claims to the insurance carrier, Scottsdale Insurance Company, with respect to 706A and 706B. Scottsdale denied the claims and on April 19, 2000, filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against Hall and the Kellys. Therein, Scottsdale sought to void the insurance coverage or reduce its exposure because Hall allegedly misrepresented the value of the units and failed to disclose, or concealed, other pertinent information.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">\u00b69 On May 24, 2000, the Kellys filed an Answer to the Complaint and, simultaneously, filed a cross-claim against Hall. The cross-claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>sought breach of contract damages for Hall\u2019s failure to procure cargo insurance. Further, the Kellys alleged that Hall negligently damaged the structures in preparation for and during the move. On May 31, 2000, Hall filed a counterclaim against the Kellys. Hall sought breach of contract damages for the Kellys\u2019 failure to secure permanent foundations for the units. Hall alleged that this delay unnecessarily encumbered his equipment. Hall sought payment of the outstanding contract price and damages at the rate of $100 a day for each day that his equipment remained with the units.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b610 On April 1, 2002, the case proceeded to a non-jury trial. As of the time of trial, some two years after the move, the Kellys had yet to secure permanent foundations for the units. Rocon left its moving equipment with the units for a considerable period of time but removed it just prior to trial. At trial, the Kellys asserted that Rocon further damaged the units when it removed its equipment from the temporary location prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b611 On May 20, 2002, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order. The court found that Hall did not misrepresent or conceal information in procuring the cargo insurance. The court found that unit 706A sustained damage in the move totaling $34,209. The court found that 706B, valued at $75,000, sustained irreparable damage in the move. Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of the Kellys and against Scottsdale in the amount of $109,209.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b612 The court concluded that the Kellys failed to establish that Hall negligently moved the units. Further, the court found that both Hall and the Kellys breached the House Moving Agreement-Hall failed to obtain cargo insurance on all of the units and the Kellys failed to secure permanent foundations for the units. Therefore, the court determined \u201cthat based upon the breaches of Hall and the Kellys, the parties are not able to collect damages from each other.\u201d On June 17, 2002, the Kellys filed a notice of appeal from the portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment which denied recovery against Hall. On June 27, 2002, Hall filed a notice of appeal from the portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment which precluded his recovery against the Kellys. Scottsdale is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Daines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906. In determining whether a court\u2019s findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>fact are clearly erroneous, we apply a three-part test. First, we review the record to determine if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Rettig v. Kallevig </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 189, 193, 936 P.2d 807, 809. Second, if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, we determine whether the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809. Third, if substantial evidence exists and the trial court has not misapprehended the effect of the evidence, we may still adjudge a finding clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the record leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809. We review conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aii\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err when it concluded that the Kellys failed to establish their negligence claim against Hall?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b615 The Kellys argue that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact with regard to the negligence claim are not supported by substantial evidence. Conversely, the Kellys assert that substantial evidence supports their contention that the units were damaged due to Hall\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b616 The court entered few findings with respect to the negligence claim. The court simply found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">33. This Court finds that the Kellys and Scottsdale failed to establish that Rocon was negligent when the buildings were moved. Testimony was given about the procedure used by Rocon. It is uncontested that Rocon used a different procedure than O\u2019Neil and that Rocon removed bracing that was installed by Rocon and Kelly. However, Kellys have not established that Rocon\u2019s procedure was the cause of the damages to the fourplexes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">34. Mark Coppe, inspection officer for O\u2019Neil, stated in his deposition that the problem was that the c-channel steel was not strong enough for the two story fourplexes which lacked a floor. However, Mr. Coppe also stated that many house movers would use the very same procedure that Rocon used and that he was not present when the fourplexes were moved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">\u00b617 As the foregoing findings demonstrate, the court cites solely the testimony of Mark Coppe in support of its negligence determination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>However, Mark Coppe\u2019s testimony does not stand for the proposition cited by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b618 Mark Coppe conceded that he was not present when Hall moved the fourplexes. However, Mark Coppe examined the units after the move and developed an opinion as to the cause of the damage based on his twenty-five years of experience in the field. He opined that Hall\u2019s moving technique subjected the units to the damage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">The problem was using channel iron steel instead of steel beams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">[W]hen you have a two-story building like that, you have to consider the weight of the second story .... [I]f that had been like a garage type of structure with the peg walls, you could get by with that type of system of just using channel iron, but when you have a building of that size, you have to use steel beams going both directions to support the weight of all of the walls which are supporting the weight of the upper level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">I don\u2019t think channel beams could get the job done, period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u00b619 Throughout his testimony, Mark Coppe never wavered from this position. He did indicate that Hall\u2019s technique would have been sufficient to move smaller structures but he never stated that \u201cmany house movers would use the very same procedure that Rocon used\u201d under similar circumstances. Perhaps the District Court confused Mark Coppe\u2019s testimony with that of John Richards, discussed in greater detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b620 The Kellys presented additional evidence to support Mark Coppe\u2019s opinion. Brunno Coppe, a housemover from O\u2019Neil with approximately twenty-nine years of experience, testified that he would use Hall\u2019s moving method on smaller buildings. Brunno Coppe testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think... it was a good idea to use it on this building being as big as it was and heavy as it was.\u201d Brunno Coppe stated that the units were more likely to suffer damage as a result of Hall\u2019s moving technique as compared to that recommended by Mark Coppe.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b621 Jim Schilke, a structural engineer, testified that the units were \u201cdoomed to be damaged\u201d due to Hall\u2019s moving technique. Schilke stated that \u201cthe channel iron or the cross members were undersized significantly, sometimes [by] ... a factor of 2.0 times. In other words, they were overstressed by a factor of about two times what they should be able to take.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u00b622 John Richards, a foreman with O\u2019Neil who has moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>approximately 2000 houses, testified that he has used Hall\u2019s technique on \u201csmall buildings like garages and some smaller single stories on occasion.\u201d However, he had \u201cnever once\u201d considered Hall\u2019s technique for the Kellys\u2019 units because they were \u201ctoo big a structure for that kind of [technique] .... [I]t would be a risk in traveling ....\u201d Richards speculated that other movers would undertake the risky procedure employed by Hall. However, in light of the testimony presented, such a procedure appears inappropriate to accomplish the task at hand. Mere speculation that other movers might undertake similarly risky action should not militate against the standard of care evidence presented by the Kellys.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b623  Aside from Richards\u2019 speculative statement, the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order references no evidence to rebut the Kellys\u2019 negligence claim. Additionally, the court did not address damage which Hall concedes occurred in transit (hitting a post and the like) and upon cribbing the units for removal of Hall\u2019s equipment. Thus, we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s negligence findings are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred when it found that the Kellys failed to establish Hall\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b624 Did the District Court err when it concluded that each party breached the House Moving Agreement and, therefore, neither party could recover under their respective breach of contract claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b625 The District Court found that \u201cthe parties agreed that George Hall would obtain cargo insurance on all four of the fourplexes.\u201d The court also implicitly found that, pursuant to the House Moving Agreement, the Kellys were required to provide permanent foundations for the units shortly after the initial move. The court determined that Hall secured insurance for only two of the units, in violation of the agreement. Further, it found that \u201c[a]s of the time of trial, the Kellys had yet to obtain a site and build a foundation to place the fourplexes.\u201d Based on these findings, the court concluded that \u201cboth Rocon and the Kellys breached the House Moving Agreement\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe parties are not able to collect damages from each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b626 Hall argues that the House Moving Agreement required the Kellys to furnish the requisite cargo insurance. Therefore, according to Hall, he did not breach the agreement and is entitled to recover from the Kellys based on their failure to provide permanent foundations.</p>\n<p id=\"ANh\">\u00b627 The Agreed Facts in the Pretrial Order and Hall\u2019s testimony belie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Hall\u2019s position on appeal. The original House Moving Agreement does contain a boilerplate provision which obligates the property owner to procure the necessary cargo insurance. However, the Agreed Facts in the Pretrial Order state that \u201cHall agreed to purchase the [cargo] insurance.\u201d Further, Hall testified that he told the Kellys he would procure the cargo insurance on all four units. He stated that he failed to comply with the obligation because \u201cI run out of money and-plainly run out of money. I didn\u2019t have the money to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b628  There is sufficient evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Hall agreed to procure cargo insurance on all four units. By his own admission, Hall failed to perform this obligation. Therefore, the District Court did not err when it concluded that Hall breached the House Moving Agreement and, as such, could not recover under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b629 As for the Kellys, they concede that the House Moving Agreement required them to provide permanent foundations for the units within sixty days of the initial move. However, they argue that the procurement of cargo insurance was a condition precedent to their performance under the contract. The Kellys argue that they \u201cdid not have to provide Hall with a final foundation until he purchased cargo insurance.\u201d Since Hall never acquired the insurance, the Kellys contend the court erred when it found that they breached the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b630 Section 28-1-403, MCA, defines a condition precedent as \u201cone which is to be performed before some right dependent thereon accrues or some act dependent thereon is performed.\u201d For years, this Court has recognized that conditions precedent are not favored in the law, must be strictly construed, and must be plainly expressed. <em>See Atlantic Pacific Oil Co. v. Gas Development Co. </em>(1937), 105 Mont. 1, 17-19, 69 P.2d 750, 755-56; <em>First Nat. Bank of White Sulphur Springs v. </em>Stoyanoff (1960), 137 Mont. 20, 29, 349 P.2d 1016, 1021 (Angstman, J., dissenting). Further, \u201c[i]t is a principle of contract law that a mere stipulation or covenant in a contract will not be construed as a condition precedent, particularly where a forfeiture would result and where it appears a condition precedent, if desired, could have been provided for by express agreement.\u201d <em>Palmquist v. Allardyce Petroleum Corp. </em>(1974), 164 Mont. 178, 180, 520 P.2d 783, 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b631  The House Moving Agreement contains no language indicating the agreement was contingent upon Hall\u2019s procurement of cargo insurance. Further, the Kellys cite no legal authority or compelling evidence in support of their contention that Hall\u2019s failure to secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>cargo insurance excused their performance. The Kellys simply offer the bare assertion that \u201c[obtaining the cargo insurance was a condition precedent to the Kellys providing Hall with a final foundation.\u201d Based on the presumption against conditions precedent and inconclusive evidence, we hold that the District Court did not err when it found that the Kellys breached the House Moving Agreement and, therefore, could not recover breach of contract damages against Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b632 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a trial on causation and damages consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, LEAPHART, RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE STADLER, sitting for JUSTICE WARNER, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
