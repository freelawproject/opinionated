Maier subsequently filed a petition for post-conviction relief and an amended petition for post-conviction relief. The District Court denied both petitions, and Maier appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\u00b63 Is Maier\u2019s amended petition for post-conviction relief procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1999)?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">\u00b64 Lloyd Scott Maier was convicted of two counts of attempted deliberate homicide on April 25, 1996. The charges arose from an incident on August 12,1995, in which Maier shot Robert Bradford and Brian Kunesh with a semi-automatic rifle. Maier was sentenced by the District Court on June 28, 1996. On July 12, 1996, Maier appealed both his conviction and sentence to this Court. We affirmed the District Court on March 18,1999. See <em>State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, 293 Mont. 403, 977 P.2d 298 <em>(Maier I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\u00b65 On April 16,1999, Maier filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the District Court. Maier\u2019s petition contained ten claims. Then, with his petition for post-conviction relief still pending, Maier filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with this Court. We considered Maier\u2019s petition and noted that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-22-101, MCA (1999), a writ of habeas corpus is not available to attack the validity of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>conviction or sentence of a person who has been adjudged guilty of an offense in a court of record and has exhausted the remedy of appeal. Accordingly, we concluded that Maier\u2019s claims would be more properly raised in a petition for post-conviction relief, and dismissed Maier\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus on November 9, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b66 Maier subsequently filed a second amended petition for post-conviction relief on November 21, 2000 (although no first amended petition for post-conviction relief was ever filed by Maier). Maier\u2019s second amended petition contained two additional claims. The District Court examined both of Maier\u2019s petitions for post-conviction relief, and determined that ten of Maier\u2019s claims were procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1997). The District Court further determined that Maier\u2019s eleventh claim was improper under the facts of the case. Finally, the District Court found that Maier\u2019s twelfth claim contained sufficient merit to require a response from the State. Therefore, the District Court denied Maier\u2019s petitions for post-conviction relief with respect to eleven of his twelve claims on April 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b67 The State responded to Maier\u2019s remaining claim by alleging that Maier\u2019s second amended petition for post-conviction relief was procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1999). The District Court rejected the State\u2019s argument on September 20, 2001. The District Court then conducted a hearing on the merits of Maier\u2019s remaining claim on January 23, 2002. On March 20, 2002, the District Court issued an order, denying the remaining claim in Maier\u2019s second amended petition for post-conviction relief. Maier appealed the District Court\u2019s March 20, 2002, order on March 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 349, \u00b6 9, 42 P.3d 753, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b69 Is Maier\u2019s amended petition for post-conviction relief procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1999)?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u00b610 As a preliminary matter, we note that although the petition filed by Maier on November 21, 2000, was titled \u201csecond amended petition for post-conviction relief,\u201d the petition was actually Maier\u2019s first amended petition, as no previous amended petition was filed. Thus, for clarification purposes, the petition titled \u201csecond amended petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>post-conviction relief\u2019 will hereinafter be referred to as \u201camended petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b611 We further note that although Maier\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief and amended petition for post-conviction relief contained twelve claims (in total), only one of those claims is at issue in this appeal. That is, Maier does not contest the District Court\u2019s denial of the first eleven claims contained in his petitions for post-conviction relief. Accordingly, we will confine our review to the District Court\u2019s denial of Maier\u2019s twelfth claim, which he raised in his amended petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b612 Throughout the proceedings, the State has asserted that it was unnecessary for the District Court to have considered the merits of Maier\u2019s twelfth claim, as Maier\u2019s amended petition for post-conviction relief was procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1999). Section 46-21-102, MCA (1999), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a petition for the relief referred to in \u00a7 46-21-101 may be filed at any time within 1 year of the date that the conviction becomes final. A conviction becomes final for purposes of this chapter when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">(a) the time for appeal to the Montana supreme court expires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">(b) if an appeal is taken to the Montana supreme court, the time for petitioning the United States supreme court for review expires; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">(c) if review is sought in the United States supreme court, on the date that that court issues its final order in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">(2) A claim that alleges the existence of newly discovered evidence that, if proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct for which the petitioner was convicted, may be raised in a petition filed within 1 year of the date on which the conviction becomes final or the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of the evidence, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">\u00b613 Maier filed an appeal before this Court on July 12, 1996. We rendered our decision regarding Maier\u2019s appeal on March 18,1999. See <em>Maier I, </em>\u00b6 2. Maier then had ninety days to petition the United States Supreme Court for review. See Rule 11, Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States; and <em>State v. Root, </em>2003 MT 28, \u00b6 9, 314 Mont. 186, \u00b6 9, 64 P.3d 1035, \u00b6 9. Accordingly, pursuant to subsection (l)(b) of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1999), Maier\u2019s conviction became final on June 16,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u00b614 Maier\u2019s twelfth claim alleged the existence of newly discovered evidence. As we noted above, \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA(1999), provides that post-conviction petitions based upon claims of newly discovered evidence may be filed any time within one year of the date that the conviction becomes final, or within one year of the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of the evidence, whichever is later. However, because Maier raised his twelfth claim for the first time in his amended petition for post-conviction relief, it is the timeliness of Maier\u2019s amended petition which is germane to the instant appeal. Thus, we must consider the nexus between the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA (1999), and \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b615 Section 46-21-105, MCA (1999), addresses amendments to petitions for post-conviction relief. Section 46-21-105, MCA (1999), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">(l)(a) All grounds for relief claimed by a petitioner under 46-21-101 must be raised in the original or amended original petition. The original petition may be amended only once. At the request of the state or on its own motion, the court shall set a deadline for the filing of an amended original petition. If a hearing will be held, the deadline must be reasonably in advance of the hearing but may not be less than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaP\">\u00b616  The plain language of \u00a7 46-21-105(l)(a), MCA (1999), clearly allows a petition for post-conviction relief to be amended once. However, in situations where the claim alleges the existence of newly discovered evidence, \u00a7 46-21-105(l)(a), MCA (1999), must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA (1999). That is, \u201cstatutes do not exist in a vacuum, but must be read in relationship to one smother to effectuate the intent of the statutes as a whole.\u201d <em>In re A. W., </em>1999 MT 42, \u00b6 14, 293 Mont. 358, \u00b6 14, 975 P.2d 1250, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted). Therefore, we conclude that although \u00a7 46-21-105(l)(a), MCA (1999), allows a petition for post-conviction relief to be amended once, such amendment may not violate the provisions of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA (1999), which requires petitions for post-conviction relief based upon a claim of newly discovered evidence to be filed within one year of the date that the conviction becomes final, or within one year of the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of the evidence, whichever is later. To conclude otherwise would render the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA (1999), meaningless. Accordingly, we hold that an amended petition for post-conviction relief which is based upon a claim of newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>discovered evidence must be filed within one year of the date that the conviction becomes final, or within one year of the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of the evidence, whichever is later, as required by \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b617 In this case, Maier\u2019s amended petition for post-conviction relief alleged that newly discovered evidence existed which established that he did not commit the offense of attempted deliberate homicide. The facts surrounding Maier\u2019s claim are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b618 On September 24, 1998, a meeting was held between Maier and Robert Bradford at the Montana State Prison (MSP). At the time of the meeting, both Maier and Bradford were inmates at MSP, and the meeting was arranged by prison officials in an attempt to avoid potential problems between the two men. During the meeting, Bradford recanted testimony he had given at Maier\u2019s trial in 1996, in which he named Maier as the person who had shot him on August 12, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b619 Maier contended that Bradford\u2019s statements were newly discovered evidence that established that he did not commit the offense of attempted deliberate homicide. As we noted above, Maier \u201cdiscovered\u201d Bradford\u2019s recanted testimony on September 24, 1998. However, despite this \u201cdiscovery,\u201d Maier\u2019s original petition for post-conviction relief, which he filed on April 16,1999, contained no claim with respect to newly discovered evidence. Rather, Maier waited until he filed his amended petition on November 21, 2000, to allege the existence of newly discovered evidence. Maier\u2019s amended petition was filed over one year after his conviction became final, and over two years after the date that Maier \u201cdiscovered\u201d Bradford\u2019s recanted testimony. As such, Maier\u2019s amended petition failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b620  This Court has previously stated that: \u201c[T]he one year statute of limitations for postconviction relief is a jurisdictional limit on litigation and its waiver may only be justified by a clear miscarriage of justice, one so obvious that the judgment is rendered a complete nullity.\u201d <em>State v. Abe, </em>2001 MT 260, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 233, \u00b6 15, 37 P.3d 77, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). We have further stated that this \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception does not apply to post-conviction claims unless the defendant alleges newly discovered evidence which establishes that the defendant did not commit the offense. <em>State v. Rosales, </em>2000 MT 89, \u00b6 7, 299 Mont. 226, \u00b6 7, 999 P.2d 313, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b621  In this case, the newly discovered evidence alleged by Maier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>concerned Bradford\u2019s recanted testimony. However, testimony from prison officials at the hearing on Maier\u2019s amended petition for post-conviction relief indicated that Bradford never actually stated that Maier was not the person who shot him. Rather, prison officials testified that Bradford stated that he was not able to view the shooter because he was hiding behind the dashboard of his vehicle. Additionally, at Maier\u2019s trial in 1996, two other witnesses identified Maier as the person who shot Bradford. See <em>Maier I, </em>\u00b6 56. Therefore, we conclude that Bradford\u2019s recanted testimony does not, by itself, establish that Maier did not commit the offense of attempted deliberate homicide on August 12,1995. Accordingly, the \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception to \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1999), does not apply to Maier\u2019s claim of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b622  In light of our above conclusions, we hold that Maier\u2019s amended petition for post-conviction relief was procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1999). We further hold that the District Court erred when it failed to apply the procedural bar to Maier\u2019s amended petition. However, although the District Court\u2019s reason for denying Maier\u2019s amended petition was incorrect, its result can be sustained under the wrong-reason, right-result appellate rule. <em>See Knutson v. State </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 126, 129, 683 P.2d 488, 490. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
