Dukes, as personal representative of the Estate of Keith Dukes and on her own and her minor children\u2019s behalf, and Sandra Henry, on behalf of her minor child (hereafter referred to as \u201cDukes\u201d), brought this action against the defendants in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County. Defendant City of Missoula (City) moved the District Court to dismiss Dukes\u2019 complaint, alleging that any inspection or other duties imposed on it by Montana\u2019s Scaffolding Act in \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA (1997),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were preempted by the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The District Court agreed and dismissed Dukes\u2019 complaint against the City, concluding that any duties imposed on the City by Montana\u2019s Scaffolding Act were preempted under federal law. Dukes now appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint against the City. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"ATN\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it concluded that the duty to inspect under Montana\u2019s Scaffolding Act, \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA, is preempted by the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">\u00b64 The facts in this case, as reflected in Dukes\u2019 amended complaint, are as follows: On February 10, 1998, Keith Dukes, an employee of Sirius Construction, Inc. (Sirius), while in the course of his employment, was injured and eventually died as a result of his injuries. Defendant Sirius was involved in performing services under a written contract with the University of Montana at the time of Keith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Dukes\u2019 injuries. When the injury occurred, Keith Dukes was performing work for Sirius on the University of Montana campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b65 In the amended complaint, Dukes alleged that, pursuant to the Montana Scaffolding Act, \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA, the City had a duty to conduct inspections to ensure that the other named defendants complied with the provisions of the Act, \u00a7\u00a7 50-77-101 through -107, MCA. The Act required, in part, that employers follow safety practices commonly recognized in the construction industry as well as applicable state and federal occupational safety laws. <em>See </em>\u00a7 50-77-101(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A9W\">\u00b66 Dukes alleged that the City failed to enforce Montana\u2019s Scaffolding Act by failing to perform the inspections required under \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA, and alleged that the City\u2019s failure to inspect constituted a breach of a legal duty and negligence <em>per se </em>under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b67 The City thereafter filed a Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., motion to dismiss, arguing that Dukes\u2019 amended complaint failed to state a claim for which relief was available. The City argued that the Montana Scaffolding Act was preempted by the OSH Act and the OSHA regulations promulgated thereunder. The City argued therefrom that it could not owe a duty to Dukes under preempted state law, and likewise, that it did not owe a duty to Dukes under OSHA regulations because the regulations do not impose liability upon a third party who is not an employer of the worker. Absent an imposed legal duty, the City argued that there could be no negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b68 The District Court agreed and granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court concluded that Congress intended the OSH Act and OSHA regulations to occupy the field of occupational safety and health regulation, thus preempting the safety standards set forth in the Montana Scaffolding Act as well as any enforcement provisions thereunder, except where the state has submitted a comprehensive plan pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(b), and where that plan was approved by the Secretary of Labor. Montana has not done so. The District Court additionally concluded that the OSH Act savings clause, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653(4), while preserving private tort actions, does not save from preemption state occupational safety and health standards or their enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b69 The District Court concluded, therefore, that the Montana Scaffolding Act could not impose a duty on the City to inspect and that, without a legal duty, the City could not be held liable for negligence arising under the Montana Scaffolding Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b610 Dukes now appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b611 This Court\u2019s standard of review of district court rulings on motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., is: A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of a claim which would entitle the plaintiff to relief. <em>Reidelbach v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2002 MT 289, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 498, \u00b6 14, 60 P.3d 418, \u00b6 14. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., has the effect of admitting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint. In considering the motion, the complaint is construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all allegations of fact contained therein are taken as true. <em>Reidelbach, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted). The District Court\u2019s determination that Dukes failed to state a claim for which relief was available is a conclusion of law. Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusion of law is whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Reidelbach, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err when it concluded that the duty to inspect under Montana\u2019s Scaffolding Act, \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA, is preempted by the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b613 In the District Court, the City argued that, by virtue of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(b), the OSH Act preempted all state occupational safety and health standards as well as their enforcement, and that a state may develop and implement its own occupational safety and health plan only by submitting and receiving approval of its plan by the Secretary of Labor. Relying on <em>Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Association </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 88, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73, and <em>Industrial Truck Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Henry </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 125 F.3d 1305, the City argued that any non-approved state regulations are preempted even if they merely supplement the federal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b614 The City thus asserted that it could not owe a duty to Dukes for two reasons: first, any imposition of duty under the Montana Scaffolding Act was preempted; and second, citing to <em>Russell v. Bartley </em>(6th Cir. 1974), 494 F.2d 334, the OSH Act imposes a duty of care only on employers to care for employees, but imposes no duty of care on third party non-employers. Consequently, the City argued, violation of an OSHA regulation could not be the basis for a negligence cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b615 Finally, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thornock v. State </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 67, 69, 745 P.2d 324, 325, the City argued that this Court has already held that OSHA preempts any duty to inspect where OSHA has promulgated regulations. This Court held in <em>Thornock </em>that the OSH Act and OSHA regulations impliedly preempted the entire field of regulating occupational safety and health issues. We thus held that OSHA preempted any duty of inspection imposed on the state by the Montana Safety Act of 1969. <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 74-75, 745 P.2d at 328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b616 The District Court agreed with the City and, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thornock, </em>concluded that Congress intended to wholly occupy the field of \u201cassuring worker safety.\u201d The District Court concluded that, because OSHA preempted the Montana Scaffolding Act, the Act imposed no duty of care or duty to inspect on the City. The District Court thus determined that the only duty to inspect or duty to enforce safety standards arose under OSHA and that the only entity with responsibility for inspection and enforcement of scaffolding safety standards is the Secretary of Labor. Accordingly, the District Court dismissed Dukes\u2019 claim against the City, concluding that, without a legal duty, Dukes\u2019 claim against the City for negligence must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b617 On appeal, Dukes argues that neither the OSH Act nor OSHA regulations provide for express preemption, nor do they imply field preemption, and that the District Court thus erred in concluding that Montana\u2019s Scaffolding Act was preempted. Dukes argues that the City had distinct duties under the Act, including a duty to inspect and verify compliance with manufacturer specifications, state law and federal laws, and a duty to enforce compliance. Finally, Dukes argues that, in light of decisions in subsequent state and federal cases, <em>Thornock </em>was incorrectly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b618 The United States Supreme Court and this Court have repeatedly held that preemption is not easily favored. <em>See Favel v. American Renovation and Constr. Co., </em>2002 MT 266, \u00b6 39, 312 Mont. 285, \u00b6 39, 59 P.3d 412, \u00b6 39; <em>also see Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250, 135 L.Ed.2d 700, 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b619 \u201cBecause the States are independent sovereigns in our federal system, we have long presirmed that Congress does not cavalierly preempt state-law causes of action. In all pre-emption cases ... we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 39 (citing <em>Sleath v. West Mont </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Home Health Services, </em>2000 MT 381, \u00b6 23, 304 Mont. 1, \u00b6 23, 16 P.3d 1042, \u00b6 23). The presumption against preemption can only be overcome by evidence of a clear and manifest intent of Congress to preempt state law. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 39 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b620  There are three ways in which federal law may preempt state law. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40. The first is by express preemption, wherein Congress includes a preemption clause providing that state law will not apply in the area governed by the federal statute. Absent express preemption, this Court recognizes two types of implied preemption. The first is \u201cfield preemption,\u201d wherein the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive or comprehensive that it is reasonable to infer that Congress intended to \u201coccupy the field\u201d and leave no room for supplementary state regulation. The second type of implied preemption is \u201cconflict preemption.\u201d Conflict preemption manifests itself as an inability of state law to comply with federal law or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the fall purposes and objectives of Congress. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40 (citing <em>Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Labs. </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 707, 713, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 2375, 85 L.Ed.2d 714, 721).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b621 Dukes argues that neither express nor implied preemption exists here, and therefore, the City had a duty under the Montana Scaffolding Act to inspect and enforce state, federal and manufacturer standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b622 Section 50-77-106, MCA (1997) [now repealed], of the Montana Scaffolding Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">It is hereby made the duty of the building inspector, his deputy, or other authorities in any county, city, town, or village in the state, through the county attorney or any other attorney, in case of failure of such owner, person, or corporation to comply with this chapter promptly, to take the necessary steps to enforce the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Section 50-77-101(2), MCA (1997), of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">Employers and employees shall follow safety practices commonly recognized in the construction industry as well as applicable state and federal occupational safety laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\u00b623 The City counters that even absent all types of preemption, the Montana Scaffolding Act is inapplicable to the present case because implicit in the statute is a requirement that the City receive notice of a violation in order to bring about the statutory duty to inspect. The City also argues that Dukes did not set forth exactly which provisions of the Act that the City allegedly failed to enforce. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>did not address either of these issues in its order and those issues are beyond the scope of this Court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss. We begin our discussion by addressing express preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">A. Express Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b624 The City contends that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653(b)(4), expressly preempts Dukes\u2019 claims against the City. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to supersede or in any manner affect any workmen\u2019s compensation law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries, disease, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b625 While the above statute contains no language of express preemption of state safety regulations, standards, inspections or enforcement, the City argues that the language of the statute \u201ctriggers\u201d express preemption in light of Dukes\u2019 claims. The City references Dukes\u2019 amended complaint and briefs in opposition to summary judgment, which contain explicit references to OSHA standards related to scaffolding. The City explains, \u201cthe safety practices the City is alleged not to have enforced are OSHA standards. Under Dukes\u2019 claims, OSHA standards would enlarge or affect common law or statutory rights, duties or liabilities.\u201d Citing to <em>Garay v. Missouri Pacific Railroad </em>(D.Kan. 1999), 38 F.Supp.2d 892, <em>Canape v. Petersen </em>(Colo. 1995), 897 P.2d 762, and <em>Hernandez v. Martin Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(Ohio 1995), 649 N.E.2d 1215, the City argues that allowing Dukes\u2019 claims would \u201cenlarge or affect common law or statutory rights, duties or liabilities\u201d in violation of \u00a7 653(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b626 The above three cases do not hold that \u00a7 653(b)(4) of the OSH Act expressly preempts state safety standards, but rather, hold that permitting negligence <em>per se </em>based upon violations of OSHA regulations would allow employees to circumvent workers\u2019 compensation laws or to forego the elements of a negligence cause of action, thereby enlarging or diminishing duties owed by individuals to those injured in the course of their employment, contrary to the language and intent of \u00a7 653(b)(4). <em>See Garay, </em>38 F.Supp.2d at 900-01; <em>Canape, </em>987 P.2d at 767; <em>Hernandez, </em>649 N.E.2d at 1216-17. Therefore, none of the holdings in the cited cases lead this Court to conclude that, absent explicit preemptive language, \u00a7 653(b)(4) somehow \u201ctriggered\u201d express preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b627 Neither are the above cases relevant in the instant case. In Dukes\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>amended complaint, Dukes alleges that the City is negligent <em>per se, </em>not for violating OSHA standards, but for violation of \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA. As this appeal is here upon a motion to dismiss, the District Court did not consider whether the City may or may not be negligent <em>per se </em>for violation of \u00a7 50-77-106 of the Montana Scaffolding Act, and we decline to make such a ruling here, as such determination is properly reserved for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b628  Express preemption, by definition, must be clearly manifested. <em>Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association v. City of Akron </em>(6th Cir. 1986), 801 F.2d 824, 831. As no provision of the OSH Act contains explicit preemptive language, we conclude that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653(b)(4), contrary to the City\u2019s argument, does not expressly preempt state occupational safety and health standards or statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">B. Implied Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"AUz\">1. Field Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b629 The District Court relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thornock, </em>which concluded that \u201cstate efforts to set and enforce standards have been superseded\u201d and that the Secretary of Labor has the responsibility for enforcement and inspection. <em>See Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 76, 745 P.2d at 329. The City urges this Court to affirm based on <em>Thornock, </em>the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gade </em>and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Industrial Truck Association, </em>arguing that OSHA regulations are so comprehensive and pervasive as to make a reasonable inference that Congress left no room for supplementary state regulation, thereby implying field preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b630 We first turn to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gade. Gade </em>involved competing state and federal regulations relating to hazardous waste operations. In 1986 Congress enacted the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act under which OSHA promulgated regulations on \u201cHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\u201d including detailed regulations related to worker training. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 91, 112 S.Ct. at 2379, 120 L.Ed.2d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"A71\">\u00b631 Two years later, the Illinois General Assembly enacted the Hazardous Waste Crane and Hoisting Equipment Operators Licensing Act and the Hazardous Waste Laborers Licensing Act, both of which also included detailed requirements related to worker training in relation to hazardous waste operations. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 91, 112 S.Ct. at 2379, 120 L.Ed.2d at 80. The plaintiff in <em>Gade, </em>the National Solid Wastes Management Association, brought a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court against the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA), seeking to enjoin IEPAfrom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>enforcing the Illinois licensing acts, claiming that the acts were preempted by the OSH Act and OSHA regulations. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 94, 112 S.Ct. at 2380-81, 120 L.Ed.2d at 81-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b632 Reading the OSH Act as a whole, the United States Supreme Court determined that the OSHA regulations were \u201cnot intended to be all encompassing\u201d in the workplace. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 96, 112 S.Ct. at 2382, 120 L.Ed.2d at 83.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">First, Congress expressly saved two areas from federal preemption. Section 4(b)(4) of the OSH Act states that the Act does not \u201csupersede or in any manner affect any workmen\u2019s compensation law or... enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653(b)(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">[Second], section 18(a) provides that the Act does not \u201cprevent any State agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under State law over any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which no [federal] standard is in effect.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\"><em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 96-97, 112 S.Ct. at 2382, 120 L.Ed.2d at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b633 The Supreme Court further noted that Congress not only reserved the above two areas to state authority, \u201cbut it also, in \u00a7 18(b) of the Act, gave the States the option of pre-empting federal regulation entirely.\u201d <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 97, 112 S.Ct. at 2382, 120 L.Ed.2d at 83. Said section allows for any state that wishes to assume responsibility for development and enforcement of occupational safety and health standards where federal standards already exist, to submit a state plan for the development of such standards to the Secretary of Labor for approval, thereby preempting existing federal standards. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u00b634 The Supreme Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">[N]onapproved state regulations of occupational safety and health issues for which a federal standard is in effect is impliedly preempted as in conflict with the full purposes and objectives of the OSH Act. The design of the statute persuades us that Congress intended to subject employers and employees to only one set of regulations, be it federal or state, and that the only way a State may regulate an OSHA-regulated occupational safety and health issue is pursuant to an approved state plan that displaces the federal standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-11\"><em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 98-99, 112 S.Ct. at 2383, 120 L.Ed.2d at 84 (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b635 The <em>Gade </em>Court ultimately held that \u201cpreservation of state authority in the absence of a federal standard presupposed a background pre-emption of all state occupational safety and health standards whenever a federal standard governing the same issue is in effect.\u201d <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100, 112 S.Ct. at 2384, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85. Reading the OSH Act as a whole, this is the only conclusion consistent with a plain reading of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b636 We thus disagree with the City\u2019s argument that <em>Gade </em>holds or implies that the OSH Act or OSHA regulations were intended by Congress to preempt the entire field of occupational safety and health regulation absent submission of a state plan and approval of that plan by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(b). In <em>Gade, </em>the United States Supreme Court clearly evinced Congress\u2019 intent in the OSH Act to preserve state authority to promulgate standards in the absence of OSHA regulations on a specific occupational safety and health issue, as well as preserving state workers\u2019 compensation law and common law and statutory rights, duties or liabilities of employers and employees. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 96-100, 112 S.Ct. at 2382-84, 120 L.Ed.2d at 83-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b637 We conclude that the City\u2019s argument also fails to consider the OSH Act as a whole. A precondition to the requirement that a state submit a plan for approval to the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(b), is an attempt by a state to regulate a specific occupational health and safety issue already regulated by OSHA. As 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(a), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">Assertion of State standards in absence of applicable Federal standards. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any State agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under State law over any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which no standard is in effect under section 655 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Gade, </em>it was not the desire of Congress to impliedly preempt all state regulation of all occupational safety and health issues, but to preserve state authority to regulate safety and health issues in the absence of OSHA regulations on a particular issue, thereby subjecting employers and employees only to a single set of regulations, whether federal or state. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100, 112 S.Ct. at 2384, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u00b638 We agree with the City\u2019s interpretation of <em>Gade </em>only to the extent that the City contends that the OSH Act savings clauses do not save <em>supplemental </em>state regulation. As the Supreme Court stated, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>natural implication of [the savings clause] is that state laws regulating the same issue as federal laws are not saved, even if they merely supplement the federal standard.\u201d <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100, 112 S.Ct. at 2384, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85. <em>Gade, </em>however, was not a field preemption case, and we find the City\u2019s reliance on <em>Gade </em>for the proposition that the OSH Act has preempted the entire field to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b639 The City next relies on <em>Industrial Truck Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Henry </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 125 F.3d 1305, to support its field preemption argument. In light of our above conclusion, we find the City\u2019s reliance on <em>Industrial </em>to be misguided. The City quotes three passages wherein the <em>Industrial </em>Court interprets <em>Gade. </em>However, the passages relied on by the City refute its own argument. For instance, the City quotes from <em>Industrial </em>wherein the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">Thus, under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as interpreted by <em>Gade, when OSHA promulgates a federal standard, </em>that standard totally occupies the field within the \u201cissue\u201d of that regulation and preempts all state occupational safety and health laws relating to that issue, conflicting or not, unless they are included in the state [approved] plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\"><em>Industrial, </em>125 F.3d at 1311 (emphasis supplied). The application of <em>Gade </em>by the Court of Appeals in <em>Industrial </em>led to its conclusion that \u201cthe plurality\u2019s preemption analysis extends to states with approved plans like California. <em>Gade </em>refers to preemption of state regulation on an issue-by-issue basis.\u201d <em>Industrial, </em>125 F.3d at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b640 The State of California had submitted and received approval from the Secretary of Labor to preempt federal regulation with its own Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act. A portion of the plan as enacted, however, had not been submitted to the Secretary of Labor for approval. The narrow holding of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Industrial </em>was that those state regulations which were not submitted to OSHA, insofar as they applied to a health and safety issue wherein OSHA regulations had already been promulgated, are not saved from preemption. <em>Industrial, </em>125 F.3d at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b641 Based on the foregoing, we find that neither <em>Industrial </em>nor <em>Gade </em>are field preemption cases, and neither case supports the City\u2019s position that OSHA regulations promulgated under the OSH Act were intended to be so pervasive and comprehensive as to impliedly preempt all state regulation of occupational health and safety issues not approved by the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b642 The City\u2019s remaining authority in its field preemption argument is this Court\u2019s previous decision in <em>Thornock v. State </em>(1987), 229 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>67, 745 P.2d 324. In granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court relied on <em>Thornock </em>in determining that Congress intended to occupy the field of \u201cassuring worker safety.\u201d Relying on <em>Thornock, </em>the District Court stated that \u201c[s]tate scaffolding safety standards and enforcement of those standards were pre-empted by the Act, and the Secretary of Labor has [the sole] responsibility for enforcement and inspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b643 This Court decided <em>Thornock </em>five years prior to the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Gade. </em>In light of the City\u2019s argument and the District Court\u2019s conclusion, we find it necessary to review our <em>Thornock </em>decision in light of <em>Gade </em>and in light of more recent cases from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b644 The plaintiff in <em>Thornock, </em>Larry Thornock (Thornock) lost his arm at the elbow in a sawmill accident and sued the state pursuant to the Montana Safety Act of 1969, alleging that the state failed to inspect the sawmill as required by the Safety Act, thus allowing the sawmill to operate in a hazardous condition which led to the accident and the loss of the plaintiffs arm. <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 69, 745 P.2d at 325. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state and against Thornock, concluding that the OSH Act and the federal safety standards for sawmills adopted thereunder preempted the statutory duty of the state to inspect hazardous places of employment, and we affirmed its decision on appeal. <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 69, 745 P.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b645 On appeal, Thornock conceded at the outset that OSHA preempted the promulgation not only of safety standards relating to sawmill operation, but also conceded that OSHA preempted the \u201cenforcement of such standards from the State\u2019s purview.\u201d <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 70, 745 P.2d at 326. This Court accepted Thornock\u2019s concession without question or analysis. With this foundational assumption, we dismissed Thornock\u2019s reliance on the cases of <em>P &amp; Z Co., Inc. v. District of Columbia </em>(D.C. 1979), 408 A.2d 1249, and <em>Berardi v. Getty Refining &amp; Marketing </em>(N.Y. 1980), 107 Misc.2d 451, 435 N.Y.S.2d 212, both of which interpreted the savings clauses of the OSH Act consistent with the subsequent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Gade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b646 The appellants <em>in. P &amp; Z </em>received misdemeanor convictions for failing, as employers, to report employee injuries to the Industrial Safety Board as required under the District of Columbia Industrial Safety Act, and, on appeal, argued that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 operated to explicitly preempt District of Columbia reporting requirements. <em>P &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Z, 408 A.2d at 1249-50. The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">The term \u201cstandard\u201d in this context is a word of art. The OSHA preemption subsections specifically apply only to standards promulgated by rule under \u00a7 655. In this regulatory scheme... the function [of information gathering and reporting] is not covered by the preemption provision since it is not considered a standard. The authority for OSHA to implement reporting requirements is set forth in separate OSHA provisions \u00a7\u00a7 657(c) and 673, thereby removing the regulations from the preemption provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><em>P&amp;Z, </em>408 A.2d at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b647 The <em>P&amp;Z </em>Court thus determined that, although information gathering and reporting requirements were addressed by the OSH Act in \u00a7\u00a7 657 and 673, states \u201cmay continue reporting efforts regardless of whether a state plan is in effect, since they may assert authority over any issue not covered by a \u00a7 655 standard.\u201d <em>P &amp; Z, </em>408 A.2d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"AjM\">\u00b648 To the extent that this Court in <em>Thornock </em>addressed the decision in <em>Berardi, </em>we noted that \u201cwhile OSHA was meant to be exclusive in the promulgation and enforcement of standards, a state may take jurisdiction over any safety issue on which there is no federal standard.\u201d <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 71, 745 P.2d at 327. However, this Court applied neither the holding in <em>Berardi </em>nor the holding in <em>P&amp;Z, </em>but dismissed Thornock\u2019s reliance thereon because the allegations in his complaint-that the state failed to enforce OSHA standards-were contrary to his concession in the district court and on appeal that all state enforcement was preempted. \u201cWhereas <em>P&amp;Z Co. </em>holds that a state or other local jurisdiction can exercise duties not preempted by OSHA, Thornock specifically incorporates into his complaint a duty preempted by OSHA-the right to enforce standards.\u201d <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 71, 745 P.2d at 327. This Court, therefore, did not address the merits of <em>P &amp; Z </em>or <em>Berardi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b649 Besides failing to directly address the OSH Act\u2019s savings clause under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(a), this Court also made overly broad statements based upon misinterpretations of existing case law. For example, citing to <em>New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce v. Hughey </em>(3rd Cir. 1985), 774 F.2d 587, 592, we stated that \u201c[s]tate laws dealing with workers safety are preempted once OSHA enacts similar standards.\u201d <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 72, 745 P.2d at 327. <em>Hughey </em>does not stand for such an overly broad statement of general preemption, nor does a plain reading of the OSH Act savings clauses or the subsequent holding in <em>Cade </em>allow for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b650 The <em>Hughey </em>Court addressed the question of whether the OSH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Act preempted New Jersey\u2019s Worker and Community Right to Know Act, which required disclosure of substances that may pose environmental hazards. <em>Hughey, 774 </em>F.2d at 590. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the OSH Act expressly preempted all provisions of New Jersey\u2019s Right to Know Act, holding that state laws are expressly preempted only to the extent that a federal standard regulating the same issue is already in effect. <em>Hughey, 774 </em>F.2d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b651 In addressing implied, conflict preemption, the Court of Appeals in <em>Hughey </em>did not conclude that all \u201cstate laws dealing with workers safety are preempted once OSHA enacts similar standards,\u201d but rather, examined each of the approximately 30 sections of New Jersey\u2019s Right to Know Act to determine which individual sections conflicted with OSHA regulations. The Court of Appeals then severed from the surviving sections of the statute those sections found to conflict with federal law. <em>Hughey, 774 </em>F.2d at 594-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b652 In another example, this Court relied on the case of <em>Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association v. City of Akron </em>(6th Cir. 1986), 801 F.2d 824, when making the overly broad conclusion that \u201cOSHA was intended to establish a national standard .... To that degree, the court held that state workers\u2019 safety laws were preempted expressly.\u201d <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 73, 745 P.2d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b653 In <em>Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed whether the City of Akron\u2019s \u201cRight to Know\u201d ordinance, regulating hazardous and toxic substances in the workplace, was preempted by the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard set forth in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910. Consistent with the savings clause in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(a), the Court of Appeals held that the city ordinance was preempted, but only \u201cto the extent\u201d that the ordinance attempted to regulate the presence of hazardous and toxic substances in the workplace. <em>Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association, </em>801 F.2d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"A8x\">\u00b654 The Court of Appeals did not, as stated by this Court in <em>Thornock, </em>find express preemption of the city\u2019s workers\u2019 safety laws. To the contrary, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cwe cannot accept plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Congress expressly preempted local regulation by these provisions establishing a national standard. Furthermore, we agree with the trial court to the extent that express preemption, by definition, must be clearly manifested, especially when local health and safety provisions are endangered.\u201d <em>Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association, </em>801 F.2d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b655 Finally, this Court stated in <em>Thornock </em>that, \u201cThornock must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>persuade this Court that federal powers granted in OSHA do not relieve the State of its burden to inspect dangerous work sites.\u201d <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 73, 745 P.2d at 328. This is completely wrong. The imposition of such a burden of proof is contrary to this Court\u2019s presumption that preemption is not easily favored and contrary to the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by a federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Sleath, </em>\u00b6 23. Furthermore, we have repeatedly held that the presumption against preemption can only be overcome by evidence of a clear and manifest intent of Congress to preempt state law. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 39. It was error for this Court to place the burden on Thornock to prove that duties under the Montana Safety Act were <em>not </em>preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b656 Based upon compound errors, this Comb concluded in Thornock:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae-J\">It is plain from reading the Occupational Safety and Health Act that Congress intended to occupy the field of assuring worker safety. Congress accomplished this by setting minimum federal standards that all employers must meet. Thornock\u2019s argument that Congress did not occupy the field because it expressly included provisions in OSHA by which the various states could resume workers safety programs is not persuasive. In order to retain the right to set and enforce work safety rules, a state must submit to the Secretary of Labor a plan that is \u201cat least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the standards promulgated under section 655 ...\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(c)(2). So while states may choose to exercise work safety programs, they may do so only on the federal government\u2019s terms. This field has been occupied by federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayqs\"><em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 73-74, 745 P.2d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b657 Given this conclusion, it is understandable that the City relied on <em>Thornock </em>as an implied field preemption case. However, from our analysis and review of the case law thus far, it is clear that Congress did not intend for the OSH Act to expressly or impliedly preempt state law regulating occupational safety and health issues except where OSHA has promulgated standards on a particular issue. To the extent that <em>Thornock </em>held that the OSH Act expressly or impliedly preempted states from regulating any issue of occupational safety and health issues, <em>Thornock </em>is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b658 Additionally, to the extent that this Court in <em>Thornock </em>dealt in any detail with the OSH Act savings clause in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653(b)(4), this Court merely stated: \u201cIt can be clearly determined from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>language of this section that Congress did not mean to interfere with the various states\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation schemes. Beyond that, Congress\u2019 intention is obscure.\u201d <em>Thornock, </em>229 Mont. at 76, 745 P.2d at 330. Such conclusion is also incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b659 Section 653(b)(4) not only provides that the OSH Act shall not be construed to supersede or affect workers\u2019 compensation law, but also that the OSH Act shall not enlarge or diminish or affect a state\u2019s common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities imposed on employers or employees with respect to injuries, disease or death of employees arising out of or in the course of employment. Thus, besides clear language that Congress did not mean to interfere with the various states\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation schemes, \u201c[t]here is a solid consensus that section [653(b)(4)] operates to save state tort rules from preemption.\u201d <em>Pedraza v. Shell Oil Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1991), 942 F.2d 48, 53 (citing <em>National Solid Wastes Management Ass\u2019n v. Killian </em>(7th Cir. 1990), 918 F.2d 671, 680, n. 9 (collecting cases); <em>Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety Comm\u2019n </em>(1976), 430 U.S. 442, 445, 97 S.Ct. 1261, 1264, 51 L.Ed.2d 464 (noting that OSHA establishes a new statutory duty on the part of employers and creates new remedies and stating: \u201cEach remedy exists whether or not an employee is actually injured or killed as a result of the [unsafe or unhealthful] condition, and existing state statutory and common-law remedies for actual injury and death remain unaffected.\u201d); <em>People v. Chicago Magnet Wire Corp. </em>(Ill. 1989), 534 N.E.2d 962, 968 (\u201cCongress expressly stated that OSHA was not intended to preempt two bases of liability that, like criminal law, operate to regulate workplace conduct and implicitly set safety standards-State worker\u2019s compensation and tort law.\u201d)) (further citations omitted); <em>also see York v. Union Carbide Corp. </em>(Ind. App. 3 Dist. 1992), 586 N.E.2d 861, 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b660 The <em>Pedraza </em>Court further stated: \u201cWe are aware of no case which holds that OSHA preempts state tort law. Rather, most courts have been concerned with how OSHA affects tort actions, not with whether it preempts state tort law. Thus, every court faced with this issue has held that OSHA creates no private right of action.\u201d <em>Pedraza, </em>942 F.2d at 52 (citations omitted). \u201cIt is noteworthy as well that OSHA provides no replacement remedy for workplace injuries, disease or death caused to employees by suppliers of products used in the workplace. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u2018[i]t is difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.\u2019\u201d <em>Pedraza, </em>942 F.2d at n. 7 (citation omitted); <em>also see Wickham v. American Tokyo Kasei, Inc. </em>(N.D. Ill. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>1996), 927 F.Supp. 293, where the plaintiff brought a products liability action under state law for injuries suffered at work, allegedly the result of the defendant employer failing to place warning labels on containers with dangerous chemicals in violation of OSHA regulations. <em>Wickham, </em>927 F.Supp. at 293-94. The Court in <em>Wickham </em>found no preemption and allowed the plaintiff to proceed under state tort law for the employer\u2019s violation of an OSHA regulation, noting that the plaintiff\u2019s suit, \u201cif successful, would not have the effect of creating any state imposed modification of OSHA standards and, thus, would not amount to state regulation. Therefore, even if OSHA preempted state regulation of chemical labels and warnings, it would not preempt this particular cause of action.\u201d <em>Wickham, </em>927 F.Supp. at 295. The <em>Wickham </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">OSHA is a purely regulatory provision that creates no private right of action. Instead, it is enforced by fines or criminal prosecution. Criminal prosecution or a fine payable to the federal government would not compensate the plaintiff for his alleged injuries. If \u00a7 1910.1200(a)(2) did preempt a cause of action like plaintiffs based on a failure to warn, an employee would be without a remedy even when a defendant failed to comply with OSHA. It is obvious to this Court that Congress, in enacting a statute designed specifically to protect employees and others from such potential hazards, did not intend such a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>927 F.Supp. at 295 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b661 In his concurrence in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em>Ries, III v. National Railroad Passenger Corp. </em>(3rd Cir. 1992), 960 F.2d 1156, Judge Nygarrd reached a similar conclusion. \u201cSection 653(b)(4) makes clear that OSHA was not intended to redefine or affect an employer\u2019s common law or statutory duties. OSHA\u2019s overriding purpose is to prevent workplace injuries. It is enforceable by administrative civil and criminal penalties. It, however, does not provide remedies to injured employees.\u201d <em>Ries, </em>960 F.2d at 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b662  Based upon the foregoing, we reach a number of conclusions. First, Congress did not intend that state regulation of occupational safety and health issues be impliedly field preempted. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(a), states can promulgate occupational safety and health standards and enforce them in the absence of OSHA standards regulating the same safety and health issue. Second, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653(b)(4), Congress did not intend that the OSH Act affect state workers\u2019 compensation laws, nor that the Act enlarge or diminish state common law or tort law remedies available to injured workers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>And third, Congress did not intend that the OSH Act create a right of action for injured workers, but to allow injured workers to pursue rights of action given by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b663  Having reached the conclusion that there is no field preemption of occupational safety and health issues by the OSH Act, it remains necessary to determine whether the duty of the City to inspect under the Montana Scaffolding Act directly conflicts with the OSH Act and OSHA regulation of scaffolding standards and is preempted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">2. Conflict Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b664  As noted above, Congress intended that the OSH Act preserve state authority to regulate occupational safety and health issues in the absence of federal standard governing the same issue. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100, 112 S.Ct. at 2384, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85; <em>Hughey, </em>774 F.2d at 593; <em>Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association, </em>801 F.2d at 834. Where OSHA has promulgated regulations on a particular occupational safety and health issue, any state regulation of the same issue is preempted as in conflict with OSHA regulations, even if the state regulation merely supplements the federal regulation. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100, 112 S.Ct. at 2384, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85. As also noted, the intention of Congress was to subject employers and employees only to a single set of regulations, whether federal or state. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100-02, 112 S.Ct. at 2384-85, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85-86; <em>see also Wickham, </em>927 F.Supp. at 295 (noting that state tort law claims are preempted only insofar as those claims are based upon the theory that a defendant should have complied with requirements that are <em>in addition </em>to OSHA standards) (citations omitted). Thus, any state safety or health standard related to scaffolding will be preempted if in direct conflict with OSHA scaffolding standards or even if merely supplemental to OSHA scaffolding standards. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100, 112 S.Ct. at 2384, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b665 Section 50-77-106, MCA, does not enumerate specific safety or health standards related to scaffolding. Rather, this provision provides that the building inspector or other authorized person has a duty to inspect and enforce the provisions of the Montana Scaffolding Act through the county attorney, or other attorney, in the case of failure of the owner, person or corporation to comply with any part of the chapter. Because \u00a7 50-77-101(2), MCA, only requires employers and employees to follow \u201capplicable\u201d state and federal occupational safety laws as well as \u201csafety practices commonly recognized in the construction industry,\u201d the enforcement provision, \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>would not require the enforcement of state scaffolding standards or safety practices commonly recognized in the construction industry, as a preempted state standard or common safety practices could no longer be considered \u201capplicable.\u201d Thus, the enforcement mechanism of \u00a7 50-77-106, MCA, could only be employed to enforce applicable federal standards, and therefore, the statute does not conflict with those federal standards by virtue of its reference to enforcement of the now preempted state standards and common safety practices.</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\">\u00b666 The City maintains, however, that a state law requiring inspection and enforcement of federal standards \u201cinterferes with the methods by which the federal statute is designed to reach its goal\u201d and that, pursuant to <em>Gade, </em>OSHA does not permit a state to assume an enforcement role without prior approval by the Secretary of Labor of the state\u2019s plan. However, the <em>Gade </em>Court did not so conclude. Rather, the <em>Gade </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">The principle indication that Congress intended to pre-empt state law is \u00a7 18(b)\u2019s statement that a State \u201cshall\u201d submit a plan if it wishes to \u201cassume responsibility\u201d for \u201cdevelopment and enforcement ... of occupational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety and health issue with respect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated.\u201d The unavoidable implication of this provision is that a State may not enforce <em>its own occupational safety and health standards </em>without obtaining the Secretary\u2019s approval....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\"><em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 99, 112 S.Ct. at 2383, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85 (emphasis supplied). The <em>Gade </em>Court did not hold that state \u201cenforcement\u201d is generally preempted, but that enforcement of <em>its own </em>occupational safety and health standards is preempted. If the state wishes to impose an additional duty upon a non-employer to inspect for compliance by the contractor, subcontractor or builder with \u201capplicable\u201d federal regulations and to ensure enforcement of those standards, the imposition of such duty does not subject the employer to duplicative or supplemental occupational safety and health standards, and thus, does not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes or objectives of the OSH Act-namely, \u201cto assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b667 Further, the \u201cduty to inspect\u201d is not a standard. An \u201coccupational safety and health standard\u201d is defined as \u201ca standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(8). As stated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Traudt v. Potomac Electric Power Co. </em>(D.C. 1997), 692 A.2d 1326:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">Courts must apply preemption analysis \u201cnarrow[ly]\u201d with regard both to \u201cwhether Congress intended any pre-emption at all, ... [and] to questions concerning the <em>scope </em>of its intended invalidation of state law....\u201d We explained in <em>P &amp; Z Co. v. District of Columbia, </em>408 A.2d 1249, 1250 (D.C. 1979), that \u201cthe OSHA preemption subsections specifically apply only to [federal] standards promulgated by \u00a7 655\" of OSHA. Such a \u201cstandard\u201d is a \u201crequirement that directly, substantially, and specifically regulates occupational safety and health.\u201d <em>Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Ass\u2019n, </em>505 U.S. 88, 107, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992). While OSHA standards specifically addressing employee safety in regard to work with and around electrical circuits ... were in effect at the time of Traudt\u2019s accident, no regulation adopted at the time or since then suggests Congressional intent to preempt the general duty of care imposed by D.C.Code \u00a7 36-228(a). Indeed, OSHA itself contains a \u201cgeneral duty\u201d section comparable to \u00a7 36-228(a), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1)-(2), which plainly is not a \u201cstandard\u201d promulgated under \u00a7 655.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8s\"><em>Traudt, </em>692 A.2d at 1332 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AM4\">\u00b668 We find the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Traudt </em>to be persuasive and consistent with a plain reading of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 653(b)(4) and 667(a), the former preserving a right of action under state law to an injured or killed employee, and the latter preserving the authority of the state to enact occupational safety and health standards other than where OSHA has promulgated standards under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655. <em>Also see Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 96-100, 112 S.Ct. at 2382-84, 120 L.Ed.2d at 83-85, and <em>P &amp; Z, </em>408 A.2d at 1250-51. We thus disagree with the City\u2019s argument that the duties to inspect and enforce under the Montana Scaffolding Act are preempted by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657, which authorizes the Secretary of Labor to enter, inspect and investigate places of employment in order to carry out the purposes of the OSH Act. <em>P &amp; Z, </em>408 A.2d at 1250-51. There is no language in the Act itself that contemplates that inspection and enforcement of applicable standards, even if only federal standards, are the sole responsibility of the Secretary of Labor, and inspection and enforcement of federal safety and health standards by a state official will be preempted only if such inspection and enforcement is in conflict with the OSH Act by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>frustrating its purpose and objectives. As noted by the <em>Traudt </em>Court, the OSH Act contemplates that occupational safety and health standards promulgated under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655 will preempt state standards on the same occupational safety and health issue. The duty to inspect and enforce applicable regulations is not a standard as contemplated under the OSH Act, and the imposition of such duty does not subject employers or employees to duplicative regulation. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 100, 112 S.Ct. at 2384, 120 L.Ed.2d at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b669  Therefore, the building inspector\u2019s duty to inspect and enforce compliance with applicable regulations, which, in this case, are OSHA scaffolding standards, survives conflict preemption. Based on that conclusion, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding that the entirety of the Montana Scaffolding Act is impliedly field preempted by the OSH Act and OSHA regulations, thereby preempting Dukes\u2019 negligence claim for the City\u2019s alleged failure to inspect and enforce applicable federal occupational safety and health standards. The District Court thus erred in dismissing Dukes\u2019 claim against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b670 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\"> All citations to Montana Code Annotated herein refer to the 1997 code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
