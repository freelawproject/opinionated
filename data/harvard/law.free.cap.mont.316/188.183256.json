Udelhoven\u2019s petition for judicial review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Udelhoven appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court violated Udelhoven\u2019s right to due process when it dismissed her petition because she failed to comply with the service requirements of \u00a7 40-5-253(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b63 This is not the first time Udelhoven and Mark T. McGurran have come before this Court on matters relating to the support of their son. In 1999, we upheld the dismissal of Udelhoven\u2019s petition for judicial review of an administrative child support order issued by the Child Support Enforcement Division of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (CSED), on grounds that the petition was not timely filed in the district court. <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, 295 Mont. 357, 983 P.2d 968 <em>(McGurran I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\u00b64 In February of 2001, the CSED entered a \u201cmodification consent order\u201d concerning McGurran\u2019s child support obligation. Udelhoven was notified that she could challenge the provisions of the order by requesting arbitration by April 2,2001. She requested arbitration and, on April 9, 2001, CSED denied her request on the basis that she had not timely filed it. The notice of denial of her request for arbitration further stated \u201cPursuant to MCA Title 2, Chapter 4, Part 7, you may file a Petition for Judicial Review of this final order within 30 days after service of this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\u00b65 On April 16, 2001, Udelhoven petitioned the Tenth Judicial District Court, Judith Basin County, for judicial review. Udelhoven initially served her petition for judicial review on CSED and on McGurran by mailing summons and copies of the petition to their attorneys on April 17, 2001. McGurran refused to accept service by mail and his attorney sent Udelhoven\u2019s attorney a letter arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>McGurran was not a proper party to the proceeding. At the same time, CSED moved to dismiss the petition on the basis that the Tenth Judicial District Court was an incorrect venue. The district court granted CSED\u2019s motion, and Udelhoven appealed. On appeal, we determined the Tenth Judicial District Court was a proper place for trial and reversed and remanded for further proceedings. <em>In re </em>McGurran, 2002 MT 144, 310 Mont. 268, 49 P.3d 626 <em>(McGurran II). </em>\u00b66 After our June 27, 2002 opinion in <em>McGurran II, </em>Udelhoven had McGurran personally served with a summons and copy of her petition on August 14, 2002. In September of 2002, the parties stipulated to change venue to the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. McGurran then moved to dismiss Udelhoven\u2019s petition for judicial review as to him, based on Udelhoven\u2019s failure to properly serve him pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 40-5-253(4), MCA, which requires that a petition for judicial review of a CSED child support order must be served upon CSED and each party within 30 days after the petition is filed. Udelhoven responded that she did not object to the dismissal of McGurran from the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b67 In ruling on McGurran\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court stated dismissing McGurran from the action would result in \u201ca singular prejudice to McGurran, and not to the other parties.\u201d The court then determined it did not have subject matter jurisdiction because Udelhoven had not complied with the \u00a7 40-5-253(4), MCA, service requirements. It reasoned that, pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-253(4), MCA, a district court does not obtain jurisdiction until a petition for judicial review is served on all parties within 30 days after it is filed and that, because Udelhoven filed her petition in the Tenth Judicial District Court on April 16, 2001, she needed to serve all parties no later than May 16, 2001. After stating that McGurran was not personally served with a summons and copy of the petition until long after the 30-day deadline, the District Court concluded it had no choice but to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Udelhoven appeals from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b68 Did the District Court violate Udelhoven\u2019s right to due process when it dismissed her petition because of her failure to comply with the service requirements of \u00a7 40-5-253(4), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b69 The standards applicable to this Court\u2019s review of a ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction which allegedly violates a party\u2019s constitutional right to due process are set forth in</p>\n<p id=\"b217-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Pickens v. Shelton-Thompson, </em>2000 MT 131, 300 Mont. 16, 3 P.3d 603:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIN\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss to determine whether the court abused its discretion. However, a court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is' correct. Moreover, constitutional issues raise questions of law and our review of such questions is plenary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 7 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b610 Udelhoven analogizes her case to <em>Pickens </em>on both facts and the law. She urges that, pursuant to <em>Pickens, </em>the District Court\u2019s order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b611 In <em>Pickens, </em>child support obligor Pickens timely filed a petition for judicial review of a CSED child support order and mailed copies of the petition to the obligee and to CSED. CSED moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because Pickens had failed to properly serve the parties as required by \u00a7 40-5-253, MCA. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 4. The district court granted the motion to dismiss, and Pickens appealed. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"AEQ\">\u00b612 On appeal, we looked to the notice provisions in the administrative order. That order informed Pickens that he had a right to petition for judicial review under MAPA. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 9. We pointed out that a petition for judicial review under MAPA (that is, under Title 2, Chapter 4, Part 7, MCA) may be served by mailing copies of the petition to the agency and other parties and \u201cthere is no requirement that a summons be issued and served in conjunction with the petition.\u201d <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3,10 (citation omitted). While recognizing that the specific service provisions of \u00a7 40-5-253, MCA, prevail over the general service provisions of MAPA, we held that, because the notice provided to Pickens implied that MAPA service requirements applied, application of the more stringent \u00a7 40-5-253, MCA, service requirements (requiring personal service with summons) would violate Pickens\u2019 right to due process of law. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 21. We reasoned that Pickens\u2019 reliance on the misleading information given to him in the notice resulted in his failure to properly serve his petition for judicial review and, ultimately, led to his being denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 19. Under those circumstances, we held that the notice provided did not meet due process requirements. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 21. Consequently, we reversed the order of dismissal and remanded for further proceedings on Pickens\u2019 petition for judicial review. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 23. On the face of it, <em>Pickens </em>appears comparable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b613 <em>Pickens </em>was not cited or relied upon in the District Court, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>McGurran argued he was not a proper party to the proceedings and should be dismissed as a party. The District Court\u2019s order dismissing Udelhoven\u2019s petition for judicial review thus went beyond the remedy requested by McGurran. For that reason, it is appropriate to consider <em>Pickens </em>here.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b614 McGurran first asserts that we should overrule <em>Pickens </em>because access to the court system from an administrative ruling is not a constitutionally protected fundamental right to which due process applies. He relies on <em>Peterson v. Great Falls School Dist. </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 376, 773 P.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b615 In <em>Peterson, </em>a school employee brought an action against her employer school district for wrongful discharge. This Court upheld the district court\u2019s determination that the action was barred by \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, and cases interpreting that statute, on the basis of legislative immunity. The Court also rejected the employee\u2019s claim that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated her fundamental right to full legal redress. <em>Peterson, </em>237 Mont. at 380, 773 P.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b616 <em>Peterson </em>has no application here. First, <em>Peterson </em>predates <em>Pickens </em>by many years. Second, neither a due process issue nor a judicial review issue was addressed in <em>Peterson. </em>We conclude McGurran\u2019s argument that <em>Peterson </em>provides a basis on which we should overrule <em>Pickens </em>is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b617 McGurran also claims that, by failing to exhaust her administrative remedies and failing to file a timely request for arbitration, Udelhoven has not complied with MAPA or the statutory requirements for judicial review of a CSED child support order. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-4-702(l)(a) and 40-5-253(1), MCA. He asserts that, where statutory conditions for jurisdiction have not been met, the district court is powerless to review the agency decision and a defense based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b618 McGurran argued in the Tenth Judicial District Court that Udelhoven failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, but he did not cross-appeal that court\u2019s rejection of his argument. By failing to cross-appeal the issue in <em>McGurran II, </em>McGurran has waived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\u00b619 The notice CSED provided to Udelhoven that she had a right to seek judicial review contradicts McGurran\u2019s argument that there is no appealable final decision in a contested case. In addition, because McGurran did not raise this argument in the District Court, we decline to address it on appeal. <em>See Pearson v. Virginia City Ranches Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 12, \u00b6 57, 298 Mont. 52, \u00b6 57, 993 P.2d 688, \u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u00b620 Finally, as to McGurran\u2019s statement that a jurisdictional argument may be raised at any time, untimeliness of the request for arbitration would not be jurisdictional for purposes of seeking judicial review in the District Court; it would be jurisdictional only as to the request for arbitration. Udelhoven\u2019s April 16,2001 petition for judicial review was filed well within the 30 days allowed after the April 9,2001 CSED order. Therefore, while untimeliness of the request for arbitration ultimately may be a reason for the District Court to affirm the denial of the arbitration request, it is not grounds for dismissal of Udelhoven\u2019s petition for judicial review in the District Court on the basis of that court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">\u00b621 Here, as in <em>Pickens, </em>CSED\u2019s notice to Udelhoven concerning her right to seek judicial review implied that she could serve copies of her petition for judicial review pursuant to MAPA standards. For purposes of service under MAPA, it is sufficient to mail copies of the petition for judicial review to the parties and the agency. Sections 2-4-106 and - 702, MCA; Rule 5(b), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 324, 332, 922 P.2d 469, 474. Therefore, Udelhoven\u2019s original mailing of a copy of her petition to McGurran\u2019s attorney-which has not been challenged as untimely-was sufficient service upon McGurran.</p>\n<p id=\"ANW\">\u00b622  Udelhoven\u2019s reliance on MAPA procedures was suggested by the language used in the notice CSED gave her of her right to petition for judicial review. That reliance resulted in her failure to properly serve her petition for judicial review and, ultimately, denial of a meaningful opportunity to be heard. For those reasons, we conclude that <em>Pickens </em>is controlling precedent here, and that dismissal of the petition for judicial review on the basis of failure to follow the \u00a7 40-5-253(4), MCA, service requirements would violate Udelhoven\u2019s right to due process of law. Therefore, we hold that the District Court erred in dismissing Udelhoven\u2019s petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b623 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
