(Han Farms) filed an action in the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Hill County, against Appellant Beatrice C. Molitor (Molitor) to establish a prescriptive easement over a roadway which passes through real property owned by Molitor. The District Court entered judgment in favor of Han Farms. Molitor appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that Han Farms established a prescriptive easement over Molitor\u2019s property?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in failing to limit the scope and extent of any such prescriptive easement?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">\u00b65 Han Farms owns certain real property in Hill County, Montana, located in Sections 12, 13, and 14 of Township 31 North, Range 16 East, Montana Principal Meridian (M.P.M.). Han Farms has tenants, Ryan and Haven Linder (Linders), living on its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">\u00b66 Molitor owns certain real property in Hill County, Montana, located at the N % of Section 14, Township 31 North, Range 16 East, M.P.M. On Molitor\u2019s property stands two residences, several outbuildings, corrals and fences. The Molitor property is used for agricultural purposes and two families live on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">\u00b67 Han Farms has utilized a roadway crossing Molitor\u2019s land since the Han Farms property was purchased in 1979. The road connects to Bullhook Road, a Hill County public road. The road across Molitor\u2019s land was used by Han Farms to access Han Farms for residential and agricultural purposes. Han Farms\u2019 predecessor in interest used the road for the same purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">\u00b68 According to Molitor, the use of the road has increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>substantially since the Linders moved onto the Han Farms property. The Linders apparently have had several recreational invitees who use the road to get to Han Farms. Molitor gave Han Farms notice that she intended to withdraw permission to use the road, which prompted Han Farms to file this action, asking the District Court to find Han Farms has a prescriptive easement over the road on Molitor\u2019s land. In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment, dated March 19, 2002, the District Court found in favor of Han Farms, concluding Han Farms does have a prescriptive easement over Molitor\u2019s road.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous, giving \u201cdue regard ... to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Rule 52(a), MR.Civ.P. In determining whether a court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, we apply a three-part test. First, the Court will review the record to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Rettig v. Kallevig </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 189, 193, 936 P.2d 807, 809. Second, if the findings are supported by substantial evidence we will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of evidence. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809. Third, if substantial evidence exists and the effect of evidence has not been misapprehended, the Court may still find that a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b610 We review conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809. It is within the province of the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of witnesses and we will not second-guess those determinations. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809. Moreover, we will uphold a district court\u2019s findings when there is substantial evidence to support them even when there is also evidence supporting contrary findings. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A2T\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in concluding that Han Farms established a prescriptive easement over Molitor\u2019s property?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b612  A prescriptive easement is created by operation of law in Montana. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 810. The party claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the easement must establish open, notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted use of the claimed easement for the statutory five-year period. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 810. However, because the theory of prescription is based on adverse use, a landowner may rebut a prescriptive easement claim by establishing that the use of the claimed easement was permissive. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 193, 936 P.2d at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b613 That Han Farms\u2019 use of the road was open, notorious, exclusive, continuous and uninterrupted is not disputed. In dispute is whether Han Farms\u2019 use was hostile, or whether Molitor granted permission for use of the road. The District Court concluded that use of the road was not permissive, and a prescriptive easement over the road had been established. Molitor claims the use was permissive, and therefore a prescriptive easement cannot exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b614 At trial, Molitor testified that her predecessor in interest had given permission to Han Farms\u2019 predecessor in interest, to use the road. Molitor relies on the rule that if use of a road begins as a permissive use, it cannot ripen into a prescriptive right, no matter how long it may continue, unless there is a distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to the owner, citing <em>Morrison v. Higbee </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 515, 520, 668 P.2d 1025, 1027. However, the facts of <em>Morrison </em>are distinguishable from the facts of the present case. In <em>Morrison, </em>the record contained ample evidence that use of the road in dispute was permissive. For example, in <em>Morrison </em>the dominant land owner asked permission of the servient land owner to use the road at issue. Permission was granted, but was revoked years later. The parties then signed a license agreement for use of the road which stated that permission could be revoked at any time. <em>Morrison, </em>204 Mont. at 520, 668 P.2d at 1027. Here, no such evidence exists. Furthermore, even if Molitor\u2019s predecessor in interest had given permission to Han Farms\u2019 predecessor in interest to use the road, it would make no difference. Permissive use is not transferable. <em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 195, 189 P.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b615 Molitor also relies on <em>Rettig </em>to support her argument that the District Court erred in concluding that Han Farms\u2019 use of the road was not permissive. In <em>Rettig, </em>Englert and DeRudder owned adjacent properties. Englert had explicit permission to use a road that ran across DeRudder\u2019s property, subject to revocation of that permission. When Englert informed DeRudder that he planned to sell his property, DeRudder told Englert to warn prospective buyers that use of the road was a privilege based on a grant of permission, not a right. Rettig eventually purchased the property from Englert. Evidence showed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>when Rettig came to inspect Englert\u2019s property, prior to purchasing it, Englert informed Rettig that use of the road was permissive. After purchasing the property from Englert, Rettig used DeRudder\u2019s road. Rettig and DeRudder never had a conversation about use of road, but DeRudder often waved and smiled at Rettig as the two passed along it. DeRudder later sold his land to Kallevig, who informed Rettig that he could no longer use the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Rettig, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">First, periodic, express grants of permission are not required to maintain the permissive character of the use of a road. If a use begins as a permissive use it is presumed to continue as such. Moreover, the relevant facts here, that the use of the road by Englert and Rettigs was essentially the same, that DeRudder did not object to either Englert\u2019s or Rettigs\u2019 use, and that DeRudder intended that use be permissive only, support a conclusion that Rettigs\u2019 use of the road was pursuant to DeRudder\u2019s implied permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Rettig, </em>282 Mont. at 197, 936 P.2d at 811 (citation omitted). We based our conclusion that use of the road was permissive, rather than hostile, in part on the fact that Englert <em>warned, </em>Rettig that it was permissive. Rettig, 282 Mont. at 197, 936 P.2d at 811. However, the facts of <em>Rettig </em>are distinguishable from those of the present case. Here, the record contains no evidence that Molitor <em>ever </em>gave Han Farms permission to use the road. Thus, the rule set forth in <em>Rettig </em>regarding periodic, express grants of permission is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b617 Molitor also argues that Han Farms \u201cdid nothing to make a distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to the owner, Molitor.\u201d However, the burden is not on Han Farms to show their use of the road was hostile; the burden is on Molitor to show the use was permissive. In <em>Wareing v. Schreckendgust </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 196, 209, 930 P.2d 37, 45, we stated: \u201cAfter a claimant has established the elements of a prescriptive right, a presumption of adverse use arises and the burden shifts to the landowner affected by the prescriptive claim to establish that the claimant\u2019s use was permissive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b618  After reviewing the record, we hold that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by evidence and are not clearly erroneous, and that the court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. Based upon the evidence before it, the District Court concluded that the use of the road was hostile rather than permissive. The District Court further determined that a prescriptive easement does exist across Molitor\u2019s road.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err in failing to limit the scope and extent of any such prescriptive easement?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b620 Molitor urges that if we find Han Farms does have a prescriptive easement across Molitor\u2019s road, as we have done, we limit the scope of said easement. Molitor cites us to \u00a7 70-17-106, MCA, which states: \u201cThe extent of a servitude is determined by the terms of the grant or the nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired.\u201d Based upon this statute, Molitor argues that the scope of Han Farms\u2019 easement should be limited to the use during the prescriptive period when the easement was acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b621 Han Farms counters that we should not respond to Molitor\u2019s scope argument because the issue is not properly before this Court. Specifically, Han Farms argues that the scope issue was not raised in the pleadings and was not mentioned in the Pretrial Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b622 We addressed a similar issue in <em>Warnack v. Coneen Family Trust </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 203, 879 P.2d 715. In that case, we remanded to the District Court to determine whether a prescriptive easement existed. In doing so, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">For the guidance of the District Court on remand, however, we note that if the court determines that the Respondents have met their burden of proof and have established a prescriptive easement over the lands of the Appellants, the court must then determine the appropriate scope and extent of the easement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afr\"><em>Warnack, </em>266 Mont. at 217, 879 P.2d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u00b623  We take this opportunity to clarify that in an action in which the existence of a prescriptive easement is at issue, it is implied that the scope of the easement, if the court finds one exists, is also at issue. We base this holding on our decision in <em>Warnack, </em>as well as \u00a7 70-17-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u00b624  Pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-106, MCA, the scope of Han Farms\u2019 easement across Molitor\u2019s property should be limited to the use during the prescriptive period when the easement was acquired. We instruct the District Court to address the scope and extent of Han Farms\u2019 easement on remand, consistent with our holding in this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u00b625 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
