We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b62 The following issues are dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b63 1. Whether the jury\u2019s verdict for the State was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in admitting evidence that the shooting was an unforeseeable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in failing to give Plaintiff\u2019s instruction on the meaning of negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">\u00b66 The Cascade County Youth Court committed Bridger Bercier (Bercier) to Pine Hills as a serious juvenile offender in January 1995. He was fifteen years old at the time. On February 10, 1996, following Bercier\u2019s completion of a successful home visit and continued improved behavior, Pine Hills released Bercier for a trial community placement at Youth Evaluation Program (YEP), a non-secure supervised facility in Great Falls. YEP is a licensed youth group home used to transition boys from Pine Hills to community placements. Bercier\u2019s stay at the YEP was uneventful. However, on March 16, 1996, he walked out of the facility. Bercier\u2019s leaving was timely reported to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"AyV\">\u00b67 Bercier remained at large in Great Falls for nine days. During the evening of March 25, 1996, Bercier and two other youths, Dale Brott (Brott) and Tony Samson (Tony), were socializing in the basement of the Samson family home. Bercier had been over at the Samson home earlier in the day helping the Samson family push a car off the street and into the driveway. Brott saw that Bercier had a gun that afternoon, and Bercier had the gun with him at the Samson house that evening. All three boys' were drinking beer they had retrieved from Bercier\u2019s house. The three boys were joined by Mark, Tony\u2019s younger brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">\u00b68 Bercier passed Mark the gun without the clip. When Mark returned the gun to Bercier, all four boys were sitting on a couch. Mark sat next to Bercier on the couch. Bercier began pulling the clip in and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>out of the gun, and cocking and uncocking the gun. Bercier then discharged one round, killing Mark. The next morning Bercier surrendered to the Great Falls police. He pled guilty to negligent homicide and was returned to Pine Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b69 Samson then brought a negligence action against the State of Montana. After a six- day trial, the jury returned a verdict for the State. Samson appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b610 Was the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the State supported by substantial evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b611 We review a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support it. <em>Magart v. Schank, </em>2000 MT 279, \u00b6 4, 302 Mont. 151, \u00b6 4,13 P.3d 390, \u00b6 4, citing <em>Barnes v. United Industry, Inc. </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 25, 33, 909 P.2d 700, 705. It is not our function to agree or disagree with the jury\u2019s verdict and, consequently, if conflicting evidence exists, we do not retry the case because the jury chose to believe one party over the other. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 4, citing <em>Barnes, </em>275 Mont. at 33, 909 P.2d at 705. It is only in rare cases that a jury verdict should be set aside. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 4. Moreover, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict, we review the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 4; <em>Morgan v. Great Falls School Dist. No. 1, </em>2000 MT 28, \u00b6 8, 298 Mont. 194, \u00b6 8, 995 P.2d 422, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b612 Samson argues that uncontradicted, credible evidence shows that the State was negligent. Samson points out that the record demonstrates Pine Hills transferred Bercier to a non-secure facility without obtaining a complete psychological evaluation during the thirteen months that he was at Pine Hills, a violation of the court order committing Bercier to Pine Hills. Additionally, Pine Hills transferred Bercier to a non-secure group home in Great Falls even though he was ineligible for leave and on disciplinary status. Moreover, the record shows the State failed to contact Bercier\u2019s parents during the nine days between his escape from the group home and the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u00b613 The State contends it presented evidence contesting that these failures constituted negligence. Testimony from the State\u2019s witnesses explained the lack of a psychological evaluation of Bercier while he was at Pine Hills. Prior to arriving at Pine Hills, Bercier had a chemical dependency evaluation that was used in developing his treatment plan. Also, an intake evaluation of Bercier had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>conducted which indicated that he had no serious mental illness that would require a further psychological evaluation. In June 1996, after the shooting, a psychological evaluation of Bercier was conducted. Looking at those results, the social worker at Pine Hills testified that she would not have altered Bercier\u2019s treatment plan in 1995 had the results of the psychological evaluation been available to her at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b614 Witnesses from Pine Hills also explained why Bercier was transferred from Pine Hills to a non-secure home in Great Falls, even though he was not eligible for leave and was on disciplinary status. When the decision to transfer Bercier to YEP was initially made, he was rated at a Level III behavioral level, the highest and most favorable level. However, at the time of transfer, Bercier had been downgraded to a Level I, due to an altercation with another person at Pine Hills. The Pine Hills team working on Bercier\u2019s case determined that, despite the drop in his behavioral level, it was in Bercier\u2019s best interest to transfer him because at the YEP facility he could receive chemical dependency treatment that could not be obtained at Pine Hills. In regard to Bercier\u2019s escape, the State presented evidence that YEP had properly reported his escape to law enforcement and that the staff had no authority or responsibility to track down Bercier. The State acknowledged that staff did not contact Bercier\u2019s parents about his escape, but offered that his parents had previously been uncooperative with the State on issues regarding Bercier\u2019s actions and whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b615  It is not the duty of this Court to retry the case and evaluate the facts to determine if the State was negligent. Rather, we review a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support it. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 4. Based on a review of the record before us, we conclude there was sufficient evidence presented to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the State was not negligent. Therefore, we will not overturn the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err in admitting evidence that the shooting was an unforeseeable accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b617 The standard of review for evidentiary rulings is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Riley </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 436, 440, 893 P.2d 310, 313. The trial court exercises broad discretion in determining relevance of evidence. <em>State v. Smith, </em>1998 MT 257, \u00b6 6, 291 Mont. 236, \u00b6 6, 967 P.2d 424, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b618 Samson argues the District Court erred in allowing the State to present evidence and to argue that the shooting was an \u201cunforeseeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>accident.\u201d Samson contends the court abused its discretion in denying Samson\u2019s Motion to Disallow Testimony of Ken Baker, an expert witness for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b619 Baker has an extensive background in law enforcement, including service as chief of the behavior sciences unit of the United States Secret Service. His experience and training includes study and work in the assessment and predictability of an individual\u2019s potential for violent behavior, particularly toward governmental and corporate officials. Baker assessed, and offered testimony regarding, the predictability of Bercier\u2019s violence, which the District Court allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"AAU\">\u00b620 The State correctly observes that Samson has appeared to abandon her challenge to Baker\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert under Rule 702, M.R.Evid., which was one basis for her argument in the District Court. Instead, Samson focuses on her contention that Baker, though sufficiently qualified in his particular field, did not offer testimony constituting \u201cscientific, technical or other specialized knowledge\u201d that would \u201cassist the trier of fact,\u201d as also required by Rule 702. In other words, Samson, describing Baker\u2019s testimony as \u201cpsycho-babble,\u201d argues that the jury was perfectly capable of determining the predictability of Bercier\u2019s actions by assessing the evidence, and did not need, nor was assisted by, Baker\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b621 After testifying regarding his qualifications and his assessment of this matter, Baker opined that the shooting here was accidental and not predictable, focusing on factors such as his analysis of the crime scene, Bercier\u2019s post-shooting behavior, and particularly, Bercier\u2019s personal history. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">Baker: ... I saw nothing in his background that involved weaponry.... I didn\u2019t see in Bridger Bercier\u2019s background crimes of violence against people. I saw lots of crimes against property and thefts and thievery and stealing and such. But I did not see crimes that involved attacking people or especially with weapons or knives or guns or that type of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">Def. Cnsl: Is that significant to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">Baker: Absolutely significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">Def. Cnsl: Why so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">Baker: Well, because the absence of that deals with predictability .... [I]n terms of predictability, it certainly makes a big difference to me after having looked at the record as to whether or not this crime was predictable in [sic] my opinion is that it was not predictable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Def. Cnsl: Well -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">Baker: It was not foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b622  It is necessary, in order to sustain a negligence action, that the plaintiff establish a legal duty on the part of the defendant, a breach of that duty, causation, and damages. <em>Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Services, Inc., </em>1999 MT 199, \u00b6 18, 295 Mont. 416, \u00b6 18, 986 P.2d 1081, \u00b6 18. Further, in <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, 299 Mont. 449, 999 P.2d 1010, we explained that in cases involving a dispute over the intervening criminal act of a third party, as here, foreseeability must be analyzed twice: first, with regard to the existence of a legal duty, and second, with regard to proximate causation. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 17. \u201c[A]nalyzing foreseeability in the duty context, we look to whether or not the injured party was within the scope of risk created by the alleged negligence of the tortfeasor-that is, was the injured party a foreseeable plaintiff?\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 28. In analyzing foreseeability in the context of proximate cause, \u201cwe are concerned with whether and to what extent the defendant\u2019s conduct foreseeably and substantially caused\u201d the injury sustained by the plaintiff. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b623 Further, we have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">in cases involving intervening superseding acts of a criminal or noncriminal nature, \u201ctrial courts must continue to carefully review each fact situation ... on a case-by-case basis <em>...\u201d Estate of Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 179, 924 P.2d at 674. The causal issue of intervening criminal or noncriminal acts \u201cnormally involves questions of fact which are more properly left to the finder of fact for resolution.\u201d <em>Estate of Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 178, 924 P.2d at 674.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\"><em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b624 The State contends that it was necessary for its defense to present the testimony of Baker. Because the jury was required to determine the foreseeability of the intervening act, it needed information relating to the foreseeability of Bercier\u2019s actions, and thus, the State argues Baker\u2019s testimony was relevant and necessary and aided the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u00b625 As we held in <em>Lopez </em>and <em>LaTray, </em>determining causation requires a consideration of the foreseeability of the intervening criminal act. In <em>LaTray, </em>where a defendant\u2019s liability under similar circumstances was at issue, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">Here, as in <em>Lopez, </em>we are concerned with whether Shawn\u2019s assault was a superseding cause of the harm incurred by LaTray which, if not reasonably foreseeable, would break the chain of causation and absolve the City of liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 28. <em>See also Lacock v. 4B\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 17, 919 P.2d 373. Thus, it was necessary for the jury to determine whether the chain of causation was broken by the unforeseeability of Bercier\u2019s conduct, and, in that regard, Baker\u2019s testimony offered an analysis which purported to assess predictability of Bercier\u2019s actions. As stated above, the trial court exercises broad discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 6. Given the jury\u2019s need to determine the foreseeability of Bercier\u2019s actions, we determine that, under the particular challenge made here, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony of Baker and denying Samson\u2019s Motion to Disallow Testimony of Ken Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"AKMF\">\u00b626  An inconsistency has developed in our cases involving, as here, the foreseeability of an intervening cause, and it is appropriate that we resolve that conflict. In <em>Lacock, </em>we held that when considering foreseeability as an element of causation:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">[I]t will be necessary for the court to discuss foreseeability, in the course of explaining to the jury which intervening causes sever the chain of causation and which do not. In doing so, it will be necessary to instruct the jury consistently with the provisions of \u00a7 27-1-317, MCA, that is, <em>that the specific injury to a plaintiff need not have been foreseen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><em>Lacock, </em>277 Mont. at 22, 919 P.2d at 375-76 (emphasis added). However, despite this clear holding, language which would require a jury to determine the foreseeability of a plaintiffs \u201cspecific injury\u201d has crept back into our opinions. <em>See Lopez, </em>\u00b6 32, and <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 28. While it was not the Court\u2019s intention in either <em>Lopez </em>or <em>LaTray </em>to revise <em>Lacock\u2019s </em>holding on this issue, the language used in those cases is clearly contradictory thereto. Therefore, we take this opportunity to resolve this inconsistency by reaffirming our holding in <em>Lacock, </em>confirming that in cases alleging an intervening cause, juries must be instructed that the specific injury to the plaintiff need not have been foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b627 Did the District Court err in failing to give Plaintiffs instruction on the meaning of negligent homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b628  It is within a district court\u2019s discretion to decide how to instruct the jury, taking into account the theories of the contending parties. <em>Allison v. Town of Clyde Park, </em>2000 MT 267, \u00b6 11, 302 Mont. 55, \u00b6 11, 11 P.3d 544, \u00b6 11. This Court will not overturn a district court for instructions given to a jury without an abuse of discretion. <em>Allison, </em>\u00b6 11. This Court reviews the instructions as a whole and in light of all the instructions and the evidence introduced at trial. <em>Federated Mut. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 288, \u00b6 44, 297 Mont. 33, \u00b6 44, 991 P.2d 915, \u00b6 44. Absent prejudice, the trial court\u2019s decision will be affirmed. <em>Federated Mut., </em>\u00b6 44. No prejudice can be shown where the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>Federated Mut, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b629 Samson argues that the District Court abused its discretion in rejecting her proposed jury instruction defining the mental state of negligent homicide. Samson\u2019s proposed instruction reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aza\">Instruction No. 30: In this case, you, the jury, must accept as conclusively established that Bridger Bercier, in his answering true to the accusation in Youth Court that he committed the crime of negligent homicide, admitted that his conduct toward Michael \u201cMark\u201d Samson, in causing his death, was a \u201cgross deviation from the standard of care.\u201d For purposes of this case and for your deliberations, you are to accept as conclusive that Bridger Bercier\u2019s conduct toward Michael \u201cMark\u201d Samson was \u201ca gross deviation from the standard of care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b630 Without this instruction, Samson claims it was impossible for the jury to understand the significance of Bercier\u2019s guilty plea to the charge of negligent homicide and, thus, the jury could not place Bercier\u2019s guilty plea within the proper context. By denying Samson\u2019s instruction, Samson asserts that the jury was left with only Instruction No. 10's definition of negligence, given to judge the State\u2019s conduct herein, and was therefore required, even \u201cdirected,\u201d to conclude therefrom that Bercier had admitted only to the lack of ordinary or reasonable care when he pled guilty to negligent homicide. Samson then posits that, because of this misdirection, the jurors were not instructed in a manner that would allow them to appreciate that the State was making what Samson contends was an \u201cinconsistent\u201d argument-that the State could charge and accept a plea from Bercier for negligent homicide and then also argue in this action that the shooting was an unforeseeable accident. Samson contends that it was a gross injustice for the State to take these inconsistent positions, and error for the District Court to deny her instruction meant to highlight the State\u2019s fundamentally unfair posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b631 Samson relies on this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Rix v. General Motors </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 318, 723 P.2d 195, and <em>Chambers v. Pierson </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 436, 880 P.2d 1350, to claim the District Court committed reversible error. In those cases we stated, \u201cA party has a right to jury instructions adaptable to his theory of the case when the theory is supported by credible evidence. It is reversible error to refuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>instruct on an important part of a party\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d <em>Rix, </em>222 Mont. at 323, 723 P.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b632 The State argues that it was not necessary for the District Court to instruct the jury on the mental state of the crime of negligent homicide. According to the State, when taken as a whole, the instructions given by the District Court properly instructed the jury on the State\u2019s duty of custody and supervision, set out the elements for recovery based on negligence, defined negligence, and instructed the jury to find the State liable if the State\u2019s negligence was a cause of the death of Mark Samson. The State asserts the instructions properly included the key concepts in this wrongful death action. Relying on <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 916 P.2d 122, the State contends trial courts should not instruct on related legal concepts which do not control issues before the jury. According to the State, the mental state of Bercier at the time he committed the crime was not a controlling issue in the wrongful death case, and the District Court properly exercised its discretion in denying Samson\u2019s proposed Instruction No. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b633 On appeal, Samson has not argued that the State was in any way estopped by the homicide proceeding from defending this action with a foreseeability-related causation defense. In the District Court, Samson argued that the State was judicially estopped from offering its foreseeability theory, and tendered Instruction No. 30 in conjunction with that estoppel defense, which was denied. Here, Samson simply challenges the denial of the instruction itself, without the accompanying estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b634 Samson also offered Instruction No. 30 to boost her own foreseeability theory, which defined Bercier\u2019s conduct as reckless and postulated therefrom that it was foreseeable because of his background. Using this argument, Samson sought to undermine the State\u2019s contention that this was an accidental shooting which could not have been foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b635 However, the fundamental issue in this wrongful death action concerned the State\u2019s negligence, not the mental state of Bercier, and the instructions given by the District Court properly reflected that. When viewed in their entirety, the jury instructions given by the District Court properly stated the applicable law of the case. As such, the instructions given were adaptable to Samson\u2019s argument, and it was within the District Court\u2019s discretion to deny the proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b636  Further, the denial of the proposed instruction did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>prejudice Samson\u2019s case, as Samson was nonetheless able to present her foreseeability theory. Of course, it was not lost on anyone involved in the trial, including the jury, that this tragic incident arose from an utter lack of caution or care. Samson\u2019s counsel elicited from the deputy county attorney who prosecuted Bercier that he had determined that Bercier\u2019s actions constituted \u201ca gross deviation from the standard of care,\u201d from which Samson\u2019s counsel argued in his closing argument that the shooting was much more than an accident. Therefore, while the proposed instruction may have been helpful to Samson\u2019s presentation, she was not prevented from asserting her theory on the foreseeability of this tragedy under the instructions which were given, and thus, sustained no prejudice as a result of the District Court\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b637 Finding no abuse of discretion nor prejudice to the plaintiff herein, the decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-5\">JUSTICES NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b126-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AFi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b638 I dissent from the ruling on issue two. Samson has appealed from the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to disallow testimony of Ken Baker. Baker, an FBI profiler, offered expert testimony concluding that it was not foreseeable that Bercier would escape from YEP and would act violently and shoot Mark. In her motion, Samson argued that Baker\u2019s \u201cprofile\u201d of Bercier was little more than projection of his own issues, needs and morality. She contended that such \u201copinion\u201d from a non-psychologist \u201cis the epitome of\u2018junk,\u2019\u201d is not scientific, and does not assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence, as required by Rule 702, M.R.Evid. On appeal she contends that Baker\u2019s \u201cprofile\u201d testimony did not involve any legitimate area of specialized knowledge and thus does not come within Rule 702. Rule 702, M.R.Evid., provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u00b639 I agree with Samson that \u201cprofiling\u201d was not established as a scientific or specialized area of knowledge which would assist the trier of fact in determining the question of whether Bercier\u2019s actions were foreseeable. The District Court erred in not granting Samson\u2019s motion to disallow the expert \u201cprofile\u201d testimony of Ken Baker. I would reverse Samson\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"A7v\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b640 I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusions that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony of Ken Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b641 However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to instruct the jury on the mental state required for negligent homicide. While the issue in this action may, as suggested in the majority Opinion, be limited to the State\u2019s negligence, the State defended this action by contending that Bercier\u2019s conduct was an unforeseeable accident. As the majority notes, foreseeability is necessary to establish duty which is an element of negligence and was presented to the jury by way of the State\u2019s claim that there was an independent intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b642 The State concedes on appeal that \u201cthe intentional or accidental nature of the intervening act is clearly relevant\u201d to foreseeability and that the purpose for offering Ken Baker\u2019s testimony was to establish that Bercier\u2019s conduct which caused Mark Samson\u2019s death was merely an unforeseeable accident. However, the State\u2019s position was inconsistent with its prior position when it prosecuted Bercier. In that case, the State contended and, in fact, accepted Bercier\u2019s plea that his conduct exceeded the degree of culpability required for civil negligence. The State incarcerated Bercier because of that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b643 When the State prosecuted Bercier and accepted, his guilty plea for negligent homicide, it established that he acted with the following degree of culpability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">[A] person acts negligently and with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when the person <em>consciously disregards a risk </em>that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists or when the person disregards a risk of which the person should be aware that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of a nature and degree that to disregard it involves <em>a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation. \u201cGross deviation\u201d means a deviation that is considerably greater than lack of ordinary care. </em>Relevant terms, such as \u201cnegligent\u201d and \u201cwith negligence\u201d, have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Section 45-2-101(42), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\u00b644 In other words, while the State contended in this case that the occurrence in question was \u201caccidental,\u201d offered testimony from Bercier and Ken Baker to establish that fact, and contended that, therefore, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>could not have been foreseen, its position previously had been significantly different. In order to convict Bercier and imprison him, it alleged that his conduct was \u201cconsiderably greater than lack of ordinary care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b645 The misimpression given to the jury was compounded by the fact that the only definition of negligence the jury received was Instruction Number 10 which defined the standard of care in a civil proceeding. There, the jury was led to believe that negligence was simply a \u201clack of ordinary care.\u201d It is no consolation to the plaintiff that the jury was told that Bercier pled guilty to negligent homicide if the only definition of \u201cnegligence\u201d that it was given was specifically excluded from the statutory definition of negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b646 The State concedes that the degree of Bercier\u2019s culpability was relevant to the issue of foreseeability. The issue of foreseeability was relevant to the State\u2019s negligence and the issue of causation. Therefore, the jury was entitled to know what the State\u2019s position was regarding Bercier\u2019s degree of culpability on a previous occasion under circumstances where it was not in the State\u2019s interest to minimize his conduct. The State should not have been allowed to make up the facts as it went along based on its own interests. I conclude that because the jury was denied that information, the plaintiff was denied a fair trial. For these reasons, I dissent from the majority Opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for a new trial with proper instructions to the jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
