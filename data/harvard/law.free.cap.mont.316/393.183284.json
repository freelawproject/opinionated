Peterson (Gail) appeals the determination of the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County, that she bears joint and several liability with her ex-husband Donald C. Peterson (Donald) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>for the unpaid salary, penalties, attorney fees and court costs awarded to Kathy J. Harker (Harker). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion that a partnership existed between Gail and Donald from June 1997 through August 1998 was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b63 Gail and Donald married in Alaska in 1984. The couple purchased real property along Highway 200 in Sanders County near the Idaho border in 1994 with the intention of opening a bar, restaurant and casino. They secured an all-beverage liquor license in March 1995, which the State of Montana issued in both of their names. Because the license had been transferred across county lines, Gail and Donald were restricted from selling or transferring the license for five years, under \u00a7 16-4-204(1), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b64 The Petersons opened the Boar\u2019s Breath Bar &amp; Casino (the Boar\u2019s Breath) in July 1995. Harker was hired as a prep cook and swamper during the fall of 1995, and after a few months, she began tending bar. When Gail discovered that an intimate relationship had developed between Harker and her husband, she demanded that both Donald and Harker vacate the premises. Gail then operated the Boar\u2019s Breath by herself until May 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b65 Donald and Gail decided to divorce in April 1997. They negotiated a property settlement agreement (the agreement), which they signed on May 6, 1997, and filed with the District Court on June 18, 1997. The agreement provided that although the real and personal property occupied and used by the Boar\u2019s Breath was jointly owned by Donald and Gail, Donald would operate the bar and restaurant and receive all profits of the business. Donald also would be responsible for all liabilities generated by the operation of the Boar\u2019s Breath. Donald agreed to harvest $150,000 worth of timber on land belonging to Gail and use the money to pay-off the property loans for the bar and restaurant. On March 15, 2000, when the five-year restriction on the transfer of the liquor license expired, the agreement specified that all real and personal property associated with the Boar\u2019s Breath would be offered for sale. Either party could exercise a 30-day option to buy-out the other, or, if the assets were sold to a third party, Gail and Donald would split the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u00b66 Gail ceased any involvement with the day-to-day operation of the Boar\u2019s Breath in mid-June 1997. The business was operated by Donald and Harker as a couple, according to the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>numerous employees. Donald agreed to pay Harker a salary of $1,400 each month, and Harker agreed to work as many hours as necessary to keep the business open and successful. By late June 1997, Donald experienced financial difficulties and stopped paying Harker\u2019s salary; Harker agreed to wait to receive her pay. Harker received no wages from the end of June 1997 through the end of October 1998. Donald paid all employees, except Harker, in cash and failed to report any wages to the state and federal governments for income, social security, unemployment insurance and other taxing purposes or for workers\u2019 compensation coverage. When the business\u2019s gambling machines were repossessed for lack of payment, Gail was contacted because her name still was included on the leasing papers. The parties do not dispute that this incident constituted Gail\u2019s only involvement with the Boar\u2019s Breath from mid-June 1997 through October 31, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b67 Gail and Donald divorced on August 26,1997. The District Court incorporated their May 1997 agreement as part of the formal decree of dissolution over Donald\u2019s objection. By stipulation, the parties agreed to retry contested property issues rather than pursue an appeal. After a hearing, the court determined that the May 1997 agreement was conscionable and enforceable. In addition, the court found that \u201c[t]he parties contemplated and agreed that the responsibilities and obligations under the property settlement agreement commenced upon signing the agreement.\u201d The court acknowledged that Gail fulfilled her promise to relinquish all control of the Boar\u2019s Breath to Donald in June 1997. Donald, on the other hand, failed to uphold his part of the agreement. In particular, the court found that Donald\u2019s timber harvest operation on Gail\u2019s property did not yield sufficient money to pay-off the couple\u2019s property loans. The court\u2019s order of August 30, 1998, modified the May 1997 agreement by awarding the heavily encumbered real and personal property associated with the Boar\u2019s Breath to Donald and canceling the future sale of the business\u2019s assets. The order listed the specific debts and liabilities of the Boar\u2019s Breath that were assigned to Donald.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b68 Donald again appealed and the parties entered settlement negotiations. According to a new agreement reached on October 30, 1998, Gail pin-chased the assets of the Boar\u2019s Breath from Donald for $20,000 and assumed the debts and liabilities listed in the District Court\u2019s order of August 30, 1998. In exchange, Donald agreed to release all interest in the property and allow Gail to assume control of the premises on November 2, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b69 On November 13, 1998, Harker filed a claim with the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Department of Labor and Industry (the Department) for her unremunerated work at the Boar\u2019s Breath from late June 1997 through October 1998. Donald supported the claim with a letter acknowledging that the Boar\u2019s Breath failed to pay Harker for 18 months and owed her $25,200 in back salary. Gail countered that Harker earned her unpaid salary while Donald controlled the Boar\u2019s Breath and that Donald alone was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b610 The Department\u2019s compliance officer determined that Gail and Donald, as partners in the Boar\u2019s Breath, were jointly and severally liable for Harker\u2019s unpaid wages. Gail appealed. The Department\u2019s Hearings Bureau found that Gail\u2019s partnership interest in the Boar\u2019s Breath terminated on August 30, 1998, when the District Court finalized the property settlement stemming from the dissolution of her marriage with Donald. The Board of Personnel Appeals affirmed and apportioned $29,706 of Harker\u2019s unpaid wages and penalties to Gail and Donald, jointly and severally, and $6,099 to Donald, personally. Following this ruling, Donald delivered $3,000 to Harker as partial payment. The District Court again affirmed and directed Gail and Donald to pay Harker\u2019s attorney fees and court costs in the amount of $5,101.90. Gail filed an appeal with this Court, which Donald, acting <em>pro se, </em>did not join. Neither Harker nor the Department filed respondent briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous; we review conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Small v. Board of Trustees, Glacier County School District No. </em>9, 2001 MT 181, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 199, \u00b6 7, 31 P.3d 358, \u00b6 7 (citing <em>Baldridge v. Board of Trustees, Rosebud County School Dist. No. 19, Colstrip, Mont. </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 53, 58, 951 P.2d 1343, 1346).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u00b612  The question of whether a partnership exists constitutes a mixed question of fact and law. <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>1998 MT 303, \u00b6 28, 292 Mont. 97, \u00b6 28, 971 P.2d 767, \u00b6 28. Courts must decide as a matter of law what constitutes a partnership, but the determination of whether the evidence in a given case supports the existence of a partnership is a question of fact. <em>Bollinger, </em>\u00b6 28. When the facts are undisputed or susceptible of only one inference, the question of whether a partnership exists between particular persons is one of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>for the court. <em>Bollinger, </em>\u00b6 28 (citing <em>Pruitt v. Fetty </em>(W. Va. 1964), 134 S.E.2d 713, 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b613 The District Court affirmed the findings and conclusions of the Department\u2019s hearings officer and the Board of Personnel Appeals. Gail concurs that all findings are supported by substantial credible evidence, with the single exception of the determination that she and Donald operated the Boar\u2019s Breath as a partnership between June 1997 and August 1998. Therefore, the issue before us today is whether the undisputed facts support the existence of a partnership, which is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b614 Section 35-10-202(1), MCA, defines a partnership as \u201cthe association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit . . . whether or not the persons intend to create a partnership.\u201d The statute also sets forth some explicit rules for determining whether a partnership is created and provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[jjoint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership even if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property.\u201d Section 35-10-202(3)(a), MCA. To withdraw from a partnership, \u00a7 35-10-616(1), MCA, provides that a partner is dissociated from a partnership \u201cupon receipt by the partnership of notice of the partner\u2019s express will to withdraw as a partner or upon any later date specified in the notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b615  The burden of establishing a partnership is upon the person claiming a partnership exists. <em>Antonick v. Jones </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 279, 283, 769 P.2d 1240, 1242 (citation omitted). This Court has repeatedly stated that a partnership exists where: (1) the parties clearly manifest their intent to form a partnership; (2) each party contributes something to promote the partnership; (3) each party has a right of mutual control over the subject of the partnership; and (4) there is an agreement among the parties to share the profits of the enterprise. <em>MacArthur Co. v. Stein </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 85, 89, 934 P.2d 214, 217. <em>See also, Bolinger, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>Weingart v. C &amp; W Taylor Partnership </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 76, 79-80, 809 P.2d 576, 578; <em>Bender v. Bender </em>(1965), 144 Mont. 470, 480, 397 P.2d 957, 962. All four requirements must be established to prove the existence of a partnership. <em>MacArthur Co., </em>282 Mont. at 89, 934 P.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b616 To reiterate, the District Court found the agreement that Gail and Donald negotiated in anticipation of the dissolution of their marriage to be conscionable, enforceable and effective upon execution on May 6, 1997. The agreement distributed the marital property and delineated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the parties\u2019 separate financial responsibilities. The terms allotted Donald exclusive control of the Boar\u2019s Breath operation and directed that the assets of the business be offered for sale on March 15, 2000, when the restrictions on the transfer of the liquor license expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b617 Gail does not dispute the District Court\u2019s finding that she and Donald initially operated the Boar\u2019s Breath as a partnership. She contends that the May 1997 agreement that she executed with Donald gave notice of her withdrawal from that partnership and the partnership terminated when she relinquished control of the Boar\u2019s Breath to Donald. She argues that the factual findings of the court actually support the conclusion that no partnership existed between mid-June 1997 and August 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b618  The initial test of whether a partnership exists is the intent of the parties, which implies a mutual agreement or meeting of the minds. The May 1997 agreement acknowledges that the real and personal property of the Boar\u2019s Breath would continue to be jointly owned by Gail and Donald. The agreement, however, does not express an intent to carry on the Boar\u2019s Breath business as partners. Under the second factor, which requires each party contribute something to promote the partnership, we note that under the agreement terms, the business would occupy and use property that Gail co-owned with Donald until March 15, 2000, at which time the property would be offered for sale. No evidence indicates that the Boar\u2019s Breath paid rent to Gail during this interim. Clearly, the rental subsidy served to promote the financial success of the business, which weighs in favor of Gail\u2019s participation as a partner. However, the third factor dealing with the right of mutual control countervails. The agreement directed Gail to relinquish all control of the business enterprise to Donald, which she did by mid-June 1997. Finally, under the fourth partnership factor that requires an agreement to share the profits, the May 1997 agreement allotted all profits of the Boar\u2019s Breath to Donald. Therefore, we conclude that there is no support for finding a partnership under three of the four criteria after mid-June 1997 when Gail handed over control of the enterprise to Donald, ceased sharing in the profits by agreement and completely disassociated herself from the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b619  We hold that the partnership between Gail and Donald to carry on the business of the Boar\u2019s Breath ended by mid-June 1997. Because Gail was not a business partner, the conclusion that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Harker\u2019s employer between late June 1997 and August 1998 is incorrect as a matter of law. Therefore, Gail bears no liability for Harker\u2019s unpaid wages from the Boar\u2019s Breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b620 Reversed and remanded to the District Court for further proceeding consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
