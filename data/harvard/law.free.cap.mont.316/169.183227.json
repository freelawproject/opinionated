We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting testimony regarding Ely\u2019s refusal to provide a urine sample voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b63 On February 15, 2001, Lake County Sheriffs Office Detective Andrew Cannon (Cannon), along with several sheriffs deputies, executed a search-pursuant to a warrant-of the trailer house in which Ely lived. During the search, Cannon discovered a metal cigar tube containing a white powdery substance believed-and later established-to be methamphetamine. Ely arrived at the trailer during the search and was arrested. The following day, Cannon requested Ely voluntarily provide a urine sample for testing. Ely refused. Cannon then obtained a search warrant, acquired the urine sample from Ely and sent it to the Montana State Crime Laboratory. The urine sample tested positive for methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b64 The State of Montana (State) subsequently charged Ely by information with the offenses of felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs and misdemeanor criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. The misdemeanor offense was dismissed prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ANs\">\u00b65 A jury trial was held on January 22, 2002. At trial, the State called Cannon as a witness. During direct examination, Cannon testified regarding the facts that Ely had refused to provide the urine sample voluntarily and Cannon was required to obtain a search warrant to acquire it. Ely objected to the admission of this testimony, the District Court overruled the objection, and the jury ultimately found Ely guilty of criminal possession of dangerous drugs. The court sentenced Ely and entered judgment on the conviction and sentence. Ely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u00b66 The determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is within the sound discretion of the trial court and we will not overturn that decision absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Rodarte, </em>2002 MT 317, \u00b6 9, 313 Mont. 131, \u00b6 9, 60 P.3d 983, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b67 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in admitting testimony regarding Ely\u2019s refusal to provide a urine sample voluntarily?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b68 Ely argues that the District Court abused its discretion in allowing Cannon to testify regarding his refusal to provide a voluntary urine sample. He asserts that the acquisition of a urine sample constitutes a search and that both the Montana and United States Constitutions guarantee him the right to refuse to consent to that search. He further asserts that it is impermissible for the State to use the fact that he exercised his constitutional right to refuse to consent to a search as evidence at trial to establish his guilt. In response, the State argues that Ely is barred from raising these theories because they are not the basis on which he objected to the testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Aek_\">\u00b69  It is well-established that an appellant may not change legal theories on appeal or raise issues which were not raised in the trial court. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hoffman, </em>2003 MT 26, \u00b6 44, 314 Mont. 155, \u00b6 44, 64 P.3d 1013, \u00b6 44; <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 5, 313 Mont. 218, \u00b6 5, 61 P.3d 749, \u00b6 5; <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2000 MT 379, \u00b6 30, 303 Mont. 507, \u00b6 30, 16 P.3d 391, \u00b6 30; <em>State v. Chesarek, </em>1998 MT 15, \u00b6 14, 287 Mont. 215, \u00b6 14, 953 P.2d 698, \u00b6 14. The rationale for this rule is that it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue it was never given the opportunity to address. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b610 At trial, Ely objected to Cannon\u2019s testimony on the basis that its probative value would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Ely\u2019s counsel also made a brief reference to Ely\u2019s right to refuse to voluntarily provide potentially incriminating evidence. Ely\u2019s counsel did not refer, however, to Ely\u2019s constitutional right to refuse consent to a warrantless search; nor did he argue that admission of the testimony would impermissibly penalize Ely for having asserted a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b611 On this record, we conclude that Ely\u2019s objection to admission of Cannon\u2019s testimony at trial was premised on different bases than he now asserts on appeal and, as a result, Ely has changed his legal theory and argument on appeal. Consequently, we decline to address this new theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b612  Ely having abandoned on appeal the objections made at trial, we hold he has failed to establish that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting testimony regarding his refusal to provide a urine sample voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-10\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AbF\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b614 At \u00b6 10, the Court faults Ely\u2019s counsel for failing to refer \"... to Ely\u2019s constitutional right to refuse consent to a warrantless search.\u201d In my view, Ely\u2019s counsel made reference to Ely\u2019s constitutional rights, although not in the precise language the Court would like. Specifically, Ely\u2019s counsel asked the court for a short recess when he knew Officer Cannon was about to testify that Ely refused to voluntarily give a urine sample. While out of the presence of the jury, Ely\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the State has authority over a refusal by the defendant, especially a custodial defendant, to give voluntarily what is potentially incriminatory evidence.\u201d Later in the colloquy with the court, he said: \u201cThe defendant has a right to not voluntarily offer urine samples or blood samples or any other type of bodily sample.\u201d Thus, twice, Ely\u2019s counsel, while perhaps unartfully, made reference to the defendant\u2019s right to refuse to voluntarily give up his bodily fluids to a police officer on his request. Granted, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not speak in the specific terms of Ely\u2019s \u201cright to refuse consent to a warrantless search,\u201d but his objection was, in my judgment, specific enough to raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b615 Second, the Court says that Ely\u2019s counsel failed to argue that admission of the testimony would impermissibly penalize Ely for having asserted a constitutional right. <em>Ely, </em>\u00b6 10. While again, I agree that he did not specifically state that \"... the testimony would impermissibly penalize Ely ...\u201d the potential prejudicial impact of the testimony was the whole basis for his objection and the record he made. He clearly argued prejudice, which is surely akin to \u201cpenalize.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acl\">\u00b616 Counsel for the defendant may not have stated his objections as succinctly as the Court would like, but in my view, there is no question that he preserved his objection adequately for review on appeal. I think we have far too finely parsed the language of Ely\u2019s objection, which does not bode well for the competent but less articulate among us.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b617 I would not find that Ely changed his legal theory and argument on appeal. I would address Ely\u2019s objection on the merits, and I would conclude that the District Court, having been forewarned of the State\u2019s intention to introduce evidence of Ely\u2019s refusal to voluntarily give a urine sample, and allowing it anyway over the objection of the defendant, abused its discretion. I would therefore reverse. I dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
