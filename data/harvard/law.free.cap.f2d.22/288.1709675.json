She came to Canada in possession of a British passport and sought to obtain from the United States consul at Montreal a vis\u00e9 of her passport authorizing her to enter temporarily to visit her children, all of whom live in or near New York City. Such vis\u00e9 having been refused, she presented herself on July 24, 1920, at the United States immigration station at St. Albans, Yt. After a hearing before a Board of Special Inquiry, she was detained as an alien who had entered the United States without a passport properly visaed by an American consul. Thereupon this writ of habeas corpus was sued out. Upon the hearing the court discharged the writ and remanded the relator to the custody of the respondent. (D. C.) 14 F.(2d) 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The requirement of a vis\u00e9 is found in the President\u2019s Executive Order No. 4125, dated January 12, 1925, which provides, with certain exceptions, that aliens who are non-immigrants \u201cmust present passports * * * duly visaed by consular' officers of the United States.\u201d See U. S. Dept. Labor, Immigration Laws and Rules of July 1, 1925, p. 67. Authority for such order is found in the Act of May 22, 1918 (40 Stat. 559 [22 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 223-226]), as amended by the Aet of March 2, 1921 (41 Stat. 1205, 1217 [22 USCA \u00a7 227]). The former aet authorized the President, \u201cwhen the United States is at war,\u201d to make reasonable rules, regulations, and orders with respect to the entry and departure of aliens. The later aet declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\u201cThat the previsions of the Aet approved May 22, 1918, shall, in so far as they relate to requiring passports and vis\u00e9s from aliens seeking to eorne to the United States, continue in force and effect until otherwise provided by law.\u201d Section 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">It is to be noted that the Act of May 22, 1918, did not contain the words \u201cpassports and vises,\u201d but no doubt can be entertained that the power conferred upon the President to make \u201creasonable rules, regulations and orders\u201d was sufficient to empower him to require consular vises upon the passports of entering aliens. Congress itself so interpreted it in the Act of November 10, 1919, which was to extend the President\u2019s powers to March 4, 1921, if peace should he earlier declared. 41 Stat. 353 (Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 7628i-7628m). The President exercised his powers by an Executive Order dated August 8,1918. That order, however, excepted from its passport requirement aliens coming from Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">The appellant contends that the Aet of March 2, 1921, which continues in force the provisions of the 1918 aet \u201cin so far as they relate to requiring passports and vises,\u201d crystallized into permanency the then existing regulations regarding passports and vis\u00e9s, and that the President\u2019s power to modify those regulations or make new ones was not continued. From this premise it would follow that the Executive Order of January 12, 1925, was invalid, and that the relator was entitled to enter from Canada for a temporary visit without passport and vis\u00e9. The refusal of the trial court to adopt this premise is the assignment, of error most strongly pressed upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\"> The appellant\u2019s contention finds no support, in our opinion, eitherinthewordsof the legislation or in the case law. The adoption of an earlier statute by\" reference makes it as much a part of the later aet as though it had been incorporated at full length, and brings in all that is fairly covered by the reference. Engel v. Davenport, 271 U. S. 33, 38, 46 S. Ct. 410, 70 L. Ed. 813. The Aet of March 2, 1921, expressly continues \u201cthe provisions\u201d of the earlier aet \u201cin so far as. they relate to requiring passports and vis\u00e9s.\u201d The provisions which empower the President to make regulations respecting the entry or departure of aliens may fairly be referred to as provisions which \u201crelate to requiring passports and vis\u00e9s.\u201d The purpose and effect of the Act of March 2, 1921, was not merely to extend the duration of existing regulations, hut was to do away with the limitation of the earlier aet, which restricted the President\u2019s power to \u201cwhen the United States is at war.\u201d It removed these provisions from the class of so-called \u201cwar legislation,\u201d so that their operation was not terminated by the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1921 (41 Stat. 1359 [Comp. St. \u00a7 311514/15f]). United States ex rel. Le Grazie v. Wallis (D. C.) 278 F. 838, affirmed 278 F. 840 (C. C. A. 2); Flora v. Rustad, 8 F.(2d) 335 (C. C. A. 8); Takeyo Koyama v. Burnett, 8 F.(2d) 940 (C. C. A. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Subsequent to March 2, 1921, Executive Orders have been promulgated both by President Harding and by President Coolidge under authority of the 1918 act as continued by the act of 1921. No decision has been cited which suggests any doubt of the valid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ity of such orders, except Johnson v. Keating, 17 F.(2d) 50 (C. C. A. 1). That case, however, holds merely that the President\u2019s powers were terminated as to immigrants by the Immigration Act of 1924 (8 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 145, 146, 166, 167, 179, 201-226, 229). The appellant in the instant case is avowedly not an \u201cimmigrant,\u201d but a temporary visitor, within the definition of that act, and, as such, is by section 3 expressly excluded from the provisions of the act of 1924 (43 Stat. 154 [8 USCA \u00a7 203]). See Chryssikos v. Commissioner, 3 F.(2d) 372 (C. C. A. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We conclude, therefore, that,the Executive Order of January 12, 1925, was a valid regulation, and required that the relator, before entering as a temporary visitor, present a passport duly visaed by an American consul. This accords with the holdings or dicta of all cases dealing with the problem which .have been discovered. United States ex rel. Porter v. Yale, 14 F.(2d) 682 (D. C. N. D. N. Y.). And see Throumoulopolou v. United States, 3 F.(2d) 803 (C. C. A. 1); Flora v. Rustad, supra; Takeyo Koyama v. Burnett, supra; United States v. Wallis, supra. She was not within the exception of paragraph 2, subdivision F, rule 3, of the Immigration Rules of July 1, 1925, for she was neither a \u201ccitizen of Canada\u201d nor a \u201cBritish subject domiciled therein.\u201d Avowedly she came to Canada with the intention of remaining there only until she could effect entry into the United States for a visit to her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">It is urged that, even if a vis\u00e9 was lawfully imposed as a condition upon a non-immigrant\u2019s entry, the giving of a vis\u00e9 is a ministerial act, which the consul was bound to perform, and consequently the court should regard its omission as immaterial. With this we cannot agree. Certainly the giving of a vis\u00e9 is not merely a ministerial act, because some inquiry on the spot, some determination of fact, is essential. It is admitted that the consul may withhold his vis\u00e9 if he believes the passport not to be genuine, or not in the hands of the rightful holder. The instructions of the Secretary of State which supplement the Executive Order, also require the consul to \u201csatisfy himself of the temporary nature of the visit\u201d of the alien. Whether the consul has acted reasonably or unreasonably is not for us to determine. Unjustifiable refusal to vis\u00e9 a passport may be ground for diplomatic complaint by the nation whose subject has' been discriminated against. See 3 Moore\u2019s Digest, 996. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As the relator had no visaed passport, her exclusion was proper, and the order discharging the writ is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
