HAND, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A0UI\">(after stating the facts as above).  As to validity, the question is whether the mark was \u201cdescriptive,\u201d or only \u201csuggestive,\u201d of tho goods sold. A \u201cdescriptive\u201d mark is had for two reasons: First, because it does not in fact advise the public that the goods come from a \u201csingle source\u201d (Coca-Cola v. Koke Co., 254 U. S. 143, 146, 41 S. Ct. 113, 65 L. Ed. 189); second, because, if it did, since the word describes the goods, the protection of the mark would trench upon common speech which should do the same (Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Co., 220 U. S. 446, 31 S. Ct. 456, 55 L. Ed. 536; Beckwith v. Commissioner of Patents, 252 U. S. 538, 544, 40 S. Ct. 414, 64 L. Ed. 705; Warner &amp; Co. v. Lilly &amp; Co., 265 U. S. 526, 528, 44 S. Ct. 615, 68 L. Ed. 1161). A \u201csuggestive\u201d mark, which avoids both these defects, may still substantially describe the goods (Keasbey v. Brooklyn Chemical Works, 142 N. Y. 467, 37 N. E. 476, 40 Am. St. Rep. 623; Feil v. American Serum Co. [C. C. A. 8] 16 F.[2d] 88; Pennsylvania Salt Co. v. Myers [C. C.] 79 F. 87), for there is no positive policy that forbids the combination. The mark may be so far from, colloquial language as not to be confused with any descriptive phrase, and yet eonvey the same meaning. This distinction section 5 of the statute (15 USCA \u00a7 85) means to preserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">In the case at bar, the misspelling of oxygen, if once observed, would indeed betray the fabrication of the word and show that it was being used as a trade-mark. It is, however, generally held that mere misspelling is not enough. Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Co., 220 U. S. 446, 455, 31 S. Ct. 456, 55 L. Ed. 536; Thermogene Co., Ltd., v. Thermozine Co., Inc., 234 F. 69 (C. C. A. 2); Krank v. Pabst, 277 F. 15, 18 (C. C. A. 5); American Druggist Syndicate v. U. S. Industrial Alcohol Co., 55 App. D. C. 140, 2 F.(2d) 942; Parmele Pharmacal Co. v. Weiner, 5 F.(2d) 751 (C. C. A. 2). Whether this is because the public is not assumed to be critical enough to detect the contrivance, or whether the mark could have no scope, the hooks do not say. The difficulty is double; a reader who knew how to spell might he in doubt whether the mistake was deliberate; one who did not, would he unaware that it was a mistake at all. We need not say that the perversion might not he so obvious as to stamp upon the mark its artificial origin and show its purpose (Feil v. American Serum Co., 16 F.[2d] 88 [C. C. A. 8]), for in such matters it is especially unsafe to be absolute. It does seem to us, however, that the misspell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>ing of a single letter is too little, for, while to many it might be enough, over many it would pass unnoticed. We cannot, therefore, treat the mark at bar as entitled to more protection than \u201cDioxygen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">While that is indeed not itself an English word at all, its composition is apparent. \u201cDi\u201d is not an unknown prefix \u2014 e. g., \u201cdiphthong,\u201d \u201cdilemma,\u201d \u201cdichotomy,\u201d and \u201cdiptych\u201d \u2014 and in scientific and technical terminology it is common. Its significance as a prefix to oxygen would be plain to a literate person; the word would mean \u201cdouble oxygen.\u201d True, it would still remain ambiguous; but then too, so would \u201cdioxide,\u201d standing alone, a wqrd of common speech. It is not enough that the meaning should not be clear; it must indicate the source of the product, and this \u201cdioxygen\u201d certainly would not do. Even to the unlettered, oxygen must by now have come at least vaguely to mean some sort of substance; it is too common to be altogether unknown. The prefix might indeed be meaningless, yet it would indicate some new sort of oxygen.' Again, this will not serve, unless in addition it gives an intimation of source, which it would do as little as to more sophisticated persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Therefore it seems to us that the mark fails in the first requirement. It fails also in the second. \u201cDioxide\u201d would infringe as much as \u201cperoxygen\u201d \u2014 more indeed \u2014 and yet it is the <em>only </em>proper word <em>to </em>describe the class of compounds among which the plaintiff\u2019s product is. Certainly the defendant could have used it. Indeed, \u201cdouble oxygen\u201d itself would be an equal infringement. Both these are actual words. In a suit for unfair trade perhaps the plaintiff could forbid such words as \u201cperoxygen\u201d or \u201cbioxygen,\u201d .for these are coined, and it is no hardship to prevent their use. But a trade-mark, simpliciter, must be good against all infringements, or against none, else the question of its registry could not be decided in vacuo, as it must be. If a true description in English speech is an infringement, the mark is wholly bad. So it may be questioned whether \u201cWormix,\u201d however sufficient in a suit for unfair trade, was a valid trade-mark. Feil v. American Serum Co., 16 F.(2d) 88 (C. C. A. 8). If so, then \u201cWorm Mixture\u201d could have been forbidden, which would seem to be as near an infringement as \u201cWorm X.\u201d In the case at bar it is enough in our judgment on the second point that \u201cdioxide\u201d and \u201cdouble oxygen\u201d would infringe, and that these describe the class of substances to which the product belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
