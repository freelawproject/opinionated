St. \u00a7 6352) of the United States Revised Statutes on the ground that the same was being used for the purpose of depositing and concealing merchandise alleged to have been imported into the United States contrary to law; that at the time of such seizure, and for some time prior thereto, the plaintiff was the owner and holder of a lien against the truck so seized in the sum of $1,383.84, no part of which has been paid, and that such lien was and is unsatisfied and is protected by section 26 of the National Prohibition Act; that upon the conviction of Burke for the violation of said section, the forfeiture of the truck thereunder became mandatory for the protection of the interest of bona fide lienholders; that the plaintiff has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and will suffer irreparable loss and injury if the collector is permitted to sell the truck as threatened; that the plaintiff had no knowledge that the truck was being used in an illegal manner, and particularly for any violation of the National Prohibition Act, and had no knowledge that would lead him to believe that the truck was being so used. Tho prayer of the complaint was for a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from selling or disposing of the truck and requiring him to deliver the same into the custody of the court to be disposed of pursuant to section 26 of the National Prohibition Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The answer of the defendant denied that the plaintiff had no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, averred that he had such a remedy by filing a claim with the collect- or and posting a bond as provided by law, and then set forth affirmatively the steps taken by the collector to enforce a forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The court below in its opinion seems to discuss the merits of the ease in a measure, hut its ultimate conclusion was based upon the ground that an equitable suit for an injunction will not lie. In this latter conclusion we concur. The law provides for a summary forfeiture and sale by the collector when the appraised value of the property is less than $1,000, but any person claiming the property may stay all further proceedings before the collector by filing a claim and executing a bond as provided by tho statute. When this is done, the authority of the collector is at an end, and the whole matter is automatically transferred to a court of law, where aE the parties in interest are given their day in court and a full opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">This remedy would seem to be full, complete, and adequate. True, the claimant is not given a right of action in his own name; but this in nowise detracts from the adequacy of the legal remedy. He is given the right to compel the government to institute proceedings in which his rights may be fully heard and determined, and it is entirely immaterial whether he appears in court as a plaintiff in an action at law, or as a claimant in a proceeding at law to declare a forfeiture. The very object of the statute would seem to be to give parties claiming the seized property a right to have their claims deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>mined in a court of law, instead of compelling them to resort to some other proceeding, or to invoke some other remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The decree of the court below went too far, however, in disposing of the case upon its merits. The dismissal should have been without prejudice to any legal remedy that may be available to the appellant, and the decree will be so modified. As thus modified, the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
