Of these, about $49,000 were forgeries. In March, 1925, the representative of the Finance Company examined Sullivan\u2019s books, discovered the fraud, and procured from Sullivan, by way of-partial substitution for the forged accounts, assignments of about $10,000 of valid receivables. It is conceded that the Finance Company then had reasonable cause to believe Sullivan insolvent. Adjudication ensued the next month.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">The controversy is over the proceeds of the new and valid receivables thus assigned in March. The referee, whose jurisdiction is conceded, held the transaction a preference. The\u2019Distriet Court (Lowell, J.) reversed the referee, saying: \u201cThe company lent its money on.the faith of the bankrupt\u2019s assigning good accounts. When it discovered that the accounts were bad \u2014 in fact, had no'existence \u25a0 \u2014 -it required him to do merely what he had agreed to do. His estate has not been depleted by the transfer of the good accounts, because the bankrupt merely did under compulsion what he should have done in the first place; and his estate would not have received the benefit of the money loaned, unless the Manufacturers\u2019 Company had trusted him to. assign good accounts. * * * The ease at bar is similar to those which involve the doctrine of what is known\u2019 as an 'equitable lien.\u2019 Sexton v. Kessler, 225 U. S. 90, 32 S. Ct. <em>657, </em>56 L. Ed. 995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">We,,think the, referee was right, and the court wrong. Forged accounts are not part of a bankrupt estate; they are nothing. Sullivan\u2019s warranty of title of the specifically described and assigned accounts cannot be extended into an equitable lien over undesignated, unassigned (and, for aught that appears, then nonexistent) accounts. The assignments were limited to specifically assigned accounts; they can no more be extended to cover, by way of equitable lien or any other right, undesignated accounts, than a chattel mortgage of furniture not owned can be extended to cover undescribed furniture actually owned. When Sullivan assigned valid receivables in substitution for forged receivables, he depleted his estate to that extent. Prior to the March transfer, what the Finance Company had was forgeries, plus Sullivan\u2019s contract or covenant that they were valid. That contract or covenant cannot be related to the assignments in March.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">The theory urged, and in effect adopted by the court below, is that, because Sullivan procured money from the Finance Company on forged receivables, an equity then and there arose against all of Sullivan\u2019s real assets of the same general nature, although un-\u2019 mentioned either specifically or in general terms in the contract or instruments of assignment, and even if not then in existence. We regard this theory as unsound, on principle and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">Undoubtedly valid equitable liens antedating the four months period are enforceable in bankruptcy. Thompson v. Fairbanks, 196 U. S. 516, 25 S. Ct. 306, 49 L. Ed. 577, Westall v. Wood, 212 Mass. 540, 99 N. E. 325. They are not transmuted into preferences by acts of appropriation and enforcement within the four months period. This was the underlying proposition of our decision in Atherton v. Beaman (C. C. A.) 264 F. 878. To the same effect was Mass. Trust Co. v. MacPherson (C. C. A.) 1 F.(2d) 769. In that case the difference in opinion in the court arose, not out of the general principle that an equitable lien created prior to the four months period is enforceable, but whether, under the facts in that ease, the original transaction did or did not create an equitable lien. To the same effect is In re Robert Jenkins Corporation (C. C. A.) 17 F.(2d) 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">An analysis and discussion of the so-called \u201ccotton cases\u201d would not be fruitful. Pyle v. Texas Transport Co. (D. C.) 192 F. 725; Id. (C. C. A.) 203 F. 1023; Lovell v. Newman (C. C. A.) 192 F. 753; Hentz v. Lovell, (C. C. A.) 192 F. 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>It is enough to observe that, if these decisions are to be interpreted as the Finance Company\u2019s learned counsel urges, that interpretation was not adopted by the Supreme Court in Pyle v. Texas Transport Co., 238 U. S. 90, 98, 35 S. Ct. 677, 59 L. Ed. 1215, where the result below was affirmed simply on the ground that there was no evidence of reasonable cause to believe. \"We find nothing in these decisions, nor elsewhere, warranting us in so extending the doctrine of equitable lien as to give the victim of fraud a right to collect within the four months period damages out of the assets of a known insolvent. The fact that the Finance Company\u2019s claim originated in Sullivan\u2019s fraud gives it, for present purposes, no better standing than if it accrued from his unintentional, but honest, failure to make good his warranty of the collectibility of valid accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The decree of the District Court is reversed, with costs to the appellant, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
