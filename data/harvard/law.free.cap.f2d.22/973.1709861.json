The county tax commissioner valued the 60,000 acres at $15 an acre, and the 900 acres at $7 an acre. An agent for appellant appeared before the county board of supervisors, at its first meeting, and protested against these values fixed by the commissioner. The board, at its second meeting, for which the statute provides, increased the valuation of the 60,000 acres from $15 to $16 an acre. It did not change the valuation of the 900 acres. Notice of the $1 increase made by the board was posted on only one of the tracts to which it was intended to apply. The lower court held that the increase was valid as to that tract, but was invalid as to the others. See (C. C. A.) 2 F.(2d) 708. It also held that $15 an acre for the other tracts constituting the 60,000 acres and $7 an acre for the 900 acres of mineral rights were the assessed values of those properties. This latter ruling, of which appellant'complains, was based on the ground that the action of the tax commissioner was an assessment, and that appellant either had or waived the notice required by section 4053, Kentucky Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Respecting the notice, we observe that section 4053 of the Statutes declares that, \u201cif the value fixed by the assessor [the tax commissioner has the same authority as the assessor had under the old statute] be greater than that fixed by the taxpayer, it shall be the duty of the assessor to notify the taxpayer, at the time of the assessment, the amount of such increase, and of the time and place of the meeting of the board of supervisors.\u201d The purpose of this notice, as has been held by the courts of Kentucky, is to give the taxpayer an opportunity to appear before the board and protest the action of the eommis-. sioner. If the taxpayer does in fact appear and protest, the assessment made by the commissioner ought not to be invalidated because formal notice was not given; and as an agent of appellant protested in this instance, there is no doubt, we think, that the action of the commissioner is to be given the same effect as if statutory notice thereof had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The remaining question is: What is the authority of the commissioner under the statutes? Appellant contends that he cannot assess property; that only the taxpayer and the bbard of supervisors can do that. Section 4053 provides that the tax commissioner \u201cshall fix the value upon all the estate listed with him for taxation at its fair cash value, * * * and enter the same in his tax book\u201d; that in arriving at what is the fair cash value he shall consider what he knows about the property, the statement of the person listing it, and \u201csuch other evidence as he may be able to obtain upon oath of witnesses sworn by him.\u201d In section 4120, which deals with the duties of the board of supervisors, it is said that the board may \u201creduce or raise any assessment\u201d' appearing upon the assessor\u2019s books, but shall not do so unless \u201cthe evidence is clear and unmistakable that the valuation is not a fair cash value\u201d; that where the property \u201chas not been correctly valued they [the board] shall fix the value thereof, and correct the assessor\u2019s books so as to show the true value.\u201d After the board has done this, and notice has been given to the taxpayers whose lists -have been increased or assessed (\u201cassessed\u201d evidently refers to omitted property), the board must hold another meeting, at which those-who have received such notices may appear and protest against the proposed increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">As we interpret these statutes, it is the duty of the commissioner to \u201cfix the value\u201d of the taxpayers\u2019 property, and, if the board of supervisors does not change the values fixed by the commissioner, his action as. to those values stands as the assessment. This was assumed to be the result of the commissioner\u2019s action by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in Negley v. Henderson Bridge Co., 107 Ky. 414, 54 S. W. 171, and Ward v. Wentz, 130 Ky. 712, 113 S. W. 892. In the Ward Case it was said: \u201cUnder our statute, the assessor has the power to obtain information from other sources, and to make an assessment without reference to the list given in by the taxpayer.\u201d It is plain from this language that the action of the commissioner in valuing the 60,000 acres at $15 an aere and the 900 acres at $7 an acre was a binding assessment in so far as it was not changed by the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s bill prayed an injunction against collection of the tax increases. The decree below, denying the injunction, except as stated, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
