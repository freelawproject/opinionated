The eases that have considered the question whether the stockholder\u2019s liability is contractual or created by statute leave the coi*rect answer in doubt. Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S. 27, 7 S. Ct. 788, 30 L. Ed. 864; First Nat. Bank v. Hawkins, 174 U. S. 364, 19 S. Ct. 739, 43 L. Ed. 1007; Matteson v. Dent, 176 U. S. 521, 20 S. Ct. 419, 44 L. Ed. 571; McDonald v. Thompson, 184 U. S. 71, 22 S. Ct. 297, 46 L. Ed. 437; McClaine v. Rankin, 197 U. S. 155, 25 S. Ct. 410, 49 L. Ed. 702, 3 Ann. Cas. 500. We said in Fulkerson v. Shaffer (C. C. A.) 217 F. 355, in considering an Oklahoma statute which provided for the personal liability of stockholders of a State hank and for assessments upon shares thereof for the purpose of paying the bank\u2019s indebtedness, that the shareholder\u2019s liability under the statute was contractual in character; and some of the eases just eited were referred to to support that statement. But a decision of the point was not necessary under the facts of that case and the statement may, therefore, be regarded as obiter. However, an answer to the question seems unnecessary and to be an immaterial point in tbe instant ease, for if we should hold that the liability oE Jones was created by Acts of Congress and therefore statutory, and within the terms of the Statute of Limitations relied on, nevertheless, the plea that the bar had fallen could not be sustained, as we will now attempt to show.</p>\n<p id=\"A9J\">It will be observed that it was alleged in the complaint that plaintiff instituted a suit against the defendant on February 10, 1923, on the claim herein sued upon in the State district court for the Third Judicial District, which was within one year after the assessment on defendant\u2019s stock was due and payable, that said suit was removed from the district court for the Third Judicial District to the district court for the' First Judicial District of the State on March 12, 1924, that issue was joined and on October 10, .1924, said suit was dismissed without prejudice on the motion of plaintiff and immediately thereafter this action was begun. Section 6484 of the Utah statute reads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">\u201cIf any action be commenced within due time, and a judgment thereon for the plaintiff be reversed, or if the plaintiff fail in such action or upon a cause of action otherwise than upon the merits, and the time limited for the same shall have expired, the plaintiff, or, if he die, and the cause of action survive, his representatives, may commence a new action within one year after the reversal or failure.\u201d The facts plead and proven brought plaintiff\u2019s ease clearly within the terms of this section of the statute. Salisbury v. Poulson, 51 Utah, 552, 172 P. 315; Platz v. Smelting Co., 61 Utah, 342, 213 P. 187. In Luke v. Bennion, 36 Utah, 61, 106 P. 712, these were the facts: Luke first brought his action in a justice court on \u00a1November 4, 1896, summons was issued but it did not appear that it was ever served. On December 10, 1904, Luke brought the same action in the district court, and two days thereafter the justice, on Luke\u2019s motion dismissed the action that had been brought in time on November 4, 1896. The defendant set up a five-year Statute of Limitations, which the trial court held good in bar. In an opinion holding this to he error because of the provisions of section 6484, then section 2893, Comp. Laws 1907, the supreme court of Utah said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\u201cThe material questions presented are, when.did plaintiff\u2019s action in the justice court fail, and was plaintiff\u2019s voluntary dismissal of the action a failure not upon merits, within the meaning of the statute? * * * The statute in question seems to have been taken from the Kansas statute. In construing it the Supreme Court of Kansas held that: \u2018Where a plaintiff dismissed his action, he \u201cfails in such action,\u201d and the failure is \u201cotherwise than upon the merits.\u201d It is not necessary to inquire what caused the failure in the action, * * * why it was dismissed. It is sufficient that he failed to obtain the object of Ms suit, and that Ms failure was not upon the merits.\u2019 * * * We are therefore of the opinion that the voluntary dismissal of the action in the justice court was a failure of the action otherwise than upon the merits, and within the meaning of section 2893, and that the court erred in holding the action brought in the district court barred by the Statute of Limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">But counsel for Jones seems to contend (1) that neither the State district court in which the first suit was brought nor the district court to which it was removed had jurisdiction, and therefore section 6484 does not apply; and (2) that bringing the second suit in the Federal court on its failure in the State court was not within the purpose of the section. As to the first, under the Constitution of Utah, art. 8, \u00a7 7, and the construction thereof by its Supreme Court, its district courts are courts of original and general jurisdiction. They have power to hear and determine all justiciable controversies where tbe parties to the litigation are in court by appearance or summons, except over such controversies as may be denied to them either by the constitution or statute; and we know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>of no statute or constitutional provision \u2014 we have been cited to none \u2014 denying to those courts jurisdiction over this controversy and plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The section of the constitution is this :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\">\u201cThe District Court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal, not excepted in this constitution, and not prohibited by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In Davidson v. Hunter, 22 Utah, 117, 61 P. 556, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cThe district courts of this state, under the provisions of the constitution, have original jurisdiction in all matters, civil and criminal, not excepted in the constitution, and not prohibited by law. The jurisdiction of said court in the case is not within any exception, and is not prohibited by law. Therefore there is no doubt but that the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action, and that the suit was brought \u2018in the proper county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">See Sanipoli v. Pleasant Valley Coal Co., 31 Utah, 114, 86 P. 867, 10 Ann. Cas. 1142; Baker Lumber Co. v. A. A. Clark Co., 53 Utah, 336, 178 P. 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The Utah statutes, sections 6525-6534, prescribe the counties in which different kinds of causes of action may be brought and tried \u2014actions concerning real property, for the recovery of fines, penalties and forfeitures, against public officers and actions on written contracts which specify the place of performance. Then sections 6529 and 6530 provide for the county in which a transitory cause of action shall be brought, if the same arise without the state; then section 6531 provides that in all other eases the action must be tried in the county in which the cause of action arises or in the county in which any defendant resides at the commencement of the action. Section 6532 says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">\u201cIf the county in which the action is commenced is not the proper county for the trial thereof, the action may, notwithstanding, be tried therein unless the defendant, at the time he appears and answers or demurs, files an affidavit of merits, and demands, in writing, that the trial be had in the proper county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The following section names, several grounds for ehahge of venue, among them, that the county designated in the complaint is not the proper county. The record discloses that the transfer of the case from the Third to the First district was made on the motion of Jones, but it does not show the ground thereof; but if it did, we certainly cannot review that action and must hold that each of the State district courts had jurisdiction while the case was pending respectively in them. There is no statute of the United States giving the Federal court exclusive jurisdiction of this suit, and the issue could be brought on and litigated in the State courts. Minneapolis &amp; St. L. R. R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211, 36 S. Ct. 595, 60 L. Ed. 961; Plaquemines Tropical Fruit Co. v. Henderson, 170 U. S. 511, 18 S. Ct. 685, 42 L. Ed. 1126; Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 23 L. Ed. 833; Rose on Federal Juris. &amp; Pro. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 158. But after all that has been said, how does it matter whether either State court had jurisdiction? for if they did not that would be a failure of plaintiff\u2019s action in those courts \u201cotherwise than upon the merits.\u201d Smith v. McNeal, 109 U. S. 427, 3 S. Ct. 319, 27 L. Ed. 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">As to the second contention, we see no reason for holding that the suit could not be brought in the Federal court or in any other court having jurisdiction within one year after the same suit had failed in the State court otherwise than upon its merits. It was so held in McIver v. Florida Cent. &amp; P. R. Co., 110 Ga. 223, 36 S. E. 775, 65 L. R. A. 437; Atlanta K. &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Wilson, 119 Ga. 781, 47 S. E. 366; Cox v. Strickland, 120 Ga. 104, 47 S. E. 912, 1 Ann. Cas. 870. See also Lamson v. Hutchings (C. C. A.) 118 F. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
