The last-mentioned rulings are not subject to be reviewed, because none of them was excepted to. The above-mentioned motion was made after the admission, without objection, so far as the record shows, of much \u25a0oral evidence, some'at least of which was plainly admissible. Manifestly the overruling of that motion was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">No reversible error bein'g shown by the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
