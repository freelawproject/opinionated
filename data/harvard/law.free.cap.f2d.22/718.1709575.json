The motion was denied by the court. The defendants then called three witnesses, including the truck driver, whose testimony tended to sustain their plea. At the close of the testimony the defendants renewed their motion for a directed verdict, and the court sustained it, saying that plaintiff\u2019s own testimony had proven him guilty of contributory negligence. Judgment was entered upon the directed verdict, and this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"Acy\"> In our opinion the judgment of the lower court was right. It is settled law that a motion to direct a verdict against the plaintiff is an admission of every fact in evidence tending to sustain Ms case and of every inference reasonably dedueible therefrom, and that the motion can be granted only when but one reasonable view can be taken of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>denee and the conclusions therefrom, and that view is utterly opposed to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. Glaria v. Wash. Southern Ry. Co., 30 App. D. C. 559. It is a familiar rule in negligence eases that, \u201cwhen a given state of facts is such that reasonable men may fairly differ upon the question as to whether there was negligence or not, the determination of the matter is for the jury. It is only where the facts are such that all reasonable men must draw the same conclusion from them, that the question of negligence is ever considered as one of law for the court.\u201d Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Ives, 144 U. S. 408, 417, 12 S. Ct. 679, 683 (36 L. Ed. 485).</p>\n<p id=\"A34\">At the same time it is well settled that the court may withdraw a ease from the jury altogether, and direct a verdict against plaintiff, where the evidence against him is undisputed, or of such conclusive character that the court, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, would be compelled to set aside a verdict returned in opposition to it. Patton v. Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad Co., 179 U. S. 658, 659, 21 S. Ct. 275, 45 L. Ed. 361. \u201cIt is true that, where the undoubted facts and circumstances in evidence clearly show that one about to cross a railway track must inevitably have seen a coming car or train if he had actually looked in its direction, the testimony of the injured party that he looked and failed to see it coming may be rejected, and his contributory negligence declared as matter of law notwithstanding.\u201d Glaria v. Washington Southern Ry. Co., supra. These rules apply where the plaintiff\u2019s ease is based upon a charge of last clear chance negligence. Washington R. &amp; E. Co. v. Buscher, 54 App. D. C. 353, 298 F. 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">When we examine the present record in the light of these principles, we are led to the conclusion that the lower court was correct in holding that the testimony conclusively established the contributory negligence of the plaintiff, and did not tend to establish negligence, even under the last clear chance doctrine, upon the part of the truck driver. According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, he was walking across the street in broad daylight at a point somewhat distant from the corner crossing, at a time when the street was otherwise clear of traffic, and that he walked to a point in the street directly in front of the the approaching truck when it was only 5 feet distant from him. There is no intimation of unusual weather conditions at the time, nor of defective vision upon plaintiff\u2019s part. It is clear that if the plaintiff had looked in the direction of the truck before stepping in front of it he could not have failed to see it approaching him. Nor does the plaintiff offer any excuse for his failure to see the truck before walking in front of it. He testified that when he first saw the truck coming toward him, at a distance of 5 feet from him, he jumped toward the curb, that the truck barely grazed him, and that the driver stopped the truck as quickly as possible. The truck was moving at a lawful and reasonable rate of speed, and there is no testimony to impeach the competency of the driver or the efficiency of the truck\u2019s brakes. Plaintiff testified that the driver failed to sound the horn, but under the admitted circumstances that fact alone does not tend to relieve the plaintiff of the charge of contributory negligence, nor to impute negligence to the driver. For it does not appear from the testimony that the driver in the exercise of reasonable care should have foreseen that plaintiff was about to step in front of the truck, in time to have prevented the accident. Accordingly, since plaintiff\u2019s testimony established his own negligence, and failed to disclose negligence upon the part of the truck driver, the lower court was right in directing a verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
