In Dunbar v. United States, 156 U. S. 185, 15 S. Ct. 325, 39 L. Ed. 390, the indictment charged that the defendant \u201cdid willfully, unlawfully, and knowingly, and with intent to defraud the revenues of the United States, smuggle and clandestinely introduce into the United States\u201d opium upon which the duty had not been paid; and one of the objections to it was that a scienter was not alleged \u2014 that it was not averred that he knew it was opium upon which the duty had not been paid. It was held that the objection was not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-26\">The court further said that the language of the indictment excluded the idea of any unintentional and ignorant bringing in of opium upon which the duty had not been paid, and that it could only be satisfied by proof that such bringing in was done intentionally, knowingly, and with intent to defraud the revenues of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-27\">In Rosen v. United States, 161 U. S. 29, 16 S. Ct. 434, 480, 40 L. Ed. 606, and in Price v. United States, 165 U. S. 311, 17 S. Ct. 366, 41 L. Ed. 727, the Supreme Court held that a charge that defendant \u201cunlawfully, willfully, and knowingly\u201d deposited in the mail obscene matter, was a sufficient averment that he knew the character of the matter which he mailed. In Konda v. United States (C. C. A.) 166 F. 91, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 304, this court had before it the charge that defendant unlawfully and knowingly deposit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ed in the mail\u00a7 nonmailable matter. The statute declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cAny person who shall knowingly deposit * * * nonmailable matter * * * shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">After quoting the statute the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cThat is, in the statute the adverb \u2018knowingly\u2019 not merely modifies the verb, but characterizes the whole act that is stated by the predicate and the subject. Now, if the courts and the citizens of the country are bound to know, on reading the statute, that a depositing of nonmailable matter is a* misdemeanor only when the depositor has knowledge of the character of the matter, we believe that the same language in an indictment is sufficient to notify a defendant that the government is charging and has undertaken to prove that he knew the character of the matter when he mailed it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">So here a charge that plaintiff in error knowingly transferred a counterfeited obligation sufficiently charges that he knew the character of the obligation when he transferred it.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> The indictment in the ease at bar. not only alleges that plaintiff in error knowingly transferred the counterfeited obligation, but also that he did it \u201cwith intent to defraud the United States\u201d \u2014 that is, with intent that a spurious obligation should pass into and impair and debase the circulating medium and eventually be redeemed by the United States as genuine. A charge that he transferred a eouhterfeited obligation with such intent includes the charge that he knew that it was counterfeited. The intent to defraud the United States could not exist without knowledge of the character of the instrument by which the fraud was to be accomplished. If this view be correct, the most that can be said is that the indictment is defective, in that one element of the offense is stated loosely and without technical accuracy. It is a \u201cdefect or imperfection in matter of form only,\u201d and is not ground for holding the indictment insufficient. See section 1025, R. S. (18 USCA \u00a7 556).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
