U. S. v. Norton, 97 U. S. 164, 24 L. Ed. 907; Railroad Co. v. Commissioners, 98 U. S. 541, 25 L. Ed. 196; Chesebrough v. U. S., 192 U. S. 253, 24 S. Ct. 262, 48 L. Ed. 432; Gulbenkian v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 175 F. 860; Cooley\u2019s Law of Taxation (4th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1282, 1294. The recovery of taxes and license fees voluntarily paid under unconstitutional statutes or invalid ordinances has been for many years consistently denied by the courts. See the Sonoma County Tax Case (C. C.) 13 F. 789; Board of Education v. Toennigs, 297 Ill. 469, 130 N. E. 758; Simpson v. City of New Orleans, 133 La. 384, 63 So. 57; Detroit v. Martin, 34 Mich. 170, 22 Am. Rep. 512; Prescott v. City of Memphis, 154 Tenn. 462, 285 S. W. 587, 48 A. L. R. 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-22\">Appellant\u2019s contention that, because this is not a criminal proceeding, he may rest his right of recovery upon ignorance of the unconstitutionality of the statute, is not well founded. See Barlow v. U. S., 7 Pet. 404, 410, 8 L. Ed. 728. Neither may he successfully assert ignorance. of the facts upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>which the alleged uneonstitutionality is based, where these facts, as here, appear from public records. Public policy requires that he shall be presumed to know the facts so appearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
