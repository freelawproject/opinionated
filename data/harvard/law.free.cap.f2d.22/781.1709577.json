In accordance with the first, it is agreed that the record in No. 7702 shall be printed and entitled in all three eases. Under both- of the stipulations, it is agreed that similar determination shall be entered here of all the cases on the Douthitt record. These appeals are taken from decrees entered after sustaining motions to dismiss the petitions for insufficient facts to entitle plaintiffs to any equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"ALKq\">The petition in the Douthitt Case alleges that the plaintiff was the owner of certain land described by government survey boundaries containing approximately 131 acres; that this land bordered the Arkansas river in the state of Kansas; that to this land there had formed accretions of 65 acres which had never been surveyed and never \"placed upon the tax rolls; that on January 27, 1923, M. W. Baden proposed to plaintiff to take from him an oil and gas lease covering the above surveyed tract and offered to pay therefor the sum of $1 per acre annually in advance for each acre leased; that this proposition was accepted in so far as the 131 acres were concerned bnt was refused as to the accreted lands because the title thereto was in dispute; that in accordance with such an agreement, plaintiff executed a lease covering only the 131 aeres and agreed to warrant and defend the title thereto on condition that Baden should annually pay the sum of $1 per acre, amounting to $131, as rent unless the lands were explored and developed; that this lease was not delivered at the time of signing bnt it was agreed that it should be placed in escrow under an escrow agreement until Baden could secure certain other acreage desired and should begin development upon some of the property covered by a block of leases, of which this was one; that, thereafter, the conditions of the escrow agreement were met and the lease delivered to Baden who assigned it to Johnson D. Hill, who later assigned it to the defendants; that at the time defendants became assignees they had complete knowledge of all of the above facts or could, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, have ascertained the same and knew at such time that the lease was intended to cover and did cover 131 acres, and no more; that prior to the institution of this suit plaintiff attempted to lease the accreted lands for oil and gas development purposes; that defendants are publicly asserting claim of title to said accreted lands and have threatened plaintiff with legal proceedings and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>tion for damages in case he leases them to any one else; that such action of the defendants easts a cloud upon the title of plaintiff to the accreted lands, has prevented plaintiff from developing same, has prevented plaintiff from securing the reasonable market value of leases upon said land, will result in drainage of the off and gas from such land by the adjacent development and that, because thereof, plaintiff prays the removal of the cloud and adjudication of his title and an injunction against defendants from interfering with his disposition and development thereof. The petition refers to and incorporates, as exhibits, the lease and the escrow agreement. The lease and the escrow agreement are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-4\">Exhibit A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201cProducer\u2019s 88.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">\u201c3418 A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\">\u201cOil and Gas Lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u201cAgreement, made and entered into the 27th day of January, A.

This position is correct as the matter involved relates to titles to real estate in that state. Guffey v. Smith, 237 U. S. 101, 113, 35 S. Ct. 526, 59 L. Ed. 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-36\"> So considering it, it is necessary to ascertain the law as declared by the Supreme Court of the state of Kansas. At the outset, we are faced by the ease of Cushenbery v. Waite-Phillips Co. et al., 119 Kan. 478, 240 P. 400, where the opinion was filed October 10, 1925. That case was determined by a divided court of seven judges, three of whom dissented, but the fact of this close division in the court does not touch the binding effect of that decision as a statement of the law of Kansas. In that case, the very leases involved in these three cases were before the court, the claim there being that they covered only the described land and not the accretions, but that if the leases, as written, were construed as including the accretions, then they should, in conformity with the intention of all of the parties, be reformed to exclude the accretions. The matter of these leases and this escrow agreement were before that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>court and its expression upon two matters, controlling here, is clear and definite. That court (page 482, 240 P. 402) says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-4\">\u201cTheir elaborate arguments center about two main propositions: (1) That the defendants\u2019 leases covered only the actual acreage specified in the contracts and on which the defendants have paid the stipulated rental of one dollar per acre per annum; and (2) that if the defendants\u2019 leases are given a construction which will include the accreted lands of the lessors, such construction is at odds with the contracts intended to he made by the lessors and defendants\u2019 assignors, and that defendants had notice thereof and are bound thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201cTouching the first of these contentions appellants present a formidable array of authorities touching the rebuttable character of the presumption which attaches to the quantity of land which passes in an instrument describing the land in terms of government survey. They concede that there is a presumption that all accretions are included and losses by erosion ignored, and that the call for a stated acreage yields to the actual acreage included in the terms of the government survey; but appellants emphasize the point lhat this presumption is rebuttable by proof of the true intent of the parties to the instrument. A majority of this court decline to recognize or apply that doctrine to the cases at bar and hold without qualification that the tracts defined by the government survey and described in the government patents under which the lessors hold title include the accretions which have attached thereto since the lessors\u2019 lands were surveyed and delimited by the government surveyors in 1871 and patented in accordance therewith. So far as concerns the meandering lines along the river bank run by the government surveyors in 1871, it is to bo kept in mind that those meandering lines were not the land boundaries. They were merely mathematical data for calculating the then existing but changeable acreage \u2014 no more. The true boundaries of the lessors\u2019 lands always were the river hank itself, and such was and is the tenor and legal effect of the land patents under which the lessors of these rival litigants hold title. We have no present concern with legal questions which may arise from sudden changes caused by flood, storm or other unusual agency, as affecting- boundaries of riparian lands along' meandered streams.

Leonard, 117 Kan. 376, 232 P. 235.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Regarding the contention that, where the conveyance is an oil and gas lease, a different attitude should be taken as to the presumption that the accretions follow the legal description, that court (page 484, 240 P. 403) says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-9\">\u201cIt is argued for appellants, and supported by some authorities, that while the foregoing may be the prevailing rule as to the legal significance to be given to land descriptions in ordinary conveyances, they ought not to be so interpreted in oil and gas leases, which are mere licenses to come and go on the property concerned and to explore it for these products and to remove them if discovered. This court holds that such a distinction as to the legal effect of a land description in a deed and in an oil and gas lease is too dogmatical for practical purposes and would introduce a subtlety into our law which would be thoroughly mischievous. A legal description which sufficiently defines a tract of land in terms of government survey, in a government patent, and according to the terms of which the land passes from one fee holder to another and is thus listed for taxation, should be given no variable significance whether that description appears in a deed, an ordinary lease, an oil and gas lease, or any other instrument in which the property is the subject of any contract or transaction. Ratcliff v. Paul, 114 Kan. 506, 509, 220 P. 279.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">It seems to us that those expressions of that court must control this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">If it were not for the Cushenbery decision, the writer of this opinion would have no hesitancy in declaring as follows: That this lease should be construed in the light of or in connection with the escrow agreement as parts of one transaction; that so construed, there is no question that all which the lease was intended to&gt; cover or could cover was 131 acres; that the rule as to accretions \u2014 that they follow conveyances of the land \u2014 is based upon a presumption which is rebuttable; lhat such presumption has less force where the conveyance is an oil and gas lease because the reasons npon which the presumption is based are usually absent in such transactions. I think the Cushenbery Case has produced a patent and burdensome injustice in these eases. If any escape therefrom could he found, I would favor taking advantage of it, but I feel compelled to follow that case for the sole reason that it is controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">The decrees must be and are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
