On the trial in the court below, the plaintiff gave evidence that he had purchased the flour of a certain <em>Henry Frazer. </em>The defendant, <em>Gibson, </em>was constable of the town of <em>Bedford, </em>and the defence made by him, and <em>Smith, </em>the other defendant, was, that <em>Smith </em>had obtained a judgment against the said <em>Frazer, </em>before a justice of the peace of <em>Bed-ford </em>county, who issued an execution thereon, directed to the constable of <em>Bedford </em>town, by virtue of which, <em>Gibson </em>levied on the eleven barrels of flour, before mentioned, as the property of the said <em>Frazer. </em>Whether <em>Schell </em>had made a fair purchase of the flour, before the lien of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>execution had attached, and whether the purchase, though for full value, had been made with a view of defeating <em>Smith\u2019s </em>execution, were points submitted to the jury, by the President, who laid down the law to the jury. But the defendants complained, that the jury were misdirected, with respect to the validity of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>execution. <em>Frazer, </em>the defendant in the execution, lived in <em>Napier </em>township, as did also the justice who issued it. The <em>township </em>of <em>Bedford </em>lays between <em>Napier </em>township, and the <em>town </em>of <em>Bedford. </em>There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>acting constables both in <em>Napier </em>and <em>Bedford townships; </em>yet the justice, without any known reason; directed the execution to the constable of the <em>town </em>of Bedfordf. The objection was, that <em>Gibson \u25a0 </em>was neither the constable of the township in which <em>Frazer </em>resided, nor the next constable most convenient to the said <em>Frazer. </em>The President charged the jury, that, \u201c if they should be of opiopinion, from the facts in evidenc'e, that, at the time of issuing the execution, there was an acting constable of <em>Napier </em>township fit and proper to serve that execution, and who might have been employed, if <em>Smith </em>had thought proper to apply to him for the - purpose; and that there was also an acting constable of <em>Bedford </em>township, who was <em>next most convenient </em>to the defendant, <em>Frazer; </em>and without any legal cause, or reason, <em>Smith </em>had his execution directed to the constable of the <em>town </em>of <em>Bedford, </em>who resided about fqur miles more distant from the defendant, <em>Frazer, </em>than even the constable of <em>Bedford township, </em>then, in point of law, no lien whatever attached on any property of <em>Frazer, </em>situate in <em>Napier </em>township, on an execution so directed, and served by a constable of the town of <em>Bedford.\u201d</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-6\"><em>Thompson, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQS\">now contended, that the warrant was not void, and the constable, if not bound, was at least authorized to obey it. The act of assembly of the 20th of March, 1810, sect. 11, it is true, requires the justice to issue the execution to the constable of the ward, district, or township, where the defendant resides, or the next constable most convenient to the defendant. This act, however, is only directory to the justice, and does <em>not make a warrant </em>void, which is differently directed. It is the practice, to issue a warrant directed to a constable not the nearest to the defendant, and this practice is very extensive. <em>Clark </em>v. Worley, <em>1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>351.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-7\"><em>Russell, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae4\">The only point is, whether this was a void execution. It was void, because not directed to the constable of' the township where the defendant resided, or the next constable most convenient to the defendant. By doing otherwise, the mileage of the constable, and, consequently, the costs, are increased. In the case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Worley, </em>the warrant was directed to the constable of the township next to that in which the defendant resided. In the present case, the justice passed over the township intervening between that in which the defendant resided, and the town of <em>Bedford, </em>to the constable of which, the warrant was directed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-8\">\n<em>Reply.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuHf\">The costs are not increased.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyU-\">By the act of the 20th of <em>March, </em>1810, section <em>11, </em>(5 <em>Sm. L. </em>161,) the justice is required to issue the execution, directed to \u201cthe constable of the ward, district, or township, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>where the defendant resides, or the <em>next </em>constable <em>most convenient </em>to the defendant.\u201d <em>The next constable most convenient to the </em>defendant, are rather vague expressions. Who is to judge of the <em>next constable most convenient to the </em>defendant, unless that be left to the opinion of the justice? It would be extremely hard to throw the decision of this question on a constable, to whom an execution is directed by a justice of competent jurisdiction, at the peril of being responsible in an action of trespass. It would seem, therefore, that the act of assembly is to be considered as only <em>directory </em>in this respect; and not so positive and peremptory as to render the execution void, though directed to a constable who, in the opinion of the jury, was not the next most convenient to the defendant. There was a case, something like the present, upon the English statute of Hue and Cry. By the statute <em>13 Ed. </em>1, a party robbed might, in case the hundred did not apprehend the felon within forty days, recover the amount of his loss from them. By the statute of the 27 <em>Eliz. c. </em>13, <em>s. </em>11, the party robbed must within twenty days next before the commencement of his action, be examined upon oath before some justice of the peace, of the county wherein the robbery was committed, inhabiting within the hundred where the robbery was committed, <em>or near the </em>same, whether he knows the robbers or any of them. It was held, that where the affidavit was taken before a justice who lived <em>twenty miles </em>from the place where the robbery was committed, <em>and many justices lived </em>nearer, yet it was sufficient, as the act was only directory in this respect. <em>Peake\u2019s Evid. </em>(by Norris,) 461. <em>Bull. Ni. Pri. </em>186. I do not say how the law would have been, if the act of assembly had ordered the magistrate to issue his process to the constable residing <em>next </em>or <em>nearest </em>to the <em>defendant. </em>That might have made a difference; because both justice and constable might know who was the <em>next </em>or <em>nearest </em>to the <em>defendant. </em>But the <em>next most convenient </em>constable, is a different thing. <em>Convenience </em>is a matter which requires the exercise of judgment, and there might be many reasons influencing the opinion of the justice on that point, of which the constable could know nothing. For'these reasons I am of opinion that there was error in the charge of the court, for which the judgment should be reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
