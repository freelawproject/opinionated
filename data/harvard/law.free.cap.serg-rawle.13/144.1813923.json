The facts were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-11\">On the 5th of <em>December, </em>1798, judgment was rendered in the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Lycoming </em>county, m favour of <em>George Pennock, </em>against <em>Griffith </em>and <em>George Carr, </em>for the sum of one hundred and forty-five pounds, one shilling. On this judgment there was a stay of execution, till the 1st of <em>August, </em>1799, and a <em>fieri facias </em>issued to <em>September, </em>1799, which was returned <em>nulla bona. </em>An <em>alias fieri facias </em>issued to <em>February, </em>1800, which was also returned <em>nulla bona. </em>To <em>September, </em>1805, a <em>pluries fieri facias </em>issued, which was returned, <em>\u201c </em>levied on three hundred acres in <em>Bald Eagle.\u201d </em>This land was afterwards sold by the sheriff, upon <em>a pluries venditioni exponas, </em>issued by <em>Owen </em>and <em>Caleb Foulke, </em>te <em>May </em>term, 1814, on a\u2019judgment recovered by them, at <em>September </em>term, 1797, against <em>Griffith </em>and <em>George Carr, </em>in the same court, for three hundred and ninety-six pounds, seven shillings, and five pence. In <em>January, </em>1798, a <em>fieri facias </em>had issued on this judgment, and had been levied on the same land. The land was sold on the <em>pluries venditioni, </em>for eight thousand and ten dollars, which was paid by the purchasers, into the hands of the sheriff, who distributed the money to different judgment creditors, and to <em>theCarrs, </em>without discovering <em>Pennock's </em>judgment;- though, if it continued a lien, there was more than enough money remaining, after paying prior judgments, to satisfy his; and the question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>in this case was, whether <em>Pennock\u2019s </em>judgment continued a lien, at the time of the sale by the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-4\">The court below delivered it as their opinion, to the jury, that the <em>fieri facias, </em>which issued on <em>Pennock\u2019s </em>judgment to <em>September, </em>1805, and was returned, \u201clevied on three hundred acres, on <em>Bald Eagle,\u2019\u2019 </em>did not continue the lien of his judgment for a longer term than five years, from the return of that execution, and that the lien of that judgment had expired when the land was sold by <em>M\u2018Kisson, </em>in 1814. The plaintiffs excepted to this opinion, and the court sealed a bill of exceptions. A verdict and judgment were rendered in favour of the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-5\"><em>Bellas, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ank\">contended, 1. That this question had been decided. <em>2. </em>The act of 1798 had received by practice a construction such as he contended for. 3. Independently of authority, this case is not embraced by the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-6\">1. In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, 2 Binn. </em>228, Yeates, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, in reference to the first section of the act of the 4th of <em>April, </em>1798, \u201cNo change is contemplated in the law, as to the lien of judgments, excepting those unrevived within the five years; nor is the mode of keeping judgments alive, by issuing an execution within the year and day, superseding the necessity of issuing a <em>scire facias, </em>under the statute of <em>Westminster </em>2d, abolished thereby. The <em>scire facias </em>operates as notice to th\u00bbparties interested, and evidences the intention of the creditor to claim the lien of his judgment. But it will not be denied, that the plaintiff taking out a <em>fieri facias, </em>levying on the goods and lands of the defendant, and condemning the lands by an inquest, are matters of notoriety, and in point of notice of the creditor\u2019s pretensions, tantamount to a <em>scire facias. </em>Such, I take it, has been the construction of this section of the act.\u201d In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Smith, 2 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>156, 157, a judgment was kept alive eleven years, by a <em>fieri facias </em>unreturned. In <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Hart, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>369, the five years were computed from the termination <em>of the eesset.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-7\"><em>2. </em>The practice has been, to consider the judgment kept alive by an execution. To prove this, we have the certificate of the prothonotary of <em>Northumberland </em>county, that he had searched the records, and found hut one instance of a <em>scire facias, </em>after an execution: of the prothonotary of the Supreme Court, for the eastern district, who examined the records for twenty-one years, and discovered but two such instances; and of the prothonotary of <em>Dauphin </em>county, that it has not been the practice there to issue a <em>scire facias, to </em>continue the lien after execution and levy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-8\">3. The act of the 4th of <em>April, </em>1798, does not include this case. The inconvenience reeit\u00e9d in the preamble, <em>Purd. Dig, 306, is, </em>the suffering of judgments to remain a lien for an indefinite length of time, without any process to continue or revive the same. An execution levied, is process to continue the lien of the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>After a <em>fieri facias </em>taken out, continuances may be entered, and a new execution may issue, without a <em>scire facias. 2 Tid\u2019s Pract. </em>1002. <em>1 Str. </em>100. 6 <em>Binn. </em>135. <em>3 Binn. </em>69.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-5\"><em>Hepburn, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1p\">argued the same points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">1. Has this point been decided? We deny it. In <em>Young </em>v. Taylor, the case did not fairly arise. <em>Young </em>had issued a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum, </em>against <em>Taylor, </em>and on that point the cause was determined. What was said by Judge Yeates, as to the continuance of the lien by an execution, was but a <em>dictum,. </em>But I do not deny, that the issuing of an execution is tantamount to a <em>scire facias; </em>that is, it will continue the lien five years. If you go beyond that, the lien is indefinite in duration, and all the evils contemplated to be guarded against, by the legislature, will ensue. In the case of <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>no question of lien on land could arise, because it was a levy on goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\"><em>2. </em>The certificates of theprothonotaries, produced by Mr. <em>Bellas, </em>\u2018do not show whether there were not executions issued within each period of five years. The practice, I think, has been, to issue an execution within each period of five years, so as to give to an execution the efficacy of a <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-8\">3. The construction of the act. It is an act of limitations, and ought to be construed liberally, to effect the beneficial purposes of of the act, which were to guard purchasers, and to promote repose. Such acts are construed liberally. <em>3 Binn. 258. </em>1 <em>Binn. 212. 8 Cranch, 74. </em>9 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>214. 17 <em>Johns. </em>475.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b146-12\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABQ\">This is a question of very general concern, and of immense importance. It is, whether an execution returned <em>levied on land, </em>falls within the provisions of the act limiting the time during which judgments shall remain a lien on real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">It certainly has been the received opinion at the bar, and the practice has corresponded with it, that where an execution has been levied on land, the lien continues on the land levied, without a revival of the judgment every five years; and I would pay much respect to such continued practice, without any judicial decision to support it, unless it was in fiat contradiction to the provisions of the act; and it certainly is not a case within the letter of the act, and I know not any proper exercise of judicial power that would justify its extension to a case not provided for, that was not in the view of the legislature, nor to which a <em>scire facias </em>can be at all applicable. A judgment is a general lien on all the defendants\u2019 property: .an execution specific, a seizure of lands into the officer\u2019s hands to satisfy the debt; a pledge somewhat in the nature of a mortgage, and is so considered in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">The intention of the legislature is to be discovered in the preamble, a^id the enacting clause is not more comprehensive than the preamble. The evil in contemplation of the legislature which, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>to be remedied was, the perpetual lien of judgments, without any process to continue or revive the same. But where process had issued, and was executed, the effect of that mode of preserving the lien remains as it stood before the law. The act of the 4th of <em>Jlpril, </em>1798, and the statute of <em>Westminster </em>the 2d, are exactly alike. Whatever would be such a proceeding within the year and day, as would render it unnecessary to issue the <em>scire facias, </em>according to the statute, would continue the lien under the act of 1798, according to some opinions. The reason why the plaintiff is put to his <em>scire facias </em>is, because he is presumed, from the length of time, to have released the execution, and therefore the defendant shall not be disturbed without being called on, and having an opportunity of pleading the release, or showing cause why the execution should not go. 2 <em>Inst. </em>470. But where a <em>fieri facias </em>or <em>ca. sa. </em>is taken out within the year and not executed, a new writ of execution may be sued out at any time afterwards, without a <em>scire facias, </em>provided the first writ be returned and continuances entered from the time of issuing it, which continuances may berentered after issuing the second writ, unless a rule be made on motion for the proceedings to remain in <em>statu quo. </em>2 <em>Tid\u2019s Pract. </em>104. The same construction was put on the act of 1798, as on the statute of <em>Westminster, </em>by this court in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, 2 Binn. </em>228, where it was held, that issuing the <em>fieri facias </em>within the year, continues the lien without resorting to a <em>scire facias </em>under the act; and this decision was confirmed by this court, expressly, in <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Hart, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>378, and the principle of that decision settled the latter case, and there it was said, that a <em>scire facias, </em>which was issued within the five years and returned <em>tarde venit, </em>and after the expiration of the five years, as well as after the succeeding term, an <em>alias </em>was issued, on which the judgment was revived, was within time; and it was said, that as the issuing an original or <em>latitat </em>continued by <em>vice comes non misit hrevem, </em>will save the bar of the statute of limitations, so here entering continuances after an execution issued, will save the bar of this statute, and the entry.of continuances' with us is so much a matter of form, that they are never entered at all; and it is a common practice to continue an <em>alias </em>or <em>pluries </em>with the intervention of more than one term. If this then be the law, that the award and return of an execution will prevent the loss of the lien, how much stronger is the reason for continuing it where an execution is actually levied, where a <em>scire facias </em>after execution executed, could not, as I take it lie, where it is unnecessary, even on a change of parties, and would not justify issuing a' <em>scire facias </em>to bring them in, as was decided the last <em>Philadelphia </em>term in a case not reported, and where it is a universal practice to issue a <em>venditioni exponas </em>after execution levied on land, though both parties, plaintiff and defendant, are dead, without calling in their representatives. The legislature, when they used a legal term, used it in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>legal .signification, and the act of 1798 was drawn, as its phraseology shows, by a man learned in the law, and who had under his eye the statute of <em>Westminster. </em>Now, a <em>scire facias </em>is in the nature of an original action. The defendant may plead to it, in bar of execution. <em>Co. Litt. </em>290, <em>a. </em>The very purpose and demand of the writ is, to show cause why execution should not issue; and such is the form used, and not a writ specially framed to revive the judgment for five years, as was said, (and I know he made diligent inquiry into the practice,) by Mr. Justice Gibson, who delivered the opinion of the court in <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Hart. </em>But the case of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>which was the first decision on the act, and which has been since followed in practice, settles this very point. On the 14th of <em>March, </em>1798, the plaintiff obtained a judgment against <em>Taylor, </em>which was levied, <em>inter alia, </em>on the lots in question. He issued a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to <em>December, 1806, </em>and an <em>alias venditioni exponas </em>to <em>July, </em>1808, on which the lots were sold. One point was, that the lien was gone, there being no revival by <em>scire facias </em>within the five years, and though the cause was decided against the plaintiff, on another point, to wit, a waiver of his levy, by taking out a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>and having the body of <em>Taylor </em>in custody, yet the court decided the point of lien in his favour, \u2014 because, as the court said, <em>\u201c </em>no change is contemplated in the law, as to the lien of judgments, except those unrevived within five years: nor is the mode of keeping judgments alive, by issuing execution within the year and day, superseding the necessity of issuing a <em>scire facias </em>under the statute of <em>West-' minster </em>the second, abolished thereby.\u201d Here a <em>fieri facias </em>issued and was levied in <em>May, </em>1800, and no proceeding on that levy or renewal of execution until a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to <em>Decemher, </em>1806, and yet the execution levied kept alive the judgment without any <em>scire facias. </em>And in <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>the judge who delivered the opinion of the court very justly said,'that <em>e\u2018 </em>the act of assembly is not a jot more peremptory , as to the time when the <em>scire facias </em>becomes necessary, than the statute of <em>Westmmster.,} </em>Certainly, then, by the statute of <em>Westminster, </em>if execution is levied and remains dormant for more than a year, it is not necessary to revive by <em>scire facias. </em>The effect of levying on lands, continuing the lien on a <em>testatum fieri facias, </em>was fully considered in <em>Cowden </em>v. <em>Brady, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>505; and it was there held, that it was necessary to proceed to issue execution to keep the levy alive by <em>venditioni exponas </em>after <em>venditioni ex-ponas, </em>because the lien was a secret one: but on a levy in the proper county, the record is notice to every man. Suppose five years to expire without <em>scire facias, </em>and a levy to be afterwards made, would not that, levy be good against a purchaser subsequent to a levy, and remain so, though not pursued for more than five years?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The act of 1798 does not touch the lien created by the levy. The five years relate to the first day of the term in which judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ment is entered, not to the teste of the execution, nor time of delivery to the hands of the sheriff. If a leasehold estate was levied on, the levy would not be continued by the act of 1798. So, in the ease of after purchased lands not bound by judgment, the lien attaches from the levy, not from the judgment. That case does not fall within the provision of the law: so that lands not bound by judgment, but by execution only, would not be subject to this limitation; but if there was both a binding judgment and an execution, they would. My opinion is, independent of the decision in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>that an execution levied on land retains its lien, and is neither within the letter nor spirit of the act; that it never can be said of a judgment thus far executed, that it is a judgment without any process to continue or revive the same. But when I consider the contemporaneous construction of the act in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>in 1809, confirmed by tlie decision in 1822, in <em>Pennock v. Hart, </em>and the usage and practice, on the faith of a contemporaneous decision of the highest tribunal in the land, it appears to me it would be a most mischievous construction now to put on this act, that an execution levied fell within the provision of an act, limiting only the time for which judgments should remain a lien on real estate. If it was <em>res integra, </em>without precedent or without practice to the contrary, I would not so construe it. As it is, this new exposition of the act would be attended with serious injury to creditors, who, reposing on the decision of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>have supposed the liens of their executions continued, without revival of the judgment by <em>scire facias. </em>I give no opinion how far an execution taken out and not levied, and no actual renewal for five years, would keep alive the lien, by a subsequent entry of continuances on the record, where no process had ever issued, but barely on the effect of a levy on particular lands, preserving the lien on the land levied, unless such a length of time had elapsed, as by analogy to the statute of limitations, twenty-one years, a presumption of satisfaction would arise. For after an execution executed, I am of opinion that no <em>scire facias </em>is necessary to keep the lien on the land alive, and that is all that is now decided. My opinion, therefore, is, that the judgment should be reversed, and <em>a venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"ACR\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
