The defendant made cognizance, as bailiff of <em>George Ream, </em>of the taking of the goods as a distress for rent.

No new agreement was made, but <em>Soberts </em>continued in possession; and, on the 30th of <em>April, </em>1817, the defendant, <em>Diller, </em>distrained on the goods of <em>Roberts, </em>by order of <em>Ream, </em>for the sum of forty-seven pounds, which he claimed as a year\u2019s rent in advance, due the 1st of <em>April, </em>1S17.

It is sufficient that there was error in the charge of the court. We say the second year\u2019s rent was payable the 1st of <em>April, </em>the first day of the year, and we did not distrain till the 30th of <em>April. </em>The judge charged, that the landlord could not distrain till the end of the term. Whenever the rent is due, it may be distrained for, whether that he in the beginning, middle, or end of the year.

The sheriff cannot contradict his own return, in an action afterwards brought against him. 7 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">The main point of this case, is on the charge of the court, that the defendant had no right to distrain. There were no words in the lease reserving a rent. The lessee was to pay forty-seven pounds on the first day of the term, and each party bound himself in a penalty to perform all the covenants. I consider the payment of the forty-seven pounds as a condition precedent to the entry, and not a rent. There is no covenant to pay the rent of forty-seven pounds. Even if it were rent, yet, if it were payable the first day of the term, there could be no distress for it. 1 <em>Johns. </em>384. Rent payable in advance is a personal covenant, on which action lies, but not distress. Rent is defined to be a certain profit, issuing yearly, out of lands or tenements corporeal. But, it may be made payable every second, third, or fourth year. The 10th section of the act of the 21st of <em>March, </em>1772, directs the form of avowry, that the tenant enjoyed the land during the time for which the rent became due.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-9\"><em>Hopkins, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\">All that is necessary for a distress is, that the rent should be due. Enjoyment of the land is not necessary. Suppose the lessee should refuse to enter, and the lessor should find some of his cattle on the land. Our act of assembly requires only that the rent should be due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-11\">On the third bill of exceptions, it is to be remarked, that the sheriff returned a fact not true, which ought not to affect a third person.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b62-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b62-13\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqX\">This is an action of replevin, brought by <em>Isaac Roberts, </em>the plaintiff below, against <em>Jldam Diller, </em>the plaintiff in error. The defendant acknowledged the seizure of the plaintiff\u2019s goods, and made cognizance, as the bailiff of <em>George Ream, </em>by whose orders he distrained for a year\u2019s rent, due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>said <em>Ream, </em>from the plaintiff. The main point in the cause was, whether the landlord had a right to distrain. The evidence was to the following effect: \u2014 A written agreement, bearing date the 23d of <em>March, </em>1818, was made, between <em>Ream </em>and <em>Roberts, </em>by which, in consideration of the sum of forty-seven pounds, to be paid on the 1st of <em>April, </em>1816, <em>Ream let or rented </em>(these are the-expressions,) to <em>Roberts, </em>a certain tavern, and lot of ground, for one year, from the 1st of <em>April, </em>1816. There were several covenants for things to be done by each party, some of which I shall mention hereafter, and for the true performance of the whole, each bound himself to the other, in the sum of ninety-four pounds. <em>Roberts </em>entered on the 1st of <em>April, </em>1816, paid the sum of forty-seven pounds in advance, and enjoyed the premises, until the 1st of <em>April, </em>1817. No new agreement was made between the parties, but <em>Roberts </em>remained on the premises, and, on the 3uth of <em>April, </em>1817, the defendant, by order of <em>Ream, </em>distrained on the plaintiff\u2019s goods, for the sum of forty-seven pounds, which he claimed <em>as </em>a year\u2019s rent in advance, due the 1st of <em>April, </em>1817. The president of the Court of Common Pleas, charged the jury, that the landlord had no right to distrain, and to this opinion the counsel for the defendant excepted. In the argument before us, the counsel have discussed the broad question, whether, when rent is reserved, payable <em>in advance, </em>the landlord has a right to distrain immediately on the rent\u2019s being due, according to the terms of the lease. On this question no opinion will be given, because, it did not arise on the evidence in this case. There was no evidence of any agreement for the second year\u2019s rent; but it was contended, on the part of the defendant, that on the plaintiff\u2019s holding over after the end of the first year, the law implied an agreement, that he should pay the same rent, and at the same time, which he had agreed to pay-it the first year. Such undoubtedly is the general rule; but the written agreement for the first year, in this case, was of so singular a nature, that I do not think there could be any implication of law, that it should extend to the second year. The reason for my opinion, that the law did not imply an extension of the written agreement to the second year, is, that it contained several collateral matters, to be done by each party, which could be performed <em>in the first year only. </em>For instance, <em>Roberts </em>was to finish a certain room in the house, then in an unfinished state, for which purpose he was to advance money, which was to be repaid by <em>Ream, </em>at the end of the <em>year. </em>\u2014 Ream was to have a right to keep his horse in the stable, until the 1st of <em>August. </em>\u2014 Roberts was to keep a public house, and obtain and pay for the license for the <em>same. </em>\u2014 Ream was to have the roof of the stable repaired by the 1st of <em>June, </em>and put a fence round the lot and garden, by the 5th of <em>April. </em>\u2014 Ream was to give two wagon loads of his dung, which was then on the premises, to be replaced by <em>Roberts, </em>at the end of the year, and was to take away the rest of his dung by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>1st of <em>May. </em>All <em>these </em>things indicated a bargain for one year only. In fact, it very much resembled what is called a bargain and sale for a year, though at the same time it was, in strictness, a lease. But, as some of the things which were to he done the first year, could not be done the second year, I do not see on what ground the law would imply a contract, that the same money should be paid the second year, and <em>on the first day of the year. </em>Then, if the law did not imply a contract to pay the exact sum'of forty-seven pounds, there could be no distress, even though the jury might think forty-seven pounds a reasonable compensation for one year\u2019s enjoyment of the premises. To entitle the landlord to a distress, there must be a reservation of a <em>certain </em>rent, of which there was no evidence in this case, but the written agreement, before mentioned. I am of opinion, therefore, that the judge was correct, in charging the jury, that in this case the landlord had not a right to distrain. But, besides the exception to the judge\u2019s charge, there were three bills of exceptions to the evidence. Of the two first nothing need be said, as they were abandoned. The third was to the following effect. The sheriff made return on the writ of replevin, <em>\u201cproperty not delivered, and hail entered by the defendant.\u201d </em>The defendant offered to prove, \u201cthat the sheriff has searched for the bond, which the plaintiff alleges was given by the defendant, and which the return on the. writ, by inadvertence and mistake, alleges was taken, and it is not to be found, and that no such bond existed.\u201d This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, and rejected by the court. The defendant\u2019s offer was, in one word, <em>to prove the return of the sheriff to be false. </em>But this the law will not permit. In the present action, the return of the sheriff cannot be contradicted, although it may be, in an action brought against him for a false return. The mistake alleged by the defendant is a very singular one; but, if there really was such a mistake, the sheriff should have applied to the Court of Common Pleas, for leave to amend, or rather to <em>alter </em>his return. No doubt, that court, on proof of the fact, would gave given leave to do so. If the return was false, and the defendant has been injured by it, he has his remedy by action against the sheriff. But I consider the law settled, that the return cannot be contradicted by either party, in the action in which it was made. There was no error, therefore, in the rejection of the evidence. I am of opinion, on the whole, that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">See <em>Buckley </em>v. Taylor, 2 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>600, where it is held, that, where by the custom of the country the tenant is to pay one half a year\u2019s rent in advance, on the day he enters, the landlord may distrain on that day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
