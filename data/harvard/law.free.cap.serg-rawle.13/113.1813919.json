I proceeded to the east side of the said surveys, and there found the lines not run, and the draught incorrect, and then told General <em>Patton </em>that <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>draught carried a lie in its right hand, and he had better go and get a correct draught from <em>J.

The deponent states that he ran lines and found he had an incorrect draught, he does not state what draught he had, nor of what survey, nor what lines he ran. He states that <em>Patton </em>got a correct draught, but not what draught, nor of what survey. Then he ran the lines on the west side, as already stated; but still not saying what lines, or what courses and distances. He says the two draughts agreed on the west side, but not on the east; but what draughts we do not know. It is all unintelligible, and not evidence.

There was an altercation about where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>we should start; points which Mr. <em>Miles </em>said were wrong. We went to a line south 82 east to a mark, and ran the line of <em>Roger Flahaven, </em>north 84 west, to a broken white oak slump, \u2014 marks on it. From that we ran south 13 west, without a line, or rather across a line, north 21z- east: continued south <em>17 </em>west one hundred and sixty perches, \u2014 no line. The next day we began at a blazed pine, south 3-f east,' \u2014 same marks: did not go far, but went back, and ran south 38 west one hundred and forty-six perches to <em>Lambourn\u2019s </em>survey; in all, three hundred and sixty-eight: blocked several trees, all of which counted to 1793.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I think that line was run by <em>Daniel Turner </em>and me, to ascertain where these surveys would go.

West </em>and <em>John White, </em>north 82 west, the line crosses the run and comes in a bank. The resurvey between <em>T. West, </em>jr., and <em>T.

I have no recollection of the names of the draughts. We followed lines along <em>Buffaloe </em>run, \u2014 at length got off them. I believe the line I mentioned is the one then run.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\"><em>Third bill of Exceptions. </em>The plaintiffs then offered the deposition of <em>Daniel </em>Turner, again. It was objected to and rejected, and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-10\">Certain points were proposed by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to the eoDrt, which, yvith their answers, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-11\"><em>Second point. </em>That although it is not necessary to re-mark old lines, where a new survey calls for adjoining an old survey, yet the lines called for, must be the .lines of a <em>legal survey </em>made by the proper officer, and returned into the surveyor general\u2019s office and accepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-12\"><em>Answer. </em>When a surveyor goes to execute a warrant adjoining old surveys, it never was necessary to send to the land office, to ascertain whether the old survey was returned. At least this was unnecessary in 1784: there was at that time a law expressly allowing surveys made, and not returned to be returned thereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-13\">3. That a new survey ealling for an old survey, where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>no evidence of the lines of the ancient survey having been made by the proper officer, or a survey returned into the surveyor general\u2019s office: although there may be an ancient marked line on the ground, yet it is necessary, in marking the new survey, to re-mark the lines; the marking of new lines never having been dispensed with, except where it adjoins the lines of a survey made by the proper officer, and returned into the surveyor general\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\">\u00abAnswer. The old surveyors before the war, were generally dead or removed in 1784, and when a new man came in and found regular lines of another survey, he was not bound to go to the trouble and expense of ascertaining whether they were made by a legal deputy surveyor, nor need he send to the land office to inquire whether returned or not. If the man for whom he was executing the warrant was willing to trust them as surveys, and to keep from interfering with and to adjoin them, the deputy surveyor might do so and need not re-mark the old lines, and it never was necessary, nor is it, that the old survey should be returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-7\">4. That when a survey has been made on an application abandoned by the owner, and never returned into the surveyor general\u2019s office, that the lines of this abandoned survey, called for by a recent survey, without being marked on the ground for the late survey, gives no notice and will not constitute a survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-8\"><em>Answer. </em>I do not know what is meant by the assumption of facts in this case. The old survey was not abandoned in 1784, 1792, or 1801. An ejectment was brought on it after 1S01. After the decision of other causes, this was discontinued about 1810. The lines of MichaelBrazieland <em>Jacob Buck </em>were on the ground, and it was not necessary to re-mark that one of them which was adopted as a line by <em>T. West, </em>jr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-9\">\u25a0 As to the last three points, they seem to me to all embrace the same object. Unwilling, however, to be mistaken, I asked the counsel wherein the difference consisted. He replied, they were different, \u2014 that the last was different from the others; but gave no further explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-10\">The Court (Huston, President) charged the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-11\">Charge. The defendant\u2019s leading warrant, and all those following, to <em>John White, </em>are located with absolute certainty, by calling for old surveys by name. <em>Thomas West </em>is to join <em>John White, </em>and <em>Thomas West, </em>jr., adjoins <em>Thomas West. </em>In making the surveys, each warrant was laid adjoining the old survey it calls for. Above this, the suryey of <em>Miles </em>adjoins old surveys, but does not name the survey called for; but old surveys are there, and <em>Miles </em>adjoins them. <em>Miles </em>had two tiers of surveys, \u2014 the old surveys are his northern boundary. A line of 1784 is found on the east end along <em>B. Davis </em>and <em>Grigson, </em>and corners: at the same time, the old southern boundary and corners were regularly run and marked, and are now found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The western line is not found, nor does it appear to have been searched for. <em>Shugart </em>had been put on a wrong track by the plaintiffs and therefore had no chance to find it. <em>Mitchell </em>looked for it a little (to use his own words) at one spot, and does not pretend to say that he searched carefully. This would bring the case to this point: \u2014 is the running and marking the outside lines and corners of a range of surveys belonging to the same person sufficient, or must the division lines be all run and marked to give title? In trying <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Straube </em>before Justices Ye ates and Smith, each party had a range of surveys, or rather each two ranges, and neither had run the division lines. I well remember that Judge Smith interrupted the examination on this point, and. said no surveyor, in marking several surveys adjoining, for the same person, ever run and marked the division lines. From the year 1800 to this time, I have been engaged where many titles have been tried, and, until 1812, I personally examined many ranges of surveys, I have seen on the ground, or heard surveyors examined in court as to their surveys, as to <em>B. </em>and \u00ab#. <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>surveys in <em>Huntingdon </em>and this <em>county, </em>\u2014 Freni\u2019s surveys, <em>Wallis, James, </em>and <em>Drinker, Haine\u2019s Wistar\u2019s, </em>and the lands in <em>Bald Eagle, Nittaney, </em>and <em>Brush </em>valley; I have an equal knowledge of <em>Lycoming. </em>I have found the division lines omitted between surveys belonging to different owners, and never found them marked between surveys adjoining the property of the same owner, and never heard of any surveyor who did it, or any court which decided it was necessary. It is worse than idle, then, to inquire whether it would have been better to have done so originally. Universal usage forms part of, or makes the common law of every country, and must do so. To decide now that a universal practice avoided titles, would be to destroy almost all titles, and the oldest titles to the best land in the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">Few land-holders now in the court house, and not half the owners of the best land in the country, would be unaffected. The question has been settled by hundreds of decisions, \u2014 by the Supreme Court, in 7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>220; and the peace and safety of the country require that it should be left undisturbed. But, in fact, in this case we are not called upon to decide that question; for when part of a survey is found, it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the whole was made; and this presumption is not destroyed, until proof is given that in fact the rest was not run; or proof of facts which render it undeniable, or at least improbable, that the rest was run. Have we any such proof here? At the east end a corner is found between the two ranges of surveys, and no one has said that the whole line between the two ranges has not been run; no one has ever examined it; nor has there been any examination for the division line by any person except <em>Shugart, </em>who never was one yard on the lines of the defendants. The defendants, then, have evidence enough of a legal suryey. As to the plaintiffs\u2019 title, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>they have; a warrant, survey, return and patent, and proof of improvement in 1782. Iiis improvements,'however, were about half a mile from any part of the defendants\u2019 land, yet, when he comes to survey in 1802, be includes his improvement, and extends his survey into <em>Miles\u2019 </em>land: this he could not legally do, as that was not vacant land; the state had sold it in 1784, and it had been returned in 1786. The state could not sell it again in 1792 or 1802. The plaintiff\u2019s father could acquire no right to it by his improvements half a mile distant from it. The moment he put <em>Harts-wick </em>within <em>Miles\u2019 </em>line, <em>Miles </em>brought the former ejectment and recovered. There is therefore no equity from labour or money expended. The defendants\u2019 title, being the oldest, is the best.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\">But a new point is made, and the plaintiffs seem to rest their claim on this fact. The old surveys laying north of, and called for by <em>Miles, </em>are all admitted to be returned, till you pass <em>R. </em>Flahaven. Westerly from that, lay two old surveys, of 1776, which were not then, and are not yet returned; the lands within which are those <em>Lambourn </em>holds by improvement. <em>T. West, </em>jr., is bounded northerly by these two old surveys. The plaintiffs say, the fact of these old surveys not being returned, avoids the survey of <em>T. </em>West, jr. Now the law is not so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">It may be material to the owner of an old survey, whether it is returned or not; but in 1784, it was immaterial to the owner of <em>T. West, </em>jr. whether the old survey was returned or not, if the line of an old survey was on the ground, and he adjoined it, it was enough for him. He may call for it, and need not re-mark it. The law of. the 5th of <em>April, </em>1782, and other laws, permitted the old surveys to be returned, long after that. And whether it ever was returned, is immaterial to the owner of <em>T. West, </em>jr. This, and more than this, has often been decided, particularly in <em>Keble </em>t. <em>Arthurs, </em>where a false oath did not destroy a very defective survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">This opinion and charge of the court were excepted to by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-7\">The plaintiffs in error now assigned as errors,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">1.

In the answer to the third point, in instructing the jury, that it was unnecessary to re-mark any ancient marked line, found upon the ground, whether made by the proper officer or not, or the survey returned into the surveyor general\u2019s offiee, in making a recent survey, adjoining the ancient linn,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>5. In the answer to the fourth point, in not answering the point of law submitted; and in instructing the jury, that the lines of <em>M.

West, </em>jr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-6\">6. To that part of the charge, in which the court instructed the jury, \u201cthat it was not material to the owner of <em>T. West, </em>jr., whether the old survey was returned or not. If the line of the old survey was on the ground, and he adjoined it, it was enough for him.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-7\"><em>Potter, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUR\">now insisted on the first error assigned, and relinquished the second; but contended,</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">\u2018 3. That there was certainly error in rejecting <em>Daniel Turner\u2019s </em>deposition, when it was offered a second time. This deposition was evidence, 1. To contradict the evidence of <em>William Wilson. 2. </em>To explain by whose directions the line run by <em>Turner, </em>in 1793, was run, namely, General <em>Patton, </em>who, with Colonel <em>Miles, </em>was owner of the land. 3. To explain the evidence of <em>William Wilson. </em>It was material to show, that <em>Patton </em>and <em>Miles, </em>having marked their land, could not change it, to the injury of <em>Lambourn. Turner </em>swore, that the draughts were delivered to him by Colonel <em>Patton; </em>from which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel would have argued to the jury, that the lines were run under <em>Patton\u2019s </em>direction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-9\">4. There was error in the answer of the court, to the <em>2d, 3d, </em>and 4th points; namely, that in making a new survey, it is not sufficient to refer to the defendant\u2019s lines, unless they were run by an officer, and returned, but it is necessary to mark the old lines anew. It has been decided, that a new survey, referring to old official lines, is good, without re-marking them. That is the utmost extent to which the court has gone. In <em>M\u2018Rea </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>230, the Chief Justice puts the case of a surveyor receiving a warrant, where the land to be surveyed on it is bounded on three sides by the lines of other tracts, whieh he has surveyed before, and says, \u201cIt is not contended that he is obliged to run those three lines over again; \u2014 and why? Because it would be useless trouble, those lines having been run and marked by <em>legal authority </em>before.\u201d The same language is used by Ye ates, J., in commenting on the case of <em>Stockman </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>5 <em>Binn. </em>215. In <em>Hubley </em>v. <em>Vanhorne, </em>7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>185, a void survey was held to be no survey, as to a person procuring a subsequent survey. And <em>Fugate </em>v. <em>Coxe, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>293, decides, that the running of one line only is not sufficient to establish a survey; which doctrine was recognized and confirmed in <em>Morris </em>v. Travis, 7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 220.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-10\"><em>Burnside, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-11\">If the court relaxes on the doctrine of surveys, we shall be thrown into confusion. That is my sincere opinion. I have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>misrepresented, as holding wild opinions on the subject of actual survey, and marking on the ground. I think it is sufficient, if it is proved that the surveyor was on the ground, and ran some lines, and returned his survey. The law is declared by the Chief Justice, in <em>Covert </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>288, to be, that where a new survey is made, calling for the lines of an old survey, there is no occasion to mark the lines anew; double marks are apt to create confusion; and the new survey is as well identified by referring to the old lines, as if each boundary line were marked over again. Whether a new survey is actually made on the ground, is a fact to be decided by the jury. It ought, moreover, now to be presumed, that a survey made in 1776' was made by authority, although not returned. A great tract of country, a million of acres, in the counties of <em>Centre, Mifflin, Clearfield, </em>and part of <em>Indiana, </em>is owned by non-residents, who have been paying taxes from twenty to fifty years, which lands are now occupied by persons claiming by improvement rights. The first alarming doctrine was delivered by Judge Smith, in <em>Centre </em>and <em>Mifflin, </em>in 1804. The whole country immediately began to make tomahawk improvements. <em>Keble v. Arthur </em>was tried before the Chief Justice, (Tilghman,) who charged in favour of the survey. The jury found for the defendant. A new trial was granted; and there' was a second verdict for the defendant, and the court again granted a new trial. On a third trial, before Judge Walker, he gave an elaborate charge, in favour of the plaintiff, and the jury found agreeably to the charge. Then the law became settled; and many verdicts were given accordingly., <em>Coxe </em>v. <em>Fugate </em>again set people\u2019s minds afloat; in which this court decided, that one lino did not make a survey. It has since been urged to juries, that if one line does not make a survey, neither do two, or any number less than the whole. In this case, it was proved by Judge Huston, that the old surveys in 1766, to which our surveys referred, were made, but not returned, on locations legally entered. In such case, the presumption is, that the surveys were made by lawful surveyors. The judge charged very properly, that the defendant was not obliged to bring positive proof of the person by whom the surveys were made. It was to be presumed, that the old lines were run by authority. Positive proof is not proof now to be expected. The defendant has paid taxes to nearly the amount of one thousand dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\"><em>Burnside </em>was proceeding to argue on the bills of exceptions, but the court told him, that he need not speak to the first.

West, </em>Jr., returned by the regular deputy, in 1786, was an actual survey, or a paper one. When a survey is returned, it is always <em>prima facie </em>evidence that it was duly made, and it lies on the adverse party to disprove it. But, when a time analogous to the statute of limitations has run round \u2014 where the owner has continued to pay the public taxes, where 'there has been no <em>caveat, </em>it would seem to me worthy of all consideration, whether it ought not to be a presumption of law, conclusive of the fact, (the purchase money being paid into the public treasury,) that the survey purporting to have been made by the public officer, returned and received into the public office, the public recognizing it by assessment of taxes, the owner contributing to the support of government, was in fact made. It is so consistent with legal presumption, made for the sake of peace, in all cases of this nature, (as livery of seisin, the surrender of copyhold,) to give to the holder of that which he has paid for actual investiture, all the forms of an effective conveyance; and that, as it is good between the state, and the purchaser from the state, so it should bind those claiming under the state; as well where they claimed under pretence of settlement, as of subsequent office right.- This species of right certainly falls within the reason of the law, which gives to the <em>bona fide </em>holder of a legal or equitable right the protection of presumption of length of time, of the forms and ceremonies required byr law, to complete and perfect his title. It is on the ground of general convenience, public good, and security of titles, that the protection is extended to incorporeal rights \u2014 to payment and extinguishment of mortgages. It is as difficult for the owner to keep alive his marks on the ground, as it is impossible for him to keep alive the witnesses who made them. Time, the exterminator of all things, accident by tempest and by fire, may prostrate the best marked lines; and when to this is added the destructive hand of man, who is led into the strong temptation of rooting up the distant owner\u2019s land marks, <em>and thereby, by this accursed </em>thing\u2014 of removing land marks \u2014 making himself the owner of the land; the reasons are very cogent in favour of this legal presumption. It is not required of the court now to decide this; and such a case has not heretofore come directly in judgment. At present, according to the spirit of all former decisions, it appears to me sufficient'evidence of a survey returned, an actual survey, to show that any part of it was made on the ground. The act of assembly, it was decided, in <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Insersoll, </em>was in this particular but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>directory; for I hold it to be a good survey, if the surveyor marks so much on the ground as to enable him to close the survey from the adjoining surveys, natural boundaries, and his own personal knowledge, and the decision of the Supreme Court of the <em>United, States, </em>proceeds on the same principle. 4 <em>Wheat. </em>598. And in <em>Taylor </em>v. Brown, 5 <em>Cranch, </em>243, Chief Justice Marshall said, \u00a3\u00a3 If the omission to record the survey avoid it, then the omission of any other act enjoined by the same section of the act would render it equally void. The surveyor is directed to see the lands plainly bounded by natural boundaries, and marked trees. Has his omission to do this ever been inquired into, in a contest respecting the validity of a survey? Would any gentleman of the bar contend, that, because the land was not plainly bounded, that for that reason a survey actually made was void?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">On examining the propositions on which the counsel of the plaintiffs required the opinion of the court, they will be found <em>to be </em>substantially but two. The first was, whether there must not be at least one line applicable to the particular survey. The answer to this was very full, and very accurate. \u00a3\u00a3 There must have been lines on the ground, and there must be, or must have been one line applicable\u201d to the survey in question, lines of old surveys, are equal to new lines; leaving to the jury, (and there was a view,} the faet of a survey on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The second'proposition, though branched into four inquiries, w7as, <em>\u201c </em>whether, when a surveyor in his return called for an old survey, as a boundary, it was necessary to prove <em>that survey returned into the office,'\u201d </em>Evidence was given, that there were two ancient well made surveys in 1766; one in the name of <em>Michael Braziel, </em>the other in the name of <em>Jacob Buck, </em>which .were not returned, in which it seems ejectment had at one time been brought, but had, for some cause, been discontinued. Thus the question did not arise, whether the lines adopted had been the work of a regular deputy, with an order in his hands, or a mere private, unauthorized, unofficial act. But it arose on a w'ell marked line, an office right; and the learned judge gitfes such an answer to the proposition as was to be expected, from his great experience, and matured judgment, on questions of this nature. The owner of a warrant, bounded by such a survey, has nothing to do with the return.' It matters not to him why it was not returned, or why, if you please, it was abandoned. Any one at all conversant in the land titles of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>well knows, that there are numerous legal unquestioned surveys, made even so far back as 1766, that have not been returned to this day; owing sometimes to the fault of the deputy; sometimes to the default or negligence of the proprietor, in not paying the fees, or calling for the return. The question is not on the validity of the survey, its return, or abandonment, but whether <em>de facto </em>there was such a boundary on the ground, to which the surveyor might refer, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>out marking it anew, and adopt it in an adjoining survey. Most clearly he might, and the survey being found marked, would be sufficient. It is a matter of boundary, not of title; to prove which, even hearsay, after a great length of time, is admissible evidence. Most clearly, in such a case as this, he might adopt it as a boundary, without the useless labour of marking it again; which would tend to confound the first title, \u25a0 and render it a matter of dispute afterwards, when the first survey was made; and 1 do not know that it would be lawful for the surveyor to make fresh marks on an ancient boundary. But one thing is very certain, it would be idle and unnecessary; and after so great alapseof time \u2014 nearly sixty years since these ancient surveys were made, the court would presume, for the purpose of boundary, they were made by legal authority. The charge throughout receives my entire approbation. It contains the soundest doctrine; and in a case circumstanced as this is, I have struggled to get over the exception^ as to the rejection of <em>Daniel Turner\u2019s </em>deposition. I cannot See how the evidence of <em>Joseph Shugart </em>proved any fact to impugn the defendant\u2019s survey. His right became fixed by the return; it was beyond his control. The warrant was <em>functus officio; </em>there was no order of re-survey. The employment of \u00e1n assistant, to a deputy surveyor, to examine the ancient lines, and the irregular work of that surveyor, and his marking other lines, could not remove the warrant, or defeat the defendant\u2019s right, fixed down to a particular spot, by the survey and return.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">But this evidence of an experimental irregular line was read without opposition; and the defendant gave evidence, by <em>William Wilson, </em>how the line came to be run; that it was done by <em>Turner, </em>from an incorrect draught, and never located the old surveys. The plaintiff then cross-examined him; when he said, he did not know who employed <em>Turner, </em>or furnished the incorrect draught. This made way for the admission of <em>Daniel </em>Twiner\u2019s deposition, which had been before so justly rejected, for the reasons given by the court. Indeed, such evidence was so unsatisfactory, vague, and rambling, that it ought never to have been read, to establish by itself any fact. Yet, as his name, the draught, and General <em>Patton, </em>as one of the owners, had been introduced, in one point of view it was admissible, to show that the work had been done under the direction of General <em>Patton, </em>and that he furnished the incorrect draught. If the plaintiffs had been called upon to state for what purpose it was-offered, and had shown it as evidence in chief, to substantiate a fact, and the court had overruled it, it would then have been properly overruled. For, when evidence is offered, the adverse party has a right to call on the other party, to know what it is intended as proof of; and if he states it, then it is to be tested by that statement, and if it is not evidence of that fact, though it might be evidence of some other matter, the rejection would be no cause to reverse a judgment. But this does not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>pear; nor does the opinion of the court assign any reason for its rejection; but it appears to have been a general offer, and a general rejection. 4 <em>Binn. 201, </em>335. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>The Lessee of Moore, 5 Binn. </em>138. I incline to think the court considered it but as a renewal of the application first made, to receive it as evidence in chief, which they had before so justly rejected. Had the counsel of the plaintiff stated the design with which it was then offered, I cannot think the counsel of the defendant would have objected to it, or the court sustained the objection. But nothing of this appears, either in the offer, or in the opinion of the court; and, therefore, being evidence for some purpose, it was admissible. No doubt, but <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Turner </em>spoke of the same line, and of the same transaction. It is for this reason alone the judgment is reversed, and reluctantly reversed; for I cannot yet discover how the line run by <em>Turner </em>could change the position of the survey, in the name of <em>West. </em>Yet, as both parties went into evidence of that line, <em>Turner\u2019s </em>deposition was made evidence in consequence of the testimony given by <em>Wilson, </em>the defendant\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The court very properly rejected the survey of <em>Adams, </em>and of previous surveys, not made at the same time, nor in any manner connected with the chain of surveys made for Colonel <em>Miles, </em>and as properly agreed to admit <em>Diehl\u2019s </em>and O\u2019Neal\u2019s, for the reasons given by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
