It was entered by order of the defendant without the plaintiff\u2019s interference. It is not in conformity with the provisions of any act of assembly. The act of the 24th of <em>February, </em>1806, <em>sec. </em>28, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>324, applies only to cases where there is a holder of a note, bond or other instrument of writing, ill which judgment is confessed or containing a warrant of attorney. And the act of the 21st of <em>March, </em>1806, <em>sec. </em>S, refers to amicable suits and confessions in writing, executed in the presence of two or more witnesses. It is true in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Gilbert, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 567, </em>it was held, that judgment may be entered by the prothonotary in consequence of an agreement of parties, to enter an amicable action, and confess judgment independently of the act of the 21st of <em>March, </em>1806. That there the paper was carried to the prothonotary by the plaintiff. That case is different from the present. Amicable actions are not entered without consent of both parties, expressed either personally or in wiriting. In <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>the cause of action was specified: but this paper specifies no cause of action. This writ of error is prosecuted by the creditors of <em>Thomas R. Peters, </em>who think themselves injured.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-10\"><em>Farrelly, </em>and <em>Galbraith, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1s\">Neither <em>Thomas R. Peters, </em>if living, nor his administrators since his death, could dispute this judgment. .If he could constitute an attorney to confess judgment, surely he might do it personally, without an attorney. This court knows nothing of his creditors. We do not say, that this judgment is entered under the act of 1806, but under long practice. The case of <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>is conclusive. They cited also <em>Helvate </em>v. <em>Rapp, 7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>306.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b197-12\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK1\"><em>Thomas R. Peters, </em>deceased, attorney at \u25a0law, gave a written order <em>to Alexander MlCalmont, </em>prothonotary of the Court of. Common Pleas of <em>Venango </em>county, to enter judgment against him, in an action of debt, for the sum of ten thousand dollars in favour of his brother, <em>Richard Peters, </em>jun.; the defendant in error. In pursuance of this order, an amicable action of debt, <em>Richard Peters, </em>jun. v. <em>Thomas R. Peters, </em>was entered on the docket, and judgment confessed for4en thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Against this judgment it is objected, that it is not conformable to the act of the 21st of <em>February, </em>1806; by which the prothonotary is authorized to enter judgment on a confession in writing by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the defendant, attested by two witnesses. If the judgment was founded on this act of assembly the objection would be good. But it was decided by this court, in the case of <em>Cook v. Gilbert, </em>(8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>567,) that the act was affirmative, and did not mean to prohibit the entry of judgments according to a practice existing prior to its date. And we are of opinion that the judgment entered in. the present ease was warranted by that practice. It was objected also, that the judgment ought not to have been entered, because it did not appear that the plaintiff assented to it. But the assent of the plaintiff may be presumed, because the judgment was for his benefit, and because his positive assent was subsequently given. If there was any thing unfair in this transaction, the creditors of <em>Thomas R. Peters </em>may contest it. They may commence actions against the administrators, and if this judgment is set up against them, they may aver that it was confessed by-fraud, and put the plaintiff to the proof of a good consideration. But the only question at present is, whether any error appears on the face of the record. It is the opinion of the court that there is no error, and therefore the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Judgment affirmed'.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
