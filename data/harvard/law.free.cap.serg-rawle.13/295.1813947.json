The plaintiff moved for leave to issue a <em>fieri facias </em>for one hundred and fifty-four dollars and ninety-eight cents, the balance claimed on the statement made by him, and the following facts were agreed to by the parties, to be considered in the nature of a special verdict. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-14\">A levy was made by virtue of the <em>fieri, facias </em>mentioned in the condition of the bond by the plaintiff as sheriff on the goods of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>defendant <em>Stewart, </em>on the 27th of <em>May, </em>1819, and the bond was executed by the defendants <em>Stewart </em>and <em>Reditt, </em>after the said levy, and on the same day and year. In consequence whereof,, the plaintiff delivered over the property to the defendants in the execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">On the 1st of <em>November, </em>1819, the defendants paid to the plaintiff one hundred dollars on account, and delivered to the plaintiff certain personal goods, a parcel of the goods levied on as aforesaid, which were sold by the plaintiff for ninety-three dollars. On the 7th of <em>February, </em>1820, upon the motion of <em>John Rame, </em>the court ordered and directed the sheriff to pay over to the said <em>John Rame, </em>seventy dollars, part of the ninety-three dollars, in discharge of one years\u2019s rent due from the said <em>Stewart, </em>to the said <em>Rame, </em>at the time the said goods were levied as aforesaid, for the premises on which the said <em>Stewart </em>then resided, on which the said goods were found, at the tim\u00e9 of said levy, but no notice was given by the said <em>Rame </em>to the plaintiff, of said rent, or. demand of payment thereof until the 7th of <em>February, </em>1820. And the said <em>Reditt, </em>one of the defendants, was at the time of the execution of said obligation and until the said 7th <em>February, </em>1820, entirely ignorant that any rent was due to the said <em>Rame.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">Upon the foregoing facts, the defendants contend that they are not liable to pay to the plaintiff the aforesaid sum of seventy dollars paid by the plaintiff to the said <em>Rame, </em>but that they ought to be credited for the same out of the balance due on the foregoing statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">It is agreed that if the court shall be of opinion, that the defendants are not legally chargeable with the foregoing sum of seventy dollars, paid under, and in pursuance of the orders' of the court, to the said <em>Rame </em>as aforesaid, and that the same was improperly deducted from the amount of sales, then the said seventy dollars shall be deducted from the balance stated; but if the same is legal and proper, then that execution shall issue for the said balance with interest from the 1st of <em>November, </em>1819.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">The court below, after argument, directed the seventy dollars to be deducted from the balance in the plaintiffs\u2019 statement, and that execution should issue only for the amount then remaining, viz. eighty-four dollars ninety-eight cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-9\"><em>Carothers, </em>for the plaintffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\">This case depends on the condition of the bond from <em>Stewart </em>and <em>Reditt, </em>to <em>Mitchell. </em>They were bound to deliver goods sufficient to satisfy <em>Cappas </em>execution, with all legal costs and charges, or to pay said debt and costs, and save the sheriff harmless. But they have not kept the sheriff harmless- The sheriff had in the first place to pay seventy dollars, due to <em>Rame </em>for rent, and these seventy dollars are how the matter in dispute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-11\"><em>Williamson, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3FX\">We contend that the defendants are bound only to pay the debt and costs on <em>Capp\u2019s </em>execution. Bonds like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>this should not be encouraged, because they induce the sheriff to neglect his duty, and postpone the sale of goods levied on. <em>Reditt </em>is only a surety, whose liability is not to be enlarged beyond the words of his contract 9 <em>Wheat. 680. </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>90. The intent of this bond was, that the obligors should pay <em>Cupp\u2019s </em>execution, namely, his debt and all costs and charges: there was no view to any rent due to <em>Rame. </em>The words, save harmless, were not intended to extend beyond this. Special covenants are not to be extended by general words coming afterwards. 2 <em>Saund. </em>412, 415. 9 <em>Wheat. </em>720. 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>934. 1 <em>Stra. </em>227. When this bond was given, the rent due to <em>Rame </em>was not known to the surety or the party. The levy was made on the 27th of <em>May, </em>1819; the execution was returnable to the first Monday of <em>August </em>term, 1819; there was no notice of the rent to the sheriff till the 7th of <em>February, </em>1820. The sheriff is not bound on an execution to levy more than the debt and costs. 6 <em>Johns. </em>283. Act 21st of <em>March, </em>1774, sect 4. <em>New Purd. Dig. </em>709. 1 <em>Selw. N. P. </em>534. 2 <em>Yeutes, </em>274. The order of the court was illegal, and the sheriff was not bound to obey it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-5\"><em>Carothers, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANzt\">The defendant had an election to pay the debt and costs to <em>Capp, </em>or give the sheriff goods to that amount. The defendants did deliver some goods in <em>November, </em>1819, but they were liable to the rent. The court ordered the sheriff to pay the rent, and would have attached him if he had disobeyed. The legality of the order of the court is admitted by the statement of this case: we have not the facts on which the court decided.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b297-7\">Gibson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">If the landlord\u2019s application had been in time, we should entertain no doubt that there had been a breach of the condition of the bond. The sheriff had levied, and we may presume, on sufficient to produce satisfaction not only of the*exeeution, but also of the rent; and it is a fair construction of the agreement to say, that in consideration of releasing the property from the levy, the defendants below were to put him in a situation equally advantageous, by delivering him property equally productive: and whilst he remained subject to any responsibility which arose out of the levy they were bound to keep him clear. The question then is, did they, as circumstances turned out, keep him clear. The act of the 21st of <em>March, </em>1772, directs that chattels levied in execution shall be subject to payment of a year\u2019s rent for the premises on which they shall be seized; <em>\u201c </em>and that the sheriff shall after the <em>sale </em>of the said goods, pay to the landlord or other person empowered to receive the same, siich rent so due, and apply the overplus thereof if any, towards satisfying the debt and costs on such execution mentioned.\u201d Now it is a part of the case, that notice of his claim was not given by the landlord till lo&gt;--g after the time when the execution was returnable; and he had tbere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>fore undoubtedly lost his preference. It is the business of a sheriff who is acting without notice of any other demand which he may be bound to satisfy, to levy no more than is sufficient to satisfy all demands already in his hand; and although I will not at present say he ought to have notice of a landlord\u2019s claim in time to enable him to extend his levy, yet if the landlord lie by till after the return of the execution he will undoubtedly be postponed. The existence of his demand is a matter peculiarly within his own knowledge, and he is therefore bound to give notice of it in time to produce as little delay to the execution creditor as possible. But, to say nothing of the delay, it would be attended with extreme hardship, if not injustice, to permit him to disclose his demand for the first time after the execution is returned, and the remaining property of the debtor has perhaps been attached by other executions; and thus enable him to intercept thf money in its passage from the hands of the sheriff to rhe pocket of the execution creditor. A second execution would probably produce nn beneficial result, as landlords seldom claim a preference where there is not a scramble among the creditors. In this case, then, when the landlord claimed to have a part of the money applied to the extinguishment of the rent, he had lost his preference; and the defendants had consequently performed the condition of their bond by delivering property sufficient to satisfy the execution and save the plaintiff harmless. The proceeds of it were, however, wrested from the plaintiff by order of the court. Bui what is that to the defendants, who had covenanted to indemnify him only against legal resposibility, and not against the consequences of an erroneous opinion of the court. They are third persons, and not to be prejudiced by acts which can operate only on him who is the immediate subject of them. At the return of the execution, they had performed their covenant by protecting the plaintiff frqpi the lawful demands of all persons, till all danger from lawful demands had passed away; and cannot now be held answerable for a manifest error of the court in a proceeding to which they were not a party; much less be concluded from contesting the only fact that could warrant the act of the court \u2014 notice to the plaintiff in time to render the landlord\u2019s claim available. It was the plaintiff\u2019s business to make out to the satisfaction of the court, what is now conceded to be the truth of the case, that he had not received such notice; and if he failed to do so, he, and not the defendants, must take the consequences. It is the opinion of this court, therefore, that the court below did <em>not err </em>in directing the money which was paid over to jthe landlord, to be deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Judgment affirmed-.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
