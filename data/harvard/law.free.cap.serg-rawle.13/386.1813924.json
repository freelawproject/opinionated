The court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence; upon which, the counsel for the defendant offered to prove, that the said <em>John Adams </em>lived in <em>Centre </em>county, but the court rejected the evidence, and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">In the course of the trial, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to prove, by <em>Robert, Buchanan, </em>that <em>William Loudon, </em>at the time of his death, was not in debt, and left a good deal of personal property, consisting of cattle, horses, farming utensils, &amp;c. The evidence was objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, but admitted by the court, and an exception taken. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-11\">Several other points arose, in the progress of the case, but, as they were afterwards, abandoned, it is unnecessary to state them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-12\">The court, upon being requested to instruct the jury, that, if they beli\u00e9ved that the legacies mentioned in the will of <em>William Lou-don, </em>or any of them, were not paid, the defendant was entitled to a deduction to the amount of such legacies; and further, that the said legacies were a charge upon the land,\"answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-13\">\u201cAs a general principle, for whatever interference did exist, and the adverse title is the elder and better, the defendant would have a right to set off to the amount of its comparative value. I have no doubt, as at present advised, that, when either a special or general warranty is inserted in' a deed, and a better outstanding title can be established for part, that the purchaser can retain <em>joro tanto. </em>But, Twill state another .position. \u2014 When, at the time of the execution of the deed, there are apparent outstanding liens. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>or incumbrances,, which may or may not thereafter be brought against the land, and all the facts in relation to them are equally known to both parties, if, expressly to guard against such contingent liens, or incumbrances, a warranty is inserted, with special reference to them, and if nothing occurs, from the date of the deed, until the money is demandable, to render it more certain that such liens or incumbrances will actually come against the land, than was in the contemplation of the parties, when the deed and bonds were executed; under such circumstances, the defendant would not be permitted to retain.\u201d <em>\u2018\"l </em>Then, with respect to the supposed liens of the legacies, under the will of <em>William </em>Loudon, they must be decided according to these principles. We have no doubt, in saying, that the legacies referred to under <em>William Lou-don's </em>will, were charged upon the land. Then, it must be decided by the jury, whether all the facts, in reference to them, were known to the parties, when the deeds and bonds in question were executed; and whether any thing has occurred since their date, which renders the land more liable to b\u00bf charged by them, than was known and contemplated by the parties, when the bonds were given. The warranty in the deed, in its terms, seems to relate to these liens.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">To this opinion the counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-7\"><em>Metzger </em>and- <em>Carothers, </em>for\u2019the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-8\">1. The evidence of <em>Buchanan </em>was inadmissible.. The object of it was to raise a presumption of.paymeut of the legacies charged on the lands. ( <em>Henry Loudon, </em>the executor and devisee, 'who was bound to pay these legacies, ought not to have been permitted to raise a presumption of payment, from the circumstance of his having assets for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">2. Whether the deed from <em>Loop </em>and wife to <em>Fuhrman </em>was admissible, depended upon the acknowledgment, the defect in which was, that there was no evidence of its having been made before a justice. The certificate does not state of what <em>county </em>or <em>state John \u00c1dams </em>was a justice. If he had called himself a justice of <em>any </em>county, the matter might have been submitted to the jury, but where no county is named, how is it possible to prove that he is not a justice. .The commissions-of justices are recorded in the recorder\u2019s office, of the proper county, and also in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth. They cited, <em>Act of the 28th of May, </em>1715, <em>sec. </em>2, <em>Purd. Dig. 115. Act of the l8th of March, </em>1814, <em>sec. </em>1, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>122. <em>Act of the 24th of February, </em>1770, <em>sec. 2, Purd. Dig. </em>117. <em>Act of the 18th of March, </em>1775, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>118. <em>Act of the 13th of April, </em>1790, <em>sec. </em>10, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>131. <em>Act of the 8th of </em>April, 1785, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>120, 1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>102. <em>7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-10\">3. The court were mistaken, in saying that there was a particular warranty against the legacies charged upon the land. It is not so. \u2022 The covenant is against <em>the heirs of </em>\u2014 \u2014Loudon, <em>deceased. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Then, considering it as a <em>general warranty, </em>will that be sufficient to prevent the defendant from setting up defect of title, \u00e1s an equitable defence against his bond given for the payment of the purchase money? The general current of authority in <em>Pennsylvania </em>is to the contrary. In this case,, the balance of purchase money due from the defendant was but about three hundred dollars, and the legacies were about half that sum. At all events, it was the duty of the plaintiff to have tendered security, or indemnification against these legacies, as soon- as he-received notice of them. The security arising from a general warranty, must always be very fluctuating, and has become much more precarious, in consequence of the great change which has taken place in the value of property in this country. The offer of security, in this case, was made during the trial, and therefore, too late. 5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>201, 206. 1 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; Rawle, 438, 447. 5 <em>Binn. </em>365. 7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>62.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-7\"><em>Wadsworth </em>and <em>Mahon, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABBs\">admitted that the legacies were a lien upon the land, but said, the personal estate was, in the first instance, to be applied to the payment of them. <em>Whart. Dig. </em>613. <em>No. </em>128. <em>Id. </em>614. <em>No. </em>135. It was, therefore, proper to show, that the testator left a considerable personal estate, as it afforded some presumption of payment, especially as a long time had elapsed since the death of .the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-8\">2. The acknowledgment was good. If Mr. <em>didams </em>was a justice in any county, he had a right to take the acknowledgment. He calls himself a justice, and it sufficient to prove that he <em>acted </em>as a public officer. 1 <em>Phill. Ev. </em>170. 3 <em>Johns. </em>431. 6 <em>Binn. </em>88. The word <em>aforesaid, </em>in the certificate, refers to the county mentioned in the <em>deed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-9\">3. As to the charge of the court, it may be proper to mention, that the plaintiff executed and offered to the defendant a judgment bond, with good security, conditioned for the indemnification of the defendant, against' any outstanding title, or incumbrances. In this case, the defendant has not only a warranty against the heirs of the testator, but a general warranty-. That must have been the intention of the parties, when one gave the warranty, and the other his bond, for payment- of the purchase money. No action lies on the warranty before eviction, because, perhaps there never may be an eviction; and, in the mean time, it is impossible to estimate the danger with any tolerable accuracy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by .</p>\n<author id=\"b389-11\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ask\">This is an action of debt, on three bonds given by <em>Jacob Fuhrman, </em>the plaintiff in error, who was defendant below, to <em>Henry Loudon, </em>the plaintiff. These bonds were given to secure the purchase money of a tract of land, sold by the plaintiff to <em>Jacob Roop, </em>from whom the defendant purchased; it having been agreed, by all the parties interested, that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ant, instead of giving his bonds to <em>Roop, </em>should give them to the plaintiff. The defendant' having pleaded payment, with leave to give the special matters in evidence, rested his defence principally on two points. \u2014 1. That the land which he had purchased was liable to the dower of <em>Jacob Roop\u2019s </em>wife. \u2014 2. That the said land was liable to the payment of certain legacies, charged on it by the will of <em>William Loudon, </em>deceased, father of the plaintiff. In order to show that no right of dower was outstanding, the plaintiff\u2019 produced a deed from <em>Roop </em>and wife, acknowledged before <em>John Jldams, </em>styling himself a justice of the peace, to which the defendant\u2019s counsel objected, because it was not said, in the certificate of the acknowledgment, of what county or state <em>Jldams </em>was ,a justice. But the court overruled the objection, and admitted the deed in evidence. The certificate was headed, - county, ss. and then went on to say, \u201c before me, one of the justices of the peace for the <em>said county, </em>personally came <em>the above named Jacob Roop, </em>and <em>Susanna, </em>his wife, and acknowledged the above indenture,\u201d &amp;c. &amp;c. Now, it would seem, that the words, <em>\u201cfor the said </em>county,\u201d were intended to refer to the county mentioned in the body of the deed; because, in another part of the certificate, where it is said, that <em>the above-named Jacob Roop, </em>and <em>Susanna, </em>his wife, appeared before the justice, reference must certainly have been intended to the body of the deed, no mention of <em>Roop </em>and wife having been previously made in any other place. The exception is not to\u2019 be favoured, as it cannot be seriously supposed, that <em>Jldams </em>would have undertaken to receive the acknowledgment of a deed relating to lands in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>if he had not been a justice of the p\u00e9ace for some county in the state, and if a justice for any county, it was sufficient. At the time of taking this acknowledgment, any justice of the peace was authorized to take the acknowledgment of a deed affecting lands in any part of the state. I am of opinion, therefore, that the exception was net good, and the deed was properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">2. The next error is of a more substantial nature. The defendant says, that he ought not to be compelled to pay his bonds, because the land which he purchased, and for which these bonds were given, is liable to the payment of certain legacies, charged on it by the plaintiff\u2019s father. The court below were requested to charge the jury to this effect. The charge was-substantially as follows: That, in general, where a bond is given for the purchase mokney of land, and, before payment, it is discovered, that there are incumbrances existing, the plaintiff cannot recover, without deducting the amount of the incumbrances, although he has made a conveyance to the defendant with general warranty; but that, where the incumbrances, with all the circumstances attending' them, are known both by vendor and vendee, and. the vendee takes from the vendor a deed, warranting particularly against those incumbrances, and gives his bond for the purchase money, it is no defence against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>an action on the bond, to say, that the incumbranees are still existing. And the court left it to the jury, to determine, whether both parties, in the present case, knew of the legacies charged on the land, and whether any circumstance had occurred, rendering the situation of the defendant more perilous than it was when he gave his bonds. I see nothing to find fault with' in this charge. The plaintiff\u2019s warranty certainly referred to these legacies; it was against the plaintiff himself, and his heirs, <em>\u201cand each and all the heirs of his deceased father, and his and their heirs, </em>and against all and every other person.\u201d The legacies were given to some of the heirs of the father, and no doubt it must have been known to the defendant that they were charged \u00f3n the land, because the land which he was purchasing came to the plaintiff, (the vendor,) by his father\u2019s will, and when the defendant was examining the title papers, the legacies and the charge stared him full in the face. Then how does the defendant stand before the court? He asks equity. The plaintiff has no equity to ask; he sues on the defendant\u2019s bond, which has been forfeited at law. But what equity is there in the defendant\u2019s case? He purchased a tract of land, which he knew to be burthened with the payment of legacies; he secured himself against these legacies, by a warranty taken for the very purpose. He reserved a conveyance of the land, and passed his bonds for the purchase money. Thirteen years elapsed, from the death of <em>William Loudon, </em>by whose will the charge was created, to the time of commencing this suit. . The defendant has never been molested by the legatee, and yet he complains that he should be called on to pay his bonds, because possibly he may be molested hereafter.- It really does appear to me that there is no foundation for this complaint; and that by refusing payment the defendant is violating the fair meaning of his agreement. If the incumbrance had been unknown when the bonds were given, the case would have been very different, even though the plaintiff\u2019s deed of conveyance had contained a clause of general warranty. He would then have been protected by the principles established in Steinhauer <em>v. Witman, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>438, 447. But upon the facts exhibited in the present case, the charge of the court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">An exception was taken to the evidence of <em>Robert Buchanan, </em>who proved that <em>William Loudon, </em>(father of the plaintiff,) died possessed of considerable personal property. I think it was good evidence, being a circumstance affording some little presumption, that the legacies might have been paid. It is unnecessary however to say any thing more on this point,- as I understand that it was abandoned after the argument. The judgment is to be affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
