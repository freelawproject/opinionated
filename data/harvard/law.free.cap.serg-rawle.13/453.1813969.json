The plea was non-assumpsit and payment with leave to give the special matters in evidence. No notice of special matter was given to the plaintiff. The suit was marked on the docket for the use of <em>Benedict Darlington. </em>On the trial of the cause, the plaintiff proved the sale and delivery of the goods; also, that they were sold and delivered on the credit of a letter from <em>Darlington </em>to <em>Pusey, </em>the plaintiff, in which he undertook to be responsible for the payment. The defendants then offered to prove, by the oath of <em>James Buck, </em>that after the sale and delivery of the goods as aforesaid, <em>Darlington </em>said, that \u201cwhen he (Darlington) had paid <em>Pusey for these </em>goods, bis accounts with <em>John Alexander </em>would be about square.\u201d This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, and rejected by the court, whereupon the plaintiff excepted to their opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-10\"><em>Edwards, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASo\">now contended that the evidence was admissible, and that the ground on which the court had rejected it, namely, that it was special matter of which no notice had been given by the defendants, was not tenable. It was proper evidence under the pleas, without notice, because it went to show that the plaintiff had no right to recover, and that his debt was paid; for the suit being for the use of <em>Darlington, </em>it was <em>to he </em>considered in the same light as if brought by him; and in that case it went in bar of the action, under the issues joined.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-11\"><em>Dillingham, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAC8\">insisted that it was evidence of special matter: it was in fact a set-off of a debt due by <em>Darlington </em>to <em>Alexander </em>against <em>Darlington's </em>claim in this suit against <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Ralston. </em>He cited <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Myers, 4 Yeates, </em>366. <em>Wharf. Dig. </em>531, <em>pl. </em>43, 45. He also contended, that a debt due to one of the defendants by the plaintiff cannot be set off in a suit against both. To this point he cited the <em>Defalcation Act of </em>1705. <em>Purd. New Dig. </em>175. 3 <em>Yeates, </em>26. <em>Mont. on Set-off, </em>23. 6 <em>Bac. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Ab. </em>136. 1 <em>Wheaton\u2019s Selw. </em>117. 1 <em>Coxe\u2019s New Jersey Rep. </em>11. 11 <em>Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfX\">If notice of this evidence had been given by the defendants to <em>Darlington, </em>for whose use the suit was brought, or to his attorney, I think it would have been admissible. But it was a defence of a special nature, and therefore notice ought to have been given. This action was brought, not in the name of <em>Darlington, </em>but of <em>Pusey. </em>The declaration did not mention <em>Darlington, </em>but set forth that the goods were sold and delivered by the plaintiff <em>(Pusey) </em>to the defendants. The pleas of non assumpsit and payment applied to <em>Pusey </em>and not to <em>Darlington. </em>Nevertheless, as the action was for the use of <em>Darlington, </em>the defendants might have averred that the fact was so, and then have pleaded, that they had made payment to <em>Darlington, </em>or that they had an account agairist him, which they intended to set off. Or, having put in the pleas of non assumpsit and payment <em>with leave, </em>&amp;e. they might have given notice, that they intended to give evidence of payment to, or a set-off against <em>Darlington, </em>or of his confession that when he had paid <em>Pusey\u2019s </em>demand, the accounts between himself and <em>Jllexander </em>would be about square. This was a collateral matter, altogether foreign to the demand made by <em>Pusey </em>in this action, although a good defence against <em>Darlington, </em>for whose use the action was brought. It was <em>special matter, </em>therefore, of which <em>Darlington </em>was entitled to notice under the rule of court, because without notice he might have been taken by surprise, inasmuch as the pleas of non-assumpsit and payment were only in answer to the declaration which averred that the goods were sold and delivered by <em>Pusey. </em>It is a great indulgence to defendants to permit them to give evidence of special matter in this informal way. It saves the expense and danger of special pleading. The least that can be expected therefore, is, that the plaihtiff should be protected against surprise, by notice of the matter intended to be given in evidence, in bar of his claim. For these reasons, I am of opinion that the evidence was properly rejected, and therefore the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
