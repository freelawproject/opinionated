Fact. That <em>Share </em>had notice both of the appointment of the referees and of their meeting, as appears by the testimony given on the trial of the facts on the <em>scire facias </em>issued on this judgment which is contained in the bill of exceptions taken by <em>Share, </em>by the charge of the court and the verdict of the jury, all remaining on record though reversed on an informality in the mode of trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A91\">2d Fact. That <em>Banck </em>acted as his agent in the appointment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the men, as he admitted the award to be against him, and gave security for the payment of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">3d Fact. He solicited <em>James Duffy </em>to enter bail for him on the award, and represented to him that his land was bound by the judgment, and was worth far more than sufficient to satisfy the judgment and previous lien; and that he, <em>Duffy, </em>would run no risk in bailing him, to stay the execution: \u2014 upon the faith of which he did bail him, as he well knew <em>Share\u2019s </em>real estate to be worth much more than the award, and the other judgments which bound it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">4th Fact. That <em>Duffy </em>was sued on the bail he entered for <em>Share </em>on the award to <em>April </em>1st, 1818, No. 63, on which judgment was entered on the 24th of <em>August, </em>1818, <em>scire facias </em>issued, and an application made to open the judgment overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-8\">5th Fact. That by the report of the referees in the <em>scire facias </em>issued on this judgment, the fact of <em>Share\u2019s </em>adopting the award in this cause as his, and his getting <em>Share </em>to enter bail for him, is fully established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-9\">6th Fact. That <em>Share\u2019s </em>real estate, bound by this judgment, has been sold by his other creditors, the amount of this judgment ordered by the court to be paid to <em>Becker </em>without opposition, and the money paid over to the wards of the plaintiff, whose money it was before this writ of error issued, and without any notice of it, which payment, if allowed to stand, secures <em>Duffy </em>according to the plighted faith of <em>Share, </em>that he was secured by the lien of the award on his <em>(Share\u2019s) </em>land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-10\">7th Fact. That <em>Henry Share\u2019s </em>real or personal estate has been sold by the sheriff, and he is insolvent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-11\"><em>Buchanan </em>contended, that the plaintiff in error was entitled to restitution of course and as a matter of right. 2 <em>Tid\u2019s Prac. </em>936, 1137, 1138. 2 <em>Salk. </em>588. 2 <em>Tid\u2019s Prac. </em>402, gives the form of the writ. 2 <em>Saund. 69. </em>2 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>57. This court will have enough to do, if in every case of restitution, they inquire into the merits of the reversed judgment, and exercise their discretion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-12\"><em>Hopkins, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGr\">Restitution is in the sound discretion of the court, and great injustice will be done unless they exercise it. He relied on the case of <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Eaton, for the use of Coleman, </em>and referred to 16 <em>Johns. </em>4. 15 <em>Johns. </em>395. 2 <em>Dall. </em>205. <em>Madd. Ch. </em>109.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b42-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b42-14\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHx\">This is a motion by the plaintiffs in error, for restitution of the money levied on an execution issued on a judgment which has been reversed. The fact is, that there has been a reversal of two judgments, \u2014 the original judgment for <em>Becker </em>against <em>Ranch </em>and <em>Share, </em>and a judgment on the <em>scire facias </em>issued on the original judgment. Restitution is always granted on the reversal of a judgment, unless there be something peculiar in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the case. The reasons offered against restitution in this case, are not satisfactory. They seem calculated only to show, that the judgments which have been reversed were just, and that on a second trial, <em>Becker </em>will again obtain judgment against the present plaintiffs in error. But, to suspend restitution on this ground, would involve the court in endless difficulties. It may as well be alleged, in every other case in which a judgment is reversed, with an award of a <em>venire de </em>novo, that in all probability there will be the same verdict, and then we shall be called on to investigate the merits of the cause. To avoid all embarrassment of this kind, the general rule must be, that on the reversal of a judgment, the plaintiff in error is entitled to restitution. But there are cases in which restitution would work such manifest injustice, that it would be the duty of this court to guard it by certain restrictions. An instance of this kind occurred, in the case of <em>Kirk (in </em>error) v. <em>Eaton, for the use of Coleman. </em>There, <em>Eaton </em>had obtained a judgment against <em>Kirk, </em>and also a second judgment in <em>a scire facias </em>on the original judgment, on which an execution had been issued, and levied on the land of the defendant. The judgment on the <em>sci. fa. </em>was reversed, but the original judgment remained in force. <em>Kirk </em>was <em>insolvent, </em>and asked for restitution. Now, in that case, what would have been the situation of <em>Coleman, </em>for whose use the suit was brought, if restitution had been granted. He would have lost the fruits of his original judgment, by which the land of <em>Kirk </em>was bound, because the purchaser under the execution would have held the land, notwithstanding the reversal of the judgment on the <em>scire facias. </em>This would have been flagrant injustice, to prevent which, the court ordered, that instead of making restitution to the <em>insolvent debtor, </em>the money should be brought into coui\u2019t, to await the event of a trial on an issue, on the plea of payment on the <em>scire facias, </em>and then, as much as should be found to be due on the original judgment, was to be paid to <em>Coleman, </em>and the balance restored to <em>Kirk. </em>So, in the present case, it is understood, that <em>Share, </em>on whose land the execution was levied, <em>is now insolvent, </em>and that the land was bound by several judgments, subsequent in date, to the judgment of <em>Becker. </em>Now, the judgment of <em>Becker </em>being removed, by reversal, justice requires that the younger judgments, which were a lien, should be paid out of the money raised by <em>Becker\u2019s </em>execution. But the money will be lost, if it goes into the hands of <em>Share, </em>therefore it becomes the duty of the court to protect the judgment creditors. This can only be done by ordering restitution, on certain conditions, \u2014 that is to say, the Court of Common Pleas, who are to carry our order for restitution into effect, must direct the restored money to be brought into court, after which it is to be applied, first, to the discharge of all liens on the land of <em>Share, </em>according to their legal priority, and the balance, if any, paid to <em>Share </em>himself. This will do justice to all parties, and will be such a restitution as the nature of the case demands.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
