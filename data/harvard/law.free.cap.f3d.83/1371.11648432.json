He was sentenced to life in prison for the kidnapping count, as well as five years to be served consecutively for the \u00a7 924(c) violation and 30 years to be served concurrently for the \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e) violation. Adams perfected this appeal, alleging that (1) the indictment handed down by the Federal grand jury in this case does not contain an essential element of the \u00a7 1201 kidnapping offense, namely, that the kidnapper hold the victim \u201cfor ransom or reward or otherwise,\u201d rendering the indictment fatally defective, and (2) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove this same element. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">The victim in this case, Sharee Lovett Adams, married the defendant in 1991. According to the evidence presented by the government, Mrs. Adams left her husband four or five times, and each time Mr. Adams would find her and threaten her with physical harm in order to force her to return to him. In early 1994, while the couple was living in Brunswick, Georgia, Mrs. Adams left the defendant again, first moving to a women\u2019s shelter and then to the home of the defendant\u2019s sister, from which the defendant had been banned. On this occasion as well, the defendant gained entry into his sister\u2019s house by ruse, physically assaulted his wife and forced her to return with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">In July of 1994, Mrs. Adams left her husband and moved, in with her cousin, Delores Uwaezuoke, who resides in Atlanta. She left the defendant a letter asking him to file for divorce, and said that she would do so if he did not. Three to four weeks later, the defendant found his wife. He went to Ms. Uwaezuoke\u2019s apartment, but was refused entry on two occasions, first by Ms. Uwaez-uoke, and then by Mrs. Adams, who at that time was in possession of a rifle. When Mr. Adams would not leave, Mrs. Adams grabbed the rifle, drove to a telephone and called police. Mr. Adams refused to leave until forced to do so by police. On the following day, a Sunday, a local judge refused to grant Mrs. Adams a stalking warrant, and told her to return on Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">On Monday morning, the defendant returned to Uwaezuoke\u2019s apartment. He threw a brick through a sliding glass door, entered the apartment, and held a handgun he had purchased in Atlanta to Ms. Uwaez-uoke\u2019s head. He ordered Mrs. Adams to come out of hiding. When Mrs. Adams entered the room, the defendant took her and freed Uwaezuoke. As he walked Mrs. Adams out to his car, the defendant said, \u201cBitch you done fucked up now. You know what I told you I was going to do if you left me.\u201d RII-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-9\">The defendant tried to force Mrs. Adams into his car, but she fought to free herself. When she did break free and attempt to run away, the defendant shot her in the abdomen, forced her into the car, and sped away. He refused to take her to a hospital, going instead to a hotel in Madison, Florida. There he twice attempted to force Mrs. Adams to have sex with Mm. The F.B.I. eventually convinced Mr. Adams to free Ms wife, and then took Mm into custody. Mrs. Adams eventually underwent five operations to repair the wound inflicted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">\n<em>The sufficiency of the indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-11\">In the defendant-appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he insists that the Federal grand jury indictment handed down against him does not include an essential element of the \u00a7 1201 Mdnapping offense. That section defines as kidnappers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-12\">Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds <em>for ransom or reward or otherwise </em>any person ... when\u2014 ... (1) the person is willfully transported in interstate or foreign commerce ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 (1994) (emphasis added). The defendant notes that Ms indictment does not contain an allegation that he held his wife \u201cfor ransom or reward or otherwise,\u201d and argues that the indictment is therefore fatally defective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>The original version of \u00a7 1201, enacted into law in 1932 and known as the \u201cLindbergh Act,\u201d punished only those who kidnapped another person \u201cfor ransom or reward.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 408a (1932), <em>quoted in Gooch v. United States, </em>297 U.S. 124, 125-26, 56 S.Ct. 395, 395-96, 80 L.Ed. 522 (1936). Section 408a was amended on May 18, 1934, to include within its sweep those who kidnap \u201cfor ransom or reward <em>or otherwise.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 408a (1934) (emphasis added). The phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d in the amended statute was construed broadly in <em>Gooch </em>to \u201cprevent transportation in interstate ... commerce of persons who were being unlawfully restrained in order that the captor might secure some benefit to himself.\u201d <em>Gooch, </em>297 U.S. at 128, 56 S.Ct. at 397. The application of <em>ejusdem generis </em>was rejected. The Senate Judiciary Committee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-5\">The object of the addition of the word \u2018otherwise\u2019 is to extend the jurisdiction of this act to persons who have been kidnapped and held, not only for reward, <em>but for any other reason.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">H.R.Rep. 534, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>quoted in Gooch, </em>297 U.S. at 127, n. 1, 56 S.Ct. at 396-97, n. 1 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>H.R.Rep. 1457, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>quoted in Gooch, </em>297 U.S. at 128, 56 S.Ct. at 397 (expression of identical intent by House Judiciary Committee); <em>United States v. Satterfield, </em>743 F.2d 827, 850 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cThe statute broadly prohibits the interstate transportation of a person against his will if the captor hopes to obtain any benefit to himself from the abduction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-7\">The Supreme Court has subsequently held that \u00a7 1201 is not limited to kidnappings committed for an otherwise illegal purpose. <em>United States v. Healy, </em>376 U.S. 75, 81-82, 84 S.Ct. 553, 557-58, 11 L.Ed.2d 527 (1964). In <em>Healy, </em>the defendants kidnapped a pilot and forced him to fly them to Cuba. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 84 S.Ct. at 554. The district court dis-the indictment against the ground that the kidnapping was not committed for pecuniary benefit. <em>Id. </em>at 76-84 S.Ct. at 554-55. The Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe addition of \u2018otherwise\u2019 intended to make clear that a nonpecuni-motive did not preclude prosecution un-the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 84 S.Ct. at 557. The Court then disposed of defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1201 at a minimum requires that kidnapping be committed for an illegal purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-11\">This contention is without support in the language of the- provision, its legislative history, judicial decisions and reason. The wording certainly suggests no distinction based on the ultimate purpose of a kidnapping ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1447-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 82, 84 S.Ct. at 557. The Court noted that there were no policy considerations supporting defendants\u2019 assertion that \u00a7 1201 requires an illegal purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-13\">A murder committed to accelerate the accrual of one\u2019s rightful inheritance is hardly less heinous than one committed to facilitate a theft; by the same token, we find no compelling correlation between the propriety of the ultimate purpose sought to be furthered by a kidnapping and the undesirability of the act of kidnapping itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1447-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 82, 84 S.Ct. at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-15\">In <em>Clinton v. United States, </em>260 F.2d 824 (5th Cir.1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 948, 79 S.Ct. 731, 3 L.Ed.2d 681 (1959), this Court\u2019s predecessor construed \u00a7 1201 in circumstances quite similar to the case at bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The indictment in <em>Clinton </em>also omitted the phrase \u201cfor ransom or reward or otherwise.\u201d The court noted, \u201cIt is difficult to see how the addition of the words \u2018for ransom or reward or otherwise\u2019 would have added anything to the indictment because <em>obviously \u2018otherwise\u2019 comprehends any purpose at all.\u201d Id. at 825 </em>(emphasis added). <em>See also United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number><em>Atchison, </em>524 F.2d 367, 370-71 (7th Cir.1975) (\u201c[I]t now appears to be well settled that purpose is not an element of the offense of kidnapping and need not be charged or proved to support a conviction under the kidnapping statute, a defect in the indictment\u2019s allegation of purpose is collateral in nature.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">Adams argues that <em>Clinton </em>does not control the result here for two reasons. First, he argues that the holding in <em>Clinton </em>stands in contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Chatwin v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 455, 66 S.Ct. 233, 90 L.Ed. 198 (1946). However, the defendant misreads <em>Chatwin. </em>The Court in <em>Chatwin </em>held that the statutory language \u201cheld for ransom or reward or otherwise\u201d in the Federal Kidnapping Act \u201cimplies an unlawful physical or mental restraint for an appreciable period against the person\u2019s will and with a willful intent so to confine the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 66 S.Ct. at 235. The Court found that the person allegedly kidnapped by the defendants in that case was not held against her will, and was free to leave at any time. <em>Id. </em>The Court reversed the defendants\u2019 convictions because the government \u201cfailed to prove an act of unlawful restraint.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\"><em>Chatwin </em>holds that, for an act of transporting a person across state lines to constitute kidnapping under the predecessor to \u00a7 1201, the victim so transported must be held against his or her will. In this regard, <em>Chat-win </em>is in no way inconsistent with the holding of the court in <em>Clinton. </em>Further, the indictment handed down against Adams clearly states that he \u201cdid unlawfully seize, confine, kidnap, [and] carry away\u201d Mrs. Adams and <em>\u201chold [her] against her will.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">However, part of the dicta in <em>Chatwin </em>relates to Adams\u2019 second argument that <em>Clinton </em>does not control our decision in this case. Adams correctly notes that the court in <em>Clinton </em>upheld an indictment that, although it lacked the words \u201cfor ransom or reward or otherwise,\u201d did in fact charge the defendant with \u201cunlawfully and knowingly\u201d transporting the victim in interstate commerce after kidnapping her. The court found that indictment sufficient. Adams argues, in essence, that the indictment handed down against him contains no statement regarding his <em>mens rea </em>because there is no language in it that could serve as a substitute for the purpose requirement of \u00a7 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-9\">The Supreme Court stated as dicta in <em>Chatwin </em>that one of the elements of the Federal kidnapping offense is that the kidnapper act \u201cwith a willful intent so to confine the victim.\u201d <em>Chatwin, </em>326 U.S. at 460, 66 S.Ct. at 235.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Adams argues that, in <em>Clinton, </em>the intent element in that indictment served as a substitute for the purpose of the kidnapping element. He insists that his indictment contains no language that could serve as a substitute for \u201cransom or reward or otherwise,\u201d and thus an essential element of the offense is missing from it. However, <em>Chatwin </em>deals not with the sufficiency of an indictment, but instead with the sufficiency of the government\u2019s proof after trial. An indictment, on the other hand, is sufficiently detailed if it: (1) contains the essential facts underlying each element of the offense, such that the defendant is properly informed of the proof he must meet, and (2) is specific enough to permit the defendant to use it to protect himself from a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 763-64, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1046-47, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962). It cannot be disputed that the indictment in this case, given its degree of factual and temporal specificity, meets the second of these two criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-10\">We also readily reject Adams\u2019 claim based on the first <em>Russell </em>criterion. The factual specificity of the indictment more than ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>quately made him aware of the proof against him and the allegations to which he must answer. The incident at issue is clearly defined, down to the date of the alleged offense. The only arguable deficiency in the indictment is a failure to explicitly charge willfulness. Our resolution of this issue is facilitated by the posture in which Adams\u2019 assignment of error is brought to this Court. Adams did not object to the indictment in the district court, but instead makes this argument for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">When the adequacy of an indictment is challenged for the first time on appeal, this Court \u201cmust find the indictment sufficient unless it is so defective that it does not, by any reasonable construction, charge an offense for which the defendant is convicted.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooshmand, </em>981 F.2d 725, 734-35 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotations omitted). <em>Hooshmand </em>explained, quoting from <em>United States v. Chilcote, 724 </em>F.2d 1498, 1505 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1218, 104 S.Ct. 2665, 81 L.Ed.2d 370 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avy\">[P]ractical, rather than technical, considerations govern the validity of an indictment. Minor deficiencies that do not prejudice the defendant will not prompt this court to reverse a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\"><em>Hooshmand, </em>931 F.2d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-7\">We readily conclude that Adams suffered no actual prejudice as a result of this indictment. In addition to the factual specificity noted above, the indictment specifically refers to \u00a7 1201. <em>See Chilcote, </em>724 F.2d at 1505 (\u201cMoreover, when the indictment specifically refers to the statute on which the charge was based, the statutory language may be used to determine whether the defendant received adequate notice.\u201d). Therefore, the ruling of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">. The indictment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Y1\">That between on or about August 1, 1994, and on or about August 2, 1994, in the Northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>District of Florida and elsewhere, the defendant,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-9\">BRADY LA VICK ADAMS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqX9\">did unlawfully seize, confine, kidnap, carry away and hold against her will Sharee Lovett Adams, and did transport Sharee Lovett Adams in interstate commerce from the state of Georgia to Madison County, Florida;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-16\">All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1201.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1447-17\">.

Because the Court's primary concern and holding in <em>Chatwin </em>was that the predecessor to \u00a7 1201 required that the restraint applied by the kidnapper be exercised against the victim\u2019s will, the Court did not elaborate on the dicta noted above. The logic of this dicta is that \u00a7 1201 should not be construed to punish a person who unknowingly and unintentionally transports across state lines a restrained individual, against that individual\u2019s will. For example, if a trash hauler locks a dumpster, which unknown to him also holds an intoxicated reveler, picks it up and moves it in interstate commerce, he should not be guilty of kidnapping even though he restrained the individual and carried him across state lines, because he did not form the necessary intent to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">.
