Such order is not one from which an appeal lies. (See. 963, Code Civ. Proc.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodell, </em>72 Cal. App. 452 [237 Pac. 829]; 2 Cal. Jur. 156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">The attorney for appellants in this case was substituted after the appeal was taken, and after the briefs were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Works, P.
