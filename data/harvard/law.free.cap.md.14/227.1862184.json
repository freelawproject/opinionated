After the old building had been taken down, and the temporary one put up, a hole was dug within the limits of the market by persons who had no business there, jnto which the plaintiff fell during market hours and was injured. The hole was about twenty feet from a flat outside the old market house, but within the limits taken for the new one, where hucksters were accustomed to sell, and, at the time, were selling vegetables against the orders of the market-master, who had warned them off. The limits of the new market were indicated by a furrow, along which granite stones were placed for the work, which with timber placed at one end were intended as obstructions to keep people off. The plaintiff sued the city to recover damages for injuries sustained by falling into this hole. Held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b236-5\">1st.

The power and authority to prevent or remove nuisances carries with it the duty and obligation to prevent or remove them. 9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>174, <em>Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto. vs. Marriott. Rev.

That independently of the power and authority so conferred, and the consequent duty and obligation so imposed under the statute, it was the duty of the city, in its character as owner and proprietor of the Bel-Air market and market place, and of all the ground embraced within the limits of this market, as set forth in sec. 5, of Rev.

The prayer of the plaintiff was properly granted. It embraced the whole law of the case, and is substantially the same as was granted and received the approbation of this court in <em>Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto. vs. Marriott. </em>The only questions for the jury to determine were, 1st, had the city, or its agents and servants, exercised proper and reasonable care and diligence in the prosecution of the work at the market, in taking down and removing the old building, so as to prevent the liability of accident, or in preventing or removing the particular nuisance complained of, to wit, the hole in the market space into which the plaintiff fell? and 2nd, was the plaintiff himself in the exercise of ordinary care at the time of the accident? These questions the plaintiff\u2019s prayer submitted to the jury and they passed upon them. In addition to the cases already cited, see, on this point, 4 <em>Hammond, </em>500, <em>Goodloe vs. City of Cincinnati.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">The court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 prayers for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">1st. The first is too vague and indefinite, and in the broad and general terms in which it was granted, was calculated to mislead the jury as to the responsibility of the city. It can be taken in two senses and is susceptible of two constructions. The \u201cfull power and authority\u201d and \u201cexclusive discretion,\u201d therein claimed for the city, may be taken to be that absolute, unlimited, and illimitable power and authority, and irresponsible discretion, which are the attributes of sovereignty and belong to it alone, and in the exercise of which the sovereign power is exempted from all liability for the consequences flowing from it; or it may be taken to be only that \u201cfull power and authority\u201d and \u201cexclusive discretion\u201d, which is conferred upon the city by the Act of 1796, in regard to the erection and regulation of markets, meaning thereby, that the city has power, authority and discretion, to the exclusion of everybody else, qualified, however, by the respect it owes, in common with every other proprietor, to the safety of the lives, health and property of others, and the liability it is under for injury occurring through the negligence, default or unskillfulness of tself, or its agents and servants, in the actual exercise of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>power, authority and discretion. If the prayer is to be takers in the former sense, it is clearly erroneous. Power, authority and discretion, of that absolute and arbitrary species, cannot be predicated of this defendant. It is not sovereign but subject. It is the creature of the sovereign power of the State. It derives its being and all its rights, powers, privileges and faculties-from the Act of incorporation,\u2014from its charter granted by the State. The State has made it a corporation\u2014it can unmake it. It has clothed it with certain specified powers\u2014these it can alter, modify or take away. Such a condition of subordination is incompatible with the idea of sovereignty in the city, and with the possession, on its part, of that species of absolute power and authority, and irresponsible discretion, which are the marks and attributes of sovereign power alone. If it is to be taken in the latter qualified and conditional sense, the law of the prayer is not denied. But that sense is not clear, and the court should have modified it so as to express the responsibility of the city for its wrongful acts, or those of its officers and servants, in the execution of the work at the market, or rejected it altogether, on the ground that it does not distinguish between the two classes of powers above referred to, and tended to mislead the jury. 3 <em>Comstock, </em>463, <em>Rochester White Lead Co. vs. City of Rochester. </em>3 <em>Barb., </em>254, <em>Brower vs. New York City. </em>15 <em>New York Rep., </em>532, <em>People vs. Draper. </em>1 <em>Selden, </em>369, <em>Lloyd vs. New York City. </em>2 <em>Kent, </em>309, 321, and <em>note. </em>17 <em>New York Rep., </em>104, <em>Storrs vs. City of Utica. </em>16 <em>New York Rep., </em>160, <em>Conrad vs. Ithica. Ibid., </em>171, <em>Weet vs. Brockport, </em>and cases already cited under preceding points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">' 2nd. The second prayer takes from the jury the whole question of care and diligence, and <em>the </em>degree of care and diligence, incumbent on the city in making the improvements at the market, and so- far conflicts with the doctrine of the plaintiff\u2019s prayer granted by the court. There is, besides, no evidence to support that part of it which refers to the plaintiff\u2019s-straying into the market place, and leaving out that the prayer asserts, if it asserts any thing, the absolute non-liability of the city, under all and any circumstances.. It is only a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>application, to the facts in this case, of the erroneous doctrine asserted in general and abstract terms in the first prayer, and is open to the same objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">3rd. The third prayer errs in this, that it seeks to relieve the city from liability on account of the existence of one nuisance, by pleading the fact of the existence of another, to wit, the suffering and permitting, by the city and its officers, of hucksters and country people to invade and take possession of the space which was the site of the old market house, and had been marked out as the site of the new one, to set up their tables and sell their commodities thereon, and thus invite persons attending the market, as purchasers, into tire space. Under the Act of Assembly already quoted, full power and authority is conferred on the city, in regard to the regulation of markets. By the Rev. Ord., No. 26, as well as by the special ordinance authorising the improvements in question, given in evidence, the city has proceeded to act under this power, and it is responsible for a complete and perfect execution of it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b243-6\">Tuck, 3.,</author>\n<p id=\"A38\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The case before us is, substantially, as follows: Ordinances were passed by the defendants for rebuilding the Bel-Air market house, and for the erection of a temporary one for the accommodation of the public, until the new one should bo completed. After the building had been taken down, and the temporary one put up, and in use as a market, a hole was dug within the limits of the old house by persons who had no business there, into which the plaintiff fell, during market hours, on the night of October 8th, 1853. How this happened does not appear: the witnesses speak of him as in the hole when they first saw him. That he was seriously injured is shown by the proof. The hole was about twenty feet from a flat outside the old market house, but within the space taken for the new one, where country people were accustomed to sell vegetables, and were selling at that time, against the orders of the market-master, who had warned them off. At the time of the accident the contractors had taken down the old house, and by means of a plow, had indicated the outlines of the new one, wr ich included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the flat, and placed along the furrow granite stones for the work, which, with lumber placed at the end next Gay street, about thirty feet from the hole, were intended to serve as obstructions to keep the people off. The temporary market had been put up and in use since the 12th of September.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We have no idea that this suit can be maintained, on the ground of negligence on the part of the defendants\u2019 agents in removing the old house. If that were the only proposition, it might be answered, that the owner or person in charge of property undergoing repairs, or being rebuilt, is not responsible for damage to one who voluntarily goes amidst the ruins, having no business there. He cannot ascribe to the supposed negligence of others, that which results from his own imprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">But it is contended that, by force of the charter\u20141796, ch. 68, sec. 9\u2014it was the duty of the city'' authorities to prevent, and remove nuisances of this kind. It is true that, in the ease of <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., vs. Marriott, </em>9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>160, it was decided, that the charter placed the Corporation of Baltimore, in this regard, upon the same footing which is held by individuals and private corporations; and as the defendants had authority \u201cto erect and regulate markets,\u201d as well as to \u201cprevent and remove nuisances,\u201d it would follow that they had assumed the duty, and the consequences of negligence in its performance, of keeping the established markets free from nuisances. This liability, however, could not be enforced where the party injured had not observed ordinary care and diligence; nor where he met his accident at a place, which, at the time, was not an authorized market place, or where buying and selling were carried on against public authority. When the old house was taken down the ground ceased to be a market place, and the fact of its removal, and the erection of a temporary house, indicated to the public that they could not go upon the old site to sell and buy, with the same privileges and indemnity, in respect thereto, as before the established market had been discontinued. The fact, that hucksters were selling on the flat, as formerly, cannot affect the question, because that would be allowing the plaintiff to protect himself against the consequences of his own act, under cover of the unauthorized acts of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>But then it is claimed that the plaintiff was injured whilst passing over the old ground, towards the temporary market house. <em>We </em>do not perceive the right of the party to pass that way, except upon the hypothesis assumed in his prayer, \u201cthat he had no other way by which to proceed to the temporary market in safetyIf this was the only way, or had been set apart by the city authorities as a passage way to the market, we think it should have been kept free from nuisances and obstructions, from which damage might result to persons whilst passing and repassing during market hours. But the circumstance that others were passing that way, does not render the city liable to the plaintiff; they were all there at their own peril, if there was no permission to use it for access to the temporary market, and none of them could set up any demand against the city, as for negligence, in respect to its condition as a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">According to these views, it follows, that the plaintiff\u2019s prayer was erroneously granted. It assumes the duty of the city to keep the hole filled up during market hours, when, as we have said, the ground had ceased to be a market place. It was also erroneous in this, that there was no evidence on the subject of care and diligence on the part of the plaintiff, or that he had no other way by which to proceed to the temporary market in safety, or that he pursued the same path usually taken by others. If the city authorities, or those having the market in charge, had indicated this as a way to the temporary market, the city would be chargable for negligence, if any, in permitting the way to be obstructed by nuisances of this kind, but there is no such evidence. The fact that others used the same route, did not make it a way in the sense that would impose on the city the duty of keeping it clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Upon the case, as presented by the evidence, we do not perceive that there is any cause of action against the city authorities. Municipal corporations are responsible, in many cases, for the manner in which the duties of their subordinates may be performed; but it would be extending the doctrine beyond the limits of reason and public policy , to enforce responsibility under the circumstances disclosed by this record. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>say the least, it was imprudent in the plaintiff to have ventured at night, over the site of a recently demolished market house, where he might reasonably have expected to find obstacles and hindrances, from which injury might result to others as well as himself; and where, he must be considered as having known that, the corporation had been doing nothing more than the charter and ordinances authorized, in reference to the erection and regulation of markets.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b246-7\">(Decided. July 15th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Having disposed of the case on the appeal of the defendants, it is unnecessary to consider the prayers granted at their instance, from which the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
