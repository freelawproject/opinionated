Pfeltz, in his lifetime, pur-\u00bb chased from J. J. Speed, trustee, under a decree in chancery, a tract of land in Baltimore county, containing one hundred: and twenty-one acres, more or less, described in a deed therefor from said Speed, as trustee, to said George, in fee-simple, dated tiie 26th of June 1847, which was duly recorded, and is filed as an exhibit with the bill; that after his purchase the said George entered into possession of the land, claiming title thereto under this purchase and deed, and continued in the peaceable possession thereof until April 1855, when he died', leaving the complainant, Sarah, his widow, and the other complainants, his children, all of whom are infants under the age of twenty-one years, and, also, leaving a will,'which is filed as an exhibit with the bill, by which he devised this land to the complainant, Sarah, during her widowhood, or until his youngest child should arrive at full age, she to receive the fonts, issues, and profits thereof, and apply the same to the\u2019 support, education and maintenance of herself and the testator\u2019s children, and should she marry, or when his youngest child shall attain the full age of twenty-one years, whichever shall first happen, then she is- to- sell the same and divide the-proceeds, after payment of her dower interest therein, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>his children, share and share alike; (hat, after the death of the? said George, the complainants, claiming under this will, went into the peaceable and quiet possession of this land, and continued to receive the rents and profits thereof, and to apply the same to the purposes of the will, until on or about the month of' May last, when the defendant, Julius P. Pfeltz, unlawfully, violently, and contrary to equity and good conscience, entered upon and into the possession of said premises, and has since continued to hold the same unlawfully and against equity and' good conscience, to the great and manifest u\u2019rong and injury of (he complainants, withholding from them any use or benefit of said premises, whereby they are, in great measure, deprived of their proper legal and equitable support and maintenance of and from the rents and profits of said land, he, the said Julius P. Pfeltz, not denying some right and title of the said George, but sometimes pretending and giving out in speeches that the right and title of said George was only equitable and not legal, and feigning and pretending some alleged forfeiture thereof, and pretending that his children, the other defendants, are entitled to said laud, because of such alleged forfeiture, and that the legal estate is outstanding, in a certain Job Smith, in trust for their use under some pretended deed, and, at other times, pretending some other excuse for his said' violent, unlawful and inequitable conduct in the premises, all of which pretences and excuses (he complainants aver are false and without foundation in law' or equity. The bill also charges that the said Julius P. Pfeltz is utterly insolvent, and then prays that he may be compelled, by decree, to surrender and yield up said land to the complainants, as in their former estate, and to account with them for the rents and profits thereof whilst so held by him, and pay over the same to the complainants for their own use and benefit, according to the terms of said will, and that the title of the complainants may be declared and quieted, and that, <em>pendente lite, </em>a receiver may be appointed of said rents and profits, and that said Julius P. Pfeltz may be enjoined and compelled to surrender up the premises to the receiver, when appointed,, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On the same day that the bill was filed, the court (Krebs, J.) passed an order appointing a receiver, and granting an injunction as prayed, from which, after answer filed, the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b387-5\">The cause was argued before Eggleston, Took and Bartol, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-6\"><em>Chas.

The bill asserts a legal fee-simple title in the appellees, and an <em>unlavful </em>and <em>violent </em>entry by the appellant, Julius P. Pfeltz. It does not charge that he is doing irreparable waste. Under such a state of facts the appellees can have full and adequate relief without resorting to a court of equity, 1st, by proceedings under the statues for <em>forcible entry </em>and <em>detainer. </em>1 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>McH., </em>428, <em>Proprietary vs. Brown. </em>9 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>107, <em>Isaac vs. Clarke. 2 Harr.

The appellees, having adequate remedy at law, could notask relief in a court of equity. <em>Story\u2019s Eq.

This proceeding is virtually an ejectment bill, which is not allowed by courts of equity. <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., sec. </em>476.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-12\">4th. The case made by the bill did not authorise the appointment of a receiver, or the issuing of an injunction. 3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>456, <em>Herr vs. Bierbower. Ibid., </em>503, <em>Carlisle vs. Stevenson. </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>480, <em>Ches. &amp; Ohio Canal Co. vs. Young. </em>In the case last cited, at page 490, this court denies the doctrine that, <em>because </em>a party asserts only an <em>equitable title, </em>and cannot succeed at larv, a court of equity gains jurisdiction and may exercise it in the manner here claimed. It might be shown from the will of George G. Pfeltz, the exhibited source of the appellees\u2019 title, that a <em>legal title </em>is in the: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>widow for protecting all rights of herself and her infant children, but that ascertainment is not at all necessary. A bill in equity cannot be made to serve for an ejectment or for a writ of forcible entry, or for an action of trespass. <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., sec. </em>476. The cases cited under the appellees\u2019 second point are far from establishing the doctrine indispensable for their bill, that because an <em>infant </em>asserts the right to land, and is excluded by another from possession, the person in possession must be deemed guardian, and may be called by bill in equity, not only to a trial of title, but actually through the interposed appointment of a receiver to surrender the possession, and at once. Even where a parly has been made amenable in equity to an infant for <em>mesne profits </em>as <em>quasi </em>guardian, and by reason of entry without title superior to the infant\u2019s, a previous determination under ejectment, of title against the pernor of the j-pnts and profits, is necessary. 1 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>220, <em>Drury vs. Conner. </em>Such an expansion of chancery power, in using a bill in equity, not for even trying title, but only for challenging title, and through an injunction deciding it <em>instanter </em>for the complainant, and then, through a receiver and his engrossing power over the product of the land, divesting possession, is grossly and oppressively mischievous. Such is the present adventure in equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-5\"><em>T. Parkin Scott, </em>for the appellees, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-6\">1st. That the infant children of George C.

Rep., </em>517, <em>Binnerman vs. Weaver.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-7\">2nd. That the appellant, Julius P. Pfeltz, having taken possession of their estate, is accountable in equity, whether their estate be legal or only equitable. 1 <em>Gill, </em>370, <em>Chaney vs. Smallwood. </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>397, <em>Barnes vs. Compton. </em>2 <em>Md.

That this is a proper case for an injunction and receiver, and especially as the appellant, Julius P. Pfeltz, is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>solvent. 1 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>70, <em>Clark vs. Ridgely. </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>34, <em>Hamilton vs. Ely. </em>1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>543, <em>White vs. </em>Flan<em>nigain.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-5\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2z\">delivered the opinion of this com\u00ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">None of the authorities cited by the appellees are sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of a court of equity, over the case presented by the bill of complaint. The title of the complainants\u2019 testator, George C. Pfeltz, is alleged to have been a legal estate in fee, which, by his will, was devised to his widow, the complainant Sarah, during her widowhood, or until their youngest child shall attain the age of twenty-one years, for the support of herself and their children, the other complainants, with remainder to the children in fee, subject to the dower of the widow. The acts of the appellant, Julius P. Pfeltz, complained of in the bill, are au unlawful and violent entry upon the land, taking the products thereof, and depriving the complainants of .their means of support and maintenance; and the relief prayed is, that \u201csaid Julius P. Pfeltz may, by decree of this court, be compelled to surrender and yield up said land to the complainants, and account with them for the renta and profits, and pay over the same to the complainants; that the title of the complainants maybe declared and quieted; and <em>that,pendente lite, </em>a receiver may be appointed of the rents and profits, and that Julius P. Pfeltz may be enjoined and compelled to surrender up the premises to the receiver, when appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The facts charged in the bill do not show that the appellant was committing irreparable damage to the property, to prevent which an injunction was necessary. <em>Hamilton vs. Ely, </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>34. <em>The Chesapeake Ohio Canal Co., vs. Young, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>480. <em>Davis vs. Reed, </em>14 <em>Md. Rep., </em>152.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The object of the proceeding is to obtain possession of the land, and the case presented is proper for redress at law, where the remedy is ample and complete, either by action of trespass, ejectment, or by a summary proceeding under the statutes for a forcible entry. In such case a court of equity cannot rightfully interfere. <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., secs. </em>473, 476, 490. <em>Drury vs. Conner, </em>1 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>221. 2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>320, (and <em>note </em>325,) 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>26.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b390-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(Decided July 29th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The case is not within the principle decided in <em>Drury vs. Conner, </em>1 <em>Mar. &amp; Gill, </em>220, and <em>Chaney vs. Smallwood, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>367, or <em>Barnes &amp; Fergusson, vs. Compton's Adm\u2019rs, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>397. Here the legal estate, as it appears from the bill, (and on this appeal our attention must be confined to what is therein stated,) is vested in the complainant Sarah, who is <em>sui juris, </em>and may assert, on behalf of herself, and her children the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>the <em>legal </em>remedies against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The order of the Circuit court granting injunction and appointing a receiver will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\"><em>Order reversed without costs, and cause </em>remanded,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
