A. </em>Talbott, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADC\">The question presented by this record, arises upon the residuary clause of the will of Sarah Brown. In relation to the first clause of .this bequest there can be no doubt. It was obviously the intention of the testatrix to give to her two daughters, then living, an equal participation in her estate, and she accordingly declares, that each shall have one-half of the rents, issues and profits during her life, the interest of the one first dying, to descend to the children of such deceased. But, on the death of both of her daughters, she clearly con-* templates a new state of things, and a new disposition. This was natural and equitable, since all the new objects of her bounty stood in equal degree of relationship to her, all being her grand-cbildren though descended in unequal numbers from her daughters. It is not the law of nature that grandchildren divide among themselves only the share of affection due from their grand-parent to their immediate parent; nor is it the law of property that an estate shall be divided, <em>by the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>mere operation of law, </em>in the same way. The substitution of children in the place of <em>parents,per stirpes, </em>is effected by the law only, in case of clearly expressed intention that such substitution shall take place; and no case can be found in which the clear grammatical construction of a bequest admits of distribution <em>per capita, </em>that the courts have decreed a distribution per <em>stirpes, </em>because of any supposed principle of legal or equitable construction, demanding such a distribution. Thus it has been held, that where a devise or bequest is made to the children of several persons, whether it be to the children of A and B, or to children of A and the children of B, they take <em>per capita, </em>and not per <em>stirpes, </em>2 <em>Vern., 705, Weld vs. Bradbury; </em>1 <em>Cox, </em>250, <em>Lugar vs. Harmon; </em>10 <em>Ves. </em>166, <em>Lincoln vs. Pelham; </em>8 <em>Ves. </em>604, <em>Barnes vs. Patch; </em>and when a gift is made to A and B\u2019s children, or \u201cto my brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s children,\u201d it will be construed as a gift to A and the children, and B, in the first case, or in the'second case, to the brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s children, as it strictly and properly imports, and not to the children, and both, as the expression is sometimes inaccurately used, to signify. 3 <em>East, </em>172, <em>Doe vs. Joinville. </em>This state of the law is recognised, and the authorities first cited in 2 <em>Powell on Devises, </em>330, 331. The case at bar fails precisely within the principle of these authorities, and there is nothing in any part of the will to indicate a different inteution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-5\">The error in the argument for the appellees consists in the assumption, that the two clauses which constitute the residuary bequest are necessarily neglected, and that because the lestratrix gave the profits of the residue in question to her two daughters, share and share alike, during their joint lives, with a remainder during the life of the survivor to the children of the one first dying, she therefore meant, that the same division of interest into two parts should continue after the death of both. This is obviously a <em>7ion sequitur. </em>The testatrix contemplates two distinct periods of time, during which her estate should be enjoyed according to the peculiar circumstances of her family. During the life-time of her daughters she disposed of the rents and profits only in the proportion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>one half to each; and to the heirs of the one first dying till the other should die. Upon the death of both, as from a new starting point, she orders the division of the whole <em>corpus </em>among the heirs of her daughters, who are the testatrix\u2019s grand-children, all standing in equal dogree of consanguinity to her. There is no interest vesting in the heirs of the one first dying, which continues after the death of the surviving sister; on the contrary, all the interest given by the first clause of the devise ceases, and the devisees of the <em>corpus </em>of the estate, though described as <em>heirs, </em>take as purchasers under a new and distinct devise. The question then is, how are they to take? <em>per stirpes </em>or <em>per capita!? </em>There is no expressed intention that they are to take <em>per stirpes; </em>the grammatical construction of the words implied a taking <em>per capita. </em>Is there any rule of construction applicable to wills which prefers a distribution <em>per stirpes </em>to one <em>per </em>capita? The authorities give no such rule. The statutes of distribution adopt the principle of representation as a wholesome, general rule, where a decedent has omitted to make a will, and prescribe (lie mode in which his property shall be distributed. But where a decedent makes a will he must provide for representation by express provision, or clearly indicated intention. Else the courts will not arbitrarily ingraft the doctrine upon his will. The cases cited by the appellants, firmly establish this, and are conclusive upon the case at bar; nor do those cited by the appellees militate against it. On the contrary, upon examination, they will be found to recognise the doctrine fully, and to rely upon the appellants\u2019 authorities with approval. If, under a devise to the children of A and B, they take <em>per capita, </em>then this devise, \u201cunto and amongst the heirs and representatives of the said Haunah Levering and Sarah Levering, their heirs and assigns forever,\u201d is a devise <em>per capita </em>among the persons answering to that description.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-5\"><em>Hugh L. Bond </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">There would seem to be no doubt as to the meaning of the will during the life of either of the legatees for life. The will, though inartificially drawn, is, to that extent, beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>reach of doubt. The bequest is to Hannah and Sarah, during <em>their lives, </em>of the profits of the residue. This of course, alone, would have given a joint estate for life. The following words .convert it into an estate in common, for it directs that the profits pf the one dying <em>first </em>should go to <em>her </em>heirs. Heirs can then mean next of idn only, and the persons so described are to take, because of such relationship to the deceased, without any other description, and no matter who or what they may be holding that relation to the dying sister. They therefore, pn the death of the sister, take her profits. This is clearly a gift to the <em>whole stock </em>of the dying sister\u2019s next of kin, and, of course, must go to them <em>per stirpes, </em>for the whole <em>stirps, </em>within the legal description, is to take, and what they take is the whole share of the dying sister. There is no attempt to reckon what share they are entitled to on the hypothesis of a <em>per capita </em>division between them and the next of kin of the surviving sister. The thing would be, in law, an impossibility, because, till the death of both, it cannot be known who will be the next of kin of both. The will therefore continues on the death of one, to the next of kin of such decedent, the profits of the decedent. They might continue to hold them for half a century\u2014so long as the other sister lives ;\u2014and during that time the division is clearly to be joe?' <em>stirpes. </em>If so, is there any thing which, in the event of the death of the surviving sister, alters, by increasing or diminishing, the interest of the next of kin of the first decedent sister?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">Certainly there is nothing expressed on that subject. The will gives the <em>profits </em>of the stock during the life of the sisters and of the survivor; that is, the stock is to kept undivided; it is not to be sold; it is a mere life-estate,, not to vest in any one in severalty till the death of both, and not to be divided till the death of both. Hut' when both are dead the will then contemplates the vesting of an absolute right in severalty among the persons entitled. To accomplish this purpose it gives the execptor power to sell the stock after the death of the survivor, but there is an omission of any word of gift or division\u2014probably by accident;\u2014of the net proceeds. The yrprds are, \u201cand the qpt proceeds unto ancl amongst the fiqirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>and representatives of the said Hannah and Sarah Levering.\u201d Tiiere is here no new disposition of the property <em>in the proportions </em>in which it is to go to the two families\u2014certainly none expressed. The implication is against it, because it would involve a different interest in the same set of persons, at different times, without any reason for a difference, and without any thing to indicate that the thought of such a difference was in the mind of the testatrix. Neither is there any rule of law which countenances such a change of intention. The interest which is <em>expressed </em>as to its quantity must stand, no matter how ambiguous following words may be, for the ambiguity cannot overcome an <em>expressed </em>intention, nor divest an actually vested interest. But there is no ambiguity oven. The rule of law seems quite settled, that however it may be when <em>children </em>or <em>issue </em>are designated, neither children nor issue are terms of legal descent or devolution guiding the distribution of property after death, but are simply words of purchase, describing persons who are to take, yet when heirs or representatives arc the persons to whom an interest is given in personalty, after a life-estate, they are words describing the persons who, <em>in law', </em>bear that relation to the decedent,- and that being so, the law gives the property to the persons who are heirs or representatives, in the same proportions the law would give it had the' decedent died possessed of the property to be distributed according to law. It divides the property among the heirs of Hannah and Sarah, just as if Hannah, had died holding her half, and Sarah had died holding her half. Such is the ruling in the case of <em>Rowland vs. Gorsuch, </em>2 <em>Cox, </em>187, and on the principle that representatives must take under a bequest in a will just as they would under a statute which defines what representatives are. The representatives of Hannah are one body known to the law, and the representatives of Sarah are another body of persons known to the law, and giving the property to and among the <em>representatives </em>of Hannah and Sarah does not make, of the two legal bodies of representatives, one body, nor make the representatives of each the representatives of both, but it is the representatives of Sarah and the representatives of Hannah to whom the law gives th\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>property. It is quite irrelevant to cite the law of nature against the law of Maryland, and for us the law of Maryland embodies the law of nature, as we understand it. The cases cited seem quite as irrelevant as the law of nature. They are <em>all </em>cases of bequests to children, and not to a class of legal representatives; and <em>that </em>distinction disposes of <em>all </em>the cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">The language of this will is precise on this point. There is no reason to suppose that children were exclusively in the testatrix\u2019s mind. Her words are much wider. They cover every contingency covered by the law of distribution. Any pel-son who, by that law, might be the next of kin of either sister is within the words heirs and representatives. One sister might have been the only person representing her sister or remote cousins or uncles. It might have been that one sister might have died childless\u2014her sister her only next of kin\u2014 and the disposition of the property, on the death of the survivor, would still equally follow the words of this will. So there is no reason to speak of the equal love of the testatrix for grand-children; for it might have equally been a case where persons in equal degrees, but in the ascending line, might have been persons who should be the <em>representatives </em>of the two sisters at the death of the survivor; nay, persons who bore no sort of relationship to the testatrix, as for instance, uncles on the father\u2019s side of the said Hannah and Sarah. A rule of interpretation, therefofe, which is drawn from the affection of the testatrix, is a rule too narrow for a guide in dividing property among the representatives of the legatees for life. 1 <em>Hoff.

We </em>think this is not consistent with the intention of the testatrix. Having given to the two daughters, for their separate use, for life, all the rents, issues and profits of all the residue of the estate, the will provides, that \u201cin case of the death of either of them, then and in that case the rents, issues and profits of (he one so dying shall be equally divided between the heirs of the said deceased.\u201d Whatever interpretation may be given to this word- \u201cheirs\u201d\u2014whether heirs-at-law, children, or next of kin\u2014it clearly means, heirs-at-law, children, or next of kin, of the daughter first dying. And as the one who died first left children, they then became entitled to one-half of the rents, issues and profits; the surviving daughter still being entitled to- the other half. This is admitted by the counsel for the appellants. In their printed argument they say: \u201cIn relation to the first clause of the bequest, there can be no doubt. It was, obviously, the intention of the testatrix to give to her two daughters, then living, an equal participation in her estate, and she accordingly declares, that each shall have one-half of the rents, issues and profits, during her life, the interest of the one first dying to descend to the children of such deceased.\u201d They, however, then- say: \u201cBut, upon the death of both of her daughters, she contemplates a new slate of things and a new disposition.\u201d And they insist, that it is this new disposition which gives the appellants the right to claim a distribution <em>per capita, </em>and not <em>per stirpes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Should it be conceded that the interpretation insisted upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>by the </em>appellants\u2019 counsel, would be correct if the provision made with regard to the decease of the two daughters had -stood alone, still it is not so when viewed in connection\u2014as it must be\u2014with the previous provision, in the same residuary clause, in reference to the decease of one. Having there clearly shown an intention to give to the children of one -daughter the precise one-half of the estate which their mother had, no matter which of the daughters of the testatrix should die first, whether it might happen to be the one leaving the largest or smallest -number of children, it would seem right to .suppose the testatrix had a like intention of giving to the children of each mother the share of the mother, when providing for the decease of both of <em>them.</em></p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b47-9\">(Decided June 24th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Should it be supposed that the will of the testatrix created -in each of her two daughters, not. merely a life-estate but a fee, the children of each would be entitled to the same division or distribution of the fund in contest, as they would if the will should be construed as giving to each daughter but a life-estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We think the court did <em>wrong </em>in dismissing the petition of the appellants. Although they were not entitled to the full amount claimed .by them, yet they were each entitled to a portion of the fund in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The decree will be reversed and the cause remanded, for the purpose of having the principles of this opinion carried jnto effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The costs are to b.e paid out of the fund, such being the agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\"><em>Decree reversed and cause </em>remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
