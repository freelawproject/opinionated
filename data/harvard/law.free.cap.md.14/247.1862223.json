He then offered to prove by the bailiff, who was authorised to levy the distress, that the distress was laid, and, as a part of the proceedings, offered an account and affidavit, which he proposed to show, by the bailiff, was the account on which he proceeded.

Hagner </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">The objection sustained by the <em>court </em>below was, that the account was not such as was required by the Act of 1834, ch. 192. The first section of this Act prescribes the form of the affidavit to be made by the landlord before making the distress, 1st, where the distress is for a certain money rent, and, 2nd, where the rent is payable in produce. The affidavit in this ease is <em>identical </em>in language with that prescribed by the Act in the case of a <em>money rent, </em>and the account exactly follows the 3rd sec. of the Act in the case of a money rent. They both specify, \u201cin dollars and cents, the amount of rent claimed to be due and in arrear.\u201d The 3rd sec. does not require that the whole year\u2019s rent should be first stated in the account and then the credits given, but the account is to state in \u201c dollars and cents, the <em>amount of rent claimed to be due and in arrears.\u201d </em>The account, therefore, \u201c states particulars \u201d as fully as the Act requires it should, even if it be only \u201c a balance of rents.\u201d In the same manner, by sec. 1st, the landlord must limit his affidavit strictly to the specified amount \u201c which he shall claim to be due,\u201d thus intimating the propriety of making mention of no other sum except the particular amount \u201cclaimed to be due and in arrear.\u201d If, therefore, this is to be regarded as a <em>money rent, </em>there seems to be no objection whatever to the account. That it is to be so regarded seems clear. By its express terms it is payable in <em>money, </em>not in any manner of <em>produce. </em>The character of <em>the rent payable in kind, </em>as mentioned in the Acts of Assembly, is clearly explained by the language of the Acts of 1831, ch. 171, and 1834, ch. 192. The first was intended to apply the right of distress to cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u201c where land shall be rented in consideration of a render of <em>a portion of the crops raised upon the same, </em>or for <em>a specific amount of grain or other produce.'\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>By the 2nd sec., the <em>specific amount or quantity of grain or other </em>produce, <em>or proportion of the crops agreed upon as rent, </em>is to be <em>valued, </em>&lt;fcc. The Act of 1834 speaks in the same way of \u201c <em>the quantity or proportion of produce </em>claimed by the landlord,\u201d &amp;c., both laws evidently referring to a renting where the landlord was not to be paid in <em>money </em>but in some product from the land. In the present case, by the express terms of the renting, <em>money </em>and nothing else was to be paid by the tenant. If, therefore, this rent was of either of the descriptions of rent specified in <em>the Act of </em>1834, it must certainly be considered as a <em>money </em>rera\u00ed, and if it be a money rent the account and affidavit are fully sufficient. The law says there shall be annexed to the warrant \u201cthe <em>account </em>of the landlord.\u201d An account is defined to mean \u201cthe state or result of a computation.\u201d The word means nothing more in this case than in ordinary cases where accounts are produced. Certainly it would be no objection to an account in an action for the recovery of a debt before a magistrate, that it only states the <em>balance </em>due. The plaintiff1 must afterwards <em>fully </em>prove the particulars of his account with all the debits. The words of the Act are, therefore, gratified in this case, for this certainly is <em>an account. </em>The Act proceeds to describe what the account must contain ; it shall state in dollars and cents, \u201c the amount of rent <em>claimed to be due </em>and <em>in arrear </em>\u201d\u2014not the <em>items </em>nor the amount which <em>would have been </em>due if payments had not been made, but the amount <em>then </em>claimed to be due. This account is fully in conformity with these requirements of the law. The levying of a distress by a landlord for rent in arrear is not \u201ca summary proceeding authorized by law,\u201d as is argued by the other side, but is a right as old as the common law, and all statutes abridging it are to be construed with great strictness. Before the Act of 1834, no account was necessary. That Act requires an account to be annexed to the warrant, and prescribes what it shall contain, and nothing which is not demanded by the Act need be inserted. The Act says nothing of the neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sity of setting forth the <em>items, </em>the <em>time </em>from which the renting dates, or any other particulars of the renting. 'How can their absence invalidate an account which contains everything the Act demands? Even if the landlord claimed too much rent as due, he would be compelled to <em>reduce it at the </em>trial of the replevin. If the distress is illegal, an action of replevin easily brings the illegality to light, and the claim of the landlord must be verified by proof. But if he really has a claim, then he is entitled to have it discharged in preference to all other creditors. . This landlord framed his account for rent due precisely in conformity with the words of the law, and if it were now to be held insufficient, he will have been entrapped by the very words of the law into the loss of his rent. Nor does the Act require <em>\u201c </em>that credits if any should be stated <em>in the </em>account.\u201d It only requires a statement of \u201c the amount claimed to be due,\u201d and that he shall make affidavit of \u201c the <em>amount </em>of his, or her, or their rent, <em>claimed to be due.\u201d </em>In fact, the whole law seems to exclude the idea that all the dealings between the parties are to be set forth in the account. It wisely left the question as to how <em>much </em>was really due, for the final determination of a jury at the trial of an action of replevin, in which the tenant might dispute the landlord\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\"><em>Note. </em>The learned counsel also argued, 1st, that if this rent should be viewed as one payable in produce, still the account should have been admitted in evidence. 2nd, that even if this court should decide these papers to be technically incorrect, the ruling below should still be reversed, upon the ground that any defect in the account and affidavit had been waived by the tenant, and, <em>3d, </em>that <em>this is neither of the </em>rents mentioned in the Act of 1834, but a third description of rent, viz., a money rent not actually <em>certain </em>but <em>capable of being made certain, </em>and, therefore, not comprehended by this Act. The argument on these points is omitted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-6\"><em>Jno. J. Cressuiell </em>and <em>Henry W.

Because it does not state the whole rent due for a certain time, nor the credits to which the tenant was entitled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">2nd. Because the account does not state the time for or during which the rent accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">1st. Whenever a landlord resorts to this summary proceeding for the collection of his rent, he must be held to a strict compliance with the requirements of the law by which he is authorized to levy for a mere claim not yet ascertained by any judicial proceeding; and where the levy is made upon'the property of a third person who is not his debtor, even-handed justice requires that he shall bring himself within the strictest letter of the law. The proceeding by distress for rent is regulated in this State by the Act of 1834, ch. 192, the 5th sec. of which provides, <em>\u201c </em>that every distress made contrary to the provisions of this Act, shall be illegal and void. The first section \u2022of this Act requires that the affidavit shall specify the amount of rent claimed to be due, in dollars and cents, but the 3rd sec. requires, in addition to this, that the <em>account </em>of the landlord shall be prefixed to the warrant. The paper in this case is <em>not an account, </em>but a mere statement of a <em>balance, </em>without stating any of the items of debit or credit. The Legislature must have intended to require, in and by the <em>account, </em>a particular statement of the entire rent for a certain time, and of the credits, if any ; otherwise, it was folly to msist both upon an affidavit and an account. The account would only repeat the affidavit, and contain nothing in addition. A mere statement of a balance cannot be considered an account. The lease in this case was not for any particular and certain amount of rent per annum, but so many cents per perch for the stone that might be quarried, varying according to the quantity and quality of the stone quarried in each year, and in such a case, an account containing the items by which it is made up, is particularly necessary. The intent of the Act is to furnish the tenant, and more especially the stranger whose goods may be levied on, with the means of testing the accuracy of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>count, and the latter could never protect himself against a false claim or collusion between the landlord and tenant, if a mere statement that there was a balance of rent due, which the tenant had (perhaps fraudulently) admitted should be considered a sufficient substitute for the account required by the Act. Such an account, to answer any useful purpose, should state the amount of rent, the time for which it is claimed, and the credits, if any, to which the tenant is entitled. The affidavit, as given in sec. 1, shows that this view is correct, because it provides that the landlord shall make oath that he has <em>\u201c </em>not received, either directly or indirectly, any part or parcel of the said rent claimed to be due and in arrear, or any security, or satisfaction for the same except, <em>if any, the credits given.\u201d </em>If it were sufficient to charge for a <em>balance </em>of rent, then all the latter part of the affidavit, referring to <em>credits given </em>in the account preceding, would have been totally useless and without meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">2nd. But this account does not state when the rent commenced, or when it matured, or whether the sum stated was a balance for a year, or a month, or any other period, but simply that a <em>balance </em>of quarry rent was due on the 31st of December, 1854. For all that appears in the account, the rent might have been due for a half dozen years, and when it fell due, might have been for $1,000, or even a greater sum, which, by sundry payments after it fell due, might have been reduced, on the 31st of December 1854, to the <em>balance, </em>as stated in the account. The papers under which the distress is made, should show upon their face that the landlord was <em>prima facie </em>entitled to resort to that remedy. It is not in every case of rent in airear, that the landlord can distrain, and one object in requiring a sworn account, doubtless was to compel him to show in advance, upon the face of his proceedings, that his case was one in which he might distrain rightfully. The account, we contend, should, at least, contain sufficient to admit of the fair inference that the renting, where a money rent is claimed, was at a sum certain for a certain specified time. But here there is nothing, either in the account, affidavit, or warrant, from which we can infer anything in regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>to the rate or amount of rent, or the time for which it is claimed. The rent, as stated in the avowry, was ten cents per perch for building stone and seventy-five cents per perch for faced stone, but the account does not state nor furnish the ineans of ascertaining how many perches there were of each kind. The aggregate amount of the rent for the year is stated in the avowry at $1640. In the exception, it is stated to have been $719.21, hut the account does not state, or furnish the means of ascertaining, what it was. Surely this cannot be considered such an account as the Act requires : it is entirely too uncertain. The Act of New York, of 1838, ch. 153, requires only an affidavit that the rent distrained for is due, omitting, altogether, the account, and yet every case in New York sustains the position, that the time for which the rent accrued, must be defined, and, in support of this point, we confidently refer to 15 <em>Wend., </em>368, <em>Marquissee vs. Ormston. </em>17 <em>Wend., </em>417, <em>Jenkins vs. Pell, </em>and same case in 20 <em>Wend., </em>450, 2 <em>Hill, </em>648, <em>Smith vs. Fyler.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-5\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AW-\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The decision of this appeal depends upon the construction of the Act of 1834, ch. 192, regulating the mode of levying distress for rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The rent reserved was in money, the amount thereof to be ascertained by computation of the quantity and kinds of stone quarried. This, in our opinion, was a certain money rent, within the meaning of the Act. That is certain which may be made certain. Under the statute of New York, which, in this respect, is similar to our own, in a case \u201cwhere the rent reserved was three dollars per acre for all the improved land on the premises, the tenant agreeing to build a certain quantity of stone fence, a part at so much per rod, and the residue for such price as might thereafter be agreed upon by the parties, the whole to be applied towards the payment of rent,\u201d it was held that, the rent was sufficiently certain within the statute. <em>Smith vs. Fyler, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>648.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">This being a case within the Act of 1834, the only question before us is, whether the account and affidavit, offered in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>dence, are a sufficient compliance with its provisions? Three objections are made to the account by the appellee:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">1. That the time when the rent became due is not stated,</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">2. That the account does not state the whole amount of rent, and set out the credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">3. That the period, during which the rent accrued, is not stated in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The first objection is based upon a misconstruction of the account. In our opinion, it is necessary to state when the rent became due, but, according to our interpretation of the account, that is sufficiently stated. It is in these words:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u201cBaltimore, <em>February 2nd, </em>1855.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">\n<em>Mr. James Whitelock,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\"><em>To Andrew B. Cross, </em>Dr.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">To balance of quarry rent due Dec. 31st, 1855, on the quarry at Rock Run, Cecil county, which formerly belonged to estate of W. L. Cross, ... $,\u2018591.00\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Notwithstanding the ingenious criticism of the appellee\u2019s counsel, we think the fair interpretation of this is, that the quarry rent became due the 31st of December 1855, and the balance therein stated is charged as remaining unpaid at the date of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">The second objection is not sustained by any thing in the Act of Assembly. The 3rd section requires that there shall be prefixed to the warrant, \u201can account stating in dollars and cents the amount of rent claimed to be due and in arrear, * <em>% m </em>* * together with an affidavit or affirmation thereon <em>in substance </em>as required by the first section of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">It is not necessary to state in the account the terms of renting, nor to set down the items showing the whole amount originally payable under the contract, and the credits thereon; it is sufficient \u201cto slate, in dollars and cents, the amount of rent claimed to be due and in arrear,\u201d verified by affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">That has been done in the present case. The form of the affidavit prescribed in the first section need not be literally pursued; if it is substantially followed that is sufficient; the words, \u201cexcept the credits, if any, which have been given,\u201d are designed to apply to a case where credits have been stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>account, which may be done, but they do not make it necessary to state debits and credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In <em>Smith vs. </em>Tyler, 2 <em>Hill, </em>the affidavit stated a sum due as balance of one year\u2019s rent, ending in the month of January A. D., 1840, which the court held to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">3. In support of the third objection several cases from New York have been cited, but a reference to them will show they are inapplicable, the provisions of the Act of 1834 being unlike the statute of New York in this particular. By the revised statutes of that State, it is expressly required, that the affidavit specify the amount of rent due, <em>and the time for which it accrued. </em>The decision in <em>Marquissee vs. Ormston, </em>15 <em>Wend., </em>368, went upon those words. The court say: \u201cWhatever reasons may have influenced the Legislature, the direction is clear and explicit, that the affidavit shall specify <em>the amount of rent due and the time for which it accrued</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In construing the Act of 1834, we do not think the principle ought to be adopted, which is applicable to the construction of statutes conferring special remedies, in contravention of the common law. The right of the landlord to distrain for rent in arrear, in a case like this, is ohe which he enjoyed by the common law. The Act of 1834 was intended to restrain and regulate that right for the benefit and protection of the tenant, and while its requirements must be complied with, they are to receive a sensible construction, looking to the object and design of the Legislature. These were to protect the tenant from onerous and oppressive proceedings by the landlord, and to prevent the levying of excessive distress, by requiring the sum claimed, as actually due and in arrear, to be clearly stated, and verified by oath. The amount actually due is always open to examination on proof, in the action of replevin. Our Act nowhere requires the time, during which the rent has accrued, to be stated in the account or affidavit; in this respect it is unlike the statute of New York. The time when the rent becomes due, it is necessary to state for the security of the tenant against being called on a second time for the same debt, as well as to show that it is such arrear of rent as may be lawfully collected by distress.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b266-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>(Decided July 15th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In our opinion, the account and affidavit in this case are sufficient, and ought to have been admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><em>Judgment reversed and procedendo </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
