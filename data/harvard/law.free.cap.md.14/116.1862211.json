The agreement was intended merely to save the trouble of reexamining the witnesses who had just been examined in the previous case, and the bill of exceptions to be signed in this was to embody the evidence recited in the exceptions in that, with a change of the names and ages of the negroes to suit \u00a1this, and an offer only of the first prayer of the appellant and the first prayer of the appellees. But it was never designed \u00edo dispense with a bill of exceptions, which, of course, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>have been prepared by the counsel of the party wishing to appeal. The appellees were satisfied with the judgment, and it was not incumbent on them to prepare the exception. They, therefore, are not responsible for the imperfect form of the record. It is of course, impossible for this court to reverse this judgment. It is <em>prima facie </em>correct, and this court will not set it aside, unless they see evidence, in the form of an exception, bringing the points properly before them. In this case there is no exception at all. If, however, the court should think themselves justified, under the agreement, in giving a construction to the particular clause of the will, we refer to the case of <em>Vansant vs. Roberts, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>119, in support of our view of the absolute character of the manumission.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b126-9\">(Decided July 15th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-5\">TticK, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADY\">delivered the opinion of (his court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The record in this case is defective in not setting out a bill of exceptions, according to the agreement of the parties. There is, consequently, nothing before us on which the court can revise the judgment below. The appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We may observe, however, .that the right of the appellees to their freedom, as appears by the agreements, depends on the construction of the will of Betty Reynolds, to be found in the case of <em>Negroes William &amp; Others vs. Reynolds, (ante, </em>109,) according to which the judgment was properly entered in their favor. <em>Spencer vs. Dennis, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>314. <em>Vansant vs. Roberts, </em>3 <em>Md.
