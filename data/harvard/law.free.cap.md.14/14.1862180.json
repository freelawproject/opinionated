The <em>jurisdiction </em>of the court to appoint the trustee attached upon the <em>filing of the petition. </em>1 Gill, 215, <em>Bowie vs. Jones. </em>10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>155, <em>Buckey vs. Snouffer. </em>The 2nd sec. of the Act of 1854, ch. 193, requires the court to appoint a trustee, and vests in him all the applicant\u2019s property, both that enumerated in the schedules, and that <em>not so enumerated; </em>and, by the 16th and 17th secs., the clerics and commissioners have power to appoint the trustee, which power would not have been given to these ministerial officers if the Legislature had supposed they were to decide <em>questions of laio </em>in regard to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the schedules, and lists of debtors and creditors to authorise the appointment of a trustee in any particular case. These provisions show that the Legislature intended that the mere filing of the petition should give jurisdiction over the case to appoint the trustee. The 11th sec. gives the court power to' remove the trustee for misconduct, and appoint another in his place, and the whole design and spirit of the law is, while granting relief to the debtor, at the same time to protect the interests of creditors, and this is done by the immediate appointment of a trustee, who, as soon as he is appointed and files his bond, takes the entire property of the debtor out of his possession for the benefit of his creditors, subject to the control of the court by whom he is appointed. 1 <em>Md. Rep., 471, Waters vs. Dashiell. </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>452, <em>Baylies &amp; Tyson vs. Ellicott. </em>If the appointment of the trustee is invalid by reason of defects in his schedules or lists of debtors, then the property would revert to and vest in the applicant, whereas the policy of the insolvent law is, to grasp the property for the benefit of creditors. 4 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>392, 393, <em>Glenn vs KarthaUs. </em>It is therefore submitted:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-5\">3rd. That from the time of the application of an insolvent debtor, his property is in the custody of the law for the benefit of his creditors, and for the protection of their interests the law requires the prompt appointment of a trustee; that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>appointment ought not to be delayed by a defect or irregularity' in the schedules, when there is substantially an offer by the applicant to surrender all his property for the benefit of his creditors, because such a surrender is ail that the policy of the insolvent law requires of him, and the creditors have ample protection against injury from such defect, in their right to file interrogatories, and prevent the discharge of the applicant if he does not satisfactorily explain and supply the defects and omissions of his schedules.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">4th.

That from this order the <em>trustee </em>had the right to appeal. The 23rd sec. of the Act of 1854, repeals expressly all the prior insolvent laws, and the 20th sec. declares, that <em>any person interested </em>may appeal from the decision of the court on <em>any question </em>under this Act. The trustee\u2019s right of appeal in such a case as this, is fully recognized by the case of <em>Salmon vs. </em>Pierson, 8 <em>Md.

That the power of the Court of Common Pleas, or its-commissioner, to appoint a trustee in iusolvencjp is a special and limited power, confined exclusively to cases and modes-prescribed by the Act of Assembly, and not capable of being rightfully exercised until after due performance of the conditions precedent, which the Act imposes. Whatever may have been the disposition of this court, where proceedings in insolvency have come incidentally in question, to relieve them from the operation of the rigid rule as to the proceedings of courts of limited jurisdiction, there has been no variation of that rule in respect to such proceedings before the insolvent courts themselves, and they are held, as all other special jurisdictions, to the course of procedure prescribed by the statutes' conferring their powers. 5 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 132, <em>Shivers </em>vs. <em>Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>son. 1 <em>Gill, </em>215, <em>Bowie vs. Jones. 2 H. &amp; G., 50, Raborg vs. Hammond. </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>241, <em>Powles vs. Dilley.

That the exhibition of \u201ca <em>list </em>of debts due from and owing to\u201d the applicant, \u201cwith the names of his debtors and creditors, all verified by affidavit,\u201d is a necessary <em>preliminary </em>to the right to appoint a trustee, under the Act of 1854. 12 <em>Wheat., </em>81, <em>U. S. Bank vs. Dandridge. </em>12 <em>Sergt. &amp; Rawle, </em>306, <em>Bank of Northern Liberties vs. Cresson. </em>Such requirements are not merely formal or unimportant, but arc founded upon a wise policy, and are essential matter of substance. If a list of the debtors be not filed, the court may, unknowingly, appoint the principal debtor trustee. If a list of the debts be omitted, those debts may be attached by any creditor, notwithstanding the application and appointment of the trustee, and the execution of a deed to him. By collusion between the applicant and a favored creditor, the latter might have his claims fully satisfied out of the debts not mentioned in the schedule, while the insolvent might obtain his discharge, notwithstanding his having given such preference. The opportunity for collusion would be doubled in the case of a trustee furnished with a list of the debts and debtors which is not, filed, and enabled thereby to point, out, to favored creditors, if corruptly disposed, the opportunity of seizing, perhaps, the most valuable assets. That no such possibility is practically supposable in the present, case, does not affect the principle or the importance of the conditions in question. <em>Act of </em>1854, <em>ch. </em>193, <em>secs. 1, 2, </em>15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\">3rd. That at the time the application was made, and the debts due Higgins were stated to be \u201cin the hands of trustee for the benefit of creditors,\u201d there was no such trustee in existence, and the allegation amounted to nothing more than a statement, that the lists required by law to be filed, before a trustee could be appointed, were not filed, but were retained in fho hands of the applicant\u2019s private counsel, or of the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>plicant himself. The allegation itself shows, that the failure to file lists was not a mere mistake, and arose out of no difficulty in the applicant\u2019s ascertaining the names of his debtors, or specifying what was due him, but was a voluntary and inexcusable omission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-4\">4th.

Teackle trustee, who gave a bond as such, which was approved, and received from the insolvent a deed of all his property. The trustee also filed the usual certificate, that he had received from the insolvent all his property and evidences of debt mentioned in his schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Subsequently, on the 2ist of April 1858, the appellees, as creditors of Higgins, filed their petition, charging, that he had filed his petition for the benefit of the insolvent law, but had not \u201cexhibited therewith,\u201d as required bylaw, \u201ca schedule of his property, and a list of the debts due from and owing to him, with the names of his debtors and creditors, all verified by affidavit.\u201d The appellees, in their petition, also objected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>to the appointment, of Mr. Tcackle as trustee; and prayed that the proceedings of the commissioner, and the appointment of the trustee, might be annulled and revoked, and the petition of Higgins be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">After the trustee had put in his answer, the court passed an order rescinding the appointment of the trustee, upon the ground of its having been prematurely made. By the same order, the application of Higgins was remanded to the commissioner, who was ordered and directed to appoint a trustee as if sufficient schedules and lists had been originally filed; provided Higgins should file full and sufficient schedules of his debts and credits, with full and sufficient lists of his debtors and creditors, under oath, and as far as he could ascertain the same, but not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Prom this order the trustee has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Higgins certainly failed to comply with the provisions of the Act, and his failure to do so ought to debar him from obtaining a release from his debts until he does comply with the requirements of the statute. Such, we think, was the design of the law, but we cannot suppose it ever was intended that such a failure on his part, should have the effect of rescinding the appointment of his trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">It is, manifestly, one of the main objects of the insolvent system to have the property of the applicant placed, promptly and securely, in the hands of a trustee, to be converted into money and distributed amongst the creditors as speedily as practicable. I\u00cd be is to be removed, merely because of the insolvent\u2019s non-compliance with the law, in the particulars mentioned, and no other trustee is to be appointed until the insolvent does comply, it will be allowing his misconduct to prejudice, delay and hinder the creditors, without any neglect or fault on their part, or that of the trustee. An interpretation of the law producing such consequences could not have been intended by the Legislature, nor would it be calculated to insure a compliance with its provisions. But a more reasonable interpretation, and much more likely to have the requirements of the Act complied with, would be to retain the trustee, and at the same time deny to the applicant a final discharge until he does comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The appellees, in their petition, also urged, as a reason for removing the trustee, that he \u201cdid not represent any of the creditors, but was counsel for the applicant.\u201d This, where, in other respects, the trustee is an unexceptionable person, cannot be a sufficient ground for rescinding the appointment, and ordering another trustee to be appointed only when the insolvent shall have \u201cfiled full and sufficient schedules of his debts and credits, with full and sufficient lists of his debtors and creditors, under oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">From what has been said, it will be seen, that we concur with the judge below in regard to so much of the order appealed from, as remanded the case to the commissioner for the purpose of giving the insolvent an opportunity of complying with the provisions of the Act of 1854. But we think the said order is erroneous, because it rescinded the appointment of the trustee. The decision will, therefore, be affirmed in part and reversed in part, with costs to the appellant, and the cause will be remanded, so that the principles announced in this opinion may be carried into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">One of the points presented by the counsel for the appellants is, \u201cThat the trustee has no right to appeal in this case, not being \u2018interested\u2019 in the sense of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">To sustain this view reference is made to <em>Rachel Colvin\u2019s </em>Estate, 3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>302. <em>Ellicott vs. Warford, </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>85. <em>Salmon, Trustee of Boon, vs. Pierson, </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., 297.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">In the first two of these cases the decisions were, that a receiver in chancery had no right to appeal from an order discharging him. In both cases the nature of his office is spoken of. In 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>the court say: \u201cThe appointment of a receiver does not determine any right, or affect the title of either party, in any manner whatever. He is the officer of the court, and truly the hand of the court. His holding is the holding of the court from him from whom the possession was taken. He is appointed on behalf of all the parties, and not of the plaintiff, or of one of the defendants only. His appointment is not to oust any party of his right of the possession of the property, but merely to retain it for the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>party who may ultimately appear to be entitled to it. And when that is ascertained the receiver will be considered as his receiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">in 3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>it is said: \u201cThe court must act by its officers and agents, and there is as much propriety in calling the court the representative of any of the parties to the cause, as its agents and oilicers, who derive their authority from the court, and are removable at its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The 2nd section of the Act of 1.854, declares expressly, that all the properly, of every description, of the insolvent, \u201cthe necessary wearing apparel and bedding of himself and family, or such property as may by law be exempted from execution, excepted,\u201d shall vest in the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">He, therefore, is not merely a receiver holding possession of the property, as the hand of the court, but the title is actually vested in him, in trust for the use and benefit of the creditors generally, although they may not appear to be parties to the proceedings in which he is appointed. A decision which denies to a receiver the right to appeal from an order discharging him does not necessarily warrant the conclusion, that the present appeal cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">In 8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>the claim of the appellee, against the insolvent estate was allowed by the auditor. The trustee excepted, which exception was overruled, and the court allowed the claim. The appeal of the trustee, from this decision, was dismissed upon the ground that the relation of the trustee to the estate did not authorize him to object to the <em>claims of creditors, </em>who might, if they pleased, litigate, <em>inter sese, </em>as actors, in reference to the same subject matter. The question there under consideration was, whether the claim of a creditor had been properly allowed in the distribution of the assets of the estate? Tn such a case, this court decided, the trustee could not appeal. It is there said, however, \u201cIf he has an interest, as trustee, in reference to his allowance for commissions and expenses, or as creditor of the insolvent, he has an equal right, with others, to object, to the distribution and to appeal.\u201d If he may appeal where a distribution injuriously affects his interests, \u201cin reference to his allowance for commissions,\u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>surely ought to be entitled to appeal from an order which erroneously rescinds his appointment, thereby depriving him of his trusteeship entirely.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b32-9\">(Decided June 16th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b32-5\"><em>Salmon, Trustee of Boon, vs. Pierson, </em>was an appeal under the Act of 1849, ch. 88, which the court held to embrace only, \u201cpersons aggrieved by the action of the court below.\u201d The present case comes before us under the 20th section of the Act of 1854, which provides, \u201cThat,any person interested may appeal from the decision of the court on any question under this act.\u201d This appeal presents <em>a ques- </em>\u2022 <em>&lt;Hon arising under that Act, </em>and we think the trustee is <em>interested </em>in the decision thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, and reversed in part, with costs to the appellant; and cause remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">LeGrand, C.
