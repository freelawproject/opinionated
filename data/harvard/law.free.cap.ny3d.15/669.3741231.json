He ultimately pleaded guilty to both weapons charges and unlicensed driving in full satisfaction of the indictment. In exchange for his guilty plea, defendant was promised prison terms of five years for each felony weapon charge and 15 days for unlicensed driving, all to run concurrently, and five years of postrelease supervision. At his plea hearing, Supreme Court informed defendant that he would be required to register as a gun offender pursuant to New York City\u2019s Gun Offender Registration Act (GORA).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">In January 2009, defendant appeared for sentencing. When asked by the sentencing court if the People had anything to say, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">\u201cYour Honor, the People rely on the promised sentence of five years in jail and five years [of] post-release supervision and Gun Offender Registration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201cAnd. I have provided . . . [the GORA] registration [form] to defense counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Defense counsel requested that defendant receive credit for time served, but did not otherwise object to the sentence as stated by the prosecutor. When the court pronounced defendant\u2019s sentence, it stated that he was subject to GORA and advised him of his obligations thereunder. At no time during the sentencing hearing did defendant challenge the legality of GORA or its application to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction and sentence, arguing for the first time that GORA was preempted by state law. The Appellate Division, First Department, unanimously affirmed, concluding that \u201cthe registration and other requirements of GORA are not part of the sentence, or otherwise part of the judgment. Instead, they are analogous to the requirements of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), and a SORA determination . . . may not be reviewed on an appeal from a criminal judgment\u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>69 AD3d 450, 450-451 [1st Dept 2010]). Thus, the Court stated, it was affirming the judgment of conviction and sentence \u201con the ground that no reviewable issue ha[d] been raised\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 451).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Based on the New York City Council\u2019s finding that gun offenders pose \u201cunique dangers\u201d to the citizens of New York City, the City Council, effective March 24, 2007, adopted GORA, a regulatory scheme to monitor gun offenders residing within the city <em>(see </em>Council of City of NY Intro No. 362, Comm on Pub Safety, Rep of Governmental Affairs Div, Background [June 27, 2006]; Local Law No. 29 [2006] of City of NY). GORA states that a person convicted of specified gun offenses in a court in New York City is a \u201cgun offender\u201d subject to registration with the New York Police Department (NYPD) <em>(see </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 10-602 [d], [e]). Among other things, GORA requires that a gun offender register at the time sentence is imposed <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10-603 [a]) and personally appear at the NYPD Gun Offender Monitoring Unit within 48 hours of the date of conviction or the date of release from prison, whichever is later <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10-603 [d]). Failure to comply with GORA requirements is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine up to $1,000 and/or up to one year of imprisonment <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10-608).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The threshold question on this appeal is whether GORA registration is subject to appellate review pursuant to CPL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>450.10. \u201cAppealability of determinations adverse to a defendant cannot be presumed because \u2018a defendant\u2019s right to appeal within the criminal procedure universe is purely statutory\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Nieves, </em>2 NY3d 310, 314 [2004]). As relevant here, Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 450.10 \u201cauthorizes a defendant to appeal from a judgment in a criminal case, which brings up for review many of the orders and rulings that precede or are part of it\u201d <em>(Nieves </em>at 314). A judgment is \u201ccomprised of a conviction and the sentence imposed thereon and is completed by imposition and entry of the sentence\u201d (CPL 1.20 [15]).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In <em>People v Stevens </em>(91 NY2d 270 [1998]) and <em>People v Kearns </em>(95 NY2d 816 [2000]), we held that the registration and notification requirements of SORA\u2014regardless whether the specific risk level determination was made at the time of sentencing or post-judgment\u2014are not a \u201ctraditional, technical or integral part of a sentence\u201d that becomes incorporated within the judgment of conviction <em>(Stevens, </em>91 NY2d at 276; <em>Kearns, </em>95 NY2d at 818).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, SORA registration and notification requirements are not reviewable on direct appeal from a judgment of conviction and are not individually appealable within the criminal proceeding <em>(Kearns, </em>95 NY2d at 818).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">We agree with the Appellate Division that GORA\u2019s registration and notice requirements, like SORA\u2019s, are not a \u201ctraditional, technical or integral\u201d part of defendant\u2019s sentence or subsumed within the judgment of conviction. Notably, neither the Penal Law nor the Criminal Procedure Law directs or authorizes a sentencing court to impose GORA registration as part of a defendant\u2019s sentence. If the sentencing court here had omitted advising defendant of his obligation to register as a gun offender, defendant would have nonetheless remained obligated to register under the terms of GORA <em>(see </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 10-603 [a] [\u201cA gun offender shall register with the department at the time sentence is imposed\u201d]). In other words, pursuant to the terms of GORA, the registration of a gun offender is an administrative matter between the City of New York, the NYPD, and the offender, not a component of a gun offender\u2019s sentence to be imposed by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Nieves </em>(2 NY3d 310 [2004]) and <em>People v Hernandez </em>(93 NY2d 261 [1999]) is misplaced. In both cases, we concluded that the matter sought to be appealed\u2014initial certification as a sex offender by the trial court upon conviction and orders of protection issued during a sentencing proceeding\u2014were part of the judgment of conviction and therefore appealable (Nieves, 2 NY3d at 312; <em>Hernandez, </em>93 NY2d at 267-268). Significantly, in both cases, the challenged issues were \u201cactually and temporally\u201d part of the judgment of conviction <em>(Hernandez, </em>93 NY2d at 270; <em>see also Nieves, 2 </em>NY3d at 315 [\u201cCPL 530.13 (4) authorizes a court to issue permanent orders of protection for the benefit of victims and witnesses \u2018(u)pon conviction of any offense.\u2019 By using this language, the Legislature signaled that orders of protection issued at sentencing are part of the final adjudication of the criminal action involving defendant\u201d]). Moreover, certification as a sex offender upon conviction and orders of protection issued at the time of sentencing are made part of the order of commitment, which is incorporated into the certificate of conviction (see <em>e.g. Kearns, </em>95 NY2d at 818). Notably, the GORA registration and notice requirements do not appear on defendant\u2019s \u201cUniform Sentence and Commitment\u201d form, further supporting our conclusion that such requirements are not part of a defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In short, like SORA registration and notice requirements,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> GORA registration and accompanying notice requirements cannot be deemed a technical or integral part of a defendant\u2019s sentence nor be incorporated into the judgment of conviction. Accordingly, GORA registration is not reviewable on direct appeal from a judgment in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Defendant further argues that GORA is preempted by Executive Law \u00a7 259-a. Because we conclude, as did the Appellate Division, that the imposition of GORA registration is not reviewable on direct appeal, we need not reach that argument. We observe, however, that there are appropriate means by which GORA could be challenged as preempted by state law, including a CPLR article 78 proceeding or a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">. After <em>Stevens </em>was decided, the Legislature amended SORA to provide the People and the defendant the right to take a civil appeal challenging a risk level determination <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 168-d [3], as amended by L 1999, ch 453, \u00a7 6; <em>see also Kearns, </em>95 NY2d at 818).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">. The distinction between SORA registration and notice requirements, which we have held to be not part of a judgment of conviction and thus not appealable, and the initial certification as a sex offender by the trial court upon conviction, which we have held comprises part of a sentence, is clearly articulated in <em>People v Hernandez </em>(93 NY2d at 270).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
