Mitchell was arrested in Essex County and charged with driving while intoxicated <em>(see</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 [2], [3]), which was elevated to a felony on account of his misdemeanor conviction of this same crime in June 2000 <em>(see </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1193 [1] [c]); aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the first degree, also a felony <em>(see </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 511 [3]); and speeding. On November 25, 2003, he pleaded guilty in the County Court of Essex County (Essex County Court) to felony driving while intoxicated and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the second degree, a misdemeanor <em>(see </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 511 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Defendant was sentenced to 15 weekends in jail, as well as five and three years of probation on the driving while intoxicated and aggravated unlicensed operation charges, respectively, to run concurrently. Essex County Court transferred supervision of defendant\u2019s probation to Franklin County, where he resided, as required by Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 410.80 (1). This statute directs that \u201c[w]here a probationer <em>at the time of sentencing </em>resides in another jurisdiction within the state, the sentencing court <em>shall transfer </em>supervision to the appropriate probation department in such other jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In February 2008, defendant brought a motion pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7\u00a7 440.10 and 440.20 in Essex County Court, seeking to set aside his 2003 felony conviction and sentence for driving while intoxicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He asserted two grounds: that there was no information in various governmental databases containing his criminal and driving history of any conviction in June 2000 for driving while intoxicated, the predicate for his felony conviction of the same crime on November 25, 2003; and ineffective assistance of counsel. On June 11, 2008, Essex County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The judge reasoned that he did not have jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s Criminal Procedure Law article 440 motion in light of Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 410.80 (2), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cTransfer of powers. Upon completion of transfer as authorized pursuant to [Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 410.80 (1)], the probation department in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>receiving jurisdiction shall assume all powers and duties of the probation department in the jurisdiction of the sentencing court. Upon completion of transfer, <em>the appropriate court within the jurisdiction of the receiving probation department shall assume all powers and duties of the sentencing court and shall have sole jurisdiction in the case </em>including jurisdiction over matters specified in article twenty-three of the correction law.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Further, the sentencing court shall immediately forward its entire case record to the receiving court\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Thus, Essex County Court concluded, only the County Court of Franklin County (Franklin County Court) could exercise jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s Criminal Procedure Law article 440 motion because Franklin County Court was, in the words of section 410.80 (2), \u201cthe appropriate court within the jurisdiction of the receiving probation department,\u201d which \u201cassume[s] all powers and duties of the sentencing court\u201d and possesses \u201csole jurisdiction in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In May 2009, the Appellate Division affirmed Essex County Court\u2019s decision and order. The court held that Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 410.80 (2) was \u201cexplicit in entrusting \u2018all powers and duties of the sentencing court\u2019 upon the court to which the matter has been transferred\u201d (62 AD3d 1045, 1046 [3d Dept 2009]). While acknowledging that \u201clogistical problems . . . [might] result\u201d from its decision, the Appellate Division nonetheless determined that \u201conce supervision of defendant was transferred to Franklin County, the Essex County Court no longer had jurisdiction to entertain defendant\u2019s CPL article 440 motion\u201d <em>(id.). </em>A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">This case boils down to whether section 410.80 (2) encompasses \u201call powers and duties\u201d that might be exercised by a sentencing court under article 410 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which governs probation, conditional discharge and parole supervision, or \u201call powers and duties\u201d possessed by a sentencing court more generally, including powers and duties under Criminal Procedure Law article 440, which covers postjudgment motions. The answer is not clear from the statute\u2019s text.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Section 410.80 (2) is embedded in article 410, and the Legislature did not, for example, choose to transfer \u201call powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and duties\u201d of the sentencing court to the receiving court \u201cnotwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,\u201d the verbal formulation frequently employed for legislative directives intended to preempt any other potentially conflicting statute, wherever found in the State\u2019s laws. And here, section 410.80 (2)\u2014when read to vest jurisdiction for Criminal Procedure Law article 440 motions in the receiving court\u2014seemingly clashes with Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7\u00a7 440.10 and 440.20. These provisions direct the court in which judgment was entered\u2014i.e., the sentencing court\u2014to entertain a defendant\u2019s postjudgment motion to vacate a judgment (section 440.10) or sentence (section 440.20).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Of course, the Legislature when writing section 410.80 (2) also might have specified that this provision transferred to the receiving court \u201call powers and duties\u201d of the sentencing court \u201cunder this article.\u201d And while the Legislature vested \u201csole jurisdiction in the case\u201d in the receiving court <em>\u201cincluding </em>jurisdiction over matters specified in article twenty-three of the correction law\u201d (emphasis added), it made no comparable reference in section 410.80 (2) to article 440 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Because different interpretations of the scope of the transfer effected by section 410.80 (2) are plausible, we now turn to its legislative history <em>(see Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577, 583-584 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The Legislature amended subdivisions (1) and (2) of section 410.80 in 2007, in a bill introduced at the behest of the Division of Probation and Correctional Alternatives, to \u201caddress[ ] problems associated with the intrastate transfer of probationers\u201d (Introducer\u2019s Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 191, at 5, 2007 NY Legis Ann, at 125). With reference to the courts, the introducer\u2019s memorandum described in detail the problems that the Legislature sought to cure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cUnder current law, a sentencing court may make a complete transfer of jurisdiction over a probationer, or it may retain its powers and duties with respect to a probationer whose supervision is being transferred to another jurisdiction. The sentencing court may retain the powers enumerated in Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7\u00a7 410.20 (Modification or Enlargement of Conditions), 410.30 (Declaration of Delinquency), 410.40 (Notice to Appear, Warrant), 410.50(3) (Search Order), and 410.60 (Appearance Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>- Court), even when all supervision is performed by the probation department in the receiving jurisdiction. Even in cases where the sending court has retained jurisdiction, it is the responsibility of the probation department in the receiving jurisdiction to initiate violation proceedings with the receiving court if there is reasonable cause to believe that a probationer has violated a condition of his or her sentence. In such instances, the receiving court may transfer the case back to the sentencing court or it may conduct a violation of probation hearing and continue or modify the sentence if appropriate. However, if the sending court has retained its powers and duties over the case, the court in the receiving jurisdiction may not revoke the sentence of probation. Instead, if the court in the receiving jurisdiction sustains the violation and chooses not to continue or modify the sentence, the receiving court must return the probationer to the sending jurisdiction for further legal action\u201d (Introducer\u2019s Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 191, at 5-6, 2007 NY Legis Ann, at 125-126).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">This potential for divided judicial authority over probation matters created \u201cconsiderable confusion in [the] handling and reporting of cases and duplication of efforts between the sending and receiving jurisdictions\u201d (Introducer\u2019s Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 191, at 6, 2007 NY Legis Ann, at 126; <em>see also </em>Mem to David Nocenti, Counsel to Governor, from Linda J. Valenti, Counsel, Div of Probation and Correctional Alternatives, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 191, at 11 [\u201cCurrent law has . . . led to considerable confusion among practitioners and members of the judiciary in terms of powers retained and limited\u201d]). The transfer of \u201call powers and duties of the sentencing court\u201d to the receiving court was designed to reduce this uncertainty and enable probation officers to supervise probationers more efficiently: \u201c[t]his legislation will ensure that the courts in the sending jurisdiction are not handling probation cases that are being supervised in another county, and that the courts in the receiving jurisdiction are not constrained in their ability to administer such cases properly and efficiently\u201d (Introducer\u2019s Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 191, at 6, 2007 NY Legis Ann, at 126).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In sum, the amendments to section 410.80 (2) were meant to transfer from sentencing courts to receiving courts the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>range of powers and duties necessary for the judiciary to carry out its responsibilities to enforce the terms and conditions of probationers, and to deal with relief from forfeitures and disabilities. There is no suggestion in the statute\u2019s text or legislative history that the Legislature intended, in addition, to divest sentencing courts of their jurisdiction under article 440 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the case remitted to County Court for further proceedings on defendant\u2019s Criminal Procedure Law article 440 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">. Transfer of probation is discretionary where the probationer, <em>after </em>the probation sentence has been pronounced, desires to reside in a jurisdiction in the state not served by the sentencing court <em>(see </em>CPL 410.80 [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-10\">. In April 2008, defendant filed a supplemental motion that sought to vacate his conviction and sentence for aggravated unlicensed operation, too.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\">. Article 23 governs discretionary relief from forfeitures and disabilities automatically imposed by law, such as a certificate of relief from disabilities, which may be issued by a court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
