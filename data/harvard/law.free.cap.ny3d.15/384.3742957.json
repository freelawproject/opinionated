The summons with notice was apparently served on defendant on February 5, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">On February 25, 2008, defendant served Goodman with a notice of appearance and a demand for a complaint. When the demand did not prompt a response, defendant on April 22, 2008 moved to dismiss the action pursuant to CPLR 3012 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">By letter dated May 6, 2008, attorney Preston Leschins informed defendant\u2019s professional liability insurance carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that his office had been \u201cconsulted\u201d by plaintiff \u201cin connection with\u201d plaintiffs claim \u201cwith a view towards substituting for\u201d Goodman. The letter characterized Goodman as plaintiffs \u201cformer counsel\u201d who was \u201cno longer practicing law.\u201d Leschins asked for \u201cthe opportunity to speak with\u201d the carrier about \u201cresolution [of the matter] in an amicable fashion,\u201d and at the carrier\u2019s \u201cearliest convenience.\u201d Plaintiff was copied on this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">On May 23, 2008\u2014the motion\u2019s return date\u2014defendant\u2019s counsel had a conversation with Goodman, \u201cwho advised that he had been suspended from the practice of law months earlier\u201d; at Goodman\u2019s request, defendant\u2019s counsel agreed to adjourn the motion to dismiss until June 13, 2008. Later that day, he spoke to Leschins, \u201cwho confirmed that he had consulted with plaintiff weeks earlier,\u201d but \u201crefused to state whether he would be appearing as attorney for plaintiff\u2019 in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On or near the adjourned return date, Goodman\u2014indicating that he was mindful that his license had been \u201csuspended on or about January 24, 2008\u201d and was therefore \u201cbeing careful not to practice law\u201d\u2014submitted a \u201cfactual\u201d affidavit in opposition to the motion to dismiss. Styling himself as plaintiffs \u201cformer attorney,\u201d Goodman stated that he had \u201cadvised [his] former client in writing of [his] situation and told him to get new counsel\u201d; however, he did not say when he did this. Goodman further represented that he \u201c[understood] that [plaintiff had] been diligently pursuing new counsel,\u201d but had \u201cnot yet retained a new attorney\u201d and was \u201cstill continuing to look for a new lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Goodman explained that the summons with notice was served after his suspension because it had been given to the process server beforehand; he annexed to his affidavit a draft complaint that he claimed to have prepared prior to his suspension. The draft complaint alleged that defendant\u2019s predecessor law firm had represented plaintiff \u201cin a lawsuit involving [his] efforts to purchase real property in Yonkers, NY,\u201d which was dismissed pursuant to CPLR 3216 for want of prosecution. Goodman asked the court to deny defendant\u2019s motion \u201cin the interests of justice,\u201d and to grant plaintiff 30 days to finalize the complaint with a new attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">On June 19, 2008, Supreme Court granted the motion and dismissed the action for nonservice of the complaint, observing that plaintiff had neither demonstrated a meritorious cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>action nor proffered a reasonable excuse for his default, as was required in order to forestall dismissal under CPLR 3012 (b). The judge noted that plaintiff had neglected to submit an affidavit of merits; further, although plaintiff had \u201clearned from Mr. Goodman on or about the end of January, 2008 of Mr. Goodman\u2019s suspension and plaintiffs need to retain new counsel,\u201d he did not make \u201cany efforts to retain new counsel before the lapsing of the statutory period during which [he] was required to serve his complaint.\u201d Finally, Supreme Court declined to allow plaintiff a brief period of time to retain new counsel on the ground he had already enjoyed a grace period of \u201capproximately five months after his first having been [apprised] by Mr. Goodman of his need to do [this].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On appeal, plaintiff was represented by counsel. His new attorney invoked CPLR 321 (c), which mandates that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201c[i]f an attorney dies, becomes physically or mentally incapacitated, or is removed, suspended or otherwise becomes disabled at any time before judgment, no further proceeding shall be taken in the action against the party for whom he appeared, without leave of the court, until thirty days after notice to appoint another attorney has been served upon that party either personally or in such manner as the court directs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">On May 12, 2009, the Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court\u2019s order, concluding that the trial court \u201cdid not improvidently exercise its discretion in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action\u201d (62 AD3d 765, 765 [2d Dept 2009]). The court observed that because \u201cplaintiffs contention that the action was stayed pursuant to CPLR 321 (c) [was] raised for the first time on appeal,\u201d it \u201c[was] not properly before [the Appellate Division].\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>We subsequently granted plaintiff permission to appeal, and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The command of CPLR 321 (c) is straightforward: if an attorney becomes disabled, <em>\u201cno further proceeding </em>shall be taken in the action against the party for whom he appeared, without leave of the court, until thirty days after notice to appoint another attorney has been served upon that party either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>personally or in such manner as the court directs\u201d (emphasis added). As the Practice Commentaries explain, CPLR 321 (c) brings about \u201can automatic stay of the action,\u201d which \u201cgoes into effect with respect to the party for whom the [disabled] attorney appeared\u201d (Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C321:3, at 183).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">\u201c[d]uring the stay imposed by CPLR 321(c), no proceedings against the party will have any adverse effect. It lies within the power of the other side to bring the stay to an end by serving a notice on the affected party to appoint new counsel within 30 days ... If, at the end of the period, the party has failed to obtain new counsel (or elected to proceed pro se), the proceedings may continue against the party\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The stay is meant to \u201cafford a litigant, who has, through no act or fault of his own, been deprived of the services of his counsel, a reasonable opportunity to obtain new counsel before further proceedings are taken against him in the action\u201d <em>(Hendry v Hilton, </em>283 App Div 168, 171 [2d Dept 1953] [discussing Civil Practice Act \u00a7 240, the predecessor statute to CPLR 321 (c)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">This lawsuit was automatically stayed by operation of CPLR 321 (c) on January 24, 2008, the date when plaintiffs attorney was suspended from the practice of law. Defendant never acted to lift the stay by serving a notice upon plaintiff to appoint new counsel within 30 days. Thus, Supreme Court\u2019s order dismissing the action must be vacated <em>(see e.g. Galletta v Siu-Mei Yip, </em>271 AD2d 486, 486 [2d Dept 2000] [\u201cSince the judgment entered upon the defendants\u2019 default in appearing at trial was obtained without the plaintiffs compliance with CPLR 321 (c), it must be vacated\u201d]; <em>McGregor v McGregor, </em>212 AD2d 955, 956 [3d Dept 1995] [\u201cThe record reveals no compliance with the leave or notice requirements of CPLR 321 (c). The appropriate remedy for a violation of CPLR 321 (c) is vacatur of the judgment\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Defendant resists this outcome on two grounds. First, he points out that CPLR 321 (c) permits further proceedings by \u201cleave of the court.\u201d Defendant contends that Supreme Court exercised this \u201cexpress statutory authority to hear and grant</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss after [Goodman] was suspended from the practice of law.\u201d The drafter\u2019s notes on CPLR 321 (c), however, state that the words \u201cwithout leave of the court\u201d were \u201cdesigned to allow the court to vary the [30-day] rule in cases where the stay of proceedings would produce undue hardship to the opposing party, as where the time to take an appeal or other action would run or where a provisional remedy is sought and speed is essential\u201d (4th Preliminary Rep of Advisory Comm on Prac and Pro, 1960 NY Legis Doc No. 20, at 191). No remotely comparable situation existed at the time Supreme Court dismissed this action. Moreover, Supreme Court did not mention CPLR 321 (c), much less articulate a basis for exercising its discretion to relax the 30-day notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Second, defendant argues that plaintiff is foreclosed from bringing up CPLR 321 (c) for the first time on appeal, as the Appellate Division concluded. While we do not as a general rule resolve cases on grounds not raised in the trial court, the context here is unusual. We are dealing with a statute intended to protect litigants faced with the unexpected loss of legal representation. And there is no indication in this record that plaintiff sought to raise CPLR 321 (c) only after having conducted his lawsuit pro se for some period of time after his attorney became disabled <em>(cf. Telmark, Inc. v </em>Mills, 199 AD2d 579, 580-581 [3d Dept 1993]). As a general rule, unrepresented litigants should not be penalized for failing to alert a trial court to the existence of an automatic stay created for the very purpose of safeguarding them against adverse consequences while they are unrepresented. And as the Practice Commentaries point out, all it takes to end the automatic stay is service of a 30-day notice on the affected party.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the complaint reinstated, and the case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\">. As noted previously, the record reveals that Goodman was suspended from the practice of law in late January 2008, but not the date when Goodman advised plaintiff of the suspension, or whether or when plaintiff may have otherwise learned about Goodman\u2019s disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\">. Plaintiff suggests that Supreme Court \u201clost jurisdiction\u201d upon Goodman\u2019s suspension; however, the statute says that the disability of a party\u2019s attorney creates an automatic stay\u2014not that it divests the court of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
