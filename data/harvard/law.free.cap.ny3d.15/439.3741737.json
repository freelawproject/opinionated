When her mother objected and attempted to block the door, Jazm\u00edn grabbed a kitchen knife with a six-inch blade, and threatened that \u201c[n]o one is going to touch me.\u201d As Jazm\u00edn tried to fight her way past her mother, her stepfather intervened. Before he succeeded in wresting the knife away from her, though, Jazm\u00edn grazed his shoulder with the blade; she also bit her stepfather\u2019s arm and chest, causing him to bleed. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where his bite wounds were treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">On February 25, 2008, the presentment agency filed a petition asserting that Jazmin\u2019s acts, described above as recounted in her stepfather\u2019s supporting affidavit, would, if committed by an adult, constitute various assault and weapons and menacing offenses. On February 29, 2008, Family Court adjudicated Jazm\u00edn delinquent upon her admission that she committed an act constituting unlawful possession of a weapon by a person under the age of 16, in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 265.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>During the dispositional hearing on March 26, 2008, the judge asked Jazmin\u2019s mother whether she was willing for Jazm\u00edn to remain in her home. The mother answered that she was so long as Jazm\u00edn attended school and did not \u201cstay or sleep out of the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The following colloquy ensued between the judge and Jazm\u00edn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cthe court: Jazm\u00edn, do you understand that if I put you on probation, I\u2019m going to keep a very tight [rein] on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201c[jazm\u00edn]: I understand that, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u201cthe court: I\u2019m going to have you come in to court for reports. If I get a report that you are not cooperating with the probation, that you\u2019re not keeping your curfew, that you are staying out overnight, or that you\u2019re not going to school, you\u2019re going to quickly find yourself in detention and on your way to a placement [upstate]. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\u201c[jazm\u00edn]: Yes, I understand that, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Family Court placed Jazm\u00edn in the Bronx Juvenile Accountability Court (JAC) program for a 12-month period of probation. While in existence, JAC matched troubled youths with an array of supportive services, such as counseling, tutoring and drug treatment, as an alternative to residential placement. Unlike regular probation, JAC participants appeared regularly in Family Court for the judge to check on their progress. The order and conditions of probation imposed by Family Court required that Jazm\u00edn report to and cooperate with her probation officer; obey the lawful commands of her parents; observe curfew; attend school regularly; submit to drug and alcohol testing; and comply with the recommendations of a mental health assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Jazm\u00edn arrived late to Family Court on April 16, 2008 for her first monitoring hearing. The Department of Probation\u2019s report was not favorable. Of the 13 school days since her probation began, Jazm\u00edn missed eight and was late twice. According to her mother, Jazm\u00edn \u201cstay[ed] out all night without permission and [might] come home once or twice a week.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, Family Court remanded Jazm\u00edn to the custody of the Commissioner of Juvenile Justice because she \u201cwas choosing not to comply with the conditions of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>probation.\u201d Jazm\u00edn\u2019s law guardian objected to the remand on the ground that the Department of Probation had not filed a violation of probation (VOP) petition. The judge scheduled another hearing to be held nine days later, on April 25, 2008, \u201cfor probation to take whatever further steps they believe [d] [to be] appropriate.\u201d Jazm\u00edn appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On May 19, 2009, the Appellate Division unanimously reversed and vacated Family Court\u2019s April 16, 2008 order of detention. The court held that \u201c[hjaving issued an order of disposition placing [Jazmin] on probation, the Family Court lacked authority to remand her to detention in the absence of a violation of probation petition\u201d (62 AD3d 526, 527 [1st Dept 2009]). By the time the Appellate Division handed down its decision, the Department of Probation had long since pursued a VOP petition, resulting in a new order of disposition on June 6, 2008, which placed Jazmin on 12 months of probation under the auspices of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services\u2019 Juvenile Justice Initiative, another community-based alternative to residential placement. The court noted that it nonetheless decided Jazmin\u2019s appeal because, although moot, the issue presented was \u201csubstantial and novel\u201d and \u201clikely to recur and evade review\u201d <em>(id.)</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Appellate Division subsequently granted the presentment agency leave to appeal to us, certifying the following question: \u201cWas the order of this Court, which reversed the order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the Family Court, properly made?\u201d After sua sponte examining our subject matter jurisdiction, we invoke the exception to the mootness doctrine for the same reasons cited by the Appellate Division and retain jurisdiction. We now answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Article 3 of the Family Court Act spells out specific junctures in a delinquency proceeding when Family Court may remand a juvenile to detention\u2014i.e., after a prepetition hearing is held in anticipation of the filing of a juvenile delinquency petition (Family Ct Act \u00a7 307.4 [4] [c]); at the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d after a petition has been filed and \u201cany adjournments thereof\u2019 (Family Ct Act \u00a7 320.1; see <em>also </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 320.4 [2] [specifying what the court shall determine at the initial appearance]); after a probable cause hearing is held (Family Ct Act \u00a7 325.3 [3]); and after a VOP petition is filed (Family Ct Act \u00a7 360.3 [2] [b]). Because the Legislature did not similarly empower Family Court to order detention of a juvenile probationer before the filing of a VOP petition, we are unwilling to imply such authority in the absence of a statutory peg, as the presentment agency asks us to do. As Jazmin points out, \u201cit is odd to suggest . . . that the Legislature intended to permit detention before a [VOP] petition has been filed when it enacted an express provision [i.e., section 360.3 (2) (b)] providing [for] a juvenile [to] be detained after a [VOP] petition is filed.\u201d Indeed, if Family Court possesses inherent authority to order detention at any time during the period of probation, section 360.3 (2) (b) would seem to be unnecessary. Moreover, while the presentment agency correctly points out that Family Court retains jurisdiction over a juvenile probationer until probation ends <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 360.1; <em>Matter of Markim Q., </em>7 NY3d 405 [2006]), continuing jurisdiction does not vest Family Court with the power to take actions not authorized by article 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The presentment agency also seems to suggest that Jazm\u00edn consented to detention, pointing to Family Court\u2019s statement at the dispositional hearing that a poor probation report meant that she would \u201cquickly find [her]self in detention,\u201d followed by Jazmin\u2019s acknowledgment that she understood. This brief exchange does not amount to a waiver of a VOP petition, assuming that such a waiver could be obtained from a minor in Jazmin\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Finally, the presentment agency argues that the monitoring hearing in this case was an \u201cadjournment\u201d of the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d within the meaning of Family Court Act \u00a7 320.1,</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>which states that \u201c[w]hen used in this article [3,] \u2018initial appearance\u2019 means the proceeding on the date the respondent first appears before the court after a petition has been filed and any adjournments thereof, for the purposes specified in section 320.4.\u201d As the Appellate Division correctly noted, however, a court appearance for checking up on compliance with probation cannot be an \u201cadjournment\u201d of the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d on the underlying juvenile delinquency petition once a dispositional order has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\"> The Appellate Division explicitly declined to decide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201cthe hypothetical questions of whether [a properly made] motion under Family Court Act \u00a7 355.1 to stay, modify or terminate an order of probation based on change of circumstances would provide an [alternative] means of initiating proceedings to revoke probation, and whether detention would be authorized pending resolution of such a motion\u201d (62 AD3d at 527), presumably because Family Court did not purport to act pursuant to this provision and the issue was not properly presented for appellate review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Section 355.1 (1) (b) specifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201c[u]pon a showing of a substantial change of circumstances, the court may on its own motion <em>or </em>on motion of the respondent <em>or </em>his parent <em>or </em>person responsible for his care: . . . stay execution of, set aside, modify, terminate or vacate any order issued in the course of a proceeding under this article\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Section 355.1 (3) further provides that \u201c[i]f the court issues a new order of disposition under this section the date such order expires shall not be later than the expiration date of the original order.\u201d Finally, a motion for relief under section 355.1 must be pursued in accordance with the procedures specified in section 355.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
