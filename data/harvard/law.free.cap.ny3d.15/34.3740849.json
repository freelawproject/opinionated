Co., Inc. v Admiral Ins. Co., </em>10 NY3d 411 [2008]). The City of New York engaged URS Corporation (URS) as the construction manager for a renovation project at Rikers Island. By written agreement dated March 22, 1999, URS hired plaintiff Regal Construction Corporation (Regal) to serve as a prime contractor for general construction at the project, including demolition and renovation. The written agreement between Regal and URS required Regal to procure a commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policy naming URS as an additional insured. Accordingly, Regal obtained a CGL insurance policy from plaintiff Insurance Corporation of New York (INSCORP), which named URS as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d The policy provided that Regal\u2019s insurance covered URS \u201conly with respect to liability <em>arising out of </em>[Regal\u2019s] ongoing operations performed for [URS]\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In March 2001, Regal\u2019s project manager, Ronald LeClair, was walking through the facility with Regal\u2019s superintendent and an employee of Regal\u2019s demolition subcontractor. Because the area was in the process of demolition, the flooring consisted of temporary sheets of plywood spread over steel floor joists. LeClair stepped from the plywood onto a floor joist to indicate a wall that needed to be demolished. According to LeClair, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>joist on which he stepped had been recently painted and the paint caused him to slip, resulting in a back injury. LeClair claimed that an unnamed person from URS told him that URS employees had painted the joist.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">In 2003, LeClair commenced a personal injury action against the City and URS. While LeClair did not name his employer, Regal, as a defendant, URS forwarded a copy of the complaint to Regal and its insurer, INSCOR1] demanding a defense and indemnification based on the additional insured clause of the CGL policy. In April 2003, INSCORP informed URS by letter that it was reviewing the incident, and reserved its right to disclaim coverage at a later date if it determined that URS was not entitled to coverage under the policy. INSCORP thereafter accepted URS\u2019s tender of its defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, however, Regal and INSCORP commenced this declaratory judgment action against URS and its insurer, National Union Fire Insurance Company, seeking a declaration that URS was not entitled to coverage as Em additional insured under the INSCORP policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Supreme Court granted judgment in favor of URS and its insurer, concluding that LeClair\u2019s injury arose out of Regal\u2019s work (19 Misc 3d 1122[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 50816[U]). Regal and INSCORP appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting (64 AD3d 461 [2009]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">An insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured is \u201c \u2018exceedingly broad\u2019 \u201d <em>(BP A. C. Corp. v One Beacon Ins. Group, </em>8 NY3d 708, 714 [2007], quoting <em>Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford v Cook, </em>7 NY3d 131, 137 [2006]). An \u201cinsurer will be called upon to provide a defense whenever the allegations of the complaint suggest ... a reasonable possibility of coverage\u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Cook, </em>7 NY3d at 137 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cIf [a] compMnt contains any facts or allegations which bring the claim even potentially within the protection purchased, the insurer is obligated to defend\u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Technicon Elecs. Corp. v American Home Assur. Co., </em>74 NY2d 66, 73 [1989] [internal quotation marks omitted]). This standard applies equally to additional insureds and named insureds <em>(see id. </em>at 714-715, citing <em>Pecker Iron Works of N.Y. v Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>99 NY2d 391, 393 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The additional insured endorsement at issue here provides that URS is an additional insured under the CGL policy issued by INSCORP to Regal \u201conly with respect to liability arising out of [Regal\u2019s] ongoing operations.\u201d We have interpreted the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d in an additional insured clause to mean \u201coriginating from, incident to, or having connection with\u201d <em>(Maroney v New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>5 NY3d 467, 472 [2005] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). It requires \u201conly that there be some causal relationship between the injury and the risk for which coverage is provided\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Here, Regal\u2019s employee, LeClair, was walking through the work site to indicate additional walls that needed to be demolished by Regal\u2019s subcontractor when he slipped on a recently-painted metal joist. Although Regal and INSCORP contend that LeClair\u2019s injury did not arise from Regal\u2019s demolition and renovation operations performed for URS, but that it was URS employees who painted the joist on which LeClair slipped, the focus of the inquiry \u201cis not on the precise cause of the accident but the general nature of the operation in the course of which the injury was sustained\u201d <em>(Worth, </em>10 NY3d at 416 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Accordingly, the injury \u201car[ose] out of\u2019 Regal\u2019s operations notwithstanding URS\u2019s alleged negligence, and fell within the scope of the additional insured clause of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Regal and INSCORP\u2019s reliance on <em>Worth </em>to argue otherwise is misplaced. In that case, a subcontractor, Pacific Steel, Inc. (Pacific), hired to install stairs at a construction project, obtained a CGL policy naming the general contractor, Worth Construction Co. (Worth), as an additional insured <em>(id. </em>at 413). After Pacific completed the initial installation, it turned the project over to Worth, who hired a different subcontractor to pour cement over the steel stair \u201cpans.\u201d After the cement was poured, Pacific was to return to install handrails. However, prior to Pacific\u2019s return to the job site, an employee of a different subcontractor slipped and fell on fireproofing which had been installed by yet a third subcontractor <em>(see id. </em>at 413-414). Pacific played no role in the installation of the fireproofing. Worth sought to invoke the protection of the additional insured clause of the CGL policy procured by Pacific, but we rejected Worth\u2019s argument that the injury arose out of Pacific\u2019s operations. Specifically, we explained that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">\u201cevident that the general nature of Pacific\u2019s opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tions involved the installation of a staircase and handrails. An entirely separate company was responsible for applying the fireproofing material. At the time of the accident, Pacific was not on the job site, having completed construction of the stairs, and was awaiting word from Worth before returning to affix the handrails\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 416).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">We went on to characterize the staircase as \u201cmerely the situs of the accident,\u201d concluding that there was no connection between the accident and Pacific\u2019s work <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">This case is factually distinct from <em>Worth. </em>Here, there was a connection between the accident and Regal\u2019s work, as the injury was sustained by Regal\u2019s own employee while he supervised and gave instructions to a subcontractor regarding work to be performed. That the underlying complaint alleges negligence on the part of URS and not Regal is of no consequence, as URS\u2019s potential liability for LeClair\u2019s injury \u201car[ose] out of\u2019 Regal\u2019s operation and, thus, URS is entitled to a defense and indemnification according to the terms of the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\">. A third-party action commenced by URS against Regal was discontinued in March 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">. During the pendency of this action, the parties to the underlying personal injury action reached a settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
