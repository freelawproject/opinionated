Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-1 to -40 (the C.B.T. Act). The dispute focuses on the interpretation of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1) and whether the Tax Court correctly interpreted that section to hold the taxpayer liable for additional taxes under the C.B.T. Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Plaintiff-appellant Nine Franklin Corporation (Nine Franklin) filed a request on July 26, 1990 with the Director, Division of Taxation (Director), for a refund on its fiscal year 1988 C.B.T. Nine Franklin requested a refund in the amount of $1,649.84. In a final determination letter dated September 14, 1989, the Director denied a part of Nine Franklin\u2019s refund claim, asserting that its tax liability was greater than claimed because of the application of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">On November 17,1989 Nine Franklin filed a complaint with the Tax Court contesting the Director\u2019s final determination. The parties filed a stipulation of facts and briefs with the Tax Court. Judge Pizzuto heard oral argument on May 31, 1991 and upheld the Director\u2019s final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">These are the facts stipulated before the Tax Court. Nine Franklin was incorporated in New Jersey on August 23, 1960. The sole asset of the corporation was a commercial rental property, consisting of a building and land, located in Newark. The building and land were purchased on August 23, 1960 for $60,000 (building $44,000; land $16,000). The building was fully depreciat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ed on a straight-line basis over ten years. On November 2, 1987 the shareholders adopted a plan for liquidation of the corporation under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 337, and filed Form 966 with the Internal Revenue Service indicating that the corporation would be dissolved within 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In June 1988, within the context of an <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 337 liquidation, the assets of the corporation were distributed to Vera Goodman, the sole shareholder, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">Cash $190,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Land and Building 195,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">($40,000.00 cash and mortgage of $155,000 (fair market value)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">Total Valuation $385,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Vera Goodman sold the building and land on July 1, 1988 for $195,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Following the liquidation, Nine Franklin filed its final New Jersey C.B.T. return for the fiscal year September 1,1987 through August 31, 1988. Nine Franklin did not file I.R.S. Form 4797, which reports <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 gains, with its 1988 Form 4797 or with its final Form 1120 U.S. Corporation Income Tax return. Nine Franklin did not report any recaptured income on line 9 of Schedule A of its C.B.T. return or on line 9 of its Form 1120 U.S. Corporation Income Tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">On July 26, 1989 Nine Franklin filed a refund request with the Director seeking a refund of $1,649.84 on its 1988 C.B.T. return. The Director requested and received supplemental materials from Nine Franklin regarding the refund request. By final determination letter dated September 14, 1989, the Director denied $722 of Nine Franklin\u2019s refund request. The Director determined that Nine Franklin erroneously under-reported income by $8,800. The $8,800 represented 20% of the accumulated straight-line depreciation taken on Nine Franklin\u2019s real property which should have been reported on the C.B.T. return. The Director determined, pursuant to <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, that Nine Franklin was required to recapture 20% of the $44,000 depreciation deductions taken on the property. ($44,000 x 20% = $8,800). The refund was reduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>$722, reflecting an application of the 9% corporation business tax rate applied to the $8,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As noted, on appeal Judge Pizzuto upheld the Director\u2019s determination. Judge Pizzuto phrased the issue as \u201cwhether nor not section 291 applies to every case where property of the kind described in section 1250 is disposed of or whether it only applies to a more limited category of dispositions of property known as section 1250 property.\u201d Judge Pizzuto accepted the State\u2019s contention that <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 applies whenever <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property is disposed of and concluded that the property in issue fell within this category. The judge concluded that the Director acted properly by (1) computing a <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 ordinary income amount for the disposition of the property, (2) applying the 9% corporation income tax to it, and (3) deducting $722 from the refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Several conclusions were essential to the judge\u2019s decision. He recognized that the case involves a corporate liquidation as opposed to a corporate sale of property. He felt this was significant because under federal tax law a corporation does not recognize taxable gain after a distribution of property to shareholders. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 is an exception to the non-recognition rule and requires the corporation to recognize an income gain that would be applicable to a sale other than one in the course of a dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The judge next concluded that the property in issue is <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property because it is real property. This was not dispositive, however, because <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 results in a classification of gain as ordinary income and requires the taxpayer to calculate the gain as if the property was <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Judge Pizzuto explained that the gain should be computed under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) by: (1) determining the amount which would be treated as ordinary income if the property was <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property (\u00bfa, the full amount of depreciation recovered on the amount of the sale of property over the amount treated as ordinary income under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250); (2) determining the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(B) (this amount would be zero despite its status as \u00a7 1250 property because there is no additional depreciation and no ordinary income under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250). The judge concluded that the amount under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(B) would be zero, and the amount under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) should be computed \u201cby simply applying the rules specified in section 1245 without regard to whether or not the given property is or is not section 1245 property.\u201d He found that there may be some property which is subject to <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 and some property which is subject to <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250; however, the two sections do not apply simultaneously to the same property. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 calculates some <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property as <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property and requires the reclassification of all depreciation recovered as capital gain upon disposition of the property to ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Applying this analysis to the present case, the judge concluded that the excess of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) over \u00a7 291(a)(1)(B) is the entire amount of the depreciation recovered on the sale ($44,000 taken in straight-line depreciation over ten years). <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 then requires that 20% of that amount ($8,800) be treated as ordinary income under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250. He concluded that the Director acted properly by computing <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 ordinary income for the disposition of the property, in applying the 9% corporation income tax, and in deducting the resulting $722 from the refund due.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Judge Pizzuto also relied on the official instructions distributed by the Internal Revenue Service for Form 4797, line 26(f), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">The amount treated as ordinary income under section 291 is 20% of the excess, if any, of the amount which would be treated as ordinary income if such property were section 1245 property, over the amount treated as ordinary income under section 1250. If you used the straight line method of depreciation, the ordinary income under section 291 is 10% of the amount figured under section 1245.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Finally, the judge indicated that even if an ambiguity exists in the interpretation of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, deference must be given to the interpretation of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency charged with its administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On this appeal, Nine Franklin contends that (1) no portion of the depreciation should be included in net income because (a) <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 does not cause it to recognize income for federal income tax purposes and (b) New Jersey did not incorporate <em>I.R.C. \u00a7 </em>291 into the C.B.T. Act; and (2) even if the Tax Court correctly interpreted <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, defendant erroneously overstated Nine Franklin\u2019s tax liability by including pre-1962 depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">A. Does <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) cause plaintiff to recognize income for federal income tax purposes?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The C.B.T. Act taxes corporations doing business in this State. <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:10A-5. The C.B.T. Act uses a three-factor allocation formula, which compares the ratio of New Jersey property, payroll and sales to their entire net amounts. <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Director, Div. of Taxation,, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>466, 213 A.2d 1 (1965). This reflects the relationship between a corporation\u2019s business activity in New Jersey and all other business activity. <em>Tamko Asphalt Products Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>446, 458 (1983). The C.B.T. Act uses a base of \u201centire net income,\u201d and defines it as the \u201ctotal net income from all sources\u201d that the taxpayer is required to report for federal income-tax purposes, with certain exceptions. <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:10A-4(k); <em>Allied-Signal Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>504 U.S. -, -, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2251, 2256, 119 L.Ed.2d 533, 543-44 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\"><em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, the provision in question on this appeal, was enacted by Congress as a \u201cdepreciation recapture\u201d device to eliminate certain business tax preferences for corporations. Under the Internal Revenue Code, distribution of property to corporate shareholders results in the recognition of income gain to the shareholder but not the corporation. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 337. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, however, is an exception to this rule, and places tax liability on a corporation which disposes of depreciated property which exceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>its adjusted basis. In such a situation, a portion of the depreciation is converted into ordinary, taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Specifically, <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u00a7 291. Special rules relating to corporate preference items</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">(a) Reduction in certain preference items, etc.\u2014For purpose of this subtitle, <em>in the case of a </em>corporation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">(1) Section 1250 capital gain treatment.\u2014In the case of section 1250 property which is disposed of during the taxable year, 20 <em>percent of the excess (if any) of\u2014</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">(A) the amount which would be treated as ordinary income <em>if such property was section 1215 property, </em>over</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">(B) tile <em>amount treated as ordinary income under section 1250 (determined without regard to this paragraph),</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\"><em>shall be treated as gain which is ordinary income under section 1250 and shall be recognized notwithstanding any other provision of this title. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">This section references two other recapture <em>provisions\u2014I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 \u00cd245 and <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property is defined as \u201cany real property ... which is or has been property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in \u00a7 167.\u201d <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250(c). Upon the sale of depreciable real property, a taxpayer must recognize gain as ordinary income to the extent there is \u201cadditional\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u201cexcess\u201d depreciation computed under \u00a7 1250. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property consists of depreciable personal property and specifically excludes buildings and other structural components. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The disputed property, without contest, is <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property. The parties also agree that Nine Franklin fully depreciated the property over a ten-year period using the straight-line method. Therefore, the amount treated as ordinary income under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 and <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(B) is $0. The dispute, however, centers on the computation under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Nine Franklin contends that <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) refers to property \u201cwhich on the whole is classified as <em>\u2018I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property\u2019 but which has some components that, if viewed separately, ordinarily would be characterized as <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property.\u201d This interpretation suggests that <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) applies to \u00a7 1250 property when a portion of the property is also \u00a7 1245 property. Nine Franklin argues that no portion of plaintiffs building, when viewed separately, constitutes \u00a7 1245 property and, therefore, the amount computed under \u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) would be $0. Nine Franklin cites no case law to support this interpretation, relying on a treasury regulation interpreting <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 and a revenue ruling analyzing <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Director rejected this interpretation and urges us to treat the depreciation taken on the property as <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property and calculate the gain under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A). The Director supports his interpretation through the plain language of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s instructions, and the legislative history and the policy considerations supporting <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In construing tax legislation, words must be given their ordinary and primary meaning; they should not be extended beyond their clear import. <em>In re Jamesburg High School Closing, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>540, 547, 416 A.2d 896 (1980); <em>International Business Mach. Corp. v. State, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 84, 357 A.2d 292 (App. Div.1976). When interpretation of a tax statute is in doubt, the court should construe the statute in favor of the taxpayer if there is no pertinent legislative history to guide the interpretation. <em>Fedders Fin. Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>376, 384-85, 476 A.2d 741 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The text of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1)(A) states: \u201cThe amount which would be treated as ordinary income if such property was section 1245 property.\u201d Applying the principles of statutory construction, the plain language of the text indicates that the property must only be <em>treated </em>as <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property. The use of the phase <em>\u201cif </em>such property <em>was </em>section 1245 property\u201d does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>impose a requirement that the properly actually <em>be I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As the Director correctly notes, Internal Revenue Service Form 4797<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its instructions for filing also support the Division\u2019s interpretation. Specifically, Lines 26a-26g on the Form are used when reporting dispositions of depreciable real property under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250. Line 26f refers to corporations subject to the corporate tax preference rules of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, and its instructions provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">Corporations subject to section 291.\u2014The amount treated as ordinary income under section 291 is 20% of the excess, if any, of the amount which would be treated as ordinary income if such property were section 1245 property, over the amount treated as ordinary income under section 1250. <em>If you used the straight line method of depreciation, the ordinary income under section 291 </em>is 20% <em>of the amount figured under section 1215.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The underlined part of the instruction is particularly applicable to the case before us, and indicates that if straight-line depreciation is taken on <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property and there is no taxable ordinary income, <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 still requires the taxpayer to calculate ordinary income as 20% of the amount under <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245. In the present case, the taxpayer completely depreciated its real property using the straight-line method. Without the recapture provision of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, Nine Franklin would not have to recognize the gain from its sale of the property as taxable ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The Director provides additional support for his interpretation: in the <em>Corporation and Partnership Tax Return Guide </em>\u00b6 182 (Research Institute of America 1988), the discussion regarding line 26f on Form 4797 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\"><em>For corporations only, </em>in addition to the amounts recaptured under the above rules, <em>20% </em>of the amount by which the gain that would be recaptured under the Sec. 1245 rules <em>(if those rules had </em>applied) exceeds the gain that is recaptured under the Sec. 1250 recapture rules, <em>will also be recaptured as ordinary income. Ud, </em>at 54],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Finally, the Director\u2019s position is supported by Robert W. Woods, <em>Taxation of Corporate Liquidations, A Complete Planning Guide </em>\u00b6 3.0535 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">notwithstanding the general principle that Sec. 1250 recapture extends only to the excess depredation claimed over straight line (see discussion in 1[ 3.053 above), 20% of the depreciation recapture that <em>would </em>apply if the property were Sec. 1245 property will be recaptured as ordinary income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">Stated differently still, Sec. 291(a) provides that for dispositions of Sec. 1250 property, one-fifth (20%) of the advantage that Sec. 1250 property enjoys over See. 1245 property <em>will be lost.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We conclude <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 was properly applied to Nine Franklin\u2019s <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1250 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">B. Does <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 apply to the C.B.T. Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Nine Franklin contends that we should adopt its position even if we find that <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 would cause it to recognize gain for federal income tax purposes. It claims that the C.B.T. Act has not adopted federal depreciation provisions, including <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291. The Director, in contrast, argues that Nine Franklin fundamentally misconstrues the scheme of the C.B.T. Act and that the Tax Court properly found <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">Nine Franklin suggests that the C.B.T. Act and the regulations implementing the Act are designed to keep the post-1980 federal depreciation provisions outside the framework of our State\u2019s taxation scheme. It contends that \u201cthe legislative intent has been to \u2018uncouple\u2019 New Jersey\u2019s depreciation methods from the post-1980 federal depreciation scheme.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Nine Franklin, the Tax Court erroneously engrafted the federal depreciation recapture rule of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, enacted in 1982, onto New Jersey\u2019s computation of entire net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The C.B.T. Act imposes a franchise tax on that portion of a taxpayer\u2019s \u201centire net income\u201d which is allocated to New Jersey. <em>N.J.SA </em>54:10A-5(c). Federal taxable income is used as the starting point in determining the net income base; thus, a taxpayer\u2019s entire net income is deemed <em>prima facie </em>to be equal in amount to the taxpayer\u2019s federal taxable income with certain adjustments. <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:10A-4(k); <em>Amerada Hess Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>66, 71, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1617, 1620, 104 L.Ed.2d 58, 65 (1989). Nine Franklin contends that under the C.B.T. Act a taxpayer is allowed to take a depreciation deduction using any depreciation method that was in effect under the Code on December 31, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Nine Franklin advances several reasons why the C.B.T. Act rejects <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291. First, it alleges that the legislative history accompanying the amendment of <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:10A-4(k) in 1982 indicates that \u201cNew Jersey deductions for depreciation would be uncoupled from federal depreciation allowances based upon the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) beginning with tax years commencing in 1982.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Second, it contends the federal depreciation recapture provisions are largely irrelevant to the C.B.T. Act. Specifically, Nine Franklin alleges that the C.B.T. Act provisions serve to recharacterize capital gain as ordinary income, which they maintain is critical because capital gains have been historically taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. This recharacterization, however, is meaningless because the C.B.T. Act is imposed at a flat rate regardless of whether the income is capital gain income or ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Finally, Nine Franklin urges that New Jersey has taken affirmative steps to disregard federal depreciation provisions adopted after 1980, including <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 which was enacted in 1982, and to leave in place the pre-1980 depreciation structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The Director claims that Nine Franklin misperceives the scheme of the C.B.T. Act. Acknowledging that the C.B.T. Act nullifies the ACRS because it would have decreased tax revenues, he contends that <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 serves to increase the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>revenues under the C.B.T. Act. Therefore, no reason existed for the Legislature to try to uncouple <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 from the C.B.T. Act. The Director also attacks Nine Franklin\u2019s argument on the ground that it undermines the premise that a taxpayer\u2019s net income is equal to the taxpayer\u2019s federal taxable income. According to the Director, the C.B.T. Act includes all federal taxable income under the Code unless the Legislature specifically enacts legislation nullifying the federal provisions. Since this has not been explicitly done for <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, the income should be included in federal taxable income for C.B.T. purposes. By following Nine Franklin\u2019s theory, a taxpayer could pick and choose which federal provisions it deems inapplicable to the C.B.T. Act. We affirm the Tax Court finding that there is no good reason to exclude <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 from C.B.T. depreciation analysis and no language in the C.B.T. Act suggesting exclusion of the federal recapture provisions from the Division\u2019s assessment consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Nine Franklin next contends that even if the Tax Court is upheld in applying <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291, the Director improperly included pre-1962 depreciation which is not recaptured by <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291. As a result, Nine Franklin\u2019s tax liability was over-stated. The Director challenges this claim, especially since it is raised for the first time on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Nine Franklin correctly notes that <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 291 and 1245 only recapture depreciation taken in periods ending after December 31, 1961. The legislative history of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 explicitly acknowledges the prospective nature of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Conference Committee Report confirms this interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">The bill as passed by both the House and Senate adds a new section 1245 to the code. In general, the new section provides for the treatment as ordinary income of the gain from the disposition of certain depreciable property to the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>depreciation deductions <em>(taken in periods specified, in the </em>bill) which are reflected in the adjusted basis of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">Under the bill as passed by the House, the new section 1245 applied to property disposed of after the date of the enactment of the bill and to the extent of adjustments for depreciation and certain amortization for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961. Under Senate amendment No. 128, the new section applies to property disposed of during a taxable year beginning after December 81, 1962. Under Senate amendments Nos. 129, 130, and 181, <em>the adjustments taken into account are those attributable to periods after December 31, 1961. </em>The House recedes. (Emphasis added). H.Rep. No. 1508, 87th Cong., 2d. Sess. (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As revealed on the following table, plaintiff depreciated its real property as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">Period Depreciation Taken</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7s\">9/1/60 to 8/31/61 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfP\">9/1/61 to 8/31/62 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyF\">9/1/62 to 8/31/63 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9C\">9/1/63 to 8/31/64 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akc\">9/1/65 to 8/31/66 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">9/1/66 to 8/31/67 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgO\">9/1/67 to 8/31/68 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADR\">9/1/68 to 8/31/69 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIz\">9/1/69 to 8/31/70 $ 4,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajl\">Total $44,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Nine Franklin is correct that the entire $44,000 of depreciation taken for the taxable year ended August 31,1961 falls outside the scope of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245, as does the depreciation taken for September through December 1961. ($4,400 x 4 -*\u2022 12 = $1,467). As a result, $5,867 of depreciation taken prior to the effective date of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 is not be subject to recapture.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">Since <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291(a)(1) requires the recapture of depreciation as if real property were <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245 property, <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291 must incorporate the same effective dates as <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1245. The $5,867 of pre-1962 depreciation is exempt from the recapture provision of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>This error was not brought to the attention of the Director or the Tax Court.

The Director contends that this issue concerns neither the jurisdiction of the Tax Court nor a question of great public importance. He urges that Nine Franklin be precluded from raising this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Nevertheless, <em>B. </em>2:10-5 permits us to exercise such original jurisdiction as necessary to complete the determination of any matter on review.
