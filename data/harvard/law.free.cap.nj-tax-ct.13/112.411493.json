The Tax Court concluded that the correct method of valuation was to use the actual cost of construction trended up to the assessment dates and on that basis reduced the 1988 assessment by $60,305,475 and the 1989 assessment by $53,554,550. The issues on this appeal focus principally on the manner in which the Tax Court made its determination of actual costs. The opinion of the Tax Court is published at 11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>359 (Tax Ct.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">Defendant Borough appeals and seeks reinstatement of the original assessment. Defendant contends the plaintiffs failed to overcome the presumption of correctness that attached to the municipality\u2019s valuation. Alternatively, defendant argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Tax Court\u2019s use of a conservative 12% figure for soft costs rather than the sum of actual soft cost figures was reversible error. The Tax Court stabilized the soft cost figure because interest rates were unusually high at the time of construction, which was between 1979 and 1981. Plaintiffs respond that this decision to stabilize soft costs was within the Tax Court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal challenging the Tax Court\u2019s decision to add a figure for entrepreneurial profit and challenging the court\u2019s classification of co-generation and food service equipment as real property. Plaintiffs argue that entrepreneurial profit is not an appropriate consideration for corporate property built by the owner for its own use. As to the co-generation and food service equipment, plaintiffs contend that these are elements of personal rather than real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration the trial court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">I found that the most reliable indicator was the actual cost, but that doesn\u2019t mean that ... the evidence isn\u2019t to be tempered by all of the testimony of the experts ... and the other evidence, like the Internal Revenue Service figure. But I\u2019ve been doing this for about 40 years and I know there is no right answer, there\u2019s just the exercise of the best judgment that you can bring to bear. And I\u2019m satisfied that in deciding this case, after hearing all the evidence, that the end result was the proper and fair end result. And so I\u2019m going to deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Quoting from <em>Glen Wall Assocs. v. Tp. of Wall, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>265, 280, 491 A.2d 1247 (1985), the Supreme Court recently \u201cemphasized that the Tax Court has an obligation to use its \u2018special qualification[s], knowledge and experience\u2019 in reaching a determination of value.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Company v. Tp. of Edison, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>290, 311, 604 A.2d 580 (1992). It added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">The premise of <em>Glen Wall </em>is that because of the Tax Court\u2019s special expertise in these matters, \u201c \u2018it has not only the right [ ] but the duty to apply its own judgment to valuation data submitted by experts in order to arrive at a true value and find an assessment for the years in question.\u2019 \u201d 99 <em>N.J. </em>at 280 [491 A.2d 1247] (quoting <em>New Cumberland Corp. v. Borough of Roselle, </em>3 <em>N.J.Tax </em>345, 353 (Tax 1981)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">The determination presented for review is affirmed substantially for the reasons stated by Presiding Judge Lasser in his formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>written opinion for the Tax Court published at 11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>359 (Tax Ct.1990).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
