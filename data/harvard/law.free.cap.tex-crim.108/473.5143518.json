The facts amply support the verdict of the jury. We are not in accord with appellant\u2019s objections to the charge. The defense was an alibi. The court told the jury that if they believed from the evidence that at the time of the alleged sale, if any, defendant was not present, or if the jury had a reasonable doubt thereof, they should find defendant not guilty. The state\u2019s testimony to the facts involved was positive. We believe the charge sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Complaint is made-of the court\u2019s action in telling the jury that if they found the defendant guilty they should not arrive at their verdict.by any form of lot such as adding up the number of years each juryman favored and dividing the whole by twelve.
