Just across a turn-row and adjacent to the farm which appellant was cultivating officers discovered a still, mash, and signs of use, and the road leading from appellant\u2019s home down to the immediate vicinity of the still gave evidence of travel. They watched the still and saw appellant and his son come to same and begin to remove the tops from the barrels and discuss how much they should make, etc. The facts support the verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was overruled March 31, 1927, and he was given sixty days in which to file bills of exception. Said sixty days expired May 30, 1927. On May 31 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>trial judge entered an order granting further extension of time in which to file such bills of exception. The time originally granted having expired before the extension order was made, the trial court was without authority to make same. M\u00edreles v. State, 98 Tex. Crim. Rep. 396. It is to be regretted that we can not consider the bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">No error appearing in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b397-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ALB\">This is a companion case to cause No. 11163, Jess Frier v. State, motion for rehearing in which is this day overruled. The motion for rehearing in the instant case is based on exactly the same grounds as those in cause No. 11163, supra. For the same reason the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
