The statement of facts shows to have been filed in the court below on August 28, 1926. This was more than ninety days after the giving notice of appeal. The statement of facts cannot be considered because filed too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-19\">There are ten bills of exception, each of which appears to have been qualified by the trial court in such manner as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>same presents no error. A discussion of any of said bills will be pretermitted. Many of them present questions which could not be appraised by us in the absence of statement of facts. Each and all of the others are complaints rendered entirely ineffectual by the qualifications put thereon by the court and accepted by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Finding no error in any of the bills, the judgment will be affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b143-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Av4\">In his motion for rehearing appellant admits that the statement of facts was not filed in time, but attempts to make a showing of facts sufficient to excuse the failure to have such statement of facts filed. This contention in the motion is made to rest upon the sickness of appellant\u2019s counsel. The motion for new trial herein appears to have been overruled on May 20, 1926. It is shown that appellant\u2019s counsel became ill about the 1st of August thereafter. We thus have seventy-two' days elapsing in which no effort appears to have been made to secure the filing of the statement of facts. The showing of illness is that appellant\u2019s attorney had influenza. It is shown further that appellant\u2019s attorney directed his stenographer to send the papers to the District Judge for his approval. A carbon copy of the letter written by the stenographer to the District Judge, of date August 17, 1926, is attached to the motion for rehearing. Examining said carbon copy, we observe that same nowhere refers to the sending of any statement of facts, but mention is only made therein of the bills of exception. When the statement of facts reached the District Judge is not shown. We regret that we are unable to agree with appellant as to the sufficiency of the showing made.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled. <em>Overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
