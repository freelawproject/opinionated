Several jars of whiskey were discovered on appellant\u2019s premises in a chicken house, which was thirty or forty steps from the back door of the dwelling. An automobile driven by one Kelsey, in which appellant was riding, was also searched near appellant\u2019s dwelling, and several jars of whiskey taken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The affidavit upon which the search warrant was issued was made by two persons upon information and belief, and the grounds of belief were not therein exhibited. Appellant timely objected to the testimony of the officers touching the results of the search, and excepted to the action of the court in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A warrant to search a private dwelling, occupied as such, based upon an affidavit made upon information and belief in which there is given no fact, circumstance or detailed information showing or tending to show that the dwelling is used for a purpose denounced by Art. 691 P. C., is unauthorized, and a search thereunder is illegal. Chapin v. State, 296 S. W. 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">An illegal search is penalized by statute. Art. 4a C. C.
