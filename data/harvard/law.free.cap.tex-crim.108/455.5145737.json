The court explains that only a few of the regular jurors were available and that the jurors who tried appellant were properly summoned by the sheriff under the direction of the court. Appellant made no objection to the jury until after his conviction. It was then too late. Accused cannot take his chances on a jury reaching a verdict satisfactory to him and later complain if the verdict is displeasing. No error is shown in the court\u2019s action in securing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The indictment charged a joint sale to Claud Reese and Clifford Decker. It is contended that the proof shows a sale to Reese only, and that even upon a plea of guilty the testimony reveals that appellant is not guilty of the particular offense charged. We have examined the evidence heard upon the trial and in our opinion appellant\u2019s contention is not sound. It shows a joint sale to the parties named.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s other bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
