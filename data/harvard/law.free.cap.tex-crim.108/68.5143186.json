C. He makes the point that under the terms of said article unless, at the time of the alleged .acts, the child in question was already a delinquent child, there could be no violation of said statute. He presented to the trial court a special charge, which was refused, in which he sought to have the jury told that unless they found from the testimony that said child, at the date charged, was a delinquent child, they should acquit.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">The record before us, if the state\u2019s evidence be true, presents a case of much depravity, and it is with reluctance that we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>forced to say in our opinion that the trial court erred in refusing to give the special charge asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Art. 534, supra, plainly provides that in all cases when a child is a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d or a \u201cneglected or dependent child,\u201d as defined in the statutes of this state, if its parent, guardian, or the person having custody of, or responsible for \u201csuch child\u201d encourages, causes or contributes to the delinquency or dependency of \u201csuch child;\u201d or if any other person encourages, causes or contributes to the delinquency or dependency of \u201csuch child,\u201d such person shall be punished as provided. The second paragraph of said article defines \u201cdelinquency\u201d as meaning any act which tends to debase or injure the morals, health or welfare of \u201csuch child,\u201d and specifically includes the use of tobacco in any form, drinking intoxicating liquor, etc. That the legislative purpose was to make punishable any person who aids or encourages or causes any child to indulge in such practices as are mentioned in said article, may be plausibly argued, and this may be true, but if such was the purpose, the legislature did not use language so indicating. The words used are \u201cIn all cases when any child shall be a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d or a \u201cneglected or dependent child;\u201d and each provision of said article pointedly relates to \u201csuch child.\u201d We are not at liberty to write into the statutes anything merely because in our opinion same ought to be there. We must take the law as we find it. Endeavoring so to do, we are compelled to hold that the trial judge erred in refusing the special charge asked, and that for this error the case must be reversed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
