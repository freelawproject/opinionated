He brought about the arrest of one Billiard in the justice court upon complaints charging him with the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor. Thereafter, according to the testimony of Billiard and his wife, appellant came to Billiard\u2019s home at a late hour in the night and offered to have the case against him dismissed and finally settled upon the payment of one hundred dollars, which amount he later reduced to fifty dollars. Billiard agreed to pay fifty dollars. He and his wife testified that they later got the fifty dollars which Billiard took to Baird and delivered to appellant. There was no further prosecution of Billiard.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-20\">Appellant defended upon the proposition that after having brought about the arrest of Billiard, he concluded that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>let him plead guilty to vagrancy in settlement of the felony charge, and that he made the trip to Dilliard\u2019s house and told him that if he would pay him fifty dollars he would enter pleas of guilty in vagrancy charges and allow the liquor selling charge to be thus settled. He admitted that he never made any vagrancy charges against Billiard. He admitted the reception of the money from Billiard.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">There were no exceptions to the charge of . the court. While there appear in this record what are called bills of exception, four in number, same appear to be complaints based entirely on errors complained of in the motion for new trial. We cannot consider complaints of the charge of the court raised for the first time in the motion for new trial, nor those directed at the form of the indictment, when for the first time called to the attention of the trial court in connection with an effort to secure a new trial; nor to complaints of the argument of the State\u2019s Attorney when presented for the first time in the motion for new trial. These are the matters embraced in the so-called bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We think the testimony of the witness Billiard fully corroborated both by that of his wife and others, also of appellant himself who took the witness stand and admitted substantially all of the facts testified to by Billiard.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b657-10\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AL_K\">In the indictment it is charged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">\u201c * * * there was then and there a legal complaint pending in Justice Court, Precinct No. 6, Callahan County, Texas, charging Bud Billiard with an offense of the grade of felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">It is further charged in substance that Billiard gave the appellant fifty dollars in consideration of which he promised to bring about the dismissal of the cases pending against Billiard and secure his release from his appearance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">The court instructed the jury in accord with the indictment, namely, that if they believed that there was pending in the Justice Court, Precinct No. 6, Callahan County, a complaint charging Bud Billiard with an offense of the grade of felony and that Billiard was under bond for the appearance before the Bistrict Court of Callahan County to await the action of the grand jury, etc. In our examination of the record, we have failed to discover any proof that there was filed in the Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Court, Precinct No. 6, of Callahan County, the complaint charged in the indictment. The only testimony on the subject is that there was a complaint filed against Dilliard in the justice court at \u201cCross Plains, Texas.\u201d Touching the county or precinct in which Cross Plains is situated, the record is silent. There is no testimony, and this court has no judicial knowledge of the county or precinct in which Cross Plains is located. The state having failed to prove the fact essential to the conviction, the judgment must be reversed. Cases in point are: Lerma v. State, 194 S. W. 167; Fields v. State, 24 S. W. 407; Latham v. State, 19 Tex. Crim. App. 305; Vivian v. State, 16 Tex. Crim. App. 262; Cain v. State, 25 S. W. 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">For the reason stated, the motion for rehearing is granted, the affirmance is set aside, the judgment' of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
