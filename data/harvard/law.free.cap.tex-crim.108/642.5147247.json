W. Dillon v. The State.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b660-5\">No. 11316.</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ao-\">Delivered January 25, 1928.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-10\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-11\"><em>Vickers, Campbell &amp; Schenck </em>of Lubbock, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azo\">On erroneous admission of affidavit and search warrant in evidence, appellant cites: Pursell v. State, 290 S. W. 1107; Dupree v. State, 119 S. W. 301; Lippman v. State, 51 N. E. 872; Velder v. U. S., 252 Fed. 418; White v. Wagar, 185 Ill. 195; Odenthal v. State, 106 Tex. Crim. Rep. 1.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-13\"><em>A. A.

It is appellant\u2019s contention that the statements in said instruments to the effect that he had been instrumental in selling intoxicating liquor were hearsay. There seems to have been no issue upon which the contents of the affidavit and search warrant were relevant. The statements were hearsay and, therefore, inadmissible. The question of guilt was vigorously contested by appellant. Such being the case and the statements being obviously harmful to appellant, their improper receipt in evidence constituted reversible error. Bryant v. State, 250 S. W. 169; Gaunce v. State, 261 S. W. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">For the error discussed, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-17\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
