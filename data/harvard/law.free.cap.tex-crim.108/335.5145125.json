Incorporated in what appears to be the judgment of the court is a statement that the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was overruled. Also in said judgment appears the following: \u201cIt is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that * * * after which defendant\u2019s attorney gave notice of appeal.\u201d Manifestly this is not a notice of appeal in conformity with the statutory requirement that the notice of appeal must be made in open court and entered of record. Whether such appeal be to this court or some other does not appear. Danley v. State, 88 Tex. Crim. Rep. 31; Souzeda v. State, 86 Tex. Crim.

The judge makes affidavit that the notations on his trial docket show that appellant\u2019s notice of appeal as given was to the Court of Criminal Appeals at Austin. The affidavit of the clerk merely sets out that in writing the judgment of the court below, he inadvertently omitted to show that the appeal was taken to the Court of Criminal Appeals, but made the minutes show that \u201cnotice of appeal was given.\u201d It is to be regretted that this court cannot act upon the showing made. The statute is very plain, and the duty of this court is to follow it. Art. 827, 1925 C. C. P., provides that if notice of appeal is given at the term at which the conviction is had and the same is not entered of record, then by making proof of the fact, the judge of the court trying the cause shall order the same entered of record either in term time or vacation by entering in the minutes of his court an order to that effect, which entry when so made shall bear date as of date when notice of appeal was actually given in open court. We see no reason why this plain provision of the statute was not followed in the case before us. Not having been followed, we are not at liberty to grant the motion, which is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
