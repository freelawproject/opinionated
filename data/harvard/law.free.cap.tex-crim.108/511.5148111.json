Besides his dwelling, he had a store, barn and gin. In the store he sold cold drinks. The premises were searched. There was a failure to find any intoxicating liquor of any character in any of his buildings, but in the barn there were found some empty bottles, the character of which might have been for beer or might have been for \u201cnear beer.\u201d In the \u00a1weeds' isome distance from the appellant\u2019s barn there \u2018were found several cases of what the officers called beer and \u201chome brew.\u201d These cases of beer were in what was described as a \u201cbig pasture\u201d and were about the same distance from places occupied by others as from the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">There was one witness who testified that sometime ago he had bought whisky in the house of the appellant but that he did not buy it from the appellant. The date of the transaction is not given at all. The witness said, however, that the appellant was in the store at the time he bought whisky from another man. The witness did not state that the appellant was cognizant of the transaction; that the whisky was not in the store but that the man went out to some place and got it.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The evidence adduced by the appellant was that the place where the alleged contraband liquid was found was not on his premises or on the premises under his control. This comes from others than the appellant, and was not controverted by any direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The chief complaint is the refusal of the court to instruct the jury upon the law of circumstantial evidence. This fault in the charge was properly raised by exceptions duly preserved, state\u2019s counsel concedes that the conviction rests upon circumstantial evidence alone, and in this view we concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING BY STATE.</p>\n<author id=\"b531-14\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AGL\">The reversal heretofore ordered was based upon the failure of the court to charge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>jury upon the law of circumstantial evidence. It is now made to appear that the court, by a supplemental charge, gave adequate instructions upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">As grounds for a new trial appellant claimed that he had discovered new and material evidence. Upon the trial it was shown that the search of the premises was made by A. E. Bridgewater and Captain G. T. Cooper. The purported newly discovered evidence is the affidavit of Captain Cooper to the effect that he did not discover any intoxicating liquor upon the premises of the appellant. It was shown in the motion for new trial that although Cooper was present at the time of the search and testified as a witness on the trial, the appellant had used no diligence to ascertain that the witness would give the testimony embraced in the affidavit. Moreover, Cooper was one of the persons named in the search warrant as having made the affidavit upon which it was issued. The diligence which the law requires is not shown to have been exercised, in ascertaining the facts within the knowledge of the witness. The discretion of the trial court was not, in our judgment, abused. C. C. P., 1925, Art. 753, Subd. 6, Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim. Stat., 1925, Vol. 3, page 15, notes 25 and 26; Lewis v. State, 82 Tex. Crim. Rep. 285; Jackson v. State, 81 Tex. Crim. Rep. 597; Gregory v. State, 105 Tex. Crim. Rep. 674; McVerse v. State, 103 Tex. Crim. Rep. 140, 280 S. W. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The sufficiency of the search warrant (which, by the way, was not introduced in evidence) is attacked upon the ground that it did not sufficiently describe the location of the liquor. The premises where the liquor was located were described as \u201csituated fifteen miles north of Nocona, Texas, on the four-acre tract of land at and near the Rolan gin, in possession of John Battles,\u201d and the liquor is - described as \u201cintoxicating liquor possessed in violation of law, the kind and quantity of which are unknown to the affiants.\u201d In the matter of the description of the premises and the liquor, it is believed that there was a substantial compliance with the constitutional and statutory demands. See Hernandez v. State, (No. 10711, not yet reported) ; Wilson v. State, 290 S. W. 1103; Story v. State, 296 S. W. 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">For the reasons stated, the state\u2019s motion for rehearing is granted, the order of reversal is set aside, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<author id=\"b533-5\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoo\">Appellant insists that the judgment should be reversed on account of the insufficiency of the evidence. The other questions presented in the motion have been considered and will not again be discussed. The judgment was originally reversed on confession of error predicated on the mistaken idea that the court gave no charge on circumstantial evidence. No charge on this subject was embraced in the main charge, but was contained in a supplementary instruction. This was called to our attention in the state\u2019s motion for rehearing. That point and appellant\u2019s claim of newly discovered evidence challenged our attention in writing on rehearing for the state and the particular point now stressed by appellant was not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Two officers, Bridgewater and Cooper, conducted a search of appellant\u2019s premises. The record does not show that liquor of any kind was found in appellant\u2019s store or dwelling house. The officers then separated, Bridgewater going into a pasture where he found in some weeds three or four cases, some being empty and others containing what the witness called \u201cbeer.\u201d This pasture was not in appellant\u2019s possession, and he exercised no control over it. Other dwellings and stores were situated as close to where Bridgewater found the liquor as were those of appellant. There was no evidence showing that appellant was connected with this liquor. Cooper was not present at the trial, being sick at the time. While Bridgewater was .searching in the pasture, Cooper was investigating appellant\u2019s barn. Bridgewater says when he got through with his search he went to the barn and that Cooper was standing in front of it and there were some cases standing there in which were some fifty or sixty pints of \u201cbeer.\u201d The witness says, \u201cI called it beer. It was \u2018home brew.\u2019 \u201d Bridgewater had seen Cooper going in the barn and other places two or three times, but did not know whether all these places were on appellant\u2019s property; he saw Cooper come out from somewhere with cases in his hand. The officers took all of the full bottles to town and delivered them to the sheriff. The sheriff testified that he drank one bottle of it and that in his opinion it was intoxicating, Appellant makes the point that there is no evidence to show whether the liquor sampled by the sheriff came from the pasture or the barn; that the record is silent as to whether the liquor found in the two places was of the same kind; that if the liquor which the sheriff said was intoxicating came from the pasture it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>not found in appellant\u2019s possession and therefore would furnish no criminative evidence against him. It is further contended that if Bridgewater\u2019s evidence be sufficient to show that some liquor was taken from appellant\u2019s barn there is no evidence to show that it was intoxicating, unless the bottle tested by the sheriff be one taken from the barn, and there being uncertainty upon that point the state has failed to meet the requirements of the law demanding that circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonable hypothesis save the guilt of accused. We think his contention must be sustained. Albaneso v. State, 99 Tex. Crim. Rep. 108, 268 S. W. 158. Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex.. P. C., Section 1877, and authorities there collated. Our conclusion is further strengthened by the fact that when Bridge-water came from the pasture he went into the barn himself, but found only a case of empty bottles, and also by the recitals in Cooper\u2019s affidavit attached to the motion for new trial to the effect that he found no intoxicating liquor on appellant\u2019s premises, but' only found some empty \u201cnear bear\u201d bottles which were covered with dust and cobwebs. A closer scrutiny of the record in view of appellant\u2019s motion makes it our plain duty under well recognized rules of law to grant the motion, set aside the judgment of affirmance, and reverse the judgment of the lower court and remand the cause for a new trial, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
