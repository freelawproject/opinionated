Bill of exception No. 1 complains that the state was permitted to introduce in evidence entries, of the case on the criminal docket, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-18\">\u201cMarch 15, 1927, state ready, defendant not here, bond forfeited and alias capias ordered issued, case reset for Saturday, 9 a. m.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">Appellant objected to this for the reason that same was prejudicial, improper, and hearsay, could serve no purpose what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>soever, and was not a proper method of introducing the evidence attempted to be shown, as flight was evidently intended to be shown by said evidence. We are unable to agree with appellant\u2019s contention. The entries were admissible for the purpose of showing flight on the part of appellant. If appellant had any explanation to make, he was at liberty to testify. The record shows that appellant was arrested between four hundred and five hundred miles from the county in which the alleged offense was committed and was told by the officer that he was wanted for forfeiting his bond. This testimony was not objected to and was clearly admissible as tending to show appellant\u2019s flight, and the introduction of the entries made on the docket carried no probative force that would in any way injure appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Bill of exception No. <em>2 </em>complains of the action of the court in sustaining the state\u2019s objection to the following question propounded to the witness Fred Curl on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cYou do know the night that you were there with Beady, you asked her about Bully\u2019s being in the room because of something about the room rent being due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The bill shows that the witness, if permitted, would have answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cYes, I know about Beady telling me that Bully was there in the room, and that she was going to make him move if he did not pay his room rent, and it was about 8:30 or 9 o\u2019clock on the night of Mr. Bray\u2019s robbery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">This evidence was offered by appellant for the purpose of establishing or assisting in establishing the appellant\u2019s alibi, and to show that at the time the alleged offense was supposed to have been committed appellant was in the room of Beady, one and one-half miles from the scene of the robbery, and to show Beady Fears\u2019 statement was true about appellant being there on the night of the robbery, and for the further purpose of bolstering and corroborating the testimony of the witness Beady Fears, who was assailed by the state as being a common prostitute and the mother of illegitimate children. We note the bill does not state any grounds of objection, but it does state that it was offered. as tending to establish appellant\u2019s alibi. We are not in accord with appellant\u2019s contention. Any statement made by Beady Fears to the witness Fred Curl would be hearsay and not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Bill of exception No. 4 complains that while the witness Beady Fears was testifying on cross-examination the learned trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>judge, over the objection of appellant, permitted the state to propound the following question, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cI will ask you if you haven\u2019t got some children now, and that you are unmarried?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The witness was permitted, over timely objections made by the appellant, to answer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We are unable to agree with appellant\u2019s contention. This bill, under the rule laid down in Mobley v. State, 89 Tex. Crim. Rep. 646, 232 S. W. 531, and Yeager v. State, 96 Tex. Crim. Rep. 124, 256 S. W. 914, presents no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The facts are amply sufficient to support the verdict. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b515-12\">ON MOTION. FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b515-13\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AMh\">Appellant complains of our disposition of his contentions. It is first insisted that we were wrong in saying that no error was committed by the trial court in rejecting the testimony of Fred Curl to the effect that appellant\u2019s witness to an alibi, Beady Fears, told him (Curl) on the night of the alleged robbery, that appellant was there and in his room. His contention is based on the idea that Beady Fears had been impeached and that he was, therefore, entitled to support or corroborate by proof the fact of her having made this statement. As we understand the record, no attempt was made by the state to impeach Beady Fears by proof of statements made by her contradictory of her testimony as given upon this trial. It is only when this character of impeachment is attempted that we have held it permissible to sustain the witness by proof of prior statements similar to the testimony given. We are not aware of any decisions holding where impeachment is attempted by proof of conviction for felonies, or by proof of the witness having been charged with or convicted of offenses involving moral turpitude, that such impeached witness can be sustained by proof of statements of similar import to the testimony given by said witness. No such authorities are cited by appellant in his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>It is further contended that we should have held it erroneous for the state to ask Beady Fears, appellant\u2019s witness to an alibi, as stated in the original opinion, in reference to her having children and being then unmarried. For two additional reasons appellant\u2019s position is without merit. The question complained of was, if witness Fears had not some children now, and that she was at that time unmarried. Neither in the bill of exceptions, nor anywhere in the record, is it asserted that Beady Fears had never been married. That a woman has children, and that she is at the time unmarried, or without a husband, does not even suggest that she may not have been married, and that she may not be a widow. This court is compelled to take the record as it is made in the trial court and pass upon the questions raised in the light of what appears in the record. The other reason why no reversible error was committed in this testimony is that it appears from the statement of facts that Beady Fears was asked if she had not been prosecuted, convicted and paid a fine for being a vagrant, to-wit, a common prostitute, and that she admitted that she had. Immediately after making this answer she was asked in reference to having some children and being then unmarried as is complained of. If it be .true that Beady Fears had children and had never married, the only effect of such proof would be to reflect upon her credibility as a witness, because such proof would suggest her unchastity, and, therefore, unreliability as a witness. The greater includes the less. It having been shown without objection that the witness was a common prostitute, it would be a stretch of the imagination to presume that harm could have resulted to appellant from allowing her to be asked if she had some children and was unmarried. We do not reverse cases upon claims of injury unless in some way we can reasonably conclude an injury to have been inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Being unable to agree with appellant, the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
