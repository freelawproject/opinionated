Upon a habeas corpus hearing he was denied bail. The facts and circumstances of this case make it inadvisable, we think, for this court to make any extended statement or analysis of them. Suffice it to say that the evidence exhibited in the record is sufficient to raise defensive issues and mitigating circumstances, which, if believed by the jury, would not result in a verdict assessing death as a punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">For a full statement of the law which governs this court in cases of this character see: Ex Parte Cuaron, 274 S.

The alleged rape must have occurred in the presence of a young man friend of the prosecutrix, who was with her in the car during the evening, and, as she testified, was driving the car part of the time at least while appellant was endeavoring to accomplish his purpose. This young man is not used as a witness. It is disclosed by the cross-examination of the prosecutrix that she was of such experience as to have been out at night with various young men, some of whom hugged and kissed her at different times. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>She seems to have been drinking various liquors with them upon these trips. We are not able to believe that upon a fair presentation of this case a jury will fix the punishment of this relator, if convicted, at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
