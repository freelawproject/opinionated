L. Shurtleff </em>of Breckenridge, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-12\"><em>L. H. Welch, </em>District Attorney, Stephens County; <em>O. H. Aired, </em>County Attorney, Stphens County; <em>McLean, Scott &amp; Sayers </em>of Fort Worth; <em>John F. Evans, </em>and A.

In one the statement is made that relator can add nothing to the brief filed in this court in Ex Parte Saylors, No. 3701 on our docket. We are not in accord with the point in the brief in that case which might be applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">In the other brief on file for relator appears an extended argument based on the provisions of the statute relative to parole which may be accorded to one who has been incarcerated in the penitentiary for a certain length of time and who presents a record showing he has behaved himself. The points raised in this brief are too speculative and have so little application as to not call for review at our hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">Article 815 of our Code of Criminal Procedure provides that one who has been convicted and given a punishment of fifteen years or less in the penitentiary, may make bail pending appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>This relator was given a punishment by the verdict of the jury amounting to forty-five years. We think him not entitled to bail. The provisions of Sec. 11 of Art. 1 of our Constitution, which are referred to and invoked by relator, in our opinion, have no application. The statement therein that \u201cAll prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offenses when the proof is evident,\u201d etc., has reference to prisoners before conviction. Prisoners after conviction are not guaranteed the right of bail. Ex Parte Ezell, 40 Texas, 451; Ex Parte Schwartz, 2 Tex. Crim. App. 74; Wamock v. State, 6 Tex. Crim. App. 450; Ex Parte McCorkle, 29 Tex. Crim. App. 20, 13 S. W. 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The application for writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
