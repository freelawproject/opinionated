Wherefore, the petitioner prayed that the said Betton might be ordered to render and settle his account of his guardianship in the probate court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-11\">Betton appeared, in pursuance of an order of notice, and objected to the prayer of the petition, and thereupon produced as evidence of a settlement between the guardian and ward, a writing, signed by the parties, of which the following is a copy: \u201c Aug. 16, 1838. Then reckoned and settled Thornton Betton and George Kittredge all matters and dealings while said Betton was guardian of said George, and as to all matters and dealings, services and moneys advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>by said Betton in the several lawsuits in which said George has been interested, wherein said Betton has been counsel, and find due said Betton the sum of twenty-three hundred dollars.\u201d The execution of this writing \u201c having been admitted, and having been in no way impeached,\u201d it was decreed by the court of probate \u201c that no farther account of his said guardianship be ordered or required of said Thornton Betton, and that said petition be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">From this decree the petitioner claimed an appeal, setting forth as reasons therefor, 1. That Betton should have been required to produce and settle a full account of his guardianship. 2. That he had rendered no account in said court, or elsewhere, although he had received nearly $10,000 worth of property of the ward. 3. That the settlement with his ward and the giving of said receipt was obtained by fraud, importunity and undue influence. 4. That at the time of settlement, the relation, duties, obligations and influences of guardian and ward continued between them, Betton still having the custody and control of the goods and estate of said George. <em>5. </em>That at the same time the relation of attorney and client existed, or had existed just before, and for a long time. 6. That from these causes Betton had such influence or control over his ward and his affairs as greatly to diminish and impair, or to overcome his capacity to assert and maintain his rights, &amp;c. 7. That at the time of the alleged settlement it was agreed that the account should be at any time opened on request. 8. That when the receipt was given, Betton\u2019s guardian\u2019s account was confused with other accounts, so that his ward could not distinguish between them, or know what did belong to his account; and because said George was on farther reflection and examination in his life-time greatly dissatisfied with said supposed settlement, and intended to, and if he had lived would, have insisted on the account being opened, and equitably adjusted. 9. That Betton never exhibited to said George any orderly account, nor in any way furnished him the means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>properly judging of his proceedings as guardian. 10. That in settling, said George was charged with $1500, <em>\u201c </em>for board-bill, services, and J. Thorn\u2019s bill, without saying what was due on the several accounts separately, and no such sum being due. 11. That in the settlement., the ward was erroniously charged with these items, viz. : $2802.62 on account of certain notes to Betton, .(when given of the value of .about $550,) and of $1389.17 for advances, and of $863.45 paid to sundry persons on his account; also $2341.99 as paid by him to sundry persons named, some of which were \u25a0entered twice. 12. That Betton was not in that settlement charged with divers sums and items, as he should have been, viz. : the price of real and personal estate sold or appropriated by him, and the amount of various demands collected by him on notes, accounts, and' for rents, &amp;c. 13. That Betton was not charged with a large balance of interest justly due from him. 14. That .there was a balance due from Betton on the guardian account more than large enough to pay any indebtedness to him from said George on any other account. 15. That a large balance is in justice and equity due from him to his ward\u2019s estate. 16. That said .George, on said alleged settlement was charged with large sums of money without any cause or consideration. 17. That a note given by George to Betton for about $3000, secured by mortgage on real estate, given on no other consideration than the pretence of securing moneys \u201c which the said Bet-ton had advanced to said George, and for said Betton\u2019s services, and for the purpose of farther advances and services,\u201d was not wholly cancelled and given up on said supposed settlement. 18. That such settlement was made secretly between Betton and George, and said receipt executed without the knowledge, approbation or advice of any friend or relation of said George, and while the relation of attorney .and client subsisted betwee.n .them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">Betton died September 1,6, 1841, before the entry of the appeal in this court, and his estate was represented insolvent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>His executrix having been cited to come in, <em>H. F. French </em>and <em>Christie, </em>on her behalf, moved the court to dismiss the appeal, \u00cd. On the ground that the ward having attained his majority, and settled with and discharged the guardian, the authority of the judge of probate was at an end, and he could not require another settlement. But if the judge might require an account, the guardian is to account only when ordered ; it is a matter within the discretion of the court, and the decision of the judge is final. 2. Because the statute of 1822, <em>N. H. Laws, Ed. </em>1830, <em>p. </em>364, provides that no action shall be sustained against the executor or administrator of an insolvent estate, except as is provided in that act, which gives no such remedy as this. The estate having been decreed to be administered as an insolvent estate, the claim should go before the commissioner.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-5\"><em>James Bell, </em>and <em>Porter, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7-\">contended that by statute guardians were required to settle their accounts in the probate court, and to respond to the ward; that the probate court was a court of equity having power to investigate this settlement and see whether it is just, and for this purpose it will look behind the receipt, and that the representation of insolvency could not affect this proceeding.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-6\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsY\">We are of opinion that the motion to dismiss this appeal cannot prevail. Betton was guardian, and his guardianship bond required that he should render an account when required in the probate court. This he has never done. Being cited for that purpose, he appeared and produced evidence of a settlement with the ward and a discharge by him ; and this satisfied the judge <em>of </em>probate that he ought not to be required to settle a farther account. But this settlement was not a compliance with the condition of the bond, and did not debar the judge of probate from requiring a settlement to be made in court, if the circumstances of the case were such as to require a farther settlement*. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>If there were fraud in the settlement with the ward, that might vitiate the settlement entirely, and leave the case to be proceeded in as if it had not been made. If errors and mistakes had occurred they ought to be corrected; and a proper mode of correction may be to require the guardian to account for what he had thus not accounted for. Whether the error arose from omission or over-charge, it may be reached in that way. If the error be one of omission, the guardian has not accounted to that extent. If it be by over-charge on his part, by means of that charge he retains so much of the estate of the ward in his hands. In either case, therefore, there may still be an account to render. Or, in another form, the account which has been settled out of court may be required to be brought into the probate court, if the guardian relies upon that settlement, and the ward (or in this case his administrator) be permitted, in the language of the courts of equity, to \u201c surcharge and falsify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The death of Betton and the representation of insolvency does not take away the jurisdiction of the probate court to require the settlement of the account. This is not a suit within the meaning of the statute. The settlement of an account is the proper mode to ascertain the sum for which a guardian or an executor or administrator is chargeable in the probate court. If proceedings at law may not afterwards be maintained against the executrix in this case upon the bond, by reason of the representation of insolvency, this furnishes no reason why the proper accounting should not be had to lay the foundation of a claim, to be presented to the commissioner. And, besides, this is the proper mode in ordinary cases to lay the foundation for proceedings against the sureties in the guardianship bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Where a guardian might, if living, have rendered or been required to render an account, his executor or administrator, on his decease should render it, and may be cited for that purpose. Here the guardian had been cited before his death, but it is not necessary that the proceedings should abate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>new proceedings be commenced. The executrix is well made a party by being cited in to render the account if the testator should have rendered one.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Whether any farther account shall be required, and, if any, whether there shall be an entire account of the guardianship, or whether the amount shall be only in relation to the errors and mistakes shown to have occurred, must depend upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">After the delivery of this opinion, the parties proceeded to take evidence, from which it appeared that Betton, who had previously been guardian <em>ad lilem </em>for George Kittredge, was appointed guardian in the probate court, November 6, 1832. George Kittredge became of full age, March 31, 1835. After that time Betton was counsel for him in certain matters litigated in court. The parties were engaged two or three days in making the settlement, which included all matters between them, and was closed September 16, 1838. Kittredge expressed his satisfaction with the settlement upon different occasions after it was made. He died in Michigan, April 28, 1840, having removed to that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">A memorandum found among his papers after his death, containing some indication of his dissatisfaction with the settlement, appeared to have been the cause of the present proceeding: but there was no evidence that he had made any request for the correction of any errors, or expressed any dissatisfaction to Betton.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">No regular guardianship account was produced or appeared to have been made, but the appellant offered in evidence divers papers which had the appearance of having been made the basis of the settlement in part, and to have gone at tbe time into the possession of George Kittredge, from which it seemed probable that there must have been errors and overcharges in the settlement. There was evidence tending to show that George Kittredge was not a yonng man of business habits, but nothing to show that he mig ht not have fully examined and understood the accounts presented.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A74\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>Porter, </em>(with whom were <em>James Bell </em>and <em>Pillsbury,) </em>for\u2019 the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Ayg\">after an examination of the evidence to show' that there were errors and over-charges, and that Betton inust have taken advantage of the confidence of Kittredge; contended that Betton by his bond was bound to settle his' guardianship account before the judge of probate. This he has never done. 2 <em>Stoj'y\u2019s Eq. </em>&lt;\u00a7&gt; 1353. We suppose that .judges of probate in this state have substantially the same' powers and duties as the court of chancery in England. In 1 <em>/Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 </em>523, the broad principle is laid down that mistake, omission, accident or fraud, or undue advantage, vitiate\u2019 all accounts stated between whatever parties. We think the' evidence brings us within this principle. But we contend that we may call tipon Betton or his representative to settle his guardianship account in the probate court, as matter of right, without shewing the settlement with George to be tainted by accideu t, mistake, omission or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">In cases between attorney and client, the <em>onus </em>of proving' the account corree t is not on the client but on the attorney. 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. </em>&lt;\u00a7&gt; 3 06 <em>to </em>315. So between trustee and <em>cestui que trust, </em>it lies on the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"AGt\">In cases between guardians and wards, courts of equity' will not permit transactions to stand which occur within a short period after the minority has ceased; nor unless all the' duties attached to the situation have been performed, the accounts between them fully settled, and the estate put from under the guardia n\u2019s control. The other side may say that, in this case, the intermediate period was not short. The time is but of little mom ient. The true question is, did George, by the lapse of time, become more, or less independent of his guardian ? In this point of view it is proper to advert to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>circumstances of the case, and to the letter of attorney authorizing Betton to dispose at his discretion and pleasure of all George\u2019s real estate ; and while all this was transacting, no guardianship account had been settled, but this first duty of a guardian had been postponed till George, by the entaglemeut and <em>finesse </em>of the guardian, had lost the moral power of asserting his rights against his guardian, supposing he understood them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>. Upon the evidence offered, the appellant moved that the\u2019 appellee should be required to present and settle an account of the guardianship, as if no settlement had been made between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"AyL6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Now to enable a guardian and ward to stand on equal ground, and deal with each other at \u201c arms length,\u201d as it is phrased, it is pre-requisite that the guardianship account be settled and the estate delivered up to the ward. Until this is done, lapse of time operates against, rather than in favor of the ward.</p>\n<p id=\"AAQ\">The reason of the English rule laid down in 2 <em>Williams\u2019 Executors </em>1138, that executors shall have no allowance, may well be urged in illustrating the danger of such settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahe\">The 4th volume of the <em>Law Reporter </em>155, gives this abstract from 1 <em>Meigs' R. </em>342. \u201cA receipt obtained by a guardian from his ward, acknowledging satisfaction of all demands against him, though given after the majority of the ward, will be no bar to the guardian\u2019s accounting in equity with the ward.\u201d See 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 </em>308, as to dealings by a trustee with his <em>cestui que </em>trust; and the law as to a receipt in full given to an administrator by an heir, or distributee, as stated by Ch. J. <em>Shaw </em>in <em>Wood &amp; a. </em>vs. <em>Bard, </em>4 <em>Law R. </em>359, <em>S. C. </em>3. <em>Met. </em>74. Such a receipt is no bar to requiring him to render and settle an account in the probate court; its validity can only be tried in a suit by the signer to recover his share of the estate, and can have no greater effect than if it had been given for a sum certain. Now our position has always been, that we are entitled, the receipt or settlement notwithstanding, to have a settlement in the probate court; and this we think the authorities sustain. But if the law is otherwise in this state, we put our case in full confidence upon the evidence adduced, that mistakes, omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>sions, undue advantage and fraud are intermingled, in no small measure, in most of the transactions <em>by this </em>guardian with his ward; and especially in the \u201csettlement\u201d after the \u2022 ward had attained his majority.</p>\n<p id=\"A93m\">An inability to sustain the settlement can not change or abrogate the legal duty to account. We are not to suifer by reason of the other party\u2019s negligence to keep books or accounts. 1 <em>Story's Eq. </em>\u00a7 448.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ato\"><em>H. F. </em>French, for the executrix, replied and argued,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AYs\">1. That there is no evidence of fraud or undue advantage. 2. That there is not proof that the papers produced by the appellant were the full papers used at the settlement. 3. That the errors pointed out by the appellant on these papers are capable of explanation without presuming fraud. 4. That the bondsmen can not be charged on account of errors, if these errors do not prove a balance due to George at <em>all </em>times after he was of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Parker, C. J. We do not see any cause, upon farther consideration, to change the views we have heretofore entertained and expressed, respecting the proper mode of proceeding in this case. We have no doubt that the judge of probate might have ordered, and, if cause had not been shewn to the contrary, it would have been his duty to have ordered an entire account; for the condition of the bond required an account to be rendered in the probate court. What the judge of probate might have done upon the hearing of the petition before him, this court, sitting as a court of probate, may do on the appeal. But a ward, who has become of full age, may receive the money due him arid give a receipt for it without an accounting in the probate court; and, if he pursue such course several years after be becomes of age, instead of having a regular account rendered, he is not entitled afterwards to insist that the guardian, who stands with a discharge in his hand, the fairness of which is unimpeached, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>should be required to state and place upon the records of the probate court the items of a <em>settled </em>account; and the court should not require it. The administrator of the ward\u2019s estate can stand in no better situation than the ward himself, in this particular. The burden is therefore clearly on the part of the appellant to impeach the settlement which has been made, before he can ask the court to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We have examined the evidence which he has adduced for this purpose, and are of opinion that the settlement is not so far impeached as to require that a full account should be rendered, more especially as the guardian himself is now dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The testimony fails to show that George Kittredge, the former ward, had not a sufficient knowledge of business to understand and settle an account of that character. He may not have been a young man of business habits, but his general intelligence is not impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The probable influence of the guardian might have furnished a ground of objection, if the account had been settled soon after the ward became of age, but the settlement appears to have been made more than three years afterwards <em>\u2022 </em>and if the influence may not be supposed to have ceased after that lapse of time, it would be difficult to say that a settlement between a guardian and his former ward at any time, however remote, could escape suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Nor can the fact that the relation of attorney and client existed afterwards, and that the settlement embraced matters connected with that relation, affect this case, without some more evidence of probable influence upon the guardianship account from that cause, than is shown in this case. No accounts between the parties, except such as relate to the guardianship, are involved in the present proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In addition to this, George Kittredge lived more than a year and a half after the settlement, without instituting any proceedings, or even making any claim for the correction of errors. If among his papers there was a memorandum indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>citing dissatisfaction with <em>the </em>settlement, neither he nor his representatives, after such a lapse of time, should ask for an entire accounting anew, except upon evidence of fraud, even if Betton were now living.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The evidence fails to show fraud. It seems from the testimony before us that there were errors in the settlement. It is probable that some matters were, in fact, twice charged, once in specific items, and again by being included in a general charge of a bill of costs. This may have been by design ; but the evidence does not show it, and we cannot presume it. Perhaps if Betton were now living, we might consider his omission to give explanations of some of the matters which appear to be erroneous, as authorizing more decided inferences against him. The omissions of his executrix to give explanations of matters included in the settlement respecting which, from the nature of the case, she cannot be presumed to have equal knowledge, is certainly much less significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">There may be an over-charge in a large item for the board of the ward, but the item is one that would be likely to attract attention and be canvassed by the parties on the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">There are some other matters, in relation to which it is rendered probable that mistakes may have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The settlement ought not to protect Betton, or his estate, in charging what was not due or more than was due. All claims arising from errors, mistakes, omissions and even overcharges, should be accounted for; and this is as far as we can go. The account may be considered as in the probate court, and the appellant may object to it, as on leave to surcharge and falsify. It is said that no full statement of the account as settled is to be found among the papers of the ward, or those of the guardian ; but divers memoranda in the handwriting of the guardian, and bearing marks of having been used upon the settlement, are among the papers of the ward. If the ward has not taken and preserved a regular statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>of the items, and can not find evidence of one among the papers of the deceased guardian or elsewhere, that may or may not be unfortunate for his estate. His administrator, certainly, can not so readily and fully show what, if any, errors and mistakes occurred. But this neglect, whether it be on one or both sides, to preserve a statement in detail of the settlement, can furnish no reason why we should require the executrix of the guardian, at this late date, to take upon the estate the burden of now stating and vouching a new account. It may be to the prejudice of the guardian\u2019s estate that a full statement of the settlement is not to be found. If so, it only suffers thus far from the neglect of the guardian. Enough is shown to put the estate on its defence against such evidence of errors in the settlement as may be produced by the appellant. And for the purpose of an investigation of these matters, the court will appoint an auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The decree of the court was, <em>in substance, </em>that, it appearing that an accounting and settlement was had between the guardian and ward in their lifetime, purporting to include all matters for which Betton was accountable as guardian, and $2300 found due to Betton and so certified by them in writing, August 16, 1838; and there also being evidence tending to show that there were divers errors, mistakes and over-charges in Betfon\u2019s guardian account, on which that settlement was founded ; that the decree of the judge of probate be reversed, and that the appellant have leave to surcharge and falsify that account and settlement, so far as the guardian\u2019s account is involved <em>therein; </em>and that the executrix render to the appellant a guardianship account in the premises, and therein account for, and be charged with all sums^for which it is made to appear that Betton ought to have accounted as guardian, and for which he has not so accounted to said George Kittredge, and also for the amount of all over-charges in any matter relating to his accounts as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>guardian in the settlement aforesaid, and for all errors and mistakes occurring therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">An auditor was also appointed to take such account, and to report to this court as soon as may be.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
