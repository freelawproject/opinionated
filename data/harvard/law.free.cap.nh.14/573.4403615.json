The writ was a writ of attachment. The declaration alleged, that the demandants, in their capacity and right of administrators, were seized in fee within twenty years, and that the defendant disseized them. Plea in abatement, enrolling the writ, return and summons. The latter described the demandants as administrators, and the action as a plea of land, wherein the plaintiffs demanded the tract of land, but contained nothing farther to show what seizin the plaintiffs relied on, and no allegation of an averment that the defendant disseized them. The plea then alleged, that the summons did not briefly give the defendant the same information that the dec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>laration gave more at large, and contain the substance thereof in this, to wit: \u201cthat the said declaration alleges that the demandants say, that within twenty years last past, they themselves, in their capacity and right of administrators as aforesaid, were seized and possessed of the demanded tenements, as of fee and right, taking the profits thereof to the value of fifty dollars by the year, and of which the declaration alleges that the said David disseized them; but the summons aforesaid does not allege that the demandants were <em>seized </em>of the said tenements, within twenty years last past, nor does the said summons allege that the said David, in any manner <em>disseized </em>the demandants of the said tenement.\u201d Demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-5\">Livermore, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUV\">The provision of the statute on which the exceptions taken in the plea are founded, is found in one passed July 2, 1829, at the 11th section. <em>N. H. Laws (Ed. </em>1830) 92. It requires that the summons \u201cshall briefly give the same information-to the defendant which the declaration gives more at large, and shall contain the substance thereof.\u201d The summons then should not contain the whole declaration, nor formal matters not traversable. But this is not all. The summons is sufficient, if from it a man of common sense, knowing the law, may be informed what the declaration (if correctly drawn)contains, so as to enable him to draw just such another. Such is our old and approved summons on a note; \u201c <em>in a plea of the case founded on your note dated\u201d </em>&amp;c., <em>&amp;c.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-7\">In the present case, the summons states that the plaintiffs, as administrators in a plea of land, demand of the tenant the premises described. In New-Hampshire there is but one plea of land, viz.: \u201c a writ of entry in which the demandant counts upon his own seizin, and a disseizin by the tenant.\u201d <em>Richardson\u2019s Notes on Real Actions, ch. </em>4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-8\">An estate for years can not be demanded in a plea of land, and as to an estate for life, a demandant can recover, according to his title, although he demand a greater estate. The sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>gesti\u00f3n from the court that the tenant was left in ignorance by this summons, whether an estate in fee simple, for life, or for years was demanded, is therefore not applicable. Besides, the plea does not state as a variance our omission of the estate, of which we allege our seizin. <em>Jackson on Real Actions.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-5\">The second variance shown is, that the summons does not allege that the tenants, <em>in any </em>manner, disseized the demand-ants. Should the summons have stated in <em>what </em>manner the tenant disseized ? If not, the variance shewn is immaterial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-6\"><em>Goodall </em>Morrison, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b575-7\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQq\">The statute of January <em>2, </em>1829, which is applicable to this case, enacts, among other things, that the summons shall set forth the sum in the note or bond declared on, &amp;c., and \u201cshall briefly give the same information to the defendant, which the declaration gives more at large, and shall contain the substance thereof;\u201d otherwise the writ shall abate. <em>N. H. Laws (Ed. </em>1830) 92. Whether this is a wise provision or not, it does not belong to us to determine. It is sufficient that the language of the statute is imperative ; to which it might be added, that the legislature have seen fit to adhere to the policy of it, notwithstanding an attempt to procure a change mitigating its rigor. The only question for our consideration is, whether the summons is within its provisions; and we are clear that it is not. It does not give to the defendant information whether the plaintiffs claim on their own seizin, or that of their intestate; nor whether the seizin upon which they count is in fee or freehold, or even for a term, and this is certainly material information relative to the cause of action stated in the writ. It is said that the plea does not allege as a variance the omission to state the estate demanded; but we need not inquire whether this is or is not substantially alleged, as the omission to state whether the demandants, who sue as administrators, counted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>upon their own seizin personally or as administrators, or upon the seizin of the intestate, must be held fatal. 6 <em>N.
