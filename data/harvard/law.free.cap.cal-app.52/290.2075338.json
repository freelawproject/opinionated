The pleading also sets up a communication from respondents by which they notify appellant that the agreement is rescinded upon certain stated grounds. It is alleged that appellant has at all times been ready, able, and willing to perform, has performed, and offers to perform all of the conditions of the agreement on his part to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Respondents claim that the amended complaint is insufficient because no facts are alleged going to show that the agreement was, as to. them, just and reasonable and that the consideration received by them for the agreement was adequate. Such a statement of facts is, of course, necessary in every complaint for specific performance (Civ. Code, sec. 3391, subds. 1, 2; <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Tomasini, </em>168 Cal. 234 [142 Pac. 67]), and the allegation, in terms, that an agreement is just and reasonable as to the defendant and that he has received an adequate consideration for it states merely a conclusion <em>(Joyce </em>v. <em>Tomasini, supra). </em>The pleading now before us satisfies one of the requirements of the authorities, for it alleges the value of the land agreed to be conveyed <em>(Lynn </em>v. <em>Knob Hill Imp. Co., </em>177 Cal. 56 [169 Pac. 1009]). <bracketnum><em>[2]</em></bracketnum><em> </em>Not only, however, does it not allege the period over which the notes were to run, nor how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>many notes were given, nor whether they were payable in installments, great or small, but there is no showing as to the ability of appellant to pay the notes, nor any allegation of any fact negativing the possibility that the instruments are so much waste paper. These notes, secured by a mortgage upon the very land agreed to be conveyed, were the only consideration for the transfer and, short of a showing of some value behind the paper, respondents\u2019 agreement to convey was made solely upon their faith in the value of the land itself. Surely, under such a state of affairs, no adequate consideration was received by respondents and the agreement was, as to them, unjust and unreasonable <em>(Cummings </em>v. <em>Roeth, </em>10 Cal. App. 144 [101 Pac. 434] ; <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Markarian, </em>175 Cal. 37 [165 Pac. 3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We have not overlooked the fact that appellant, while in possession, placed certain valuable improvements upon the land. That circumstance cannot be considered in this action <em>(Windsor </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>124 Cal. 492 [57 Pac. 386]), for the reason that \u201cthe point of time to which the question of adequacy [of consideration] must relate is the time of the formation of the contract\u201d <em>(Morrill </em>v. <em>Everson, </em>77 Cal. 114 [19 Pac. 190]). Nothing is availed appellant by reason of the fact that equities arise in his favor because of his expenditures upon the improvements, as \u201cinadequacy of consideration is, under the law of California, an independent and distinct ground for denying specific performance\u201d <em>(Haddock </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>171 Cal. 59 [151 Pac. 1140]).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The respondents ask us, in the event that we sustain them in their contention that the amended complaint is insufficient, to modify the judgment in such manner as to show a judgment in their favor on the merits, the judgment actually entered being for a dismissal; but we cannot direct a judgment in the cause which will preclude the possible maintenance of another action by appellant upon a different complaint, showing a meritorious cause of action <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>5 Cal. 428; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Mellus, </em>59 Cal. 444; <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Templeton, </em>152 Cal. 148 [13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 579, 92 Pac. 78]).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Finlayson, P. J., and Craig, \u00a1J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
