It follows from what we have said in the case of <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Assn. </em>that the election for the year 1919 was void, and that there should be a new election to fill the office now held by said respondent Healey.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Richards, J., and Waste, P.
