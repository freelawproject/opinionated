The sole ground for the application is that the petitioner has \u201cbeen given to know and understand\u201d that the warden at the state prison will not discharge him from custody and restore bim to his liberty until a date some time later than the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>upon which he contends he is lawfully entitled to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><bracketnum><em>[1]</em></bracketnum><em> </em>There are two reasons why we cannot entertain this petition at this time: First, we are not in a position to assume that the warden of the state prison will not act in accordance with law and discharge the petitioner, if it be, as alleged in his petition, that he is entitled to a discharge on the sixth day of April, 1921. The second is that the term for which the petitioner was sentenced has not actually expired, and until it has, the petitioner is not illegally detained <em>(Ex parte Ross, </em>82 Cal. 109, [22 Pac. 1086].)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Application for the writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
