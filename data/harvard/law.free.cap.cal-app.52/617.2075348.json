No principle seems to be better settled in this state' than that \u201cnegligence may be charged in general terms; that is, what was done being stated, it is sufficient to say it was negligently done, without stating the particular omission which rendered the act negligent. \u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Buttner, </em>90 Cal. 99, [27 Pac. 29]; <em>Stein </em>v. <em>United Railroads, </em>159 Cal. 368, [113 Pac. 663]; <em>Bergen </em>v. <em>Tulare County Power Co., </em>173 Cal. 709, [161 Pac. 269].) <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Neither is the complaint defective in failing to allege facts showing that defendants\u2019 negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. It clearly appears from the allegation that defendants were operating their automobile in a negligent manner, and that by reason of such negligence their automobile collided with that of plaintiff and thereby caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Respondents also argue that, since plaintiff, in addition to the use of the word \u201cnegligent,\u201d alleged that defendants\u2019 operation of the automobile was wrongful and unlawful, he should have specified particularly what law was violated and wherein their act was wrongful. No authorities are cited in support of this contention, and we are unable to perceive any merit therein. Clearly, as shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>by the complaint, the action is based upon defendants\u2019 negligent act in operating their automobile, and the words \u201ccareless, reckless, wrongful, and unlawful\u201d are nothing more than other expressions of the alleged act of negligence, and since their use neither adds to nor their omission detracts from the sufficiency of the complaint, they should, where used in this connection, be disregarded as surplusage. If defendants\u2019 act was negligent, it was likewise wrongful and unlawful in that by such negligent act they, without right or warrant of law, caused damage to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The complaint, if true, shows that defendants were guilty of negligence in operating their automobile, and that as a result of such negligence they caused it to collide with that of plaintiff, which was the proximate cause of the injury complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The court erred in sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Conrey, P. J., and James, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
