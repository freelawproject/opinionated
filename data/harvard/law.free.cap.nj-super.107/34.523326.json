Strelecki, </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. 257 (Law Div. </em>1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">We are in agreement with the Law Division that the statutory requirement of a reciprocal remedy for New Jersey residents by the state of the claimant\u2019s residence, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6-62, is not here met since New York, whose statute requires physical contact in a \u201chit and run\u201d case, would consequently not afford a New Jersey resident relief under its comparable statute <em>on the same facts </em>as here involved. See <em>Betz v. Director of Div. of Motor Vehicles, 27 N. J. </em>324, 330 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
