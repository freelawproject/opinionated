J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AvO\">Plaintiff landlord sued defendant tenant for damage to the tenanted building in Hillside, Hew Jersey, which resulted from a fire allegedly caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. The case was tried before a jury. After 12 minutes of deliberation it returned a unanimous verdict in favor of plaintiff for $17,000, the stipulated amount of the damage. Defendant timely appealed the judgment based upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Reversal is sought on two grounds. First, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it allowed into evidence, over objection, testimony by Fire Captain Mateer of the Hillside Fire Department that, in his investigation of the fire, he was told sometime after the fire by one of two employees of defendant, who were in the building when and where the fire occurred, that the fire was caused, in essence, by the use of gasoline, which the fire captain concluded was a \u201ccareless use of gasoline.\u201d The fire captain was unable to identify which one of the two employees made this statement to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The second claim of reversible error is that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing plaintiff\u2019s attorney to lead unduly plaintiff\u2019s witness, Fire Captain Mateer, in the critical area adverted to above, over defendant\u2019s repeated objections thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The record discloses the following facts. During the early afternoon of July 12, 1966 a fire broke out at the premises owned by plaintiff and leased to defendant for the garaging and maintenance of its trucks. Vincent Haddeo, a foreman or maintenance supervisor in the employ of defendant for 15 years, and Walter Marcin, a mechanic in the employ of defendant for nine years, were the only two persons in the garage occupied by defendant immediately prior to and at the time the fire began. There was \u201cjust one\u201d vehicle in the garage, \u201ca tractor.\u201d There was no trailer attached to it. Defendant owned the tractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The tractor had been in the garage three to four weeks. It was there for a complete overhaul \u2014 \u201ctransmission, rear, tires, brakes.\u201d Marcin testified, \u201cEverything was completed outside of the tail light. All we had to do was take it outside and adjust the governor on it.\u201d That would have been the next job. The vehicle had been painted inside the garage; it had remained within the building during the three or more weeks of the complete overhaul.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">At the time of the fire Marcin was replacing the tail light; he had started to take off the old tail light. It was to be replaced by a new assembly, which was on the floor \u201cright alongside of\u201d Marcin. He had only started \u201cto twist one bolt\u201d when he saw the fire. Haddeo was on the right side of the truck. Marcin could see only his feet. Marcin testified that he was in the back of the tractor, in a \u201csquatted\u201d position, when he saw \u201ca big ball of flame\u201d coming, moving across the floor toward them, from the left front of the building, \u201cas you look at the front from inside the building back toward the left front of the truck.\u201d Marcin described the floor as \u201cclean as a whistle\u201d and the ball of fire as being \u201cabout two feet.\u201d He yelled to Haddeo, \u201cEire on the deck,\u201d jumped up, and he and Haddeo ran for the fire extinguisher to try to put it out. Hot succeeding, both men ran and called the fire department. Marcin called from \u201cnext door\u201d and Haddeo phoned from the \u201cback room\u201d of the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Neddeo testified that immediately prior to the fire he was <em>\u201cin the </em>process of removing what is called a pressure sensitive stencil, this is self-adhesive.\u201d He was half-way through the removal of that on the right door when the fire took place. He denied telling Captain Mateer that he had washed the truck down with gasoline. He explained, \u201cIn the trade you don\u2019t use solvent, and gasoline is a solvent, to remove over-spray or anything from a vehicle, you can\u2019t even use soap and water, not only gasoline.\u201d This is so, said Haddeo, \u201cbecause it will dull the finish or probably lift it from the metal which it has been sprayed onto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Marein stated in his testimony that he \u00a3\u00a3believed\u201d there was one five-gallon can of gasoline, which was kept toward the front of the building \u00a3\u00a3by the door.\u201d He \u201cbelieved\u201d that it was in the building .on the day of the fire. The can had a \u201cscrew top.\u201d Marein testified that he knew the top was screwed on. The gasoline was used primarily for emergency calls \u201cwhen a truck breaks down and runs out of gas.\u201d It was also used \u201csometimes\u201d for washing parts. Marein testified that neither he nor Uaddeo had washed any parts that day in gasoline. While admitting that he smoked cigarettes, Marein swore that he was not smoking at the time when he was working behind the truck. The tractor itself had a gasoline tank on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The foregoing summary of the testimony of Marein and Uaddeo, the only two occupants of the garage when the fire began, leaves unanswered the question, \u201cWho started or what was the cause of the fire?\u201d Their actions, immediately before the ball of flame was first seen \u2014 Marein\u2019s removing a tail light assembly preparatory to its replacement with a new one and Naddeo\u2019s work effort at the right door in removing a pressure sensitive stencil, self-adhesive \u2014 do not establish a causal relationship to the fire. Yet, the fire did occur and these employees of defendant were the only two persons in the building at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">There was only 'one other witness, namely, Eire Captain Mateer. The testimony of this witness, objected to by de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>fendant in certain critical areas hereinafter discussed and admitted over objection, was crucial to a finding of liability. We shall first summarize it and then discuss the propriety of its admission by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Captain Mateer testified that he was in the firehouse about a block or two away from the scene of the fire, on the same street but on the opposite side thereof, when, at about <em>2 </em>:28 p.m., a pedestrian entered the firehouse and informed him that \u201cthere was a truck on fire down the street,\u201d pointing eastward. Assuming it was a fire in the street, he left the firehouse on an engine pumper, along with the driver and one other fireman on the rear step. Usually a full crew consists of five, but the vacation time and a man out sick left the captain undermanned, with only two fire fighters besides himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">As the fire-fighting trio pulled from the set-back firehouse into the street, the captain could see down the street to Eerro\u2019s garage and observed the cinder block building fully involved in fire. He could see smoke and flames coming from the building. As he approached he observed Naddeo coming out of the building in the smoke and fire, falling, \u201cactually being blown out of the building.\u201d Naddeo fell into the street, picked himself up and \u201cran toward my engine.\u201d Mateer went to Naddeo immediately. He asked Naddeo \u201cif there was anyone else in the building.\u201d Naddeo answered, \u201cNo.\u201d In his report of fire the fire captain noted also, \u201cHe [Naddeo] told me everyone was out but there was a tractor and <em>a lot of gasoline </em>in the building.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Captain Mateer did not ask Naddeo anything else at this point. His sole concern, he said, was to extinguish the fire, to save life and property. It took approximately a half-hour to extinguish the fire. But the captain was at the scene \u201cfor three hours.\u201d He stated that he talked \u201cto all employees in the company\u201d during that time. The captain testified that there were <em>three </em>employees there during the three hours \u2014 Marein, Naddeo and \u201ca third kid,\u201d described by him as \u201ca thin boy, tall thin kid.\u201d The third person was never further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>identified and did not appear as a witness at trial. The captain\u2019s reference to this hoy is directly at variance with the testimony of Marcin and Naddeo that they were the only two persons in the building when the fire started.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The captain testified that he spoke to Naddeo \u201cabout his condition, he was burned. I told him to get a doctor, I was a little bit concerned.\u201d Naddeo did not feel that this was immediately necessary. Mateer was positive that he spoke to both Marcin and Naddeo but, except in the particulars hereinabove mentioned, he did not specify when, during his three hours\u2019 presence the critical conversation hereinafter adverted to took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Captain Mateer was then asked if Marcin or Naddeo had told him what occurred. He knew that \u201cone of them\u201d had told him, but he could not recall \u201cwhich of the two\u201d it was. Defendant\u2019s attorney thereupon objected to the captain\u2019s further testifying as to the conversation, since he was unable to identify the particular employee who made the statement. Defendant\u2019s objection was argued outside the presence of the jury. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney was permitted to place on the record his proffer of proof. The trial court overruled the objection, ruling that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">* * * any <em>admission </em>testified to by either employee concerning this fire and their work at that particular time is admissible and is authorized and within the scope of their employment so, to speak. There is no question in my mind concerning admissibility; the question is whether or not you are being disadvantaged by the failure of the plaintiff to identify the person alleged to have made the <em>admission. </em>[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The trial judge found no disadvantage, in that there were only two employees involved and defendant had the power to produce them and ask them whether they made the statement to which the captain was about to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Upon the return of the jury the question was posed again by plaintiff\u2019s attorney to Mateer as to what \u201ceither of these gentlemen had said when inquiry was made as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>to what had occurred or what happened.\u201d Mateer testified \u201cone\u201d of them said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">They had stenciled the name of the trucking firm on the door of the truck and there was an over-spray of paint on another section of the truck and they were washing it off with gasoline * * * there was a flash of fire and the fire developed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The next day the captain made up his customary report and set forth therein as the cause of the fire: \u201cCareless use of gasoline.\u201d He interpreted this to mean \u201cto use gasoline for any purpose other than to run a cumbustible engine.\u201d The report gave no details and recited no reason for the conclusion, \u201cCareless use of gasoline.\u201d Nor did the report contain the statement allegedly made by \u201cone\u201d of the two \u201cemployees that they were using gasoline\u201d to wipe down over-spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">After Captain Mateer had testified, Marcin was recalled. He admitted having had a conversation with the captain on July 12, 1966, but he stated that he did not tell the captain he had washed the truck down with gasoline, or any part of the truck. He explained that there was a new paint job on the truck and \u201cif we used gasoline on that paint it would take the gloss right oil it.\u201d The truck had been wiped down \u201cwith dry rags.\u201d This testimony coincided with that of Naddeo, noted above, in its denial that Captain Mateer had been told that the truck had been washed down with gasoline and in its explanation why gasoline would not be used on a newly painted truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The trial judge admitted the statement to the fire captain on the ground that it was an \u201cadmission\u201d by an agent (someone of the only two) and was, therefore, admissible against defendant principal. He noted that allowing this evidence did not disadvantage defendant because it could, as it did, call both of the two employees to deny making the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ment. Additionally, both testified as to why gasoline would not have been used for the stated purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The general rule in this State has been that, absent a <em>\"res gestae\u201d </em>declaration, \u201cThe admissions of an agent bind a principal only when within the scope of the agency or when they are authorized by the principal.\u201d <em>Hansen v. Eagle-Picher Lead Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>133, 145 (1951). No claim is made that the statement made to the fire captain, sometime within the three hours while he was at the scene, was a spontaneous utterance to justify its admissibility under the <em>\u201cres gestae\u201d </em>exception. In <em>Hansen </em>statements made by defendant\u2019s superintendent and by its personnel manager <em>after </em>the accident were held to be inadmissible because they were \u201cnot shown to have been <em>authorized </em>or made <em>during </em>the performance of the duties of their employment; that they relate to the employer\u2019s business is not enough.\u201d If <em>Hansen </em>still governed, a similar result would be mandated here, because there was no proof that Marcin, a mechanic, or Naddeo, a maintenance supervisor, had been authorized, expressly or impliedly, to make any admission against their employer\u2019s interest. Nor did either make the alleged statement \u201cduring the performance of their duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In <em>Cafone v. Spiniello Construction Co., </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>590, 604-606 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), we acknowledged the rule laid down in <em>Hansen </em>but noted that it was not necessary to prove that the agent had \u201cexpress\u201d authority to make the admission. We ruled that statements made by an agent are admissible in evidence against _ the principal, stating: \u201cIf they are ordinary incidents of the position occupied by the agent, authority ought to be implied.\u201d (At 605). In that case statements made by the president and part owner of defendant to the police, who were conducting an investigation into an accident in the course of the company\u2019s operation, were held to have been made within the apparent ambit of his agency and, therefore, admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In <em>Carter v. Public Service Coord. Transport, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>379 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), we deemed inadmissible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>an admission against defendant bns company a statement by a bus driver. We relied upon the rule laid down in <em>Hansen v. Eagle-Picher Lead Co., supra. </em>The statement related to the bus driver\u2019s knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy, because of its bearing upon his exercise of reasonable care in preparing for her boarding the bus. But we noted (at 385) that \u201cBule 63(9) of the <em>Uniform, Rules of Evidence </em>would render the statement admissible, since it <em>related to a matter </em>within the scope of the agent\u2019s duty and was made while the driver was still employed as agent.\u201d <em>Rule </em>63(9) had not yet been adopted in New Jersey in 1957, when the <em>Garter </em>case was decided. Por that reason, we felt compelled to follow the exclusion required by such cases as <em>Hansen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Since then we have adopted, as part of our new rules of evidence, <em>R. </em>63(9). These new rules were put in force on September 11, 1967. The trial of the instant ease took place on October 38, 1968, thereby making the new rules of evidence applicable. <em>R. </em>63(9)(a) represents a departure from New Jersey law as represented by <em>Hansen v. Eagle-Picher Lead Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>133, 145\u2014146 (1951), and <em>Carter v. Public Service Coord. Transport, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>379 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). See <em>Comment </em>on <em>R. </em>63(9) (a) in <em>Report of the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on Evidence </em>(March 1963), at 165. The comment points out that the old rule excluding the admission by the agent had been severely criticized by outstanding scholars and in recent cases, citing <em>Martin v. Savage Truck Line, </em>121 <em>F. Supp. </em>417 (D. D. C. 1954), and <em>Grayson v. Williams, </em>256 <em>F.2d </em>61 (10 <em>Cir. </em>1958). <em>R. </em>63(9) (a) adds as a safeguard to protect against vengeful or vindictive accusations that the statement be made while the employment relationship continues. That safeguard was present in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We view <em>R. </em>63(9) (a) as sanctioning the admissibility of admissions made by agents when they are made before termination of the employer-employee relationship and when they relate to matters within the performance duties of the agent. The new rule is based upon the necessity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>arriving at the truth, common sense and public policy. \u201cTo continue the old restriction would be to immunize all principals from statements made by their working agents and employees who transact their business and who get into the accidents.\u201d See <em>Comment </em>on <em>B. </em>63 (9) (a), referred to above. The rule tends to guarantee the trustworthiness and reliability of the vicarious admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"> We conclude that the trial court ruled correctly in admitting the statement made by an agent of defendant to the fire captain in the course of his investigation, with reference to the employees\u2019 having washed off the over-spray of paint with gasoline, immediately before the fire. It matters not which one of the employees made the admission. Both denied it. Credibility was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Defendant next contends that plaintiff\u2019s witness, Captain Mateer, was unduly led by questions addressed to him and permitted to answer leading questions, over allegedly repeated objections by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> However, we would not regard the challenged leading as a basis for reversal herein. True, there was some leading, but it became necessary because of the captain\u2019s reference to the presence of <em>three </em>employees during his three hours at the scene, when there were only <em>tivo </em>employees of defendant in the premises at the time of the fire. While leading questions are generally not permitted on the direct examination of one\u2019s own witness, there is an area of permissible leading, within the discretion of the trial judge, to avoid confusion, to clarify testimony, or otherwise to bring out the truth in serving the cause of justice. <em>Williams v. Guerreri, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>60, 61 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947). We do not find herein any abuse or mistaken exercise of discretion by the trial judge as to this aspect of the case. Hor, as plaintiff points out in its brief, did defendant\u2019s attorney make the claimed \u201crepeated objections\u201d on the ground that the questions were \u201cleading.\u201d Objections were based on other grounds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>such as lack of identity of the particular employee who made the alleged statement to the fire captain. See <em>Shutka v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>381, 404 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962). An objection to testimony should be accompanied by the grounds therefor. <em>R. R. </em>4:47 (now <em>R. </em>1:7-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We note that defendant has made no claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Perhaps this was due to the fact that no motion for a new trial was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
