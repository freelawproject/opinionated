The Register of the State Land Office soon after issued a certificate of purchase to Miller, who, in 1868, sold a part of the tract, containing one hundred and forty-three and twenty-five one hundredths acres, to H. Block. The land was assessed to the estate of Miller, in 1870, and the tax not having been paid, a judgment was rendered on the 30th of May, 1871, in the District Court of Sacramento County, enforcing a lien for the tax on the land, less one hundred and forty-three acres sold to EL Block. An order of sale was issued, and the Sheriff sold the land described in the judgment, to H. Mahin, for the tax and costs. Mahin assigned his certificate of purchase to the relator, who, on the 2d day of December, 1872, obtained the Sheriff\u2019s deed. Duncan paid the State for the land described in his deed, and presented the deed to the Register of the State Land Office, on the 17th day of May, 1873, and demanded a patent for the land by him so purchased, but did not offer to surrender the certificate of purchase. The Register refused to issue a patent. Duncan then made this application for a writ of mandate to compel Robert Gardner, the Register, to issue to him a patent for the land by him purchased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">Section thirty-five hundred and nineteen of the Political Code provides that \u2018\u2018whenever final payment has been made for any tract of land, * * * the Register, upon the surrender of the certificate of purchase by the person entitled to the same, must prepare a patent for the land,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">Section two of the Act of March 27th, 1872 (Stats. 1871-2, p. 587), declares that \u201cwhen part payment only has been made for lands sold by this State, and certificates of purchase issued for the same, and said lands have been subsequently sold under execution, and a Sheriff\u2019s deed issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>therefor, the Register of the State Land Office is hereby directed to issue to the grantee named in said deed, or to his assigns, a patent for said lands, upon his producing and surrendering said Sheriff\u2019s deed and assignment, if any there be, and making full payment to the State for said lands.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-7\"><em>E.
