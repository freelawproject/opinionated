In 1868 the plaintiff commenced proceedings to condemn land for its track in Solano County, in which a large number of land owners were defendants, and among the number, John and Aphonia Adamson, the then owners of the tract of land belonging to the defendant when the present proceedings were commenced. For some reason, the Adamsons were not served with process, and a judgment was entered in said proceedings as to the other lands, but none as to the land of the Adamsons, who afterwards sold to the defendant here. Before the commencement of this action, the former action was dismissed as to the Adamsons. Prior to the commencement of this proceeding, the plaintiff, without the consent of the Adamsons, laid its track across the land, and the Adam-sons afterwards sold to this defendant. This action was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>menced October 15th, 1870. The amount of land sought to be taken, was eight and seven one hundredths acres. The Commissioners appointed to assess damages and benefits, assessed the value of the land taken in 1868, when the railroad track was constructed, at thirty dollars per acre, and its value, October 15th, 1870, when this action was commenced, at fifty dollars per acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">They also assessed the damages which that portion of the tract not taken sustained in 1868 by its severance from the part taken, at six hundred and sixty-seven dollars and fifty cents, and the benefits which accrued at the same time to that part of the tract not taken in consequence of the construction of the road, at the same sum. They made a like assessment of damages and benefits at the time this action was commenced, fixing each at one thousand one hundred and twelve dollars and fifty cents. They found that the benefits to the land not taken were merely its enhanced value, and that the contiguous lands were enhanced in value in the same way. They also found that the railroad track, when constructed in 1868, was imbedded in the soil, and the value of the superstructure constituting the track was two thousand two hundred and eleven dollars and twenty-four cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The Court below held that the defendant was entitled, to the value of his land taken at the time this action was commenced, but that in estimating its value, the worth of the improvements put on by the railroad company could not be included.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">The defendant asked the Court below to strike out the assessment of benefits to the land not taken, because they were not peculiar to the defendant\u2019s land, and to allow the defendant the value of the railroad track as a part of the value of his land taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Beatty &amp; </em>Denson, for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">A railroad track is such an improvement or superstructure as the law regards a fixture.

It further appears that before the hearing in the present proceeding the former proceeding was dismissed as to this tract, and that \u201cbefore the commencement of this proceeding\u201d the plaintiffs had constructed upon the land a railroad track, at their own expense, of the value of two thousand two hundred and eleven dollars and twenty-four cents, without the consent of the owner of the land, from whom the present defendant purchased. It is not expressly stated that the track was built whilst the order made in the proceeding of 1868, authorizing the plaintiffs to enter upon and retain the possession, was in <em>force; </em>but we infer that such was the fact. Bor does it appear on what ground or for what reason the former proceeding was dismissed. The Commissioners in the present case assessed the value of the land, at the commencement of the action, at the sum of four hundred and three dollars and fifty cents, exclusive of the railroad track, which they estimate to be of the value of two thousand two hundred and eleven dollars and twenty-four cents. This being a portion of a larger tract, they estimate the damages to that portion not taken at one thousand one hundred and twelve dollars and fifty cents, and the benefits which accrued to the part not taken, \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the enhancement of the value thereof, in consequence of the construction of the said road (there being no special benefits), at the sum of one thousand one hundred and twelve dollars and fifty cents.\u201d The Court below held that the value of the said road track, constructed by the plaintiffs, ought not to be estimated as a part of the value of the land taken, and excluded it from the computation, and also held that the benefits to the land not taken should be set off against the damages thereto. These rulings constitute the grounds of error relied upon on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The argument on behalf of the defendant on the first point is, that the plaintiffs, in constructing the railroad track, were trespassers, and that the track, being attached to the soil, became a part of the realty, and belonged <em>to </em>the <em>owner </em>of the land. Hence he claims that its value ought to be included in the estimate of damages, in like manner as though the defendant had himself built the road. But this proposition cannot be maintained. Neither the Constitution nor the statute contemplates that a person, whose land is taken in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, shall be entitled to anything beyond a \u201cjust compensation.\u201d He is to be paid the damage he actually suffers, and nothing more. But, to hold that, in addition to the fair value of the land taken, and such other damages as he may suffer by severing it from the remainder of his tract, he shall also recover the value of a railroad track, in the construction of which he never expended a dollar, and which was built by the plaintiffs at their own expense, would be to defeat the obvious intent of the statute by an over-technical construction of it. On the second point the proposition is, that it appears from the report of the Commissioners that there were no <em>special benefits </em>to the land not taken resulting from the construction of the said road; though they also find that it will thereby be enhanced in value in the sum of one thousand one hundred and twelve dollars and fifty cents. From this the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>counsel deduce the argument that, inasmuch as this land will only be benefited with other contiguous lands, and will receive no benefit peculiar to itself, it does not come within the rule which requires benefits to be set off against damages. In other words, they insist that the benefit must be <em>special </em>and peculiar to the particular tract\u2014something different from, and in excess of, the benefits resulting to other adjoining lands. But there is no valid reason for this distinction. The theory of the statute is, that the land owner shall receive a fair, just compensation for the damage he suffers, and if that portion of his tract which is not taken will be enhanced in value by the construction of a railroad, his damages will be diminished to the extent of the enhancement, and hence the statute contemplates that by deducting this benefit from the damages, the sum which remains will constitute a \u201cjust compensation\u201d in the sense of the Constitution. This was the view of the question announced in the case of the <em>San Francisco, Alameda, and Stockton Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>31 Cal. 367, which is decisive of this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b99-6\">Rhodes, J., dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">I dissent from the conclusion announced on the first proposition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
