These lands were confirmed to the city and county by Act of Congress, passed March 8th, 1866. On the 14th of January, 1868, the Board of Supervisors of said city and county passed <em>\u201c </em>Order No. 800,\u201d dividing these outside lands into blocks and lots, and laying out streets, and also a public park. These lands were then in the possession of private persons, and the order confirmed to the possessors the title, but required that an assessment should be levied on the land not taken for public use, to pay the possessors of the land taken for public use for the value of the same. This order was confirmed by two Acts of the Legislature passed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>1867-8. (See Laws 1867-8, pp. 379, 410.)

The first section of the order provided that \u201cimmediately after the passage of this order, the Board of Supervisors shall proceed to devise and adopt a plan for the subdivision into blocks and lots of all the lands not reserved to the United States, situated on the peninsula of San Francisco, and within the present corporate limits of said city and county, and above the natural ordinary high-water mark of the Bay of San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean, as the same existed on the 7th day of July, 1846, and without the corporate limits of the City of San Francisco, as defined in the Act to reincorporate the said city, passed by the Legislature of California on the 15th day of April, 1851, so far as said Board may deem such subdivision necessary; and to select and set apart for public uses such lots and portions of said land as said Board may deem necessary, subject to the limitations and provisions hereinafter in this order contained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-9\"><em>W.

If the evidence thus preponderated, it was the duty of the Court to set aside the verdict. If the lands were of that character, they were not liable to the assessment levied upon them. The question presented here is whether the Court erred in granting the new trial on the grounds specified in the bill of exceptions, but questions as to the sufficiency of the complaint, or of the defenses pleaded by the defendant, do not arise on an appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
