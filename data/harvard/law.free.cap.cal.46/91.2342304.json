Consolidated Mining Company\u201d was incorporated under the laws of California, and owned and worked \u00e1 mine near Hamilton, State of Nevada. In the Spring of 1870, A. R. Biggs was appointed -Superintendent of the mine. His powers as Superintendent were in no way defined by any resolution of the Directors of the corporation, but he was instructed by letters and otherwise from the officers of the company, not to contract any debt, but merely to expend such money as might be furnished him ; but these instructions were not known to the plaintiff or his assignors. Biggs worked the mine until December 14th, 1870, and the workmen he employed boarded with Morton &amp; Wells, who kept a boarding house, until the workmen owed Morton &amp; Wells one thousand one hundred and thirty-three dollars and nine cents for board. The company owed the men for work, and the Superintendent agreed that the company should pay Morton &amp; Wells, and the amount should be charged to the workmen. All parties consented to this, and the Superintendent gave Morton &amp; Wells the following notes :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">\u201cHamilton, December 13th, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">\u201c Twenty days after date, the Jennie A.

He was not authorized to make notes or contract debts in the name of the company; on the contrary, he was instructed by letter or otherwise, from the officers of the company, not to contract any debt, but only to expend such money as he might be furnished with. The notes not being authorized were void as against the company, and their assignment did not operate as an assignment of the indebtedness for which they were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
