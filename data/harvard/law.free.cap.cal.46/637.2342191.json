The lien can be maintained only by a substantial observance of the provisions of the statute.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b645-8\">Appeal from the District Court, Third Judicial District, County of Alameda.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-9\">This action was brought to foreclose a lien claimed upon a dwelling house for labor performed upon it. The defendant objected to the lien being received in evidence, because it did not contain the name of the person by whom the plaintiff was employed. The Court overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-10\">The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-11\"><em>S. G. Nye, </em>for Appellant, argued that it was error to receive the lien in evidence, and cited <em>Bottomly </em>v. <em>Grace, 2 </em>Cal. 90; and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>29 Cal. 283.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-12\"><em>R.

S. Wood, for the erection of the dwelling house at a fixed price named therein, and that in fact the plaintiff was not employed by Wrede at all, but that the defendant Wood alone employed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The lien provided by the statute can he maintained only by a substantial observance of its provisions, and though we are certainly not disposed to defeat the lien by a nice criticism of the language in which the claim is set forth, we are not at liberty to uphold it in the face of the total omission to comply with a plain requirement of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
