The answer denied the allegations of the complaint, and for a separate defense averred that the plaintiff was elected Superintendent of the defendant on the 6th day of March, 1868, and was discharged from the service of the company on the 25th day of May, 1869\u2014a period of fourteen months and nineteen days\u2014at an agreed salary of two hundred dollars per month, and that the same had been paid; and that the plaintiff had performed no labor for the defendant except as Superintendent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">The referee found that the bonds of Sonoma County to the amount of three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars were issued and delivered to the defendant, and that before the election the defendant directed its Superintendent to aid in procuring from the Sonoma County Railroad Company a transfer of its right to the bonds, and to aid in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>canvass to procure a decision at the election in favor of the Sonoma County Railroad Company, and that he did so aid, but that no work in the field towards the construction of the railroad was performed until July 1st, 1868, and that from the date of his appointment, on the 6th day of March, 1868, until July 1st, 1868, plaintiff was engaged in said canvass and in procuring the transfer from the Sonoma County road, and in soliciting subscriptions to the capital stock of defendant, and that from the time work in the field was commenced until the 25th of May, 1869, the plaintiff continued work in the field as Superintendent. The referee also found that no stipulated sum was agreed upon as compensation for plaintiff. The referee also found that all off the plaintiff\u2019s services were rendered as Superintendent, and that he was not entitled to any extra compensation, but that his services as Superin- . tendent were worth four hundred dollars per month, for which sum, less certain payments which had been made, the referee gave judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">During the trial John H. Turney was called as a witness by the plaintiff, and said he was elected a Director of the defendant early in 1869. He was then asked to state the substance of any conversations between the plaintiff and the acting Directors of the defendant while he was a Director and plaintiff was Superintendent. The defendant objected because such conversations would not be binding on the defendant, not being corporate acts evidenced by writing, or in ratification of corporate acts. The Court overruled the objection. The witness then detailed conversations between the plaintiff and certain Directors concerning the dispute about the plaintiff\u2019s salary, in which the plaintiff claimed that his salary had never been fixed, and that it was worth four hundred dollars per month, and the Directors claimed that it had been fixed at two hundred dollars per month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Daingerfield &amp; Olney, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-4\">This case was tried by the referee, and in the Court below, on motion for new trial, on the theory that plaintiff, whilst acting as Superintendent of the railroad (defendant), could perform extra services, and receive therefor extra pay. To this end evidence was permitted by the referee, showing that for a large portion of the time plaintiff was speech making, and acting as a lawyer in trying the question of the right of way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">If the theory adopted by the referee in his findings, that all these services were as Superintendent, be true, then it follows that all testimony offered and received of the value of \u201cextra services\u201d must be error, for he also finds that we were entitled to all his services and time whilst he was acting for us as Superintendent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-6\">The referee erred in permitting John H. Turney, and other witnesses for the plaintiff, to testify as to conversations held with witnesses in regard to what individual members of the defendant and its Board of Directors said in reference to plaintiff\u2019s employment, when not in a corporate meeting. True, the proof had been made that he was Superintendent; and if this act was in the natural and regular course of business as such, the parol evidence might have been introduced of the concurrence, after the act was done; but nothing short of an appointment by the corporation as such could give authority to do the act and bind the corporation. <em>(Bank of the United States </em>v. <em>Dandridge, </em>12 Wheaton, 64, <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">There had been no payment for the services mentioned at the time covered by the questions; and it was sought to show that other services than as Superintendent were performed.

Y. 258; 24 Barbour, 375.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">The object of this testimony was not to prove ratification, but to prove employment, and hence does not come under the doctrine laid down in <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>The Western Pacific R. R. Co., </em>33 Cal. 183, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-6\"><em>Douthitt &amp; McGraw </em>and <em>Lewis Shearer, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">The cause was not tried upon the theory stated by defendant. The facts are, that after the defendant was employed as Superintendent he was directed-to perform certain labor, which was essential and indispensable to be performed before active work in the construction of the' road could be commenced, as, without this labor, that of procuring the transfer of the rights and privileges of the Sonoma County road, and the bonds of the county, the whole thing would evidently have been a failure. Therefore, the Superintendent, so soon as he was selected, was directed to employ his time and labor in this service, which was necessary to the very existence of the enterprise, which he did for some three months, and then entered upon his duty of constructing the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\">Plaintiff was under employment as Superintendent. The defendant controlled his time and what he should do; and the character of service performed under this direction, for a portion of the time, was infinitely more valuable to the company, and more laborious to the plaintiff, than when engaged on the road; and we think the defendant cannot complain of this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">There was no evidence improperly admitted or excluded that could have justly changed the result. The errors, if any were committed, could not have harmed the defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>therefore, the judgment should not be reversed. <em>(Merle </em>v. Mathews, 26 Cal. 455.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">New trial will not be granted on account of admission of improper evidence to prove a fact, not material, and independent of which the verdict is supported. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>21 Cal. 220; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>22 Cal. 240; <em>Zeigler </em>v. <em>Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., </em>28 Cal. 263; <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>12 Wend. 404, <em>Crary </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>12 Wend. 41.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-7\">By the Court, Niles, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">1. It was admitted that the plaintiff was Superintendent, under the appointment of the defendant, from the 6th of March, 1868, until the 28th of May, 1869. The evidence was amply sufficient to support the finding of the referee, that there was no special agreement for the plaintiff\u2019s compensation. He was, therefore, clearly entitled to receive the value of his services in the capacity of Superintendent. Appellants urge, as their principal ground of error, that evidence was admitted at the trial, of services rendered by the plaintiff, entirely distinct from those appertaining to the office of Superintendent. Very much of this evidence does not appear to have been objected to at the time it was offered; but at one stage of the proceedings a motion was made to strike it out, and by consent of parties, the ruling upon the motion was reserved until the final argument of the case. There does not appear to have been any direct ruling upon the question at the time of the final argument. The referee, however, in his findings, held that the plaintiff could not recover for extra services rendered during the time of his employment, without a special agreement for extra compensation; but held also that the services to which the defendant objected were rendered in the line of plaintiff\u2019s duty as Superintendent, and under the direction of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>We think this finding was sustained by the evidence. Although actual work in the field, in the construction of the road, was not commenced until several months after the appointment of the plaintiff, he appeared to have been actively and efficiently employed during the interval in the interest of the company, in business of importance preliminary to the construction of the road. While the work which he performed may not be technically within the line of a Superintendent\u2019s duty, it was work which that officer, as the servant of the company, might be directed to do; and having performed the labor, at the company\u2019s request, while holding the office, it will be presumed that he acted in an official capacity. As the plaintiff was only allowed for his services as Superintendent, and nothing for the extra services claimed by him, we see nothing in the finding of which the defendant can justly complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">2. The testimony of the witness Turney as to conversations between the plaintiff and the acting Directors of the defendant, during the period of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, was admissible to show his dissent at that time from the amount of salary proposed by certain of the Directors, and that it was not then considered, by him at least, as a fixed and stipulated sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">3. The testimony of the plaintiff, that he was requested by the Vice President, and other Directors of the company, to aid in the canvass for the procurement of a county subsidy, so far as it tended to prove a special contract for extra services, would perhaps be obnoxious to the objection that these officers had no power to make such a contract, except when in session as a Board. But, as we have seen, all evidence of any contract for extra services was substantially excluded from consideration by the referee, and the action of the Board in session is not required merely to direct the labor of an employ\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>We see nothing in the other points made by the defendant which calls for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Mr. Chief Justice Wallace did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
