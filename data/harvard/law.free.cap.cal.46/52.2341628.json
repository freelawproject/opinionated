The conviction was had under the second section of the Act of 1872, entitled \u201cAn Act to punish adultery\u201d (p. 380). The offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>consists in living \u201cin a state of open and notorious cohabitation and adultery;\u201d the <em>notoriety </em>is as material in making out the offense as is the fact of adultery committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In this case, while the evidence tends in some degree to show that the defendant committed adultery with the woman named in the indictment, there is not the slightest proof of a living with her in a state of notorious adultery or cohabitation within the intent of the statute. <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 Blackford R. 358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
