The appeal may be prosecuted in the name of the bankrupt, or in the name of . his assignee.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b583-9\">Appeal from the District Court, Nineteenth Judicial District, City and County of San Francisco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-10\">This action was brought to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been caused to a dwelling house by blasting upon a street adjoining it. The plaintiff obtained a judgment, and the defendant appealed. Before the time the appeal was taken, the appellant had been adjudged a bankrupt, all his property, debts, and credits having been assigned to his trustee in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-11\"><em>Pixley &amp; Harrison, </em>for Respondent, moved to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the appellant was not the party in interest. They argued that, since in this State the equity rule of making the party in interest the party of record has been adopted (Code Civil Procedure, Secs. 367, 369), the bankruptcy of the appellant should have been suggested, and his assignee substituted of record. (Daniel\u2019s Ch. Pl. and Pr., 66, 76, 229; Story\u2019s Equity Pl. Secs. 342, 349; 2 Barb. Ch. Pr. 65, 66; <em>Sedgwick </em>v. <em>Cleavland, </em>7 Paige, 287, 289; <em>Garr v.

The appeal may be prosecuted in the name of the bankrupt, or in that of his assignee. (Code Civil Procedure, Sec. 385.) Besides, it is shown that the assignee is really conducting the appeal here, though in the name of the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
