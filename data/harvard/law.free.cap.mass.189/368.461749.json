Clifton Martin, the same to be held in trust by my niece T. Amelia Martin, and given to each of them when she shall think it wise and best so to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The judge of the Probate Court entered a decree that Mercy Foskett was entitled during her life to the income only of the $600 bequeathed to her by this clause. From this decree an appeal was taken by Mercy Foskett to this court, where it was heard by a single justice, who, at the request of the parties, reserved the case for our consideration.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AcB1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>E. A. D. </em>Moss, for Mercy Foskett.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AN85\"><em>G. R. Stobbs, </em>for Annie A. Foskett and others.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">lb appears from an agreed statement of facts filed in this court, that the will was drawn by and was in the handwriting of the testatrix ; and that Mercy Foskett was the sister of\u00bbthe testatrix and at the time of her death was living with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The question presented is whether under the third clause of the will Mercy Foskett took an absolute interest or only the income for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We have no doubt that Mercy Foskett took an absolute interest in the $600 bequeathed to her, and not merely the income during her life. It is plain that Mercy Foskett was to have the possession and control of the entire fund during her life; otherwise a trust would have been created as to the gift to her, as it was as to the limitation over. We are also of opinion that the limitation over of <em>\u201c </em>such part of it as may be left\u201d was void as repugnant to the first gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The ease is governed by <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>184 Mass. 169, and cases cited. The case of <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Nickerson </em>seems to have escaped the attention of the counsel in the case, as it is not cited on either brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The decree of the Probate Court must be reversed, and a decree entered in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
