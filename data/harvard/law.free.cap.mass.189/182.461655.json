Under this provision the lessee constructed certain buildings which were assessed at a valuation of $30,000. The lease, immediately after the description of the land and the reservation of rent, and before the provisions in regard to the use of the land, contained a covenant by which the lessor agreed to \u201csave the lessee harmless from all taxes, assessments and betterments levied upon said premises until the termination of this lease.\u201d The lessor was compelled to pay the whole amount of the tax levied on the land and buildings, and, the lessee refusing to contribute, the lessor brought an action of contract against the lessee for the portion of the tax which was paid by the lessor on the buildings belonging to the lessee. <em>Held, </em>that in view of the particular location of the covenant in the lease and of the other provisions of the lease, the words \u201c said premises \u201d in the covenant referred only to the land without the buildings to be erected upon it by the lessee, that the covenant confined the liability of the lessor to the portion of the'taxes which might be assessed upon the valuation of the land exclusive of the buildings, and that the lessor was not bound to pay any increase of taxes due to the valuation of the buildings. <em>Held., also, </em>that the lessor, having been compelled by law to pay the taxes, which were a charge on the buildings belonging to the lessee and which between them the lessee was bound to pay, could recover the amount from the lessee as money paid to his use.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">Contract, for the amount of certain taxes alleged to have been paid by the plaintiff for the defendant.

That it appears that the plaintiff, by the terms of the lease, a copy of which is annexed to the declaration, is bound to save the defendant harmless from all taxes, assessments and betterments levied upon the premises described in the lease, and it appears that the sum paid by the plaintiff was by reason of a tax levied upon the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-7\">2. That it does not appear that the defendant, 'or any one representing him, agreed to pay taxes levied upon the premises described in the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-8\">The clause of the lease relied on by the defendant was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-9\">\u201c And the lessor further covenants and agrees that it will save the lessee harmless from all taxes, assessments and betterments levied upon said premises until the termination of this lease, but said lessee or its assigns shall repay to said lessor or its assigns, or to said Geo.

The question seems to turn upon the meaning to be given to the words \u201c said premises.\u201d Do they mean simply the land which was the only thing in existence at the time of the lease, or do they mean the land with such buildings as may be upon it at any time during the existence of the lease ?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">It is to be noted that the covenant is preceded in tbe lease only by the description of the land, the reservation of rent, and an agreement giving to the lessee a conditional right to exercise certain options for the purchase of \u201c said premises \u201d and adjoining land. It is followed by provisions relative to the use which the lessee may make of the land. It is evident that the parties contemplated that the lessee might make some changes in the surface of the land and might erect buildings of considerable value. The buildings were to be the property of the lessee and he had the right to remove them either before or after the termination of the lease, except in case of forfeiture of the lease on his part. Under the lease buildings to the assessed value of $80,000 were erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">There was no restriction as to the nature, size or cost of the buildings which the lessee could erect. For aught \u2019the lessor knew they might have been so valuable that the tax assessed on their account would exceed the whole amount of the rent. The lessor does not seem to have had any interest whatever in the \u201camusement enterprise\u201d for which the lessee intended to use the premises. The amount of the tax which would be assessed upon the land alone could be fairly estimated by the lessor, while the value of the buildings to be erected was entirely within the discretion of the lessee. As between the parties to the lease the land belonged to the lessor and the buildings to the lessee. Neither owned the whole. In view of the particular location of this covenant in the lease and the other provisions of the lease, a majority of the court are of opinion that the term \u201c said premises \u201d in the covenant embraces simply the land; that the covenant considered as a whole was restrictive in its nature as to the portion of the ordinary taxes which the lessor was to pay, and was intended to confine his liability to the portion of the taxes which might be assessed upon the valuation of the land exclusive of the buildings; or, in other words, that as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>between the parties the lessor was not bound to pay the increase in the taxes due to the valuation of the buildings. It was a \u201c different agreement \u201d within the meaning of R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 20. The case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Drury, </em>130 Mass. 428, cited by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The next question is whether the lessor who has paid the tax on the buildings can recover the amount from the lessee. Strictly speaking, there has been no tax on the buildings, as such, but we use the phrase as a convenient one to designate the increase in the tax which is due to their assessed valuation. Whatever may be the agreement of owners as to whether buildings shall be personal property or real estate, the statutes provide that \u201c real estate for the purpose of taxation shall include not only all land within the commonwealth but also all buildings and other things erected on or affixed to the same.\u201d R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 3. While it is true that the statutes provide that there shall be a valuation of the land exclusive of the buildings, and of the buildings exclusive of the land, still the tax is assessed as one indivisible real estate tax upon the whole property, and a lien for the whole tax exists upon the whole property. R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 60, and c. 13, \u00a7 35. <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Drury, ubi supra. McGee </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>149 Mass. 238, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">On May 1, 1903, the plaintiff was the owner of this land and also of a parcel of land adjoining, and on that day there was assessed to him a tax upon both of these parcels and upon all the structures existing on the parcel named in the lease. The whole property was valued at $70,000, of which $30,000 was the valuation placed upon the buildings owned by the defendant. The whole tax was $1,989, of which $540 was the portion assessed upon the value represented by these buildings. The plaintiff requested the defendant to pay the tax upon the buildings and the defendant refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The situation then was this. There was no tax upon the buildings as such, and hence there was no personal liability on the part of the defendant to pay anything to the collector. The tax was wholly upon the real estate which included for purposes of taxation the buildings owned by the defendant. This tax was a lien upon the whole property including the buildings, and while there was no personal liability which the collector could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>enforce against the defendant, yet the defendant\u2019s property was held liable, and the payment of the tax enured to the benefit of the defendant\u2019s estate by discharging that liability. The plaintiff could not release his own property by paying a part of the tax. He must pay the whole or allow the property, land and buildings, to be sold. He was therefore compelled by law to pay an obligation which although not personal to the defendant was nevertheless in the nature of a charge upon the latter\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">It is a familiar principle of law that while one cannot make himself the creditor of another by voluntarily paying the debt of the latter without his request, still where one to save his property from being sold on legal process is compelled to pay money which another is under a legal obligation to pay, and which as between the two the latter should pay, then in law the payment is made at the request of the latter, and the former-may recover from him. <em>Exall </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>8 T. R. 808. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Huse, </em>10 Gray, 99. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Bucknam, </em>117 Mass. 488. In the case before us there was, it is true, no legal personal liability on the part of the lessee to pay the tax upon the buildings, and there was only a lien upon them, but, as was said by Gibbs, C. J. in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Zamira, </em>6 Taunt. 524, \u201c nothing can rest on that distinction.\u2019\u2019 The principle is the same whether the debt be personal or only a lien upon the property. In either case the law implies a request by the person relieved, and the person who pays may recover of him whose estate is benefited. For a-short discussion of the point see the notes to <em>Lampleigh </em>v. <em>Brathwait, </em>1 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas. (8th Am. ed.) 151, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In the opinion of a majority of the court the demurrer should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
