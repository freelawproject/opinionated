L. c. 48, \u00a7 1, for the \u201c alteration \u201d of a highway and not under \u00a7 12 of the same chapter for the relocation of the highway, the nature of the proceedings now having been disclosed by a trial on the merits, is here reversed on the facts disclosed, it being <em>held, </em>that the petition was under \u00a7 12 and that the order of the county commissioners, that the expenses and land damages claimed should be paid by the town in which the highway was relocated, was valid. See <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Wellesley, ante, </em>308.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>When under R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 12, county commissioners have made an order that a <em>town </em>shall pay the expenses of the relocation of a highway, there is nothing in \u00a7 52 of the same chapter or elsewhere which requires that the county should in the first instance pay the expenses and then recover'them from the town.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b349-4\">In the trial of a petition against a town and a county for damages which are to be paid either by the town or the county, if both respondents appear and take part in the trial, and later, upon a ruling of the presiding judge at the close of the petitioner\u2019s evidence that the town is not liable, the town withdraws from the trial, and a verdict is returned against the county, and if an exception of the county to the judge\u2019s ruling is sustained by this court and it is held that the town is liable and that the county is not, the verdict obtained against the county will not be allowed to stand against the town, which is entitled to be heard in a new trial before judgment is given against it.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-5\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFS\">When this case was here before it was held that the allegations of the petition set forth a case arising under the first section of R. L. c. 48, and not under the twelfth section. It was stated, however, in the opinion of the court, that \u201cfrom the recitals in the petition for assessment of damages, which are all that is before us to show the details of the proceedings, it is not plain beyond the possibility of question whether the commissioners were acting under the R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 1, and making an alteration of the highway, or under the R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 12, and merely relocating it. If they were acting under the former section the petition for the assessment of damages should be brought against the county of Norfolk, which would be liable under the R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 52; if under the latter the petition should be brought against the town of Wellesley, which was ordered by the commissioners to pay the expenses of the change, including the land damages. R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 12. The only question before us arises on the demurrer of the county.\u201d <em>Livermore </em>v. <em>County of </em>Norfolk, 186 Mass. 133, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"AtM\">There has since been a trial in the Superior Court upon the merits before a jury, and the case comes before us upon a report made by the presiding judge. At this trial the records, and proceedings of the county commissioners appeared in evidence, substantially as in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Wellesley, ante, </em>308, and for reasons stated in that case the majority of the court are of opinion that in construing the petition for the changes in Worcester Street as a petition under R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 12, and in ordering the expenses and land damages to be paid by the town of Wellesley, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the commissioners made no error in law. The order therefore is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It is urged, however, by the petitioners that, even if the order is valid, the county in the first instance must pay the land damages and then recover them from the town; and R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 52, is recited in support of that proposition. The history of the legislation shows that this position is untenable. See St. 1835, c. 152, \u00a7 8; Rev. Sts. c. 24, \u00a7 9; St. 1851, c. 214; Gen. Sts. c. 43, \u00a7 12; St. 1873, c. 165; Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7 13; Rev. Sts. c. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 42; Gen. Sts. c. 43, \u00a7 47; Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7 58; <em>Damon </em>v. Reading, 2 Gray, 274; <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>County of Worcester, </em>147 Mass. 446. It follows that the exception of the county to the refusal of the court to rule that \u201con all the evidence the petitioners cannot recover against the county of Norfolk in this action \u201d must be sustained. By the terms of the report, therefore, the petition must \u201cbe dismissed as to the respondent county.\u201d This renders it unnecessary to consider the other exceptions of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">At the close of the petitioners\u2019 evidence the judge ruled that the proceedings of the commissioners were under R. L. c. 48, \u00a7 1, and that the petition could not be maintained against the town of Wellesley. To the ruling that the petition could not be maintained against the town the petitioners excepted. For reasons already stated the majority of the court think that this exception must be sustained. By the terms of the report, \u201c if the exception of the petitioners as to the ruling of the judge ordering the petition dismissed as to the respondent town is sustained, or in case any other exceptions of the petitioners are sustained, such entry is to be made as law and justice may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">It is apparent from the report that, notwithstanding the decision upon the demurrer, the town, as was very proper, was represented by counsel at the trial on the merits and was actively engaged in opposition to the petitioners\u2019 case until the ruling was made that the petition could not be maintained against it. This ruling, as before stated, was made at the close of the petitioners\u2019 evidence, and the town was thereby relieved from further, action at the trial; and it does not appear that it took any further action in defence. Under these circumstances it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>plain that to allow the verdict to stand as against the town would be holding the town when it has not been heard. Justice requires that the verdict should be set aside.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_S\"><em>C. E. Washburn, </em>for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9T\"><em>C. F.
