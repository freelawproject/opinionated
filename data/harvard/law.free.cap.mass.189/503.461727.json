She had been married and divorced, and was then insane. After giving instructions at great length for her support he directed that the trustees should \u201cupon the death of my said daughter provide a suitable stone for her grave, and cause a suitable inscription appropriate to her to be carved upon the family monument, and make over so much of said estate and its accretions as is then in their hands, after the payment of bequests and devises as hereinbefore provided, to my said daughter\u2019s executor for the benefit of such persons as she shall nominate in her will, if she shall have made a will being competent thereto, or in default of such will to her heirs at law.\u201d The trust estate consisted of personal property onty, and his daughter died intestate, without having had a child. When John Mayhew died, the daughter had no next of kin on her father\u2019s side. On her mother\u2019s side she had an aunt, Dencie Mudgett, and two uncles, Thomas and Jared Jernegan. Jared died before the daughter, and Dencie Mudgett died after the daughter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-12\">It was held in the Probate Court that the estate should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>be divided between the administrator of Dencie Mudgett and Thomas Jernegan, being the next of kin of the testator\u2019s daughter under R. L. c. 133, \u00a7 1, cl. 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">From this decree an appeal was taken by the children of Jared Jernegan to this court. At the trial of this appeal the appellants asked for this ruling: \u201cIn the above entitled case the appellants. request the court to rule as matter of law that the next of kin or heirs at law of D. Anna Mayhew were the next of kin, or heirs at law of said D. Anna Mayhew at the time of the death of John Mayhew, deceased, testate.\u201d \u201c The court refused so to rule, but affirmed the decree of the Probate Court.\u201d The case is here on an exception to \u201csaid refusal so to rule.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-6\"><em>E. S. Clinch </em>(of New York) &amp; <em>J. N. Pierce, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-7\"><em>R. F. Raymond &amp; S. Keniston, </em>for the petitioners, were not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b526-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkT\">[After the foregoing statement of the case.] The ruling was refused rightly. The appellants have argued that there is nothing in the will showing more affection for the aunt and uncle who survived than for the uncle who died. But the interpretation of John Mayhew\u2019s will does not depend upon that. It depends upon the interpretation of the words which he used to express his intention. Of the meaning of these words there can be no doubt. The gift over is to the heirs at law of the beneficiary for life, not to the persons who would have been her heirs at law if she had died when the testator did, as the appellants ask us to interpret them. See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Wheat-land, </em>7 Met. 169 ; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Story, </em>132 Mass. 205, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
