The debtor then gave the creditor two mortgages on the land with an instrument declaring that they were \u201c sold absolutely,\u201d and later conveyed to the creditor the land itself subject to the mortgages, with an instrument stating that whenever the creditor should sell the land the debtor would pay to the creditor any balance that might remain due on his indebtedness of $3,500 after deducting all sums received by the creditor from the sale of the land. Two years later the debtor obtained a discharge in insolvency. About twenty years later the creditor sold the land for less than the amount of his claim and brought an action for the balance. The debtor set up his discharge in insolvency. <em>Held, </em>that either the land was conveyed as security for the debt, in which case the discharge in insolvency clearly was a bar, or the conveyance was absolute and was to operate as payment of the debt pro <em>tanto </em>by the proceeds of the sale when the land was sold, and that in this case also the discharge was a bar, as the debt although not payable until the land was sold was all the time due and thus provable under Gen. Sts. c. 118, \u00a7 25.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b236-10\">After the time allowed for filing exceptions has expired, one who has filed a bill of exceptions may be allowed to amend it by stating more accurately an exception already contained in his bill, but cannot be allowed to add an exception not originally stated.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-11\">Contract upon two instruments under seal, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-12\">\u201c Exhibit A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-13\">\u201c Whereas Henry Bigelow Williams of Boston, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is owing to Gideon Currier of said Boston, thirty-five hundred dollars ($3500).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-14\">\u201c And whereas said Williams has this day caused Alden B.

Hubbard.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-12\">The declaration alleged that a large balance was due to the plaintiff after the sale of all the land conveyed to him. Writ in the Supreme Judicial Court dated May 5, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-13\">The answer was a general denial; a discharge in insolvency granted September 26, 1879, on a petition filed February 21, 1879; the six- year statute of limitations; the twenty year statute of limitations; that the plaintiff was required to sell the real estate mentioned in the contracts in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time, which he had failed to do, but had continued to hold the major part of the real estate, as owner thereof, for a wholly unreasonable time, to wit, the space of more than twenty years; that the claim of the plaintiff had been fully paid, and that the plaintiff in selling the property was negligent of the rights and interest of the defendant, and was not in the exercise of good faith toward the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-14\">The case was tried before <em>Morton, </em>J. It appeared that in November, 1876, the defendant owed the plaintiff $3,500, being the balance due upon a contract for mason work upon the Hotel Brunswick in Boston. It also appeared that before Exhibit A was executed, on November 8, 1876, \u201cthe defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ant offered the lots of land referred to in the contract, in payment of the account due, which the plaintiff declined to accept.\u201d Thereupon the defendant caused two mortgages, one on each lot, amounting together to the amount due, to be assigned to the plaintiff under the agreement stated in Exhibit A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">Nine months later, on August 17, 1877, Williams caused the fee in the two lots subject to these two mortgages to be conveyed to the plaintiff, and Exhibit B was executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">Exhibits A and B were written on one double sheet of paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">It also appeared that on February 21,1879, the defendant filed a petition in insolvency, and that on September 26, 1879, a discharge was granted to him for all debts due on February 21, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">In 1890 the plaintiff sold one half of one of the lots and in 1891 the remaining half of it. In 1908 he sold the other lot, leaving as the plaintiff contended a balance still due to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">The plaintiff offered to show in rebuttal that the defendant wilfully and intentionally omitted the plaintiff\u2019s name from his schedule of creditors in the insolvency proceedings and the address of the plaintiff, and placed in his schedule a fictitious debt to the plaintiff of $25.68, and that the plaintiff had no notice of the insolvency proceedings until more than two years after the defendant\u2019s discharge and took no part therein. This offer was stated to be made \u201c not for the purpose of seeking to invalidate the fact or regularity of the defendant\u2019s discharge, but only for the purpose of avoiding its effect as to the plaintiff in the action at bar. The court rejected this offer of proof, and the plaintiff excepted, but this exception was not included in the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions filed in this case, and it is included in this report against the objection of the defendant, and is only to be considered if the plaintiff is entitled to have his exception heard.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-10\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the justice to order a verdict for the defendant. This he refused to do, and submitted the case to the jury, with an agreement of the parties that if the jury found for the plaintiff the damages should be $825.27. A verdict was returned for the plaintiff in accordance with the agreement, and at the request of both of the parties the justice reported the case for determination by this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The second and fourth paragraphs of the terms of the reservation, the others having become immaterial, were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-3\">\u201cSecond. If there was no evidence for the jury, and the defendant\u2019s request that a verdict be ordered for him should have been granted, judgment is to be entered for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-4\">\u201c Fourth. If a verdict should have been ordered for the defendant solely on the ground of his having received a discharge in insolvency, and if the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof in rebuttal was competent and should have been admitted wholly or in'part, the plaintiff\u2019s exception to its exclusion is to be sustained, and anew trial ordered, provided that said exception is still open to the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The case was argued at the bar in January, 1905, before Knowlton, C. J., <em>Morton, Barker, Boring </em>&amp; <em>Braley, </em>JJ., and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the justices. Mr. Justice Barker died before the decision of the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>H. T. Richardson, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-7\"><em>R. F. Sturgis, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b240-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">We are of opinion that the debt due the plaintiff is barred by the defendant\u2019s discharge in insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">If the land was conveyed as security for the debt in spite of the provision in Exhibit A that \u201c said mortgages are sold absolutely by said Williams to Currier,\u201d (as some of my brethren think,) the discharge in insolvency is plainly a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">If on the other hand (as others of us think) the result of Exhibits A and B was not to make these two parcels of land security for the debt, the discharge in insolvency is still a bar. If it was not by way of security it was a conveyance to Currier by Williams of the fee in these two lots of land, which was absolute and final on the part of Williams and was accepted by Currier in payment for the debt, so far as it went, that is to say, to the amount realized when the two lots were sold. The parties might have provided that the conveyance of the land should be coupled with an agreement by Williams to make the plaintiff good against loss if the land did not realize the amount of the debt. Had they done so, the discharge would not have been a bar. In that case, until the land was sold it would be altogether contingent whether there was a debt or not. In such a case the discharge is not a bar. <em>French </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>2 Gray, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>111. <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>13 Gray, 15. <em>Deane </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>127 Mass. 242. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>177 Mass. 224. <em>McIntire </em>v. <em>Cottrell, </em>185 Mass. 178. <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>187 Mass. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">But that is just what the plaintiff and the defendant did not do in the case at bar. Currier did not agree to take the land in payment. He introduced evidence that he \u201c declined to accept \u201d the land on those terms. What he did agree to was that he would \u201c give to said Williams credit for the net proceeds of such sale on his aforesaid indebtedness,\u201d in the words of the first agreement of Exhibit A. Williams did not agree to pay to Currier such sum as would make the defendant whole in case the land sold for less than the amount of the debt. What Williams did agree to do was to \u201c pay to said Currier any balance that may be due to said Currier on his aforesaid indebtedness, after crediting the net proceeds,\u201d in the language of the second agreement of Exhibit A; and, in the language of Exhibit B, that \u201c whenever said Currier shall sell said property, (which said Currier is at liberty to do at any time as aforesaid,) he will pay to said Currier any balance that may remain due on his aforesaid indebtedness of $3500, after deducting all sums received by said Currier from the sale of said property \u201d ; and that he \u201c will also pay to said Currier semiannually at the rate of 6 1-2 per cent, the interest on his said indebtedness of $3500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The effect of these stipulations is that the original indebtedness was to remain due; when the land was sold, the net proceeds were to be credited; and until it was sold the original indebtedness was not payable because the amount paid by the conveyance of the two lots of land had not been ascertained. Until then the debt was due although not payable, and was provable as such under Gen. Sts. c. 118, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">By the terms of the report the rejection of the offer of proof in rebuttal \u201c is only to be considered if the plaintiff is entitled to have his exception heard.\u201d A party may be allowed to amend his bill of exceptions to state more accurately an exception stated by him in his bill, within the time allowed for filing a bill, but not to add an exception not originally stated in the bill of exceptions. See <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>187 Mass. 542, where the earlier cases are collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>We do not intend to intimate that there was anything in the exception in question under St. 1879, c. 245, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
