The ship Amazon, Israel Trask, master, sailed on a commercial <em>voyage on </em>or about the llth day of June, 1800, from Nantasket Roads, the outer harbor of Boston, bound for Cadiz or Malaga. While peacefully pursuing said voyage she was seized- on the high seas on or about the 6th day of July, 1800, by the French privateer La Mouche, and carried into the port of Corunna, in Spain, and vessel and cargo libeled before the council of prizes at Paris, where, on the 30th day of August, 1801 (13 Fructidor, year 9), it was decreed that vessel and cargo be restored to Capt. Israel Trask in the condition in which they are, and in case of a sale the proceeds to be given up, with a deduction of all expenses lawfully incurred. In pursuance of above decree, the Amazon was restored to Captain Trask September 24, 1801, after a detention of fourteen months and eighteen days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-11\">II. The circumstances attending the seizure of the Amazon are set forth in the protest of the master, dated at Corunna on the 14th day of July, 1800, as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-12\">\u201cThat he departed with said vessel, well dispatched, stored, manned, and provided with eveiy necessary for undertaking the voyage. That he continued on his destination with all possible expedition, with moderate winds and fair weather, until the 6th instant, when, being in 40 degrees of north latitude and 26 degrees of longitude west of London, a sail was discovered in the south, about 8 o\u2019clock in the morning. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>'observed her following in the same course as the vessel under his command, which was to the southeast, and he perceived within a few minutes she wore around and came to pass by his weather beam at the distance of half a league, and came up until she placed herself in his wake, then hoisted the American flag, and continued giving them chase under the same colors. He crowded a little after all his sails, continuing the chase, which was about half after 8 in the morning, and this confirmed the fear which they had that she was an enemy, on account of which they immediately set all their sails for the greater advantage of the vessel, and they started six casks of water to lighten her, in order to make her sail faster. They observed, notwithstanding, that the vessel which chased them gained, and that at length in a short time she would come up alongside of them, provided the wind should continue from the same quarter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-4\">\u201cAbout half after 12 she came up at the distance of about half a gunshot, and then lowered the American flag. She hoisted the French national flag, and a few minutes after-wards fired one of her bow chasers with ball and grape, and immediately the ship of the deponent hoisted her American flag at the mizzen peak. Soon afterwards she fired another gun with ball and grape, which passed over the vessel of deponent, then he took the determination of consulting with his officers upon what was proper to be done in this situation, and after having maturely considered the situation of his country with the French Eepublic in regard to the navigation of American ships, and the moral certainty of being captured by the French cruisers after the innumerable instances of other ships of the same nation in similar situations, as also the reflection on the examples of the cruel atrocities committed on American crews by several privateers under the French national flag, and fearing that this might be one of that class, as he had a license from his Government to carry guns for the express purpose of defending himself from the hostile .attacks of vessels which should sail with the national flag, on the high seas, they determined, as the means most eligible to save their persons and property, to oppose all their forces to the hostile attack, which continued on the part of the vessel which chased them; and the consultation being finished, this resolution determined upon, the' crew was placed at their different posts, and thus they waited until the enemy should \u25a0come nearer, in order to see if he continued in firing on them, and observing that the nearer he approached increased his firing, after having received numerous broadsides of ball and grape, which cut his sails and broke his rigging considerably, some part of the grape entering by the stern, then they began to defend themselves, being a little more than 1 o\u2019clock, with the enemy on their weather quarter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>\u20181 </em>The action continued in the same position with great vigor on both sides for about two hours, or something less, at the distance of pistol-shot, in which time the vessel under bis, command suffered much damage in the sales and rigging; the. enemy afterwards bore across his stern with an intention, as he presumed, of raking them, but during the action, having-set all his sales, following his course, they were able to gain sufficient distance and to prevent his intention, but the enemy did nothing else but change his position, placing himself alongside on their lee quarter, and again recommenced the action with vigor, continuing till 6 in the afternoon, in which time he had 1 man killed and the second officer dangerously wounded; the mizzen topmast and mizzen-gaff carried away, and only the bare pole of the mizzen-mast remained, the braces and sheets torn, with the foretop-sail shot in pieces, with the greatest part of the shrouds and running cut away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\">\u201cIn this condition, with no appearance of preventing their being taken, the deponent consulted with Mr. Amory, who-was interested in part of the cargo, under whom, jointly with the deponent, the management of the voyage is intrusted, and with Mr. Boudwitch, the first officer, upon the expediency of making more resistance in that condition against forces so superior, and it was determined that it would be imprudence and only to seek destruction and death to be obstinate; and then, with the greatest regret, he ordered the flag to be hauled down, which was done; notwithstanding which the firing of musketry and blunderbusses against the vessel of the deponent continued some minutes after having-surrendered, which made them believe that they had fallen into the hands of those who had so cruelly treated their countrymen; but, in honor of truth, of the captain and of the officers of the French cruiser La Mouche, de Bordeaux, which he knew the said vessel was called, he ought to say that their conduct was very different from the fears which they had inspired; and in respect to the damages and injuries which arise from this unjust detention, or which will arise till she is Elaced at liberty, he protests against the captain of the cruiser, er owners, the concerned, the insurers, and against whom it ma3r be necessary, as he swears, according to the institutions of his religion, before me, the notary, and the witnesses who have been so of all this.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">III. The decree of the council of prizes, after reciting the particulars of the seizure of the Amazon and giving an analysis of the papers found on board, proceeds as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">\u201cTaking into consideration the memorial presented the 17 th Vendemiaire, year 9, to the council of prizes, by the brothers La Pell, owners of the privateer La Mouche, in which, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>attempting to establish the legality of the capture of the Amazon\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">\u201c First.

On account of resistance to the summons and the battle which ensued, they concluded byprajung that the council would declare the capture good and adjudge to them the said ship and her appurtenances, as well as the merchandise composing her cargo, to be sold and the proceeds thereof to be distributed conformably to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-7\">\u201cConsidering the memorial presented the 9 Brumaire last by Captain Trask, and in which, after appealing to the provisions of the convention of the 8 Vendemiaire, year 9, and observing that the voyage of the Amazon was protected by two documents required by this convention, the passport and the certificate of the cargo, and that there is, moreover, furnished for the defense of the cargo a certificate from the American custom-house, which alone ought to have a decisive influence in its' defense; that finally the two powers have agreed that nothing in addition to such justification should be demanded from vessels of the United States, and that they should be restored upon these proofs without other documents, notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, he concludes by praying-that the council would declare null and void the capture of the Amazon, and decree that the said vessel and her cargo should be restored to him, the petitioner, and that the owners of the privateer La Mouche should be condemned in interest and damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">\u201cConsidering the conclusions of the commissary of the Government, which have been this day filed in writing in the bureau, and the tenor of which follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\">\u201cThe 17th Messidor, year 8, the privateer La Mouche fell in with the Amazon, gave chase to and discharged at her a shotted gun to oblige her to show her flag, which she did, but without bringing to. The privateer having discharged a second gun at her to make her bring to, the Amazon answered by discharging a number of shotted guns, continuing her course. An action then took place between the two ships and. the Amazon was obliged to strike her flag and surrender. The captain being questioned why he had not obeyed the first summons, answered conformably to the proces-verbal of the captured that his intentions were to defend himself, and that in firing upon the privateer he had hopes of damaging some of her masts and consequently of escaping.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-10\">\u201cThe ship was manned out and carried into Corunna, where the captain of the prize made his declaration before the commissary of commercial relation of the French Republic. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>results from the answers of the captain that he is named Israel Trask; that he is from Gloucester in the United States; that he had a crew of 26 men; that the ship was armed with 11 cannon, of which 8 were of 4, and 3 of 6 pounds; that the ship belonged to Thomas Amory, Marston Watson, Joseph Head, Jonathan Amory, Stephen Codman, and Nathaniel Amory, all citizens of Boston, in America, from whence he sailed bound for Cadiz or Malaga with an assorted cargo of colonial merchandise; that she sailed under the American flag; he acknowledged that he was determined to maintain an action bjr a knowledge that many vessels of his nation have been plundered and their crews murdered by privateers carrying the French flag, and that he was apprehensive. that he was chased by a vessel of this description. A passenger on board, who calls himself supercargo, says that the ship was laden with sugar; cocoa, and fish. The rest of his answers are conformable to those of the others who have been interrogated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">\u201cThis instruction has been addressed to the council, with the papers which were on board, which consisted of a Turkish passport, a regular passport of the United States in the form required by the treaty of 1778, a role of equipage granted bj7 the public officers, bills of health, a document respecting ownership of the vessel, the register, the invoice of the merchandise, the bill of lading of the cargo signed by the captain, the certificate of the custom-house, and finally all the papers required and in the form prescribed in the treaty between France and the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">\u201cAlthough the privateer had provoked the battle, although she might be responsible for having made the summons with a shotted gun, she had a little more than lawful for the capture, if it nad not been for the treaty of the 8 of Vendemiaire last. This treaty has intervened when the two nations were considered in a condition respectively of hostility. It is less <em>a, </em>treaty of commerce than a treaty of peace, which, by its conditions ought necessarily to efface the respective wrongs and revive that union and good understanding which had preceded them. This treaty, without doubt, would be an event unfortunate for any other but French citizens; but the Frenchman loves his country too well not to sacrifice his personal interests to the interests of the state, and .it is only this that the treaty has for its object. Besides the cause is only a delegation of the Government; this delegation is always subordinate to the greatest interest of the State and to the various accidents which this interest may compromise. Her owners ought, of course, to have foreseen and calculated these accidents, because war necessarily brings peace, and peace, necessary to the good of the whole, always brings evil to some individuals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201cFor these considerations I have concluded upon a restoration of the ship and cargo without, damages or interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-4\">\u201cDetermined at Paris, the 13th Fructidor, year 9th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">- \u201cGiraud.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">\u201c The report of Citizen Niou, member of the council, being heard, thoroughly examined, and considered\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">\u201c The council, conformably to the fourth article of the convention concluded the 8th Yendemiarie, year 9, between the-French Republic and the United States of America, as well as to the letter of the minister of foreign relations of the 29th Thermidor last, hath decreed that the American ship Amazon, captured by the French privateer La Mouche, together with the cargo, in the condition in which they are, and. in case of a sale of any of the aforesaid articles the proceeds of the sale legally made shall be given up and restored to the-said Captain Israel Trask, together with the documents and papers of the ship, with a deduction of all expenses lawfully incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">\u201cTo which end, as well the owners of the said privateer as all keepers, consignees, sequestrators, and depositories, shall be constrained by all proper and reasonable means, even cor-porally, doing which, they are discharged.

While peacefully pursuing said voyage she was seized on the high seas on or about the 6th day of July, 1800, by the French privateer La Mouche and carried into the port <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>of Corunna, in Spain, and vessel and cargo libeled before the council of prizes at Paris, where, on the 30th day of August, 1801, it was decreed that vessel and cargo be restored to Capt. Israel Trask in the condition in which they are, and in case of a sale the proceeds to be given up, with a deduction of all expenses lawfully incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In pursuance of above decree the Amazon was restored to C\u00e1ptain Trask September 21, 1801, after a detention of fourteen months and eighteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">This case presents the same question presented in the case of the Rose, Chase, master, decided at the present term of the court, to wit: The right of the claimants to recover when it is shown that the captured vessel resisted the exercise of search on the part of the French privateer capturing the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In that case it was held, as a conclusion of law, that there was no liability upon the part of the French Government, and hence none on the part of the American Government under the obligation imposed upon it by the convention of September 30,1800. While in the case of the Rose there was a more determined resistance, greater loss of life, and injury to the persons engaged than in this case, that difference does not change the law as applicable to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">In this case, as shown by the statements of the protest and decree, the Amazon did not stop and exhibit her papers to the' privateer; there was a very substantial and determined resistance to the exercise of the right of search, and it was only by the superior force of the capturing ship that the result of capture was accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">For the reasons above stated the court decides, as a conclusion of law, that the seizure and condemnation were lawful; that the owners and insurers had no valid claim of indemnity therefor upon the French Government prior to the ratification of the convention between the United States and the French Republic concluded on the 30th day of September, 1800; that the claims were not relinquished to France by the Government of the United States by said treaty in part consideration of the relinquishment of certain national claims of France against the United States; and that the claimants are not entitled to recover from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The facts in detail will be reported, with a copy of this opinion, to Congress, in accordance with the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
