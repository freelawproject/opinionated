On the 27th of May 1867, Gr. C. Murray entered a judgment for $400 against Morris ; on the 9th of July this judgment was assigned to S. S. Charles, and on the 6th of January 1868, Charles assigned it to Ziegler, the plaintiff. On the 14th of January 1870, the deed from the defendant was recorded. On the 23d of May 1870, Ziegler issued execution on his judgment; the land was condemned, and under a vend. ex. sold to Ziegler and sheriff\u2019s deed acknowledged November 2d 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-16\">Morris defended on the title of his wife, and the question was the validity of the deed to Mr\u00e9.

The above facts appeared in evidence at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">Morris testified that the money with which the property was bought came from his wife\u2019s estate, received by him before 1848; that his wife wished him to convey the land to her and he did so, because he had got the money with which .it was bought; he was a day laborer, but at the time of the sale to her was not in debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-7\">The defendant offered evidence that Charles, had notice of the title of the property being in the wife before'he took the judgment ; it was rejected by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-8\">The plaintiff testified he bought the judgment from Charles after having had a certificate from the recorder that the title was in Morris, and he had no knowledge that Mrs. Morris was the owner. At the sheriff\u2019s sale plaintiff had notice that the land belonged to Mrs. Morris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-9\">The court charged the jury that Mrs. Morris\u2019s title was good, \u201c unless the deed made by Samuel, her husband, to her was made with intent to defraud and cheat creditors, or unless it was more than a reasonable provision for his wife out of his property.

This deed also is void at law, can only be sustained in equity, and the wife asserted no right under it; in fact did not make known its existence until after the husband had contracted the debts, against which she now seeks to set it up; there was no abandonment of possession by the husband, all remained as before; the supineness of the wife gave to the husband a false credit as clearly appears in the evidence; and equity, therefore, will not aid her at the expense of those or him misled by her <em>laches. </em>Consequently, judgment must be entered on the question of law reserved by the court, in favor of the plaintiff, <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>upon his paying the jury fee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The defendant removed the case to the Supreme Court, and assigned for error the rejection of his offer of evidence and entering judgment for the plaintiff <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-6\"><em>Graham </em>(with whom was <em>G.

F. Smith 9, that when the jury finds a verdict for the defendant there can be no judgment entered upon a reserved point for the plaintiff. Such judgment being without any verdict to support it, wants a legal foundation and is therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">In order, however, to end this controversy we have been requested by the counsel of both parties to consider and decide the question reserved. That question was, whether the failure of the wife to record her deed until after the judgment was purchased by the plaintiff \u2014 no knowledge of the existence- of the deed being traced to him \u2014 gave to her husband a false credit, and was such laches on her part to the misleading of the plaintiff as will prevent her from setting up her title against him. It is supposed that the judgment of this court in Coates <em>v. </em>Gerlach, 8 Wright 43, is an authority in point, and upon this ground the learned judge below-entered judgment <em>non obstante veredicto. </em>But the decision in that case was expressly that the deed to the wife could not be sustained because it was more than a reasonable provision for her, and what is added as to her not recording the deed, is a reason for not regarding her case with favor, because she had studiously and purposely concealed her title for the purpose of giving her husband a false credit. <em>\u201c </em>In asking,\u201d says Mr. Justice Strong, \u201c that a deed void at law should be sustained in equity, she is met with the fact that she asserted no right under it; in fact concealed its existence until after her husband had contracted the debts against which she now seeks to set it up.\u201d But no such element as this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>which is necessary to create an estoppel against her in equity, is incorporated in the point reserved. She is to he estopped by the bare non-recording her deed \u2014 whether it was through ignorance or design. It rejects also the element of notice to the creditor, which may have existed; and certainly if she or her husband were careful to give notice to everybody who trusted him that the property was his wife\u2019s \u2014 it was entirely too much to go further, and require notice to be given to all assignees of creditors of whose existence she could know nothing, and unless consulted could not give them notice before assignment. It is evident that the wife in Coates <em>v. </em>Gerlach was to be barred in consequence of bad faith\u2014 not for simply not recording her deed, which in law she was not bound to do as against judgment or other creditors. \u201cIf anything,\u201d says Mr. Chief Justice Gibson in Reed\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 478, \u201cis settled by reason and authority, it is that a judgment-creditor is not entitled to the protection of a purchaser of the legal title against an equitable owner or his creditors, or to any advantage which his debtor had not.\u201d Throughout a series of decisions from Finch <em>v. </em>Winchelsea, 1 P. Wms 277, to Ludwig <em>v. </em>Highley, 5 Barr 132, the law has been so held in England and Pennsylvania.\u201d He proceeds to vindicate the rule with his usual force, and it is clear that the law must be made for the majority of cases, and the ordinary course of dealing in which the creditor looks to the debtor\u2019s personal ability, and to nothing else. It proves nothing, then, to allege and show that the creditor \u2014 much less the purchaser of the creditor\u2019s claim \u2014 searched the records, and found no deed there. Upon the point reserved, then, we are of opinion that the defendant below, having the verdict also in his favor, was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Judgment reversed, and now judgment upon the verdict for Samuel Morris, the defendant below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
