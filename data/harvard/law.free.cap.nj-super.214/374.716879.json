We hold that the child\u2019s claim is not barred in the absence of court approval of the parents' settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">This is what happened. In 1976, plaintiff Barbara Colfer was struck and injured by an automobile while she was riding her bicycle. Her parents started suit against the motorist, and then, when they discovered he was uninsured, made a demand for UMI arbitration under their Royal Globe Insurance Company policy. Before arbitration, a settlement was reached in the amount of $12,200. A \u201cParents\u2019 Release and Indemnification Agreement\u201d was prepared and a check made to the parents was sent by Royal Globe to the family\u2019s attorney. The net proceeds were- ultimately deposited into a savings account in plaintiff\u2019s name. Her father took the account from her while she was still a minor, promising to repay her some day. He used all of the money to pay his own unrelated obligations and living expenses. There is nothing to indicate plaintiff benefited from the use of any of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">After reaching majority, plaintiff unsuccessfully pursued her father for the money. Ultimately she started this suit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>renewed the demand for arbitration of her UMI claim. The complaint alleged breach by Royal Globe of a duty to the injured minor not to pay out benefits without judicial approval, and asserted that the demand for arbitration was not barred by the parents\u2019 release. The Law Division granted Royal Globe\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissed the suit and barred the arbitration, holding that the settlement precluded further claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It is long out of doubt that a parent or appointed guardian cannot dispose of a child\u2019s cause of action without statutory authority or judicial approval. <em>Wilkins v. Smith, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 126 (App.Div.1981); <em>Bauer v. Griffin, </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 546 (Law Div.1969), aff\u2019d 108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>414 (App.Div.), certif. den. 56 <em>N.J. </em>245 (1970); <em>Mack v. Berry, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600 (Law Div.1985); <em>Whitcomb v. Dancer, </em>140 <em>Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458, </em>460-461 (1982); <em>Doyle v. Bowdoin College, </em>403 A.2d 1206, 1208 n. 3 (Me.1979); <em>Dacanay v. Mendoza, </em>573 A.2d 1075, 1078-1079 (9 Cir.1978); <em>Centala v. Navrude, </em>30 <em>Mich.App. </em>30, 186 <em>N.W.2d </em>35 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The purpose of the rule is not only to guard a minor against an improvident compromise but also to secure the minor against dissipation of the proceeds. <em>See R. </em>4:48A; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-6; 3BA5-16, 17, all governing the disposition of the proceeds of infant\u2019s judgments and settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">It makes no difference whether the claim is in suit. There is no sensible reason why parents who may not settle their child\u2019s suit without judicial approval should be able to bind the child by settling a claim not yet in court. The dangers are identical of disadvantageous compromises and improper disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tion of proceeds. Our rules clearly provide for the institution of suit on behalf of a minor solely to seek approval of a proposed settlement of a claim not in suit. <em>R. </em>4:44-1. A guardian <em>ad litem </em>wishing to accept an award arising out of statutory arbitration of auto negligence actions, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-24 <em>et. seq., </em>must submit it for approval. <em>R. </em>4:21 A-7. A defendant in any case wishing to secure a final disposition of a child\u2019s claim for its own protection must see that a judgment is entered with court approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">It is not only personal injury claims sounding in tort whose settlement requires judicial approval. It is of no consequence, therefore, that the present claim against Royal Globe arises out of the provisions of an insurance contract rather than out of a negligent tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We do not hold that Royal Globe breached a duty to plaintiff by not insisting on court approval of the settlement. If the settlement does not bind plaintiff, Royal Globe has no duty to guard plaintiff against it. However, one who pays the parents to settle a minor\u2019s claim without judicial approval or statutory authority remains liable to the minor, and takes the risk that the parents\u2019 indemnification agreement may be an empty guarantee. As between a minor with a dissipated claim and an insurer which could have guarded against the danger of multiple payments, our choice is not a difficult one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Judgment against plaintiff is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for the entry of a judgment directing the parties to proceed to arbitration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\">There was an adverse ruling by another Law Division Judge on an earlier motion by Royal Globe for summary judgment. The parties have argued whether that earlier ruling should have barred the court\u2019s later judgment. We find it unnecessary to deal with the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">We express no opinion on the circumstances presented in <em>Boyce v. Doyle, </em>113 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240 (Law Div.1971), where a minor sought to disavow his own release without returning the consideration he received. Also, we do not deal with a case in which the parents have applied the settlement proceeds to the use of the child and the insurer seeks a credit or other adjusting relief on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
