The Advocate also argues that if this aspect of the final reconciliation adjustment procedure is viewed as automatic, the Commission\u2019s duty to implement the \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d aspect of the volume and case-mix <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-18.1b) is not fulfilled. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The current process involved in implementing these statutory objectives was recently summarized by our Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A61\">Stated simply, the Amendment establishes a three-step system for the setting of hospital rates. First, the Commissioner of Health proposes for each hospital a preliminary cost base <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014that proportion of its expenses that the Commissioner determines deserves to be covered by the hospital\u2019s charges to its patients. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-2(k). The preliminary cost base is annually increased by an economic factor to account for inflation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-18.1(b). Then, the Commissioner of Health proposes for each hospital a \u201ccertified revenue base\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>\u2014an amount determined by the Commissioner that must be reimbursed to the hospital. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-2(1). Finally the hospital\u2019s rates are approved by the Commission, based on the hospital\u2019s certified revenue base figure. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-4.1(b). The preliminary cost base, the certified revenue base, and the schedule of rates are determined in accordance with regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Health with the approval of the Health Care Administrative Board. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-2(k), -18(b). However, they must ultimately be approved by the Commission. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-4.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">.. .A key feature of the 1978 Amendment was the declared public policy of the Act to contain hospital costs. The method used to achieve this containment objective also sought to increase the efficiency of the hospital\u2019s operations through a system of \u2018incentives\u2019 and \u2018disincentives\u2019 set forth in the regulations. Under this method, an individual hospital\u2019s costs in particular functions are compared to those of other hospitals operating within a certain area. Both a hospital\u2019s direct and indirect patient care costs are screened against a standard developed for that hospital\u2019s peer group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">The disincentives and incentives in the area of direct patient care cost are not arrived at by an analysis of the costs of particular items or services. Rather, the incentives and disincentives are determined by comparing a particular hospital\u2019s historic or base year costs for each separate Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the standard by peer group for each DRG. See <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:31B-3.23. The regulations are designed to establish a prospective rate of reimbursement related to the measure of hospital resources consumed for each particular illness and identified as a price per case by DRG. <em>N.J.A. C. </em>8:31B-5.1. <em>Riverside General v. N.J. Hosp. Rate Setting Comm., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>458, 463 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">At the end of the rate year, hospitals are required to report data on their actual patient volume and case mix as well as the amount of revenue collected during the rate year, for use in final reconciliation. <em>{N.J.A. C. </em>8:31B-3.73(a)) Final reconciliation is a process of aligning and comparing the actual revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>collected by the hospital with the revenue allowable under the approved schedule. <em>See In re 1982 Final Reconciliation Adjustment for Jersey Shore Med. Center, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 84 (App.Div.1986). It involves a recalculation of the projected economic factor using the actual inflationary factor for the rate year, and a redetermination of the rates in light of the actual volume and case-mix of the hospital, together with any adjustments previously granted through administrative appeal. <em>(N.J. A.C. </em>8:31B-3.71 to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:31B3.73)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Besides the standards set forth in the regulations, a specific explanation of the various kinds of calculations as well as the forms used in the final reconciliation is provided by a methodology manual each year. The manual explaining the final reconciliation methodology for the 1983 rate year was approved by the Commission in October 1984, after the document had been circulated for comments from the hospital industry and other interested persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Under the methodology, the amount of the allowable approved net revenue for the rate year, is compared to the actual net revenue collected by the hospital. Any variance in the amounts is computed with interest. <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>8:31B-3.75(b)(4)) If the comparison shows that the hospital\u2019s actual net revenue exceeds the final calculated amount (an \u201covercollection\u201d), the excess, including the computed interest, is subtracted from the next year\u2019s rates; if the amount of the actual revenue collected is below the appropriate amount (an \u201cundercollection\u201d), the amount of the variance, together with interest, becomes an adjustment to the next year\u2019s preliminary cost base or certified revenue base. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8.31B-3.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The Advocate contends that treating the final reconciliation adjustments as \u201cautomatic\u201d violates the Commission\u2019s duty to insure that the adjustments to the schedule of rates are \u201cnecessary and appropriate.\u201d See, <em>e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-18.1b. We disagree because the argument ignores the substantial provisions in the regulatory scheme which are specifically ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>dressed to the method chosen to assure necessity and propriety. See <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:31B-3.76 to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:31B-3.87. These regulations are framed consistently with the underlying reliance upon the concept of diagnosis related groups, and strictly regulated deviations from those groups, as the means of complying with the requirements that payment be made only for appropriate and necessary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In this complex area where the Legislature has delegated a great amount of discretion to the administrative experts, deference must be accorded to the administrative agency\u2019s expertise and experience in choosing how to address its statutory charge. In re <em>Barnert Memorial Hospital Rates, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>31, 91 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We believe that reliance upon <em>Jersey Shore, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 89, is misplaced. That case involved a challenge by a hospital to the <em>methodology </em>of a reconciliation. By contrast, here, the methodology had already been adopted with opportunity for comment, and as contemplated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2A-18.-lb, the process was recognized both by that statute and by the implementing regulation, <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>8:31b-3.71a), as one of the \u201cautomatic\u201d adjustments to be made under the statute. The Advocate incorrectly argues that the automatic nature of the adjustment is a position urged by the Attorney General. Rather, \u201cautomatic\u201d is the statutory and regulatory characterization of this step in the rate process. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-18.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The Advocate now seeks a reversal and remand of the approvals by the Commission of the final reconciliation adjustments under the uncontested methodology. It urges that the Commission must make findings and a determination as to its reasons for approving the reconciliation. We are satisfied that the Commission has already determined that the adjustments are in accordance with the methodology, and are accurate. Neither of these facts has been contested. This fulfills the Commission\u2019s responsibility for approval at this stage. See, <em>Bergen Pines Hospital v. Dept. of Human Services, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>456, 478 (1984); <em>East Windsor Reg\u2019l Bd. of Ed. v. State Bd. of Ed., </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 552-553 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">It is undisputed that our decision will not change the substantive result in this case, inasmuch as the 12-month period provided by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:31B-3.75(a) for the subject hospitals to make up their schedule of rates variances by increases in their subsequent 12-month charges to users, has expired. The Advocate does not seek any refunds. Thus, the only tangible effect of a remand would be to focus attention on the need for a point in the rate-setting scheme when inquiry can be made by the Division of Rate Counsel as to reasons for large rates variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We do not mean to foreclose such opportunity. We decline, however, to order an exercise in futility by remanding this matter for hearing, where the adjustments were automatic pursuant to an approved methodology, and the data was uncontested. The regulatory scheme contains its own methods for rewarding the efficient and penalizing the inefficient. See, <em>Riverside, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 463, 464. A history of unreliable forecasts, or requests for explanations thereof can readily be made part of the consideration of preliminary cost base and certified revenue base for any given institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Indeed, the Attorney General states in Formal Opinion No. 3, 1976, \u201cthat the rate setting process furnishes a proper occasion for involvement by the Division of Rate Counsel.\u201d Although the statute has been amended since that opinion was rendered, it is still substantially accurate in stating with respect to reimbursement rates, that, \u201cthis rate is later adjusted, after the end of the year, based on actual costs of services provided. <em>The major assessment of the reasonableness of a hospital\u2019s rate request in relation to the elements of cost, however, is reflected in the setting of the interim administrative payment rate rather than in the final rate.\u201d </em>Formal Opinion No. 3, at 146. (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>We suggest that the appropriate time for participation by the Division of Rate Counsel is during the preliminary cost base proceeding when the prospective rates and submissions can be scrutinized in light of previous schedule of rates variances results, and, as well, by comparing the percent of such variances to those of the entire group of hospitals participating. In this way, the Advocate may use its power to employ experts, if it so chooses, <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>52-.27E-17, 19) and avail itself of the clearly expressed opportunity for its Division of Rate Counsel to examine reports prior to rate proceedings. This will also serve the statutory goal of cost containment <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-1; <em>In re Monmouth Medical Center Rate Appeal, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>20 (App.Div.1982)) and the policy goal of avoidance of multiple lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">It is clear to us that the Commission does not dispute the importance of raising questions respecting the cause of abnormal variances between the projected and actual figures generated in any hospital. Rather, the concern is where and when it is most appropriate that the Advocate raise these questions or request or propose answers thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Perhaps the solution is already inherent in the authorities previously mentioned. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-18.1c and Id each specifically refer to the participation of the Advocate, while omitting any reference to the Advocate\u2019s participation in these <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-18.1b proceedings. And, as previously observed, the Attorney General opined in Formal Opinion No. 3, 1976, under the pre-amendment legislation, not only that the Division of Rate Counsel may participate in Hospital Rate Setting proceedings, but that the crucial time in such proceedings is when the rates are preliminarily set.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">This makes good sense because the Commission and the Advocate will by then have the year\u2019s actual experience of all 91 hospitals for comparative purposes. The Commission can then participate meaningfully in a process where an appellant, including the Division of Rate Counsel, can explore reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>action, and receive articulated determinations thereon. See, <em>Riverside, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In sum, in the absence of any attack on the methodology itself, or on the accuracy of the components therein, we believe that the Commission\u2019s role in the regulatory and statutory scheme has been properly fulfilled by the approval of the reconciliation adjustments here under attack. The reasons for the Board\u2019s action were adequately expressed, when considered in that framework. The desired opportunity for inquiry should properly be made, upon appropriate request, during consideration of the preliminary cost base. We express no view on the nature of the proceeding required.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-2(k):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">k. \u201cPreliminary cost base\u201d means that proportion of a hospital\u2019s current cost which may reasonably be required to be reimbursed to a properly utilized hospital for the efficient and effective delivery of appropriate and necessary health care services of high quality required by such hospital\u2019s mix of patients.
