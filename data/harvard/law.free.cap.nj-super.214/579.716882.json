No CAFRA hearing has been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The appeal was filed as of right under <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2), purportedly to review a final decision of a State administrative agency. Instead, leave to appeal should have been sought. The assertion of DEP jurisdiction was interlocutory, not final. Under the circumstances, including the submission of briefs and argument before us on the jurisdictional issue, we grant leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Clayton\u2019s premises are in a coastal area subject to the requirement of a CAFRA permit prior to construction of a facility. The specific issue before us is whether Clayton\u2019s proposed paved parking lot of more than three acres and with approximately 740 parking spaces is a facility as defined in CAFRA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-3(c)(5). Concededly, a DEP regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-2.1(b)(l)(iii), is applicable to impervious paving of an area of more than two acres for motor vehicle parking and related access thereto, such as Clayton proposes. Nevertheless, he contends that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u20142.1(b)(l)(iii) is <em>ultra vires </em>and unenforceable because it is without warrant in the CAFRA definition of facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">As noted in <em>Matter of Egg Harbor Associates (Bayshore Centre), </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>358, 364 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The primary purpose of CAFRA is to protect the unique and fragile coastal zones of the State. Through CAFRA, the Legislature intended to reverse \u201cserious adverse environmental effects ... that would preclude or tend to preclude those multiple uses which support diversity and are in the best longterm, social, economic, aesthetic and recreational interests of all people of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-2. To achieve this goal, the Legislature determined that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">all of the coastal area should be dedicated to those kinds of land uses which promote the public health, safety and welfare, protect public and private property, and are reasonably consistent and compatible with the natural laws governing the physical, chemical and biological environment of the coastal area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><em>See also State, Dept, of Envir. Protection v. Stavola, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>425, 431-432 (1986). CAFRA should be construed liberally to effectuate its purpose and intent, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-3(c)(5) includes within the CAFRA definition of facility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">\u201cPublic facilities and housing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">Road, airport, or highway construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">In challenging <em>N.J.A. C. </em>7:7-2. l(b)(l)(iii), Clayton\u2019s argument is two-pronged: \u201cPublic facilities\u201d should be limited to governmental facilities; \u201croad\u201d or \u201chighway\u201d should not be extended to paved parking lot. We reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">We construe the adjective \u201cpublic\u201d modifying \u201cfacilities\u201d to mean open to the public or available for public use, as Clayton\u2019s proposed shopping center parking lot would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">In the Law Against Discrimination <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5, \u201cpublic facility\u201d is similarly defined as \u201cany place of public accommodation as any street, highway, sidewalk, walkway, public building, and other place or structure to which the general public is regularly, normally or customarily permitted or invited.\u201d No distinction is drawn between private and governmental ownership. <em>See Clover Hill Swimming Club v. Goldsboro, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>25, 33 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Clayton\u2019s argument, if logically extended, would exclude privately owned roads or driveways of 1,200 feet more in length or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>privately owned airports from CAFRA jurisdiction. Yet the threat of adverse effects to the sensitive ecology and environment of the coastal area is identical whether a road or airport is privately or governmentally owned. Nothing in CAFRA\u2019s legislative history would support such an arbitrary dichotomy or the loss of the safeguards of the CAFRA review process when equivalent facilities are privately, not governmentally, owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We likewise sustain DEP\u2019s interpretation of \u201croad\u201d or \u201chighway\u201d to encompass parking lots of two acres or more. The environmental threats from impervious paved areas, whether privately or governmentally owned, are the same: interference with natural drainage and excessive surface water run-off after storms.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Clayton argues that the category \u201croad, airport or highway construction\u201d within the statutory definition of \u201cpublic facilities\u201d does not have appended to it the phrase \u201cor equivalent,\u201d unlike the category \u201cnew housing developments of 25 or more dwelling units or equivalent.\u201d See construction of that phrase in <em>Stavola, supra </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 433-434:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">Accordingly, we hold that DEP, to work effectively toward fulfilling the legislative purposes of CAFRA, has the necessary implicit statutory authority to promulgate rules and regulations that interpret a seaside beach club cabana as \u201cequivalent\u201d to \u201ca housing development of 25 or more dwelling units.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">We do not attach decisive significance to the omission of the phrase \u201cor equivalent,\u201d following \u201croad, airport or highway construction\u201d within the statutory definition of \u201cpublic facilities.\u201d Implicitly, in accordance with the rule of liberal construction in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-20, impervious paved areas for motor vehicle travel and parking are \u201croad or highway construction\u201d subject to CAFRA review for the purpose of preserving the coastal area from development hostile to its sensitive and fragile ecology and environment. We uphold the inclusion in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-2.1(B)(l)(iii) of paved parking lots of two acres or more within \u201croad ... or highway construction,\u201d as a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>exercise of DEP\u2019s regulatory authority reasonably interpreting CAFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We affirm</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
