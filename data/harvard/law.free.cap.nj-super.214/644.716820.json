Plaintiff was struck and injured by a New Jersey automobile that respondent had insured (the insured automobile). Just before the accident plaintiff had been a passenger in a New York automobile owned by Lena Reid when it was in a minor collision that did not injure him. Plaintiff was standing outside the Reid automobile inspecting the damage caused by the collision when the insured automobile struck him. Plaintiff settled his personal injury action against the owners and the operators of both automobiles. The release he gave those parties provided, \u201cThis release is exclusive of Personal Injury Protection benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Plaintiff is not entitled to PIP benefits from the carrier of the Reid automobile because under the law of New York, where the Reid automobile was registered and principally garaged, a carrier need not, and Reid\u2019s carrier did not, afford plaintiff PIP coverage. <em>See Quintana v. Brambila, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361 (App.Div.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Respondent contends that it is not liable for PIP benefits because at the time he was struck by the insured automobile plaintiff was \u201coccupying\u201d the Reid automobile. Plaintiff denies that contention and argues that he was a \u201cpedestrian\u201d when the insured automobile struck him. The dispute is not factual. The parties agree that at the time of impact plaintiff was standing outside the Reid automobile, inspecting the damage it had just sustained. The dispute is over the meaning of \u201coccupying,\u201d a word that is used but not defined in the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act (the act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3 requires \u201c[e]very owner or registered owner of an automobile registered or principally garaged in this State\u201d to carry minimum automobile liability insurance. <em>N.J. S.A. </em>39:6A-4 requires that every such policy provide PIP benefits regardless of fault</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, or as a pedestrian, being struck by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile, to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with the permission of the named insured, and to pedestrians, sustaining bodily injury caused by the named insured\u2019s automobile or struck by an object propelled by or from such automobile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2h defines \u201cpedestrian\u201d in relevant part as \u201cany person who is not occupying, entering into, or alighting from a vehicle____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Plaintiff argues that by not being in the Reid automobile at the time of the accident he was a pedestrian because he was \u201cnot occupying ... a vehicle.\u201d Respondent argues that we should adopt the broad definition given the word \u201coccupying\u201d in <em>Newcomb Hospital v. Fountain, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291 (Law Div.1976), where the court held that the plaintiff remained an occupant of his automobile and was therefore entitled to PIP benefits from its insurer even though he had left the vehicle to watch a service station attendant adding water to its radiator. The plaintiff in that case was injured when gasoline that had inadvertently been mixed with the water caused the radiator to explode.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court found it significant that the plaintiff was only temporarily out of the automobile, was engaged in some activity associated with the automobile, and had intended to return to the automobile to continue his journey. <em>Id. </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Plaintiff counters that the court in <em>Newcomb </em>gave \u201coccupying\u201d a broad definition in order to comply with the statutory mandate that the act \u201cshall be liberally construed so as to effect the purpose thereof.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-16. Commenting on that mandate, our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cPIP coverage should be given the broadest application consistent with the statutory language.\u201d <em>Amiano v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>85, 90 (1981). As demonstrated by this case, however, defining \u201coccupying\u201d broadly to afford PIP coverage by the carrier of one New Jersey automobile can have the effect of removing PIP coverage by the carrier of another New Jersey automobile. One cannot be \u201coccupying\u201d and \u201cnot occupying\u201d an automobile at the same time. Thus broadening the definition of \u201coccupying\u201d to afford PIP coverage by the carrier of an automobile an injured party was using at the time of the accident will narrow the definition of \u201cnot occupying,\u201d thereby depriving the injured party of his status as a pedestrian and consequently his entitlement to PIP coverage by the carrier of an automobile that strikes and injures him. We reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that a court must interpret \u201coccupying\u201d either broadly or narrowly, depending upon which interpretation will afford coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The Legislature used the word \u201coccupying\u201d in company with \u201centering into, or alighting from a vehicle.\u201d The latter concepts bracket the concept of occupying and thereby infuse it with the meaning intended by the Legislature. A person is \u201coccupying\u201d a vehicle after \u201centering into\u201d it and before \u201calighting from\u201d it. If a person is not in an automobile, he is not occupying it in the statutory sense. Having alighted from the New York automobile before the accident, plaintiff was \u201cnot occupying\u201d it when he was struck and was therefore a pedestrian entitled to PIP benefits from the carrier of the automobile that struck him.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">We are not bound to use the broad definition of \u201coccupying\u201d found in <em>Mondelli v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>167 (1986). There the insured automobile was parked at the curb. The injured person was struck by another automobile while he was in the street leaning his arm on the roof of the insured automobile while talking to his girlfriend who was behind the wheel. The driver of the automobile that struck the plaintiff drove off without stopping. The policy afforded uninsured motorist coverage to a person \u201coccupying an insured highway vehicle.\u201d The policy defined \u201coccupying\u201d to mean \u201cin or upon or entering into or alighting from.\u201d The Court held that the injured person was \u201cupon\u201d the insured vehicle and was therefore occupying it. <em>Mondelli </em>is distinguishable. The policy definition of \u201coccupying\u201d in <em>Mondelli </em>included being \u201cupon\u201d the insured vehicle and the Court was concerned with the meaning of \u201cupon.\u201d That word is not present in either the statutory or policy definitions with which we are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We do not mean to leave the impression that a person injured while using a New Jersey automobile cannot look to the carrier of that automobile for PIP benefits unless at the time of the accident he was occupying, entering into or alighting from the automobile. As noted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 requires a carrier to provide PIP coverage to any person who is \u201coccupying, entering into, alighting from <em>or using </em>the automobile of the named insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The definition of \u201cpedestrian\u201d excludes a person who is \u201coccupying, entering into, or alighting from a vehicle\u201d but does not exclude a person who is otherwise \u201cusing\u201d a vehicle. Thus a person \u201cusing\u201d but \u201cnot occupying, entering into or alighting from a vehicle\u201d is entitled as a pedestrian to PIP benefits from the carrier of a New Jersey automobile that strikes him or from the carrier of any other New Jersey automobile that he was using at the time. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 prohibits recovery from both.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The plaintiff in <em>Newcomb </em>who was watching a service station attendant pour gasoline into his radiator was not then occupying his automobile. We therefore disapprove of the reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>used in that case, but subscribe to its result. Though \u201cnot occupying\u201d his automobile, the plaintiff there was \u201cusing\u201d it. Similarly the plaintiff here was \u201cusing\u201d the Reid automobile when he was struck and injured while examining the damage it had sustained. See <em>Motor Club Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. N.J. Manu. Ins. Co., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>425, 436-437 (1977), for a discussion of the broad meaning of \u201cuse\u201d in the Motor Vehicle Security-Responsibility Law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-46. However, he did not thereby lose his status as a pedestrian and remains entitled to PIP benefits from respondent, the carrier of the automobile that struck him and caused his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment consistent with the parties\u2019 stipulation of damages and for a determination of plaintiff\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6). <em>Maros v. Transamerica Insurance Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>572 (1978).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The court held alternatively that if the plaintiff was \"not occupying\u201d the insured automobile he was a \"pedestrian\" entitled to PIP from the same carrier because he was \u201cstruck by an object propelled by or from\u201d the insured automobile, a basis of recovery under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. <em>Newcomb, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 295-296.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The personal injury protection coverage of the named insured shall be the primary coverage for the named insured and any resident relative in the named insured\u2019s household who was not a named insured under an automobile insurance policy of his own.
