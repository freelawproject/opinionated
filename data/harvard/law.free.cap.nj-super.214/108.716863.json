We hold that a defendant is under no obligation to volunteer such information to the police and, therefore, the State should not be permitted to attack his credibility on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Following a protracted jury trial, defendant was convicted of murder (Ar.J'.S,.A.2C:ll-3a(l), (2)), armed robbery <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1) and two counts of aggravated assault <em>(N.J.S.A.2G:12</em>lb(l). On the murder conviction, defendant was sentenced to a custodial term of 30 years. Pursuant to 7V.J'.S'.A2C:ll-3b, the entire sentence is to be served without parole eligibility. Concurrent sentences were imposed on the other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">In the early morning hours of November 24, 1983 Omar Muhammed was shot and killed and Michael Bambo was wounded during the course of a heated dispute concerning a drug transaction. The State\u2019s theory at trial was that defendant shot both men when they refused to permit him to sample a quantity of cocaine he was about to purchase. The defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>contended that Muhammed and Bambo accidently shot each other while they were attempting to rob the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The record discloses the following salient facts. In the evening of November 23, 1983 defendant, Joseph Deleva, Terri Giannetta and Dominie Buda were having drinks at the Finnish Line, a tavern located in Newark, when they decided to purchase some cocaine. The group proceeded to an address located on Fifth Street and Bloomfield Avenue where Deleva attempted to buy the drugs from an acquaintance, Bryon Robinson. Although Robinson did not have any cocaine in his possession, Bambo, who apparently overheard the conversation, suggested that they could purchase the drugs from him. After brief negotiations, it was agreed that the group would follow Bambo to his apartment in Nutley.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Bambo and Robinson then met Muhammed and drove off in Muhammed\u2019s automobile. During the ride, Bambo confided to Robinson that he intended to \u201cbeat [those] white guys\u201d by selling them something other than cocaine. Bambo agreed to pay the other two men $40 each and \u201csome beer and wine\u201d in return for their assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Defendant, Deleva, Giannetta and Buda followed in Buda\u2019s automobile. En route to Bambo\u2019s apartment, Buda became increasingly alarmed because it appeared that Muhammed was driving in circles. When they finally arrived at the parking lot adjacent to Bambo\u2019s apartment building, Buda, because of her concern, parked her automobile facing the exit approximately 27 feet from Muhammed\u2019s vehicle. Defendant then accompanied Robinson, Muhammed and Bambo into the building. While in the apartment, Bambo obtained a tinfoil apparently containing cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The men then returned to the parking lot. At that point, an argument developed because defendant refused to pay for the cocaine without first sampling it. Deleva and Giannetta observed Muhammed \u201cunzip his jacket\u201d and reach across his chest in a manner which caused them to fear he was in possession of a firearm. Deleva urged defendant to return to the car. Defendant refused, however, and proceeded to the driver\u2019s side of Muhammed\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">It is at this point that the State\u2019s and the defense\u2019s version of what transpired differs markedly. According to the State\u2019s witnesses, Muhammed was seated in the driver\u2019s seat with the door open when defendant approached. The window on the driver\u2019s side was also open. Robinson testified that as Mu-hammed leaned across the seat to unlock the door on the passenger\u2019s side, defendant reached in the driver\u2019s window and shot the deceased in the chest. After hearing the shot, Robinson attempted to escape, but was confronted by defendant who pointed the gun at him and demanded the cocaine. Robinson told defendant that he didn\u2019t have the drugs and emptied the contents of his pockets. When defendant bent down, Robinson ran off.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Bambo testified that Buda drove out of the parking lot when the shots were fired. At that point, defendant, who was apparently still chasing Robinson came upon Bambo and, without warning, shot him in the shoulder. Bambo and Robinson then ran toward a police patrol car that was approaching the parking lot. The two men frantically told the officer about the shootings. Bambo was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment of his wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The accounts of Robinson and Bambo were corroborated by the testimony of several residents of the apartment complex. Although they were unable to positively identify defendant as the perpetrator of the shootings, their descriptions of the fast-moving events confirmed the version of Robinson and Bambo in several particulars. In addition, Michael Liscari, a visitor who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>observed the incident from the window of a fourth floor apartment, testified that, as the police officer\u2019s patrol car pulled into the parking lot, his attention was diverted to a man, resembling defendant, leaning into Muhammed\u2019s automobile apparently searching for something. When he finished, the man wiped the car door, the steering wheel and the dashboard with his sleeve and fled into the adjacent field.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Defendant elected to testify. As we have noted, his account of the events immediately prior to the killing generally mirrored the evidence presented by the State. He denied, however, shooting Muhammed and Bambo. According to his testimony, a heated argument developed between him and Mu-hammed upon returning to the parking lot after Bambo had obtained the cocaine. He testified that as he was reaching into his pocket in order to pay for the drugs he was suddenly \u201cstruck twice in the face with a hard object.\u201d Muhammed stood on one side of him and Bambo on the other. Both men brandished handguns. As he heard shots being fired, defendant struck Muhammed in the mouth and escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Defendant testified that he was cut and bleeding from the attack by Muhammed and Bambo. In a dazed condition, defendant fled into the nearby streets where he was ultimately found by Deleva and Giannetta who, along with another friend, had returned to look for him. Deleva accompanied defendant to his apartment where they stayed that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Defendant testified that upon entering his apartment he immediately took off his bloody clothing and set it afire. Defendant then flushed the remnants down the toilet. A piece of charred remains was eventually discovered by defendant\u2019s landlord and was given to the police. Defendant\u2019s explanation for attempting to destroy his clothing was thoroughly elicited during his direct examination and repeated during his cross-examination. Defendant testified that he had been convicted previously of distributing controlled dangerous substances and uttering a forged instrument and was on probation at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the incident. According to defendant, he feared that disclosure of his attempt to purchase cocaine would result in revocation of his probation and imprisonment. Moreover, defendant testified that he did not know Muhammed and Bambo had been shot. According to his testimony, he first learned of Muhammed\u2019s death while reading a local newspaper several days later at which time he retained an attorney and surrendered. Defendant admitted, however, that on the day after the incident he had his sister take photographs depicting his wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It is against this factual backdrop that the prosecutor questioned defendant concerning his failure to initially contact the police concerning the attempt of Muhammed and Bambo to rob him. Defendant admitted that he never volunteered this exculpatory information to the police and that he never filed a criminal complaint against Bambo. Defense counsel did not initially interpose an objection to this testimony. He subsequently requested a sidebar conference, however, and objected on the basis that defendant had no duty to provide the police with any information once he was a \u201ctarget\u201d of their investigation. The trial judge agreed with defense counsel\u2019s argument and instructed the jury that a suspect sought by the authorities in connection with an offense \u201chas no obligation whatsoever to come forward\u201d with the exculpatory facts he later gives in his trial testimony. The judge went on to note, however, that the jury could consider defendant\u2019s silence prior to the time \u201che became a subject of [a] criminal investigation.\u201d Defense counsel offered no objection to the trial judge\u2019s curative charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">It is now argued, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning prearrest silence infringed upon defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege. Defendant alternatively contends that New Jersey\u2019s common law privilege against self-incrimination accords greater protection than its federal constitutional counterpart and that it should be interpreted as precluding the State from eliciting testimony concerning an accused\u2019s prearrest failure to apprise the authorities of the exculpatory information he later provides in his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The extent to which a defendant\u2019s silence can be used to impeach his trial testimony has been the subject of several recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>610, 617, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 2244, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, 97 (1976), the Court held that silence in the wake of the warnings mandated by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>694 (1966) is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d because it may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination. Although the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves contain \u201cno express assurance that silence will carry no penalty,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process\u201d to allow the arrested persons\u2019s refusal to respond to questions to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 426 <em>U.S. </em>at 619, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>231, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980), the Court addressed the question whether the use of prearrest silence to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility violates either the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court stated that when a defendant elects to take the stand and testify, he necessarily \u201ccast[s] aside his cloak of silence\u201d and subjects himself to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 100 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2129, 65 L.Ed.2d at 94. Having voluntarily chosen to take the stand, the accused is under \u201can obligation to speak truthfully and accurately.\u201d <em>Ibid, quoting Harris v. New York, </em>401 <em>U.S. 222, 225, </em>91 <em>S.Ct. </em>643, 645, 28 L.Ed.2d 1, 4 (1971). The Court observed that while every defendant has the right to testify in his own defense, or to refuse to do so, the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>privilege cannot be construed as a license to commit perjury. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court thus concluded that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments are not \u201cviolated by the use of prearrest silence to impeach a criminal defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d 447 <em>U.S. </em>at 238, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2129, 65 L.Ed.2d at 95. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that \u201c[e]ach jurisdiction may formulate its own rules of evidence to determine when prior silence is so inconsistent with present statements that impeachment by reference to such silence is probative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2129, 65 L.Ed.2d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Although the evolution of the law in this area is by no means complete, New Jersey has thus far taken a somewhat different approach. In <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100 (1976), our Supreme Court held that, as a matter of state law, a defendant\u2019s silence at or near the time of his arrest may not be used to impeach his trial testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 112. <em>See also State v. Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>403, 410 (1977). The Court stated that \u201ca defendant is under no obligation to volunteer to the authorities at the first opportunity the exculpatory story he later tells at his trial____\u201d 70 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>at 115. Unlike the approach subsequently adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, supra, </em>our Court expressed the view that the \u201crule of impropriety of cross-examination of a defendant with respect to silence in police custody ... should not depend on whether or not the [accused] received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, n. 10. Noting that \u201c[t]he right to remain silent existed long before <em>Miranda,\u201d </em>the Court saw no \u201cmeaningful basis [for such] a distinction.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The exact contours of the rule enunciated by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Deatore, supra, </em>have yet to be defined. We note that <em>Deatore </em>and subsequent decisions in which the rule has been applied all involved post-arrest custodial silence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Whitehead, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>343, 346-348 (1979); <em>State v. Lyle, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 409; <em>State v. Alston, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>95, 98 (1976). <em>Cf. State v. Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 530 (1985). We also observe that <em>Deatore </em>was decided after <em>United States v. Hale, supra, </em>but before <em>Doyle v. Ohio, supra, </em>and <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, supra. </em>Since the decision in <em>Deatore </em>was reached \u201cas a matter of state law and policy\u201d as to which stricter standards and controls may be imposed, <em>State v. Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 112, it remains to be seen whether our Supreme Court will ultimately adopt the rationale of <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, supra, </em>and draw a distinction between prearrest and postarrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">We do not find it necessary to decide that question in this case. We merely note the disarray in decisional treatment of this issue in other jurisdictions. While several states have opted to admit evidence of prearrest silence to impeach a defendant\u2019s trial testimony, <em>see, e.g., People v. Redmond, </em>29 <em>Cal.3d </em>904, 633 P.2d 976, 176 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>780 (Sup.Ct. <em>en banc </em>1981); <em>People v. Givans, </em>166 <em>Cal.App.</em>3d 793, 212 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>762 (App.Ct.1985); <em>People v. Free, </em>131 Cal.App.3d 155, 182 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>259 (App.Ct.1982); <em>Lebowitz v. State, </em>313 So.2d 473 (Fla.App.Ct.1975), <em>cert. </em>den. 330 So.2d 19 (Fla.Sup.Ct.1976); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>72 <em>N.C.App. </em>59, 323 S.E.2d 490 (App.Ct.1984), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>aff\u2019d, 313 <em>N.C. </em>593, 330 <em>S.E.2d </em>205 (Sup.Ct.1985), others have chosen to adopt stricter standards. <em>See, e.g., People v. Conyers, </em>52 <em>N.Y.2d </em>454, 420 <em>N.E.2d </em>933, 438 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>741 (Ct. of App.1981); <em>People v. Lee, </em>110 <em>A.D.2d </em>913, 488 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>738 (App.Ct.1985); <em>People v. Pressley, </em>93 <em>A.D.2d </em>665, 462 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>864 (App.Ct.1983); <em>State v. Sabbah, </em>13 <em>Ohio App.3d </em>124, 468 <em>N.E.2d </em>718 (App.Ct.1982); <em>Farley v. State, </em>717 P.2d 111 (Okla. Cr.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that a defendant\u2019s failure to volunteer exculpatory information to the authorities prior to his arrest may generally be used to attack his credibility,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we find that impeachment by silence was inappropriate in this case. For silence to be probative, it must appear that the failure to speak was unnatural and that an ordinary person would have come forward with the exculpatory information under the circumstances. Here, however, the ambiguity of defendant\u2019s prearrest silence plainly diluted whatever probative force it might otherwise have had. A likely explanation was defendant\u2019s conscious reliance upon his right to remain silent. We also note that according to defendant\u2019s testimony he was unaware of the fact that anyone had been shot. We emphasize that defendant\u2019s trial testimony was only partially exculpatory. Defendant freely admitted that he had attempted to purchase cocaine in violation of the conditions of his probation. Clearly, it would not have been natural for the defendant to have come forward in the circumstances of this case and produce incriminating evidence against himself. While the use of defendant\u2019s prearrest silence would not violate due process standards under <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, supra, </em>his failure to volunteer incriminating information at the earliest possible time says little about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the truth of his trial testimony. To permit the use of his prearrest silence, if only for impeachment purposes, suggests that defendant had a duty to provide incriminating evidence against himself and, in our view, improperly burdens his right to testify in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Although our research has not revealed any decisions directly on point, we note that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts reached a similar conclusion in <em>Commonwealth v. Nickerson, </em>386 <em>Mass. </em>54, 434 <em>N.E.2d </em>992 (Sup.Jud.Ct.1982). There, the Court held that impeachment by silence was improper where the defendant would have subjected himself to criminal charges had he come forward and apprised the authorities of the exculpatory story he ultimately gave in his trial testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 434 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 997. The Court stated that \u201cimpeachment of a defendant with the fact of his prearrest silence should be approached with caution, and, wherever it is undertaken, it should be prefaced by a proper demonstration that it was \u2018natural\u2019 to expect the defendant to speak in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">As we have noted, we have no occasion here to address the broader propositions contained in defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments. While we recognize that New Jersey\u2019s common law privilege has historically been construed to afford greater protection than that given by the Fifth Amendment, <em>see, e.g., In the Matter of Grand Jury Proceedings of Joseph Guarino, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>218, 229 (1986); <em>State v. Vinegra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>484, 490 (1977); <em>State v. Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 115-116, we need not dwell upon the subject. Rather, we prefer to rest our decision upon the simple evidentiary principle that prearrest silence under the facts of this case lacked relevance and had little probative force. <em>See Evid.R. </em>1(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>elude that the trial judge committed error in permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine defendant concerning his prearrest failure to report the incident to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We next address the question whether admission of this evidence was harmless error. At the outset, we note that \u201cnot every judicial error will have the effect of vitiating an otherwise valid conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Downey, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 394 (App.Div.1986). Even where the error is of constitutional dimension, the question whether a reversal is required \u201cdepends finally upon some degree of possibility that it led to an unjust verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 335 (1971). While we have rested our holding on evidentiary principles rather than upon constitutional grounds, we are nevertheless aware of the peripheral involvement of the Fifth Amendment. In assessing the impact of the erroneous admission of this evidence, we have thus considered the harmless error standard set forth in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>18, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>824, 17 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>705 (1967), reh\u2019g den. 386 <em>U.S. </em>987, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1283, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>L.Ed.2d 241 (1967). <em>Chapman </em>states that \u201cbefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 828, 17 L.Ed.2d at 710-711.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Applying that standard, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s brief and isolated allusion to defendant\u2019s prearrest silence had no prejudicial impact. In the words of <em>Chapman, </em>we conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In reaching this conclusion, we again refer to defendant\u2019s detailed testimony, initially elicited on direct examination and subsequently pursued by the prosecutor on cross-examination, explaining the reason for his efforts to avoid disclosure of his participation in the attempt to obtain illegal drugs. Defendant\u2019s efforts to avoid detection included flight from the scene of the alleged robbery, his evasive responses to Deleva\u2019s and Giannetta\u2019s inquiries concerning what had transpired, his destruction of his bloody clothing and his attempt to secrete the charred remains. Defendant repeatedly explained that all this was done because of his fear that the authorities would revoke his probation if they were to learn of his attempt to purchase cocaine. Simply stated, the jury was well aware of defendant\u2019s attempt to prevent disclosure of his complicity in the failed attempt to obtain drugs and the reasons for it. The prosecutor\u2019s fleeting reference to defendant\u2019s prearrest silence added nothing to what the jury already knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Beyond this, we emphasize that the entire incident \u201coccupied only [several] lines, as far as the jury was concerned, in the transcript\u201d of a trial lasting two weeks. <em>State v. Alston, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 98. <em>See also State v. Whitehead, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 348. We also note that the subject matter was not specifically referred to in summation or in any other way.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the overall picture, we are fully convinced that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and cannot be said to have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments are clearly without merit and require no further discussion. i?.2:ll-3(e)(2). Specifically, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor\u2019s statements in summation exceeded the bounds of fair comment. We are also entirely unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge committed reversible error in his instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\"> A tinfoil was later discovered by the police in close proximity to Mu-hammed\u2019s automobile.

Burt, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>156 (1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 404 <em>U.S. </em>1047, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>728, 30 <em>L.Ed.24 </em>735 (1972), that under certain circumstances a defendant\u2019s failure to report an incident to the police may be admissible to impeach his trial testimony. The State argues that <em>State v. Burt, supra, </em>is dispositive of the question presented here. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The underlying facts in <em>Burt </em>were markedly different from those in this case and, as pointed out in <em>State v. Deatore, supra, </em>\"the opinion has to be read in the light thereof.\" 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 117-118. In <em>Burt, </em>the charge was murder\u2014the shooting of defendant\u2019s friend. The defense at trial was that the shooting was accidental. The proofs up to the point of cross-examination were that defendant had not sought medical or other assistance for his injured friend after the incident, but rather had fled the scene without knowing whether he was dead or alive. As noted in <em>Deatore, </em>\u201d[t]he purpose of the cross-examination was, in essence, to bring all this out and thus convince the jury that the trial testimony of accidental shooting could not be true.\" <em>Id. </em>at 118. In distinguishing <em>Burt, </em>the Court observed that \u201d[i]t was in fact not a true case of silence in police custody as to an exculpatory story, but rather one of conduct, albeit non-action, after the charged crime inconsistent with defendant\u2019s [testimony] at trial.\" <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We also note that the trial judge's instruction was defective in that it did not specifically confine the jury\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s prearrest silence to the issue of credibility. <em>See Jenkins v. Anderson, supra. Cf. United States v. Harris, supra; State v. Ripa, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>199 (1965); <em>State v. Kimbrough, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57 (App.Div.1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">We also observe that in many cases the risk of prejudice is substantial when the prosecution attempts to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony by his failure to make prearrest exculpatory statements. \"Jurors who are not necessarily sensi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tive to the wide variety of alternative explanations for a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence, may ... construe such silence as an admission and ... draw an unwarranted inference of guilt.\" <em>People v. Conyers, supra, 52 N.Y.2d </em>at 457, 420 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 935, 438 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 743. There are a variety of situations where an innocent suspect would not offer himself or his story to the police. He may believe that he has not committed a crime and thus has no reason to explain himself to the authorities. He may fear disbelief in his explanation by the police. His silence may be attributable to a mistrust or fear of law enforcement authorities. His failure to report an incident may be the result of his awareness that he has no obligation to speak or his caution arising from his knowledge that anything he says may be used against him or his belief that any attempt to exonerate himself would be futile. Accordingly, evidence of a defendant's prearrest silence may be \u201cregarded as having minimal probative significance and ... a correspondingly low potential for advancing the truth-finding process even when offered solely for purposes of impeachment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We do not suggest that a defendant's prearrest silence lacks probative force in all instances. We merely note that even where prearrest silence has evidential significance, the potential for prejudice may outweigh its probative force. <em>See Evid.R. </em>4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Defendant argues that the prosecutor alluded to prearrest silence in her summation. We disagree with defendant\u2019s strained construction of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. The prosecutor merely referred to defendant\u2019s flight from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>scene which she characterized as conduct inconsistent with the hypothesis of innocence. We perceive no error in that regard. <em>See State v. Allen, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>250, 252 (1969); <em>State v. Mills, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>277, 286 (1968), <em>cert. </em>den. 393 <em>U.S. </em>832, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>105, 21 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>104 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
