The assessor raised the assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ments of 2,000 properties for the year 1986 based upon recent sales data. The Council viewed these increases as unfair \u201cspot\u201d assessments because assessments of all properties in the city were outdated and a city-wide revaluation was planned for the following year. Seven hundred forty tax appeals followed the assessor\u2019s action, an increase of almost 450 over the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The Council responded by adopting three resolutions: one directed the assessor to \u201croll back the spot assessments for tax year 1986,\u201d the second directed the assessor to \u201ccease re-assessing any residential properties based solely on recent sales price\u201d and ordered that \u201cany reassessing of properties based upon selling prices should be postponed until the city-wide reassessment which will take place shortly,\u201d and the third engaged a real estate appraiser \u201cto inspect, value and testify\u201d before the county board regarding the value of properties that were the subject of tax appeals except \u201cthe properties that were reassessed as a result of recent sales____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In an opinion reported at 8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>313 (1986), the law division invalidated the first two resolutions as unlawful interferences with the assessor\u2019s exclusive statutory duty to assess, but validated the last resolution as the proper exercise of the Council\u2019s authority to determine how to spend municipal revenues. The assessor appeals the last determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We affirm the judgment of the law division substantially for the reasons given by Judge Hopkins in his reported opinion. We need not consider in this case whether a governing body must provide assistance to an assessor in making and defending particularly complex assessments. The assessor raised the assessments in question based solely upon recent sales data and she did not offer any special reason why she needed assistance in defending them.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
