He was sentenced to an extended term of eight years with four years to be served before parole eligibility. The sentence was made consecutive to a custodial term then being served. Defendant appeals and argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">POINT I THE COURT ERRED IN NOT SUPPRESSING THE SNEAKERS SEIZED BY THE POLICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">A. THE PLAIN VIEW EXCEPTION DID NOT JUSTIFY THE SEIZURE OF DEFENDANT\u2019S SNEAKERS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">B.

Count two alleged theft, by charging that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully take or exercise unlawful control over the movable property of Fotomat with a value in excess of $500.00 with purpose to deprive the owner thereof\u201d in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3. The allegations related to an entry into a Fotomat store for purposes of committing a theft and taking property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>therefrom. Burglary requires only an entry \u201cwith purpose to commit an offense,\u201d irrespective of whether an offense is committed. <em>See State v. Pyron, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 504-505 (App.Div.1985); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2a. Unfortunately the issue in this case becomes somewhat complex in the absence of instructions as to the lesser included offense of attempted theft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not consider the absence of a charge or verdict on attempted theft, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8d; 2C:5-1; 2C:20-3a, because we are satisfied that the verdicts on the two counts do not require reversal of the burglary conviction. Vacation of a conviction is required only if defendant was acquitted on one count which necessarily vitiates an element of the offense for which he was convicted. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 267 (App.Div.1981), certif. den. 89 <em>N.J. </em>413 (1982); <em>State v.

Hannah, </em>584 <em>F.</em>2d 27 (3d Cir.1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, here the jury could have found that while defendant or his accomplice entered the Fotomat with purpose to commit a theft, neither took property with the purpose of depriving the owner thereof.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8a(3) requires that a defendant cannot stand convicted of two crimes when \u201c[inconsistent findings of facts are required to establish the commission of the offenses.\u201d Here defendant was convicted of only one offense. Moreover <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8a(3) bars verdicts based on inconsistent fact finding and not all inconsistent verdicts. As stated in the commentary to the source section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">Subsection a(3) prohibits the conviction for two offenses which require inconsistent findings of fact to establish their conviction. This is the law in New Jersey and elsewhere. See <em>State v. Bell, supra, </em>and cases cited therein. See <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189 [25 L.Ed.2d 469] (1970). The Code does not preclude conviction on one count which is inconsistent with an acquittal on another count. The New Jersey cases have no clear holding on this point but it appears that they are in accord with the Code in allowing a verdict to stand here. <em>State v. Coleman, supra </em>at 42; <em>State v. Dancyger, </em>29 N.J. 76, 93 (1959). [2 Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission (Oct., 1971) at 19].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The burglary occurred on December 26, 1983. Defendant turned 18 years old on March 3, 1979, and reached his 21st birthday on March 3, 1982. He was convicted of four crimes committed as an adult on separate dates with judgments entered on October 31, 1980 and May 29, 1981. However, after this offense occurred but before sentencing, he was convicted of three separate criminal transactions (involving six crimes) occurring in 1984. At the time of sentencing it appears that no consideration was given to the impact of chronology. The court expressly referred to the 1984 transactions when referring to defendant\u2019s record. The court concluded that it was \u201csatisfied that he is a persistent offender, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3, and shall be sentenced to an extended term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The critical issue is whether the judgments for crime entered against defendant after the offense in this case can be considered as prior convictions for purposes of the extended term criteria embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a. That section provides that the court may impose an extended term when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>defendant is a \u201cpersistent offender.\u201d It defines persistent offender as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">A persistent offender is a person who at the time of the commission of the crime is 21 years of age or over, who has been previously convicted on at least two separate occasions of two crimes, committed at different times, when he was at least 18 years of age, if the latest in time of these crimes or the date of the defendant\u2019s last release from confinement, whichever is later, is within 10 years of the date of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-4 defines \u201cprior conviction\u201d and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">An adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that the defendant committed a crime constitutes a prior conviction, although sentence or the execution thereof was suspended, provided that the time to appeal has expired and that the defendant was not pardoned on the ground of innocence. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-4b],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Accordingly, under the literal reading of the Code a defendant must be deemed \u201cpreviously convicted\u201d when a judgment is entered prior to sentencing, provided that there is no pending appeal, irrespective of the chronology of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174 (App.Div.1982), aff\u2019d o.b. 93 <em>N.J. </em>14 (1983) the court construed the mandatory extended term criteria for second and subsequent sex offenders, embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-6</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">... to require, as a prerequisite to imposition of the enhanced penalty, that at the time of the commission of the subsequent offense a conviction of a sex offense must already have been entered. [186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 175].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">In its opinion in <em>Anderson </em>the court referred to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">Our conclusion that the enhanced penalty provision of the statute does not apply to simultaneous conviction of separate sex offenses does not rest on the statutory language alone. It has been the undeviating experience in this State that enhanced penalty statutes in respect of multiple convictions of crimes either expressly or by construction apply only to chronologically sequential convictions, and indeed it is arguable that that prerequisite is a matter of constitutional imperative. <em>Compare N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a (sentencing of persistent offenders) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3d (sentencing of second offender with a firearm)____ We see no reason to depart from that construction here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">Finally, we note that the singular use of the phrase \u2018at any time\u2019 in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-6 may be explained by comparing that section with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a, the persistent offender sentencing provision which replaced former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:85-12. Unlike its predecessor statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44~3a does not define persistent offender status in terms of prior convictions which have been entered against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the defendant at any previous time. Rather, it requires that there be two previous convictions of crime and that \u2018the latest in time of the crimes or the date of the defendant\u2019s last release from confinement, whichever is later, is within 10 years of the date of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced. Thus, it appears that the \u2018at any time\u2019 language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-6 was intended to make clear that as to enhanced penalty for multiple sex crime offenders, the ten-year limitation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a is inapplicable. Thus viewed, it is evident that \u2018at any time\u2019 was used by the Legislature to denote \u2018at any previous time,\u2019 no matter how remote that previous time was. [186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 176-177.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Subsequent to the decision in <em>Anderson, </em>the Supreme Court, in <em>State v. Bey, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>625 (1984), opinion clarified, 97 <em>N.J. </em>666 (1984), made clear that a prior conviction for murder did not have to involve an event occurring prior to the commission of the offense then before the court, for purposes of constituting an aggravating factor under N.J.S.A 2C:ll-3c(4)(a)asitthenstood. In rejecting defendant\u2019s argument in a case where the matter then before the court was chronologically an event occurring subsequent to the prior offense, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">We find no legislative history, decisional law, or policy considerations to recommend defendant\u2019s interpretations. We are satisfied that the status of the prior conviction at the time of its intended use\u2014the penalty phase of the subsequent murder prosecution\u2014is determinative. The relevance of such a conviction, duly authenticated by finality, inheres in the fact that the conviction has occurred prior to the jury\u2019s consideration of the appropriate penalty to be imposed. [96 <em>N.J. </em>at 629].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>See also State v. Biegenwald, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>630, 635-636 (1984), opinion clarified, 97 <em>N.J. </em>666 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Our courts have struggled with the chronological prerequisite of convictions for purposes of the mandatory extended term provisions of the Graves Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c, 2C:43-7c and 2C:44-3d. In <em>State v. Hawks, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430 (App.Div. 1986) and <em>State v. Windsor, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450 (Law Div.1985) it was held that the chronology of the events and offenses was irrelevant so long as judgments were entered prior to the sentencing of the matter before the court. Prior to <em>Hawks, State v. Windsor </em>was overruled in <em>State v. Lightfoot, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475 (App.Div.1986) which also dealt with the mandatory extended term criteria under the Graves Act. The author <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>of <em>Lightfoot </em>dissented in <em>Hawks. Hawks </em>and <em>Windsor </em>followed the rationale of <em>Bey, </em>whereas <em>Lightfoot </em>concluded that <em>Anderson </em>was controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The reference to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a in <em>State v. Anderson </em>is, of course, <em>dictum. </em>In any event, unlike the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:14-6 involved in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c and 2C:44-3d involved in <em>Hawks, Lightfoot </em>and <em>Windsor, </em>the persistent offender provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a deal with a discretionary determination of the court. The exercise of discretion in terms of whether to impose an extended term for an individual who has been \u201cpreviously convicted\u201d on two or more occasions is not unlike the exercise of discretion involved in a capital case regarding the finding of an aggravating factor when a defendant has previously been convicted of murder. Moreover, if the sentencing authority in a capital case can consider a prior conviction for murder irrespective of the chronology of offenses, there is no reason why the sentencing authority in a non-capital case cannot consider multiple convictions irrespective of chronology of events, provided that the other criteria of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a are satisfied. In the exercise of its discretion the court under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a must state reasons for imposition of an extended term. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-2e; <em>R. </em>3:21-4(e). Those reasons should include consideration of the chronology of events, including the impact of prior convictions involving offenses which occurred chronologically after the one before the court or judgments entered after the offense then before the court for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the persistent offender criteria embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a requires neither offenses to have occurred nor judgments to have been entered prior to the offense then before the court for sentencing and, provided that the other criteria embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a are satisfied, that the trial court can consider any \u201cjudgment\u201d entered prior to sentencing provided that there is no pending appeal or right of direct appeal. <em>See State v. Bey </em>and <em>State v. Biegenwald, </em>both <em>supra. </em>However, reasons should be expressed as to why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the court, in granting the application, considered matters involving the offenses occurring or judgments entered after the date of the offense before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Although the court in this case did not expressly consider that several of the prior convictions occurred after the offense in this matter, the statutory criteria permitting imposition of an extended term was satisfied in this case by the judgments which were entered before the burglary of December 26,1983. We cannot therefore conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in imposing an extended term. <em>Cf. State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 364-365 (1984); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The State argues that the proofs warranted the verdicts here because of questions concerning whether there was a completed theft. If so, the lesser included charge of attempted theft should have been presented to the jury. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8d, 8e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">If defendant is acquitted of an offense with several elements one or more of which is required to sustain a conviction of a second charged offense, the conviction must be vacated only if the jury could not have found an element not common to both offenses unsatisfied by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence, acquittal of a lesser included offense requires acquittal of the greater. <em>See e.g., Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>161, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); <em>State v. Dively, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>573 (1983); <em>State v. DeLuca, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422 (App.Div.1986) (separate trials). <em>See also Ohio v. Johnson, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>493, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2536, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984), reh\u2019g den. 468 <em>U.S. </em>1224, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>20, 82 L.Ed.2d 915 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">As no motion was addressed to this issue after the verdict, we do not have the benefit of the trial judge\u2019s thinking on the issue. Such a motion should initially be addressed to the trial judge. <em>Cf. R. </em>2:10-1, 2:10-2, 3:18-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
