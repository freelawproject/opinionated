Evidence was presented at the waiver hearing that the juvenile, A.B., who was 17 at the time of the hearing, committed the crime along with three other juveniles. The evidence included confessions by each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>juveniles which indicated that the crime had been planned at least a day in advance and that the juveniles planned to kill the owner in order to prevent him from later identifying them. A.B. was the one who actually fired the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">After conducting a joint waiver hearing lasting five days, the trial judge concluded that the charges against all four juveniles should be referred to the Law Division. We granted motions by the juveniles for leave to appeal and calendared the cases for argument on the same day. We conclude that the Family Court properly waived jurisdiction of the charges against A.B. and the other juveniles.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">A.B. argues that he is \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d and therefore that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2) the trial judge had no authority to waive the charges against him to the Law Division. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">The following juveniles shall not be committed to a State correctional facility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">(2) Juveniles who are developmentally disabled as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection 3 of P.L.1977, c. 82 (C. 30:6D-3a(l)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Preliminarily, we note that A.B.\u2019s counsel failed to indicate at the commencement of the waiver hearing that he would attempt to show that his client was \u201cdevelopmentally disabled.\u201d Indeed, he indicated in a colloquy regarding the qualifications of one of his expert witnesses that the purpose of the proposed testimony was to show that there was a probability A.B. would be rehabilitated prior to reaching the age of 19. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(3). No mention was made of any intent to show that A.B. was \u201cdevelopmentally disabled.\u201d Furthermore, the testimony of both experts presented on behalf of A.B. was directed solely at his capacity for rehabilitation prior to age 19. Hence, neither expert considered the statutory criteria for determining whether a juvenile is \u201cdevelopmentally disabled.\u201d In fact, the summation of A.B.\u2019s counsel was the first time it was suggested that waiver of A.B.\u2019s case to the Law Division might be inappropriate because he is \u201cdevelopmentally disabled.\u201d There is also no mention of this argument in the trial court\u2019s opinion granting the waiver motion, perhaps because A.B.\u2019s proofs were not addressed to the statutory prerequisites for such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On appeal A.B. relies upon testimony presented at the waiver hearing concerning his capacity for rehabilitation in order to demonstrate that he is \u201cdevelopmentally disabled.\u201d He points, for example, to a statement by one of his experts, Dr. Seymour Canter, that he has a \u201cdevelopmental lag.\u201d However, Dr. Canter attributed this lag to cultural and social influences and concluded that it could be overcome by a program which \u201creally shuts out the values of the street\u201d and teaches A.B. vocational skills and how to read. A.B. also relies upon the opinion of the State\u2019s expert, Dr. Stanley R. Kern, that A.B. is suffering from \u201cminimal brain dysfunction and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>low borderline intelligence\u201d which would \u201cinterfere with his ability to evaluate and to make judgments about things.\u201d However, his opinion falls short of a conclusion that A.B. has the type of \u201csevere, chronic disability\u201d which would justify his classification as \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:6D-3(a) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In any event, assuming the record would support the conclusion that A.B. suffers from a \u201cdevelopmental disability,\u201d this would not preclude waiver of the charges against him to the Law Division. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26, which is entitled \u201cReferral to another court without juvenile\u2019s consent,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-27, which is entitled \u201cReferral to other court at election of juvenile,\u201d set forth precise criteria which the Family Court is required to apply in determining whether to waive jurisdiction over a complaint against a juvenile. There is no indication that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44, which is entitled \u201cIncarceration\u2014Aggravating and mitigating factors,\u201d was intended to qualify the criteria for waiver set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26 and 27. Rather, the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44 is to provide criteria for determining whether a juvenile adjudicated delinquent by the Family Court should be incarcerated and, if so, the length of incarceration and the terms of release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The conclusion that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2) was not intended to preclude the waiver of charges against a \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d juvenile is reinforced by the preceding subsection, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(l), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">The following juveniles shall not be committed to a State correctional facility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADx\">(1) Juveniles age XI or under <em>unless adjudicated delinquent for the crime of arson or a crime which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime of the first or second degree. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Under this subsection, even very young children are subject to incarceration for serious crimes. Therefore, the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2) advanced on behalf of A.B. would have the anomalous consequence of subjecting very young juveniles to incarceration under circumstances in which older \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d juveniles would be exempt from incarceration. An interpretation of a statute which leads to such unreasonable results should be avoided. <em>See State v. Gill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>441, 444 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the Legislature intended that charges of a serious crime such as murder against any juvenile over the age of 14, including one who is \u201cdevelopmentally disabled,\u201d may be waived to the Law Division. However, a Family Court judge may consider the psychiatric condition of a juvenile, including any developmental problems, in determining whether waiver would be appropriate under the criteria set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">A.B. also argues that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to evidence that he could be rehabilitated by age 19. However, we conclude substantially for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the Family Court that there was no abuse of discretion in the waiver of this case to the Law Division. <em>See State v. Tuddles, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>565, 572 (1962); <em>State In Interest of B.T., </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 274 (App.Div.1976), certif. den. 73 <em>N.J. </em>49 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(3), waiver to the adult court system of serious criminal charges including murder is required if there is probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the crime and he was 14 years or older at the time, unless \u201cthe juvenile can show that the probability of his rehabilitation by the use of the procedures, services and facilities available to the court prior to the juvenile reaching the age of 19 substantially outweighs the reasons for waiver.\u201d <em>See State In Interest of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>S.M., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>675 (App.Div.1986). In this case, it is undisputed that there is probable cause to believe that A.B. committed the crime and that he was over 14 at the time. Furthermore, the trial judge concluded that A.B. had failed to show that there were reasonable prospects for his rehabilitation by age 19. This conclusion is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The trial judge also properly concluded that even if a reasonable probability of rehabilitation had been demonstrated, it would not outweigh the reasons for waiver. The dominant \u201creasons for waiver\u201d here are the crimes with which A.B. is charged\u2014which include murder and armed robbery\u2014and the strong public interest in \u201cgeneral and specific deterrence\u201d of these crimes. <em>State In Interest of S.M., supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 685. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(3) creates a presumption of waiver with respect to these crimes. Therefore, there was no need, as argued by A.B., for the State to show that the crimes with which he is charged were \u201ccommitted in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner\u201d or that \u201cgrave or serious harm was inflicted on the victim beyond that implicit in the offense itself\u201d in order for waiver to be appropriate. The cases relied upon by A.B. to support the argument, such as <em>State v. Martelli, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378 (App.Div.1985) and <em>State v. Link, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>615 (App.Div.1984), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>234 (1985), deal with a completely different subject, that is, presumptive sentences and parole ineligibility terms under the Code of Criminal Justice. These cases hold that a sentencing court may not treat factors which are inherent in a crime as aggravating factors to justify exceeding the presumptive term for the offense or imposing a parole ineligibility term. However, the waiver of cases from the juvenile to the adult court is controlled by different statutory provisions. The statutory \u201cpresumption\u201d when a juvenile 14 or older is charged with a serious crime is that the case will be waived to the adult criminal justice system. Therefore, it would be inconsistent with the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>2A:4A-26a(3) to impose a burden upon the State to show additional aggravating factors before charges of armed robbery and murder can be waived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">This does not mean that the circumstances of the crime or of the alleged juvenile offender are irrelevant to a waiver determination. Rather, if a juvenile can show a \u201cprobability of his rehabilitation\u201d prior to age 19, then the age of the offender, his prior record of delinquency, the circumstances of the crime and the role of the individual participant, all may be taken into account in determining whether to waive jurisdiction. However, the burden remains on the juvenile to show that \u201cthe probability of his rehabilitation ... substantially outweighs the reasons for waiver.\u201d <em>See State in Interest of C.A.H. &amp; B.A.R., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>326, 344-345 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In this case, the trial judge properly applied this statutory standard. He noted that the armed robbery had been carefully planned, the weapon had been tested, the juveniles had discussed killing the victim and the shooting had occurred without provocation by the victim. In addition, A.B. had previously damaged the victim\u2019s store during an attempted burglary for which he was sentenced to probation only two months before the murder. We concur fully with the trial court\u2019s observations concerning the seriousness of this crime and the inappropriateness under all the circumstances of declining waiver to the Law Division. <em>See State in Interest of C.A.H. &amp; B.A.R., supra; State in Interest of S.M., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the waiver order of the Chancery Division, Family Part, and remand the matter to the Law Division for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Separate opinions in the other three appeals are also being filed today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\">When the Code of Juvenile Justice was enacted in 1982 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a(l) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">\"Developmental disability\u201d means a disability of a person which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">(1) is attributable to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">(a) mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy or autism;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-16\">(b) any other condition found to be closely related to mental retardation because such condition results in impairment of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to impairment resulting from mental retardation or which requires treatment and services similar to those required for mental retardation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-17\">(c) dyslexia resulting from a disability described in subparagraphs (a) and (b);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">However, the full definition of \"developmentally disabled\u201d set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a also encompassed three additional paragraphs which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7h\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>(2) originates before such person attains age 18;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">(3) has continued or can be expected to continue indefinitely; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">(4) constitutes a substantial handicap to such person\u2019s ability to function normally in society;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">These three paragraphs were not incorporated by reference in the definition of \"developmentally disabled\" contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2). By enactment of chapter 145 of the Laws of 1985 the Legislature amended <em>NJ.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">a. \"Developmental disability\" means a severe, chronic disability of a person which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">(1) is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental or physical impairments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">(2) is manifest before age 22;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">(3) is likely to continue indefinitely;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">(4) results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity, that is, self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobility, self-direction and capacity for independent living or economic self-sufficiency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">(5) reflects the need for a combination and sequence of special inter-disciplinary or generic care, treatment or other services which are of life-long or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated. Developmental disability includes but is not limited to severe disabilities attributable to mental retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida and other neurological impairments where the above criteria are met;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Thus, a substantial part of the definition of \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d formerly contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a(l), and incorporated by reference in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2), was transferred to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a(5). The issue raised by this legislative history is whether the term \"developmentally disabled\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2) should now be construed to incorporate by reference <em>NJ.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a(l) as it read in 1982 or as it was amended in 1985. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>Ll-3.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">Any reference in any statute to any other statute, which is revised by a revision law, shall, after the effective date of such revision law, be construed to be a reference to the section or sections, if any, of the revision law corresponding in substance to, or superseding, the section or sections of the statute so revised and so referred to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-17\"><em>See In re Application of Saddle River, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>14, 28 (1976); <em>Capasso v. Pucillo, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, 476 (App.Div.1974). We read <em>N.J.S.A. </em>Ll-3.3 to indicate that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2) should be construed to incorporate by reference <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a as amended in 1985 rather than as it read in 1982. However, the part of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a \u201ccorresponding in substance to\u201d this statute as it read in 1982 is not limited to the current paragraph (1) but rather includes at least part of paragraph (5) and perhaps also part or all of paragraph (4). Since we conclude that A.B.\u2019s alleged \u201cdevelopmental disability\" would not in any event preclude the waiver of the charges against him to the Law Division, we have no occasion to definitively determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>current meaning of \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2). However, the problems which the 1985 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:6D-3a raise with respect to the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(c)(2) may be an appropriate subject for legislative attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">If the charges against a juvenile are referred from the Family Court to the Law Division, the dispositional provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44 are inapplicable.
