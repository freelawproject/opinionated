In challenging this determination of the trial court, appellants contend the alleged will is not a valid holographic will under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 as the deceased failed to sign the instrument and the document was never completed or pages had been omitted from the document as originally prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The facts giving rise to this proceeding are not in dispute. The decedent died on May 4, 1985, a resident of East Amwell Township, Hunterdon County. He was survived by two sisters, Ida Goldband and Pauline Bellen, and three children of a deceased brother, Marcia Neuhauser, Betty Siegel and Sol Siegel. Betty Siegel is totally incapacitated and confined to a nursing home under the guardianship of her brother. Because of his poor health, decedent had been residing with Marcia Neuhauser and being cared for by her for approximately nine months prior to his death. When decedent had been very ill and hospitalized he summoned Mrs. Neuhauser and informed her that he had written his own will in which he had provided that his estate be divided equally between his sisters, Ida and Pauline, his nephew Sol, and his niece, Marcia. Decedent was then aware of Betty\u2019s incompetency and her consequent confinement but he expressed no interest in including her, or any other person, as a beneficiary of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">When Mrs. Neuhauser was examining the contents of the East Amwell residence after Mr. Siegel\u2019s death, she found the purported will. It was written on the last page of a writing tablet which had been placed, together with the ownership certificate of decedent\u2019s automobile and family pictures, in between pages of an old book. The alleged will was a handwritten document consisting of a title sentence and three paragraphs. It is undisputed that the handwriting was that of the decedent. The title sentence included decedent\u2019s name and the first paragraph introduced the decedent and again reproduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>his name. This paragraph also stated his place of residence and declared the document to be his last will and testament. In the next paragraph, his executrix \u201chereinafter named\u201d was directed to pay his debts and funeral expenses. The last paragraph devised and bequeathed \u201call the rest and residue of my estate ... in equal shares, to my sisters, Ida London, Pauline Bellen, and my nephew Sol Siegel, my niece Marcia Neuhauser\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no punctuation mark at the end of this paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In September 1985 Mrs. Neuhauser filed the complaint herein for the probate of decedent\u2019s holographic will and appointment as Administratrix of the estate with the will annexed. Renunciations in favor of Mrs. Neuhauser had been executed by Ida Goldband and Pauline Bellen. Pursuant to an Order to Show Cause, the probate application was the subject of a hearing before the trial court. Children of Mrs. Goldband and Mrs. Bellen appeared and objected to the probate of the holographic will pending the family\u2019s discussion of the matter and decision as to a position. Following are pertinent portions of the colloguy which took place between the court and Seymour London, son of Ida Goldband, at this proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">THE COURT: Well, you know of no legal objections that you have at this point to the holographic will, I take it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">THE WITNESS: I have not\u2014I am not conversant with the laws of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">No, I have no objections at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">However, I would like to reserve whatever rights we may have to file any responsive pleadings in this respect if they become necessary, or seek counsel in this respect if it become necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">THE COURT: Well, how much time\u2014you indicate that you would like some time to discuss it among the various beneficiaries here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">THE COURT: Or heirs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>How much time are you going to need to determine\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">THE WITNESS: One week to ten days, Judge, at the very best. Just enough time to apprise my mother of the situation and indicate what\u2014what, if any action she would like to take.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">THE COURT: The Court will appoint Mrs. Neuhauser as the administratrix. But the final letters of administration will not be issued until December thirteenth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">We will set this matter down for December thirteenth, which is a Friday, at which time if you have\u2014want to be represented by counsel or have any objections, you can present them at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">THE WITNESS: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">THE COURT: I would assume that in the absence of anyone being here, any of the beneficiaries, that you have no specific objection other than that which you have already voiced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">THE WITNESS: That\u2019s what I was going to ask the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">If at all possible, if there are any objections, because it is an expensive proposition flying back and forth, that our objections be submitted in writing, if such be the case, I don\u2019t know, and have the Court just rule on them in writing. Unless the Court feels it necessary to take any testimony at a later time. THE COURT: Well, I would like to see what is in writing first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">THE WITNESS: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-15\">THE COURT: Then I would then determine whether or not any testimony would have to be taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-16\">THE WITNESS: Fine. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-17\">THE COURT: Certainly you may submit to the Surrogate, who will in turn submit to me, any writings that you want with respect to this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_\">THE WITNESS: Fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-18\">Neither Mrs. Goldband nor Mrs. Bellen, or anyone representing them, appeared on the continued date nor had any written objection to the probate been submitted by them or on their behalf. Accordingly, based upon the testimony previously offered, the court thereupon entered judgment admitting the will to probate and appointing Mrs. Neuhauser as Administratrix C.T.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-19\">On this appeal, the sisters of decedent claim that probate was improvidently granted as the purported will assertedly is not a properly executed holographic will. It is contended that, although the decedent wrote his name in the title and introducto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ry clauses of the document, there is no indication that the decedent intended that his name in either place act as his signature to the will. Rather, appellants state that the name of decedent in both of these places was to serve only for the purpose of description and form. Additionally, appellants argue that the incompleteness of the document admitted to probate demonstrates that its admission to probate was error. As a testator\u2019s intent can be discerned only from a consideration of his entire will, the probate of an instrument which allegedly on its face disclosed its incompleteness is not only inequitable to the interested parties but also unsafe, as the missing provisions may likely modify those which are discernible. In our view, these contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Preliminarily, we consider appellants standing to challenge the judgment of the trial court, an issue which has not been addressed by either of the parties. Our reading of the record indicates that neither Mrs. Goldband nor Mrs. Bellen, the persons whose interest in the estate was affected by the probate of the holographic will, appeared personally or through counsel in response to the Order to Show Cause. Furthermore, no objection was voiced by these interested parties on the continued date of the hearing, either personally or in writing, to the admission of the subject document to probate as the will of decedent. Thus, appellants effectively defaulted and by reason thereof have no standing to appeal from the judgment entered upon their default. <em>See Breidenbach v. Breidenbach, </em>130 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>214 (E. &amp; A. 1941); <em>Townsend v. Smith, </em>12 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>350 (E. &amp; A. 1858). The reason for this rule is obvious and needs no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">While this appeal might well be dismissed on this procedural lack of standing, we have considered the matter on its merits and concur with the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit the document to probate as the holographic will of the decedent. The pertinent statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>A will which does not comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2 is valid as a holographic will, whether or not witnessed, if the signature and material provisions are in the handwriting of the testator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Two requirements for a valid holographic will are established by the statute. First, the material provisions must be in the handwriting of the testator and secondly, the document must be signed by him. <em>Matter of Will of Marinus, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329, 343 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>332 (1985). As indicated, there is no dispute that the first requirement has been met. While the alleged will of decedent does not contain a signature at the end of the document, the writing of his name in the title and introductory paragraphs of the instrument may be accepted as his signature if intended as such by the testator. <em>See In re Estate of Cunningham, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 489 (Law Div.1984); <em>In re Phelan Estate, </em>82 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>316, 319 (Prerog.Ct.1913), aff'd o.b. 82 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>647 (E. &amp; A. 1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In construing a testamentary instrument, reliance is to be placed not only on the terms of the purported will but also on other relevant circumstances including the testator\u2019s own expressions of intent. <em>Engle v. Siegel, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>287, 291 (1977). Circumstances subsequent to the execution of the purported will likewise are relevant to the matter of the testator\u2019s intent. <em>See In re Cook, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6 (1965). Application of these principles to the present situation compels the conclusion, in our view, that there is sufficient evidentiary basis for a finding that the testator\u2019s writing of his name in the prefatory paragraphs of the will was intended as his signature. The document itself expressed a testamentary intent in fully disposing of the testator\u2019s property. Such intent, as garnered from the contents of the document, was corroborated by testimony of Mrs. Neuhauser as to the declarations of the testator that he had written his will and the disposition of his estate which he had made therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Further, we are unpersuaded by appellants\u2019 challenge to the probate of the offered will on the ground that the document is incomplete and therefore does not reflect the complete testamentary intent of the testator. This contention overlooks or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>misconstrues the plain meaning of that which was written by the testator. In devising and bequeathing \u201call the rest and residue of my estate\u201d to named beneficiaries, the testator clearly expressed his intent to thus completely dispose of his property. Appellant\u2019s suggestion that a continuation of the will might have conditioned this complete disposition upon a trust or other contingency is pure speculation having no basis in fact or reason. Although the document fails to include a paragraph naming an executrix, or provisions setting forth the powers of a fiduciary or other \u201cboiler plate\u201d language, this absence does not impact upon the testamentary disposition and thus does not require that probate be denied. <em>See In re Will of Smith, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356 (App.Div.1986); <em>In Matter of the Will of Cohen, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538 (App.Div.1985); <em>Estate of Hall, </em>118 Misc.2d 1052, 462 N.Y.S.2d 154 (Sur.Ct.1983). An instrument, although unfinished, is of testamentary character if it expresses the whole will of the testator as far as it goes. <em>See </em>94 <em>C.J.S. Wills </em>\u00a7 159 at 949-950 (1956). Clearly, the writing offered as the last will and testament of Mr. Siegel, although incomplete in some respects, embodied his testamentary intention and was properly admitted to probate as his holographic will.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The judgment dated January 15, 1986 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-14\">lda Goldband, a sister of decedent had been known as Ida London until approximately January 1980 or 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
