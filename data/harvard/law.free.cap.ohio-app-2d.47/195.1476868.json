That appeal was dismissed sua sponte by this court because the order appealed from was not a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"AAT\">We can agree with the defendant (appellant) that the jurisdiction in this case rested with this court on April 17,</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">1972, and the trial court could not lawfully make any judgment on that date. The trial court could, however, do what it did on August 1, 1972, which was to make the referee\u2019s finding the judgment of the court as of that date, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>even if that judgment was based on the same referee\u2019s findings made on March 22,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">This appeal is, therefore, an appeal again on temporary orders of the court entered August 1, 1972, and they are-not <em>final appealable </em>orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">It is further to be noted that there has not been any transcript of proceedings filed herein so that this court could not review the trial court\u2019s order, even if it were reviewable upon appeal. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed and the case remanded to the trial court for further proceedings therein, according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b214-7\">Victor, P.
