Eossman, appeals part of a Domestic Eelations Court judgment in her divorce action against defendant-appellee, Joseph A. Eossman. On January 24,1974 the plaintiff filed a divorce action against the defendant. The plaintiff predicated her action on gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty. She requested the court to grant her custody of the parties \u2019 pre-school infant and award her child support. The plaintiff also requested an award of alimony and division of the marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">The plaintiff encountered difficulty in implementing discovery concerning the defendant\u2019s earning capacity. On February 21, 1974 she served interrogatories upon the defendant. The defendant persistently declined to respond to the interrogatories. On May 3, 1974, pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, the trial court ordered the defendant to answer the interrogatories. The interrogatories were, ansswered by the defendant on May 15, 1974. However, many of the answers to questions dealing with the defendant\u2019s earning capacity were perfunctory or inaccurate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>quently the plaintiff took depositions of the defendant and his father, Leo Rossman. In reliance upon defense counsel\u2019s instructions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant and his father refused to answer several questions pertaining to the defendant\u2019s earning capacity. On July 15, 1974 the plaintiff moved the court to reconvene the deposition and order the defendant and.Leo Rossman to respond to the unanswered questions. On July 23, 1974 a domestic relations referee conducted a hearing on the issue raised by the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Pursuant to the referee\u2019s recommendation, the trial judge ordered the reconvening of the defendant\u2019s and Leo Ross-man\u2019s depositions. The judge\u2019s order instructed the defendant and Leo Rossman to respond to the unanswered questions at the reconvened deposition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>On August 12,1974, prior to the reconvening of the deposition, the trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>consolidated all pretrial discovery proceedings into trial. The judge informed, the parties of his consolidation decision by letter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 15, 1974 plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to the trial judge objecting to the court\u2019s consolidation order. The plaintiff stressed that the consolidation order improperly terminated discovery before the plaintiff obtained complete depositions from the defendant and Leo Rossman. Counsel noted that the consolidation order precluded the plaintiff from benefiting from the judge\u2019s order reconvening the defendant\u2019s depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">On August 13,1974, one day after the trial judge\u2019s consolidation letter, the defendant moved the court for a protective order pursuant to Civ. R. 26(C). The trial court never explicitly ruled on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The trial commenced on September 30, 1974. At this time plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Mr. Greene, once again objected to the trial court\u2019s premature termination of the plaintiff\u2019s discovery effort</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Mr. Greene: If the Court please, I would like to make one statement before commencing the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u201cWe would like to reinforce our objections that we have made prior to this, to the court by letter, I believe, for the court\u2019s refusal to permit us to conclude the depositions which the referee had previously ordered be concluded, and for another respect, not enforcing its own rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u201cNow, if the court please\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>The Court: May I make a comment on the reason why the Court has not proceeded with the objections; because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>there was a multiplicity of motions and also passing back and forth, and the Court thought, with the interest of proceeding with this case to a conclusion, it would be better if I held everything in abeyance, and hopefully, in open Court, have all of the objections brought to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u201cMr. Greene: May I just say this \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to belabor it, but, for instance, as an example, we were not furnished with the defendant\u2019s personal expenses until long after the deposition was concluded, and we had intended to go into detail to ask him questions, and we were never afforded that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The Court: The reason I brought it out in open court, is to give whoever is the aggrieved party the opportunity to cross-examine in open court, and, if necessary, subpoena duces tecum, or whatever is necessary to protect the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The fundamental issue at the trial was the husband\u2019s earning capacity. The defendant husband testified that he was the owner of a gas station corporation which he operated since 1972. Prior to operating the station the defendant was employed as a school teacher. He testified that his 1973 earnings from the business were $36,000. He also testified that his annual personal expenses were $19,623.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Sheldon Berkman, a certified public accountant, testified on behalf of the plaintiff. Based on his examination of some of the corporation\u2019s records Mr. Berkman testified that the defendant\u2019s total income for 1973 equaled $36,642. Berkman concluded that Rossman\u2019s projected 1974 income equaled $74,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Thomas Kuchta, a business consultant specializing in gas station management, testified. Kuchta worked with the defendant\u2019s business on a daily basis. Kuchta testified that the defendant\u2019s 1973 income was $36,000. The witness stated that in 1974 the defendant would receive a salary of $26,000 plus a $10,000 bonus which was paid in the month prior to trial. Kuchta testified that the corporation\u2019s projected profit for 1974 was $19,600. Kuchta also testified extensively regarding the market factors that contributed to the defendant\u2019s past income, as well as those factors that could cause severe fluctuations in future income. After the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the judge determined that the defendant\u2019s approximate annual earnings were $19,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On November 15,1974 the judge issued his judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The court granted the divorce and awarded Marcia custody of the parties \u2019 child. The court ordered the defendant to convey his interest in the iparital home to the plaintiff. The wife was awarded $100 per. week; alimony for three years and $30 per week child support until the child attains majority. The husband was awarded all of the stock in the gas station corporation. \u25a0 .</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The plaintiff does not appeal the trial court\u2019s divorce and child custody determinations. The wife appeals the alimony and child support awards, as well as the trial court\u2019s division of the marital property. The wife\u2019s appeal assigns two errors, one of which contains merit. .</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\n<em>Assignment of Error I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\n<em>\u201cThe trial court committed error prejudicial to the plaintiff in requiring plaintiff to commence the trial toitJiout completing discovery.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Modern discovery procedures are designed to make civil trials \u201cless a game of blind man\u2019s bluff and more .a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed.to the fullest practicable extent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(1958), 356 U. S. 677, 682; <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1947), 329 U. S. 495, 501. In <em>IIlavin </em>v. <em>Plechaty </em>(1971), 28 Ohio App. 2d 43 this court stated the policy underlying the discovery provisions of the Ohio Civil Rules.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\u201cThe Rules of Civil Procedure contain broad provisions for discovery. Under Rule 26, discovery may be had of any matter, not privileged, -which is relevant, to,-the subT ject matter of the pending action. In doing so the rules ex! emplify <em>a policy of affording attorneys every opportunity and advantage in preparing their cose before trial.\u201d Hlavin, supra, </em>at 45 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>In the trial below the defendant\u2019s willful failure to comply with the discovery rules was followed by the trial judge\u2019s refusal to enforce his own order compelling discovery. This combination of events denied the plaintiff the pretrial opportunity to fully prepare her arguments on the fundamental issue of the defendant\u2019s earning capacity. The defendant\u2019s earning capacity was the fundamental issue at trial because a husband\u2019s ability to generate income is crucial in accurately assessing alimony and child support, as well as intelligently dividing marital property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Joseph Rossman\u2019s earning capacity was a complex issue. Rossman\u2019s income and net worth were obscured by the interrelation of his personal finances with the present and future financial status of his gas station corporation. The transcending importance and the complexity of the defendant\u2019s earning capacity justified the plaintiff\u2019s desire to obtain depositions detailing Ross-man\u2019s financial posture. The plaintiff\u2019s proper pretrial desire to elucidate the crucial, complex issue of the defendant\u2019s earning capacity placed a heavy burden on the trial court to insure that the plaintiff\u2019s depositions were fully answered. The court\u2019s duty to insure compliance with the pretrial deposition rules was intensified by the defendant\u2019s dilatory and erroneous answers to the financial questions propounded in the plaintiff\u2019s earlier interrogatories.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In spite of this duty the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>deprived the appellant of the opportunity to fully prepare herself to litigate the issue of the defendant\u2019s capacity to \u25a0pay alimony and child support. The court\u2019s only justification for terminating the plaintiff\u2019s deposition effort was to expedite the conclusion of the case. The court labored under the mistaken belief that cross-examination at trial served the same purpose as a pretrial deposition. When a complex fundamental issue is the object of civil discovery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>expediency alone is not a sufficient ground for a, judge to <em>sua sponte </em>terminate discovery. Furthermore, cross examination at trial is not an adequate substitute for pretrial discovery. The purpose of discovery is to aid a party <em>in Ms preparation of the case prior to trial. </em>The opportunity for such preparation is designed to facilitate an orderly and cogent presentation by both parties in front of the trier of fact. <em>Hlavin, supra </em>at 45. Cross-examination before the trier of fact is only meaningful when the cross-examiner has an adequate opportunity to prepare his questions.prior to trial. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The appellee advances several reasons in support of the trial court\u2019s consolidation order. The appellee asserts that the plaintiff never specified the facts which he hoped; to ascertain from the deposition that was terminated by the trial judge\u2019s consolidation. However a party seeking, pretrial discovery is not required to specify the facts he expects to undercover by a pretrial deposition. The Ohio-Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cpretrial depositions are in many instances fishing expeditions.\u201d <em>Ex Parte Oliver </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 125; <em>Staff Notes </em>Civ. R. 26 (B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The appellee asserts that the judge\u2019s pretrial consolidation order is actually a ruling in favor of their qwn pretrial motion for a protective order pursuant to Civ. R. 26 (C). The judge consolidated all discovery proceedings into trial a full day before the appellee filed his motion for a protective order. Therefore the judge terminated discovery without regard to the appellee\u2019s motion for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The appellee argues that the judge\u2019s consolidation order is justifiable exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretionary authority to regulate, the length of time in which discovery must be completed. A trial judge retains broad discretionary authority over the length of the pretrial discovery phase of litigation. This discretion permits the judge to insure that trial is not unduly postponed. However, such discretion is not limitless. The appellee\u2019s failure to comply with the plaintiff\u2019s previous good faith attempts to obtain crucial discoverable information caused the delay in completion of pretrial discovery. Therefore the judge\u2019s consol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>idation order rewards the appellee\u2019s dilatory non-compliance with the discovery rules. A <em>sua sponte </em>exercise of judicial discretion that rewards a party\u2019s willful obstruction of his opponent\u2019s good faith discovery efforts is suspect. Such an exercise of judicial discretion must be justified by a weightier interest than expediency.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The policy favoring the fullest opportunity to complete discovery is the same in the Ohio and Federal courts. Therefore we adopt the standard employed by Federal appellate courts in reviewing a trial judge\u2019s discretionary decision to terminate discovery. An appellate court will reverse the decision of a trial court that extinguishes<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a party\u2019s right to discovery if the trial court\u2019s decision is improvident and affects the discovering party\u2019s substantial rights. See <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>(7th Cir., 1963), 325 F. 2d 853, 856; <em>Roebling </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(D. C. Cir., 1958), 257 F. 2d 615, 619 (Dismissal reversed and case remanded because trial court \u201cimprovidently\u201d failed to compel discovery.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The discovery question presented in <em>Goldman, supra </em>is similar to the question before this court. In' <em>Goldman </em>the plaintiff filed an action against a taxi company alleging that he was injured in an automobile accident involving the defendant\u2019s taxi cab driven by the defendant\u2019s employee. The defendant denied that the accident occurred.- The plaintiff, relying on Fed. R. Civ. P. 34, moved the court to compel the defendant to produce several business records which the plaintiff claimed supported his complaint. The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion with r\u00e9spect to most of the- requested documents. The defendant produced none</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The failure to enforce discovery in both <em>Goldman </em>and Rossman substantially prejudiced the respective plaintiffs \u2019 trial presentation of the issue that was fundamental in each case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Goldman </em>the fundamental issue involved whether the accident occurred. In Rossman\u2019s case the fundamental issue involved the accurate determination of the husband\u2019s present and future earning capacity. The record indicates that the trial judge was confused by the presentation of this question at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The trial judge\u2019s confusion is reflected by his finding that the appellee\u2019s approximate income was $19,000. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>trial judge reached this finding in spite of the appellee\u2019s admission that his 1973 income was $36,000 and Kuchta\u2019s testimony that Rossman\u2019s 1974 income would be $36,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The similarities between <em>Goldman </em>and Mrs. Rossman\u2019s appeal compel an identical result in both cases. Appellee Joseph Rossman failed to answer questions relating to the fundamental issue of his earning capacity propounded at a deposition. The defendant\u2019s silence violated Civ. R. 30 (C). The court ordered the defendant to comply with Rule 30(C). Without enforcing compliance with its order, the trial court compelled the litigants to launch into trial over the objection of Mrs. Rossman, the discovering party. The trial court\u2019s discovery order improvidently extinguished Mrs. Rossman\u2019s substantial rights. The plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of error is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Assignment of Error II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>\u201cThe judgment of the trial court is erroneous since it is based upon findings of fact that are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">This assignment of error is moot because of our resolution of the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Those portions of the trial court\u2019s judgment that were incorporated into the plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal are reversed. The cause is remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the issues contained in the notice of appeal. The trial court is instructed not to proceed with trial until the depositions of the defendant and Leo Rossman are reconvened. At the reconvened deposition the defendant and Leo Rossman are ordered to answer the questions that they were instructed to answer by the trial court. The defendant and Leo Rossman are further ordered to fully comply with Civ. R. 30(C). Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-10\">Jackson, P. J., and Corrigan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Tor example the defendant\u2019s interrogatory answers state that his 1973 income was $21,000, whereas the defendant testified at trial that his 1973 income was $36,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-4\">It is improper for counsel to instruct a deposed party not to answer a question propounded at a civil deposition. Civ. R. 30 (C) states, \u201cAll objections made at the time of the [deposition] to . . . the evidence presented, or the conduct of any party . . . shall be noted by the officer \u00a1[taking] the deposition. <em>Evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objections\u201d </em>(emphasis added). See also Civ. R. 26(B)(1). When a party objects to questions asked at a deposition his proper remedy is stated in Civ. R. 32(B), 32(D) (3) and 30(D). Under <em>Ex Parte Oliver </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 125, syl. 1, \u201cA witness who is not a party to a legal proceeding has no right, upon the taking of his deposition in such proceeding, to refuse to answer any question upon the advise of his counsel merely because such counsel believes that the testimony sought is irrelevant, incompetent or immaterial.\u201d Therefore it was improper for defense counsel to instruct Leo Rossman not to answer certain questions at the deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The court ordered the defendant and Leo Rossman to answer several unanswered questions regarding the defendant\u2019s earning capacity. Some of the questions that the court ordered the defendant to answer were:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201cDo you have copies of any and all financial statements prepared including, but not limited to, copies of financial statements given to banks, savings and loan companies and financial companies?\u201d Deposition page 2, line 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u201cIs there any reason to believe that the [financial] situation will foe different in 1974?\u201d Deposition page 4, line 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201cAny other sources of income?\u201d Deposition page 5, line 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u201cDid you ever admit to anyone that you had ways of getting money out of the business without paying taxes on it?\u201d Deposition page 11, line 20.</p>\n<p id=\"AJL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>One of the questions that Leo Rossman was ordered to answer was,</p>\n<p id=\"Ayy\">\u201cLeo, of your own knowledge, do you know where Joe got the money to start the business?\u201d Deposition page 7. line 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b123-12\">The trial judge\u2019s letter stated,</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">\u201cI have reviewed the pleadings in the above captioned matter.

See plaintiff\u2019s letter to the court dated August 15, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The appellee relies upon <em>State, ex rel Raydel, </em>v. <em>Raible </em>(1952), 92 Qhio App. 537 for the proposition that a trial judge has broad discretion to regulate the time and place of discovery. We agree with this principle. However, <em>Raydel </em>is not controlling in this case.- In <em>Raydel </em>the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in postponing the taking of a- deposition. The <em>Raydel </em>court expressly conditioned its holding on the fa.ct that the trial judge \u201cdid not deny the ri^'ht to take depositions.\u201d <em>Raydel. </em>at 544. In Rossman\u2019s case the trial judge\u2019s premature termination of. discovery denied the plaintiff the right to conclude her depositions prior to trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of the documents. The defendant merely answered the plaintiff\u2019s requests with its own interpretation of the documents as if responding to interrogatories. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment for the defendant as improvidently prejudicial to the plaintiff\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Goldman </em>at 856. The court stressed that the discoverable records in the defendant\u2019s custody dealt with the \u201cfundamental issue\u201d in the case of whether an accident occurred. The court also stressed the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery order. <em>Goldmm </em>is similar to the Rossman case because the defendants in both cases willfully failed to observe the discovery rules. Furthermore, in both cases the trial judge indulged the defendant\u2019s violation of the discovery rules by permitting the ease to be tried without compelling the dilatory party to comply with a judicial discovery order. The judicial conduct in Rossman\u2019s ease is worse than in <em>Goldman </em>because the judge below affirmatively, on his motion, and for no better reason than expediency, prematurely terminated the appellant\u2019s discovery rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The appellee argues that the appellant was not prejudiced because the appellee\u2019s attorney answered each question which the trial court\u2019s order instructed the defendant and Leo ttossman to answer at the reconvened deposition. Defense counsel answered each question in a letter addressed to plaintiff\u2019s counsel dated August 2, 1974. Defense counsel\u2019s letter was an inadequate substitute for a deposed response where inquiring counsel could follow each answer with a related question. Furthermore, the defendant testified that he did not remember authorizing the letter sent by his counsel to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
