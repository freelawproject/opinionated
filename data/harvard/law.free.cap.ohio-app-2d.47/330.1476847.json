C. 2903.02, providing that \u201cNo person shall purposely cause the death of another.\u201d He appeals assigning error in three particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">First Assignment of Error. \u201cThat the verdict and judgment of the court are not sustained by sufficient evidence and are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Second Assignment of Error. \u201cThat the verdict and judgment of the court are contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">These assignments of error will be considered together because, as argued, they involve the same evidence and application of the same principles of law, the argument basically being that the evidence did not show that the defendant <em>purposely </em>caused the death of one Henry Terminelli, hereinafter referred to as Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Henry was the three year old male child of one Donita Terminelli, twenty two years of age, hereinafter referred to as Donita. Donita, with Henry and his younger brother, had taken up residence with the defendant in his home in Fostoria, Ohio. The defendant, who is 25 years of age, had broken his shoulder blade and received other injuries in a moioreyclc accident on about July 28, 1974, and had either resigned or otherwise terminated his employment. While Donita was engaged in her employment the defendant \u201cbaby sat\u201d with the two children and saw to their needs. On September 4, 19.74, the day of the principal events herein, Donita left for work at about 3 p. m. leaving the children in tlie defendant\u2019s care. She returned at about 12:30 a. m. on September 5th and was met at the door by the defendant who told her that he had had to correct Henry for \u201cmessing his pants.\u201d Donita and the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>fendant then watched a television show to its conclusion before ascending to the second floor where they checked Henry in his bed and noticed that something was wrong with him. The defendant told Donita to leave the room and when he had ascertained that Henry was not breathing told her to go to the neighbors to summon an ambulance. The defendant began administering artificial respiration and continued to do so while Donita drove him and Henry.to the hospital after she was unsuccessful in her efforts to rouse the neighbors. Upon arrival at the hospital Henry was taken immediately to the emergency room where two nurses, two doctors and a policeman worked for at least an hour trying to revive him, giving up at about 3 a. m. All of these persons observed multiple bruises and abrasions on Henry\u2019s body. At about 11 a. m. on September 5th a pathologist conducted an autopsy and observed the same bruises as well as a large bruise on the.left side of Henry\u2019s head. He determined that death resulted from compression of the brain caused by a subdural hematoma which, in turn was caused by a broadly placed zone of bruising or trauma consistent with banging ones head against a sink or tub.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The defendant made a written statement at 4 a. m. on September 5th that Henry had fallen down a stairway (a fabrication which he and the mother testified they had agreed to on the way to the hospital). He made another written' statement at 12:30 p. m. on September 5th, which acknowledged no responsibility and gave no explanation of any sort relating to the cause of death. At -3:41 p. m. on September 6, 1974,' defendant made a final written state-, ment reading in its entirety: \u2022\u2022 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u25a0 \u201cI,..James A. Williams on the night of Sept. 4. took care of the child Henery. At about 10.00 p. m. I told Henery to get his cloth\u2019s off to take a bath. But before he was. to take a bath he had to go up stairs and get the under pants, that he had messed earlier in the- evening while taking a nap. When he returned with the pants my first reaction was to hit him on the biitt, but when I did he lot his balance and fell against the sink. Then he precieded to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>his'bath. I-then returned latter and took him out of the tub and helped him dry off. Then on the way to the bed I struck him in various places of his back side about every fourth or fifth step. Then upon entering the bedroom I grabbed him by: the arm and started shaking him and asking him why he shit the bed. I also gave him a bad spanking with about eight hits on the rear section. At the time I put him to bed he seemed to be breathing with a little difaculity so I put some viles on him.\u201d (Misspellings are as in the statement.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Defendant\u2019s oral testimony as to the critical events was substantially the same as his last written statement. D\u00f3nita was called as a prosecution witness and testified that when defendant met her at the door on her return from work he told her that he had punished Henry \u201cnot like he did before\u201d; that he had punished Henry in her presence on other occasions and had left bruises on him; that when she looked in on Henry she saw that his lips and gums were all blue; that she asked the defendant what he had done and \u201che said he back handed him in the mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Photographs were taken and submitted in evidence both immediately after the fact of death had been determined and within a few hours after the autopsy. These photographs depicted in visual form the appearance and location of the bruises on the child although the \u201cbroad zone of rather bright red hemmorrhage\u201d testified to by the pathr ologist as \u2018 \u2018 overlying almost the upper half of the skull on the left\u201d was obscured by the child\u2019s dark hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">There was thus no admission by the defendant that he \u201cpurposely caused the death of another\u201d and no direct evidence of such purpose. Such purpose, if it existed,- had to be derived from circumstantial evidence. It was also apparent from the medical testimony that each single blow which Henry had received on his head and body, as evidenced by the bruises and abrasions thereon and oth\u00e9r \u25a0than the blunt blow to the left side of his head which caused the subdural hematoma, either in and of itself or. when considered together with other blows apparently received concurrently, would not have been sufficient to cause Hen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ry's death; In the absence of direct evidence of purpose such blows would not, therefore, have been sufficient to prove that the defendant purposely killed the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Wo-come then to a consideration of the blunt blow to the left side of the head. There was no direct evidence that such a blow had occurred other than the defendant\u2019s written statement and oral testimony that Henry had hit his head on the bathroom sink. However, independently of such. evidence the jury could properly infer from the fact of the subdural hematoma and the fact of the exterior bruise dr hemorrhage on the left side of Henry\u2019s head that, in fact,' ho had received a blunt .blow to the left side of his head from some source.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">If the jury should conclude that the child had hit his head on the sink not . as the result of the design or purpose of the defendant then the jury could not infer that the defendant had purposely caused the death of the child. Bas\u2022ed on defendant\u2019s testimony and without considering the weight- or credibility to be given theret\u00ae such hypothesis would be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">On the other hand, if the jury should conclude that -the blunt blow to- the left sid^ <em>o\u00ed </em>Henry\u2019s head was from the defendant\u2019s fist or from some object wielded by the defendant, defendant\u2019s culpability would be apparent in that the law presumes that a man intends results which are the natural, reasonable and probable consequence of his voluntary acts. Based on the existence .of bruises of varying age on Henry\u2019s body evidencing a course of conduct, the physical custody of Henry by the defendant at times consistent with his responsibility for such conduct, \u25a0the' testimony of Henry\u2019s mother both as' to defendant\u2019s disciplining Henry and as to his previously leaving marks from such disciplining, based on the defendant\u2019s written statement and oral testimony as- to his -punishment, of Henry on the day and evening in question, but without r\u00e9gai-d- to . the weight or credibility to be given to such evidence,, a reasonable hypothesis of defendant\u2019s guilt would exist* -as reasonable as would be the hypothesis of his . innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulig, </em>37 Ohio St. 2d 157, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Court in reversing a conviction held that \u201c [cjircumstantial evidence relied upon to prove an essential element of a crime must be irreconcilable with any <em>reasonable </em>theory of an accused\u2019s innocence in order to support a finding of guilt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Urbaytis, </em>156 Ohio St. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>165 Ohio St. 293, in affirming a conviction, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u201c6. Where circumstantial evidence alone is relied upon in the proof of any element of a crime, and <em>a jury finds </em>that there is a <em>reasonable </em>hypothesis of innocence, <em>after considering all the evidence, </em>it is its duty to acquit; however, where the jury finds, after full deliberation, that there is no <em>reasonable </em>hypothesis of innocence <em>based on the facts as it finds them to be, </em>and the facts which it finds are irreconcilable with any <em>reasonable </em>hypothesis other than guilt, it is its duty to convict.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Creech, </em>5 Ohio App. 2d 179, this court followed the rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sheppard </em>and reduced a conviction of second degree murder to one of first degree manslaughter. That, however, was a case where the hypothesis of innocence was reasonable but, if it were so concluded, it could not at the same time be concluded on available evidence that the hypothesis of guilt was equally reasonable. In other words, there did not and could not exist on the evidence at one and the same time two equally reasonable but opposed hypotheses.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">That situation dues not exist here because, without considering the weight or the credibility to be given to the evidence, this case presents a situation where the defenddant\u2019s testimony would supply a reasonable hypothesis of innocence whereas other evidence supplies - a reasonable hypothesis of guilt and in view of the differences \u25a0 in evidence one hypothesis does not operate to exclude the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">At first blush the rule of exclusion expressed in the <em>Kulig </em>case, <em>supra, </em>that circumstantial evidence relied upon to prove an essential element of a crime must be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of an accused\u2019s innocence in order to support a finding of guilt would seem to require, a determination of reasonableness in the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>straet, <em>i. e., </em>is the' hypothesis reasonable assuming . that the facts on which it is based are true?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">;\u2022 The Ohio Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on this point but does in its expression of the rule in the <em>Sheppard </em>case imply that the determination of reasonableness includes a determination of whether the hypothesis is reasonable in view of the weight and credibility that the jury gives to the evidence. Thus, in the <em>Sheppard </em>syllabus, the phrases \u201ca jury finds,\u201d \u201cafter considering all the evidence,\u201d and \u201cbased on facts as it finds them to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States recognizes this prerogative of the jury in the case of <em>Holland </em>v. <em>United States, </em>75 S. Ct. 127, 137, where it says:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence in this respect is intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence. Admittedly, circumstantial evidence may in some cases point to a wholly incorrect result. Yet this is equally true of testimonial evidence. In both instances a jury is asked to weigh the chances that the evidence correctly points to guilt \u2022 against the possibility of inaccuracy or ambiguous inference. In both, the jury must use its experience with people and events in weighing the probabilities. If the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, we can require no more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZE\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>29 Ill. 2d 315, 194 N. E. 2d 230, the Supreme Court of Illinois said and held at page 232 of the last reference:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u201cA conviction may be based upon circumstantial evidence, and this court has held that the manner of death and the means by which it was inflicted may be inferred from the circumstances proved. <em>* * * </em>The fact that the circumstantial evidence relied upon must not give rise to any reasonable hypotheses under which the defendant could be innocent of the crime charged, * * # does not mean that the trier of fact is \u2018required to search out a series of potential explanations compatible with innocence, and elevate them to the status of a reasonable doubt\u2019. * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>17 Ill. 2d 328, 161 N. E. 2d 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">More specifically to the point, however, are the ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>servations of Judge Hunter of the Supreme Court of Indiana in the case of <em>Manlove </em>v. <em>State, </em>232 N. E. 2d 874, 878:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">'\u2022\u201cThe rule governing juries and trial courts in the trial of criminal cases is that where the evidence necessary for a conviction is wholly circumstantial in character it must be of such conclusive and persuasive force that it tends to point surely and unerringly to the guilt of the accused to an extent that it excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u201cHowever, it should also be stated that where there are two <em>reasonable inferences </em>arising from the circumstantial evidence in a case, one of <em>guilt </em>and <em>another of innocence, </em>it is not the duty or right of this Court to reverse simply because <em>ice </em>might believe the circumstances to not exclude every reasonable hypothesis, of innocence. It is the jury\u2019s function, not ours, to <em>weigh conflicting evidence </em>or uncontradicted evidence from which <em>conflicting, yet reasonable, </em>inferences may be drawn and then determine whether such evidence excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">See also 24A. Corpus \u00abJuris Secundum 827, Criminal Law, Section. 1882, and 23 Corpus Juris Secundum 561, 575, Criminal Law, Sections 907c and 907e.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We conclude that even with respect' to conflicting and coexistent hypotheses that are reasonable in the abstract a jury must consider all of the evidence in the case and apply its own determinations of weight and credibility to determine whether the hypothesis \u25a0 of guilt excludes that of innocence. If its determination is in the affirmative it may convict, but in the negative, it must acquit.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Accordingly, we also conclude in-- application to the instant case that since there, was substantial evidence \u00f3f probative value which, if believed, would support a determination of both a reasonable hypothesis of guilt and a reasonable hypothesis of innocence we'cannot substitute our judgment for that of the jury when-in consideration' of all th\u00e9 evidence iu the ease and applying their own determination of weight and credibility they arrived at a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Under the second assignment of error the appellant also claims that purpose to cause death may not be derived from the use of defendant\u2019s hands alone because they are not normally considered weapons likely to produce death. That is not necessarily the state of the law and is definitely not the state of the law with respect to the facts here involved. The defendant was twenty five years of age and Henry, the victim, was but three years of age. As stated in Judge Cole\u2019s opinion in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Cummins </em>in this court, Logan County Case No. 1098, decided April 14, 1972 (unreported):</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u201c * * * Such a child is delicate and easily subject to injury from a blow which might not seriously affect an adult. It may be inferred that a blow of the hand or fist could produce severe injury to such an infant. The differences in sizes and weight would permit an inference that a heavy blow could have disastrous consequences and the jury would, therefore, be justified in finding he, by acting, intended those disastrous and ultimately fatal consequences. <em>* * * </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We find, therefore, that the first and second assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Third Assignment of Error. \u201cThe court below erred in admitting, over defendant\u2019s objection, inflammatory and prejudicial exhibits offered by the state of Ohio relating to pictures of the deceased taken after an autopsy had been performed. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">This assignment pertains to eleven colored photographic slides, admitted into evidence and displayed to the jury, which the appellant claims were calculated to inflame the jury by showing \u201cgruesome incisions to the trunk area of the body and showing the sutures made by the pathologist after the autopsy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">It is a fact that the photographs did show extensive sutured incisions made by the pathologist but it appears from both the photographs and from the balance of the record that these photographs depicted bruises and abrasions which were not depicted by the photographs taken immediately after the abandonment of the life saving efforts taken in the hospital emergency room. There was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u00bftherefore,- a relevancy to such evidence which could not be \u2022supplied by other evidence and the. jury was fully apprised by the testimony that an autopsy had taken place before the photographs were taken. The trial court concluded (Record, p. 60):</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">\u201cWell, I feel as though, which in an enlightened day .and age, the jury recognizes that there must be something like this in so far as performing an autopsy so long as they .are not repetitions and they do show what they purport to \u00a1show. For that reason, I\u2019m going to allow the exhibits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We feel, as did the trial court, that it was apparent \u25a0the incisions and sutures were made during the autopsy .and were not the immediate result of any activity on the defendant\u2019s part. Jurors must be given credit for a reasonable amount of intelligence and an ability to discriminate between what is pertinent to an issue and what is not. In our opinion the admission into evidence and display of these photographs to the members of the jury was neither error nor was it prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Having found no error in the three particulars assigned and argued it is our judgment that the judgment of the trial court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-7\">Cole, P.
