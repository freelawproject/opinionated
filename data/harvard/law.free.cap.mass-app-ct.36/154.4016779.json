The unsevered and unsanitized photographs were admitted in evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial on an indictment charging him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>with armed robbery. On appeal, the defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the mug shots indicated to the jury that he had a prior criminal record. Concluding that the jury reasonably could have inferred from the photograph that the defendant had been involved in prior misconduct and that the limiting instruction to the jury was not adequate to cure the error, which could have influenced their verdict, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">1. <em>The robbery. </em>There was evidence to show that at about 1:00 a.m., on February 29, 1988, the assistant manager of the restaurant, Johnny Cheung, was in his car about to leave work for the night when he was accosted by four men, at least one of whom was Asian and had a gun. That man ordered Cheung out of the car and forced him, by holding the gun to his back, to return to the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Michael Benjamin, the restaurant security officer, was sitting in the lobby when Cheung and the robbers entered. The robber holding the gun to Cheung\u2019s back, subsequently identified as the defendant, came from behind Cheung, went directly to Benjamin, and put a .45 caliber handgun to his forehead between his eyebrows. He warned Benjamin not to move or \u201che\u2019d blow . . . [his] brains out.\u201d In the space of about three to five seconds, the defendant marched Benjamin to the rear of the restaurant where he removed Benjamin\u2019s revolver. The defendant next ordered Benjamin, the gun still to his back, to the kitchen where his hands were cuffed and his eyes taped. Cheung and the night manager, Ivan Ngan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were also forced to the kitchen, handcuffed and blindfolded with tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">When Benjamin no longer heard voices or sounds of activity, he worked to free himself of his handcuffs, and he called the Brockton police. That night, he described his assailant, the defendant, as Asian, about five feet, six or seven inches tall and of medium build, about one hundred and seventy pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>2. <em>The photographs. </em>John Martel testified that he was a detective with the Boston police department assigned, at the time of the robbery, to the \u201cAsian task force.\u201d When the Brockton police department notified him of the robbery, he compiled a photographic array of twenty-two pictures of young Asian males. He brought the array to Benjamin and then to Cheung, each of whom selected the defendant\u2019s photograph.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When shown a photograph and asked whether he recognized it, Martel replied that he recognized the photograph because he knew the defendant, and he identified it as being the one selected by Benjamin and Cheung. He also stated that, although the male depicted in the photograph was not wearing glasses, \u201cBrian wears glasses.\u201d He arrested the defendant who is five feet, eleven inches tall and weighed about one hundred and twenty pounds at the time of his arrest which was about three weeks after the robbery and after Benjamin and Cheung had been shown the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">All the photographs were admitted in evidence over the defendant\u2019s objection. Each photograph, including that of the defendant, is a double-pose picture of an Asian male standing against a height chart. Each has a placard with an inscription, \u201cPOLICE DEPT., BOSTON, MASS,\u201d an identification number, and the date the photograph was taken. The height chart and placard appear in both poses of the photographs. At the time the photographs were admitted in evidence, defense counsel did not request a limiting instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">3. <em>Identification of the defendant. </em>Benjamin testified that, during the three to five seconds he was in the lobby, he had the opportunity to see the defendant. Although there were discrepancies between the defendant\u2019s actual appearance and Benjamin\u2019s description of his assailant to the Brockton police, Benjamin did select the defendant\u2019s picture from the ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ray. He identified the defendant at hearings in the Brockton District Court as well as at trial. Benjamin observed that the only difference between the defendant\u2019s appearance in his picture and at all the court proceedings was that his photograph did not depict him wearing glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Cheung\u2019s field of clear vision without his glasses is limited to about seven feet. He testified that although he had his glasses on when he was ordered from his car, he never got a good look at his assailant who thereafter remained behind him. He also stated that after the robbery, Martel showed him a large number of photographs of \u201ccriminals\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and told him \u201cto pick out anyone that might look like who was in that incident, pick one out.\u201d Cheung picked out the picture of the defendant, whom he was unable to identify at the District Court proceedings. At trial, he did not say that the defendant was not the robber, but he could not tell the jury that he was. Additionally, Cheung believed his assailant had a facial birthmark whereas the defendant did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On this evidence, the judge told the jury, in his final instructions, \u201cOne or more of the exhibits in this case involves photographs that were in the possession of a police department. That is of no significance. Any police department may have lots of photographs for miscellaneous purposes. License issuance, for example. That has no significance and I instruct you to attach no significance to a police department\u2019s possession of a photograph of Mr. Gee in this case.\u201d Defense counsel objected to the instruction and requested that the jury be instructed in the language used in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>387 Mass. 628, 636 &amp; n.7 (1982), but the judge denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cAdmission of a defendant\u2019s mug shots in evidence, laden, as it is, with potential for characterizing the defendant as a careerist in crime, is inhibited by three criteria: (1) the prosecution must show some need to introduce the mug shots; (2) the mug shots, to the extent possible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>should not indicate a prior record; and (3) the mug shots should not call attention to their origins and implications.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 449, 451 (1990). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 591-596 (1993). Where the sole issue at trial was the identification of the defendant, there can be little doubt as to the Commonwealth\u2019s need to use the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">There also can be little doubt, however, because of the placards appearing in the photographs, that the police were in possession of the defendant\u2019s picture at a time, January 2, 1988, prior to the date of the offense, February 29, 1988, for which he was being tried. Moreover, Martel testified that the defendant was arrested after he had been identified from the array. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 166 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>387 Mass. at 639. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 594-595.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Commonwealth does not dispute the fact that, as stated in its brief, the \u201cjury was exposed to evidence from which they could infer that the defendant had prior involvement with the Boston police.\u201d Instead, it argues that, because defense counsel limited his objection to the fact that the photographs were unsevered and voiced no complaint about their unsanitized condition, we should conclude that the unsanitized photographs did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In objecting to the photographs, including that of the defendant, defense counsel stated: \u201cThey are front and side mug shot photos with some kind of shield under the face of each of the men depicted in the photos. So I am going to object to the photos or rather the form or having them be shown to the jury.\u201d When the judge asked whether the objection was based upon the police insignia, defense counsel responded, \u201cBoth as to the front and sides of the mug shots.\u201d Without inviting a reply from the Commonwealth or further discussion, the judge overruled the objection and instructed the prosecutor to \u201cproceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>If not a model of clarity, the objection was nonetheless adequate to alert the judge to the potential error so that it could have been avoided. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567, 571-572 (1985), quoting from <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>14 Pick. 236, 237 (1833). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 591-592 n.3, where, for \u201ctactical reasons,\u201d no objection to the admission of the mug shots was lodged. We think the basis of the objection was sufficiently stated, especially when considered with the appearance of the photographs themselves and the misidentification theory of the defense, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. at 573, quoting from McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 52, at 115 (2d ed. 1972), to entitle the defendant to the less stringent, standard of review of the error. We come then to the real issue on appeal, that is, whether the error requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">There was basis to question the adequacy of the opportunity provided Benjamin and Cheung to observe their assailant during the robbery. Benjamin\u2019s description of his assailant, given the same day as the crime, did not match the defendant\u2019s height or weight. Cheung, who thought his assailant had a facial birthmark, could not make an in-court identification of the defendant. In his final instructions, the judge essentially tracked the language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 (1979), which includes consideration of the fact that \u201can identification made by picking the defendant out of a group of similar individuals is generally more reliable than one which results from the presentation of the defendant alone to the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311. The strongest evidence against the defendant was the fact that both Benjamin and Cheung selected his picture from the same array of photographs, a point brought home by the prosecutor when, in her closing argument she asked the jury to ponder the \u201codds on that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Focus on the defendant\u2019s photograph invites attention to his prior involvement with the Boston police. It is the Commonwealth\u2019s position that the judge\u2019s \u201ccautionary remarks,\u201d that the jury was to attach no significance to the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the defendant\u2019s photograph was in the possession of the police, \u201cmirror in every significant respect those approved by the Court\u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>387 Mass. at 636 n.7: \u201cYou cannot draw any inference against [the defendant] ... if you infer then that the police ... at that time had a photograph of [the defendant]. You can\u2019t draw any inferences against him simply because the police had his photograph. The police departments have pictures of people for many different reasons, and you cannot speculate on the fact, if you came to believe it was a fact, that they had a picture of [the defendant].\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1193, 1194 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In both <em>Blaney </em>and <em>Banks, </em>the instructions given concerned photographs that had been sanitized prior to their admission in evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The point of those instructions was that, because the police have pictures of people for a variety of reasons, the adverse inference that the photos are mug shots from a prior criminal episode was not to be drawn. In the present case, Martel\u2019s testimony dispelled any unrealistic notion that the defendant\u2019s unsanitized, double-pose photograph could have been taken for an innocuous reason. The instruction lacked the force necessary to reach its mark, and we are left to wonder whether the jury understood that they could draw no inference adverse to the defendant from the apparent fact that the photographs are mug shots taken prior to his arrest for the offense for which he was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We are unable to conclude that the condition of the photographs \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>382 Mass. 166, 178 (1980), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112 (1976). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445-446 (1983), quoting from <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-765 (1946). On the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, any reasonable doubt by the jury about the ability of Benjamin and Cheung to identify the defendant as one of their assailants might have been resolved upon the basis of his prior involvement with the Boston police. We leave to the discretion of the trial judge at retrial whether, in addition to being sanitized, the photographs should be severed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> Ngan did not testify as he was out of the country at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\"> Defense counsel\u2019s objection to and motion to strike Martel\u2019s testimony concerning Cheung\u2019s selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph did not meet with success. After the Commonwealth rested without having called Cheung to testify, defense counsel again moved to strike Martel\u2019s testimony concerning Cheung\u2019s selection of the defendant\u2019s picture. The judge allowed the Commonwealth to reopen its case and call Cheung to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> Appellate counsel was not trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> It is clear from the transcript that the Commonwealth neither intentionally solicited nor anticipated Cheung\u2019s characterization of the men in the pictures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 592, no objection was taken to the photographs because, as earlier noted, it was \u201ctrial counsel\u2019s strategy ... to attack the photographic identifications by showing that the array was so suggestive as to lead the identifying witnesses to make faulty identifications.\u201d Nonetheless, the judge instructed the jury \u201cnot to draw any inference against this defendant because the police have his photograph\u201d and that \u201c[t]he fact that the police may have this defendant\u2019s picture does not mean the defendant committed this or any crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\"> We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s remaining claim that the prosecutor inflamed the jury with her closing remarks concerning Benjamin\u2019s terror when the gun was put to his forehead. Those statements were directed to the defendant\u2019s argument that Benjamin was so frightened and his attention so riveted on the gun that he had no true ability to observe his assailant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
