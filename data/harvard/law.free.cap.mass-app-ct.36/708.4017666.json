Since no objection was made to these instructions at trial, we review to determine whether they created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 627 (1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">At trial, the defendant did not deny that he fatally stabbed Raymond Sour at about 11 p.m. on July 1, 1990. Rather, he argued that his was a \u201cclassic case of manslaughter\u201d grounded on intoxication and provocation. Abundant evidence was introduced of his ingesting a substantial amount of alcohol together with a \u201chit\u201d of LSD prior to the stabbing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At one point in the evening, the defendant and Sour, who also had been drinking, found themselves in the apartment of a friend where they argued and where Sour threatened to kick the defendant in the head. The defendant testified that Sour grabbed him by the throat and said \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you and your kids. I\u2019m going to cut them.\u201d Immediately after the threat, the defendant ran to his home which was next door. There, he was observed as appearing \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d as he ran upstairs to check his four children. He then said, \u201cNobody is going to kill my kids.\u201d Within a short time, he obtained his fishing knife from the kitchen of his home, ran back to his neighbor\u2019s apartment and knocked at its door. At that point, no more than five minutes had elapsed from his first leaving that apartment. An occupant of the apartment, who was standing beside Sour within the apartment, opened the door and said \u201cEd, don\u2019t stab me with that.\u201d The defendant reached through the doorway, pushing Sour against the wall and stabbing him once in the upper left side of his abdomen. At that time, the defendant was heard to say that Sour was \u201cnot going to hurt my kids\u201d and that he \u201cgot what he deserved.\u201d The defendant then ran to his cousin\u2019s nearby home, handed him the knife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>and asked him to \u201c[t]ake care of my kids.\u201d Police officers who arrived at the scene approximately fifteen minutes after the stabbing, observed the defendant running away and falling several times. When they arrested the defendant, the police officers noted that his eyes were red, his speech slurred and that he had a strong odor of alcohol about him. One officer described him as being \u201cvery much\u201d intoxicated at the time. The defendant testified that due to the alcohol he consumed that day he was drunk and \u201ccouldn\u2019t think straight\u201d and that it was \u201chard to explain the effect\u201d of the LSD and schnapps but that he felt \u201crun down . . . tingly [and] numb.\u201d While being transported to the police station and during his booking, the defendant stated that he was trying to protect his children, that Sour had threatened them and that he had not intended to hurt Sour. On cross-examination, the defendant testified that he knew where to get his knife and recalled running up the stairs of the neighbor\u2019s house, knocking on the door and stabbing Sour. He further testified that he knew whom he was after, was not confused as to whom he was going to attack, and knew that he stabbed Sour.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Following a proper instruction on first degree murder and the capacity of proof of intoxication to reduce that crime to murder in the second degree, the judge gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cNow, the malice required to be proof of second degree murder is somewhat different from the malice necessary for first degree murder. The issue of the defendant\u2019s intoxication, if you find that he was, and if it so impaired his capacity to intend the death or grievous bodily injury to a person is not applicable to the malice that must be proved by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt in murder in the second degree. That malice \u2014 that is, murder in the second degree malice may be inferred by the jurors upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt that in the circumstances known to the defendant a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow from the contemplated act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The defendant argues that this instruction incorrectly states (1) that the malice element in second degree murder differs from that in first degree murder and is limited to third prong malice,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) that intoxication cannot be a mitigating factor in third prong malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The Commonwealth concedes that this \u201cunique instruction,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 294 n.1 (1992), is incorrect, but contends that it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Contrary to the judge\u2019s instructions, \u201c[tjhere is no distinction between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree based on a difference in the element of malice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, supra </em>at 296. Nevertheless, the judge\u2019s misstatement, \u201c[vjiewed solely as an instruction on murder in the second degree . . . was not harmful to the defendant\u201d solely because it omitted two definitions on which the jury might have relied to find malice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, supra </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The portion of the challenged instruction dealing with the effect of intoxication was correct at the time it was given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>409 Mass. 146, 155 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 93, 99 (1990) . In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, </em>411 Mass. 293, 298-299 (1991) , decided after the trial of this case, the court stated that \u201c[ujnder the third prong of malice, the Commonwealth must establish the guilty <em>knowledge </em>of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication should be considered by the jury . . .\u201d and held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication is a factor for the jury to consider whenever the Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing the knowledge of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 436, 443 (1993). In the factual context of this case, \u201cthe Commonwealth had the burden of demonstrating that the defendant knew that he was stabbing the victim with a knife . . . . \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, supra </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Even with the benefit of a correct instruction on the third prong of malice, a rational jury would not have harbored a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that he was stabbing Sour with a knife. The issue is not whether the defendant was intoxicated. Of that, the evidence is abundant. Rather, the question is whether there is evidence of the defendant\u2019s debilitation \u201cbearing on his ability to possess meaningful knowledge of the circumstances at the time of the victim\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, supra </em>at 299. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, supra </em>at 440-443. Not only was there ample evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct and statements from which jurors could infer the requisite knowledge, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977), but the defendant, by his own testimony, unequivocally admitted that at the time of the attack, he was not confused, knew whom he was after and knew that he had stabbed Sour. Significantly, there was no testimony from an expert \u201csuch as is almost always included in such cases that the defendant\u2019s condition prevented him from having the knowledge required for guilt of murder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, supra </em>at 443 (citation omitted). Moreover, his testimonial description of the physical effects of his consumption of alcohol and LSD and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t think straight\u201d does not rise to the level of a lay description of debilitation sufficient to create a jury issue. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, supra </em>at 299; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza </em>at 442 &amp; n.5 (describing the underlying facts in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 978 [1992], where \u201cthe defendant testified that he was severely intoxicated from drinking eigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>teen to twenty beers and smoking cocaine, causing him to \u2018freak out\u2019 and \u2018black out\u2019 while strangling the victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">There is no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that the judge failed adequately to distinguish murder from manslaughter. Early in his instructions, the judge stated that \u201cvoluntary manslaughter ... is a homicide committed without malice,\u201d and emphasized that the absence of malice distinguishes this crime from murder. His reading from G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13, and his detailed treatment of the capability of provocation \u201cto reduce an unlawful killing from murder to manslaughter\u201d adequately underscored the distinction between the crimes. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass. 659, 661, 663 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Lastly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that one confusing sentence relating to the burden of proof on the issue of provocation created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Read as a whole, the instructions did not dilute or shift the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-233 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> There was evidence that the defendant drank eighteen to twenty cans of beer during the afternoon on July 1, and at about 8 p.m., washed down the LSD with the contents of a sixteen-ounce cup filled with ice and peppermint schnapps, followed by a couple of sips from a bottle of peppermint schnapps.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-10\"> \u201cMalice aforethought may be shown by proof that the defendant, without justification or excuse, intended to kill the victim or to do the victim grievous bodily harm. However, proof of such an intent is not required because malice aforethought may be inferred if, in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987) (citation omitted). \u201cThis latter method of establishing malice is sometimes referred to as the third prong of malice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 134 n.9 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
