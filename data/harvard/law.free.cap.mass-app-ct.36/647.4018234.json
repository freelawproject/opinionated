L. Gildroy, a Harvard M.B.A. (master of business administration degree) with many years of experience in banking, real estate, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>venture capital operations, was a coowner of the Hyannis Regency Hotel with Robert F. Welch, Stephen C. Jones, and another. Welch and Jones were at the time also owners of the Taunton Regency Hotel, then under construction, in which Gildroy had no interest. In order to secure funds to complete construction of the Taunton Regency, Welch approached the Taunton Savings Bank (TSB) for a $200,000 loan. Welch represented to TSB that he, Jones, and Gildroy were the owners of the Taunton hotel. That representation was false as to Gildroy. During loan negotiations between Welch and TSB, Welch provided TSB with an altered form of Gildroy\u2019s financial statement that described Gildroy as an owner of the Taunton hotel and with promotional literature for a management organization then operating the Hyannis hotel that depicted Gildroy, Welch, and Jones (in both photographic and narrative form) as actively engaged in managing both hotels.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Ultimately TSB approved the loan and prepared a $200,000 promissory note for the signatures of Welch, Jones, and Gildroy. Rather than following TSB\u2019s normal procedure of conducting the loan closing with all borrowers present to execute the documents, the responsible TSB officer (apparently to accommodate Welch in hope of acquiring additional business) allowed Welch to take the note out of the bank in order to obtain the signatures of Jones and Gildroy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Welch presented the TSB note to Gildroy in a stack of documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that Welch advised Gildroy were necessary to sign in connection with applications for refinancing the outstanding construction loan for the Hyannis hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Without reading the note \u2014 which was titled in capital letters, \u201cTaunton Savings Bank Commercial Loan Note and Disclosure $200,000.00,\u201d and bore the words, immediately above the signature lines, \u201cIf this note is signed by more than one person . . . their liabilities hereunder shall be joint and several\u201d \u2014 Gildroy affixed his signature under those of Welch and Jones.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with Welch\u2019s instructions, TSB, after receiving the fully executed note from Welch, deposited the $200,000 loan proceeds into Taunton Regency\u2019s checking account at TSB. TSB was not aware of Welch\u2019s machinations or the circumstances that led to Gildroy\u2019s signing the note. Gildroy was not aware of the loan negotiations, the loan, or Welch\u2019s deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Welch and Jones made required monthly interest payments to TSB on the note for about a year. TSB was then acquired by the plaintiff, New Bedford Institution for Savings (NBIS), as a result of which TSB ceased to exist as a separate entity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, payments on the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>stopped, and the loan went into default. Gildroy had never been contacted by either TSB or NBIS regarding the loan until the default occurred and NBIS demanded payment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon the failure of any of the three comakers to remove the default, NBIS commenced this action against them to enforce their joint and several liabilities under the note. While Welch and Jones defaulted, Gildroy responded vigorously, asserting defenses of fraud and want of any consideration flowing to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">After a bench trial, the judge rejected Gildroy\u2019s fraud defense, since neither TSB nor NBIS bore any responsibility for Welch\u2019s knavery. He nonetheless ruled for Gildroy, holding that neither TSB (because it was note payee) nor NBIS (because it acquired the note as part of a \u201cbulk transaction,\u201d see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302[3][c]) qualified as a holder in due course under G. L. c. 106, our Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Based upon that ruling, the judge deemed Gildroy\u2019s defense of lack of consideration to be available against NBIS, as one not a holder in due course (see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-408), under ordinary contract principles. He upheld that defense on the ground that \u201cconsideration was not given to any of the comakers, [but] rather to a separate entity at the verbal authorization of one of the comakers [Welch].\u201d Because we conclude that TSB was a holder in due course that took the note free of Gildroy\u2019s contract defense, and consequently that NBIS acquired TSB\u2019s right to enforce the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>against Gildroy as transferee pursuant to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-201(1), we reverse the judgment in favor of Gildroy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The judge\u2019s understanding that an original payee of a note cannot be a holder in due course is belied by a consistent line of Massachusetts authorities to the contrary, both before promulgation of the UCC (see <em>Boston Steel &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Steuer, </em>183 Mass. 140, 143 [1903]; <em>New Hampshire Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Garage &amp; Factory Equip. Co., </em>267 Mass. 483, 485 [1929]), and since. See <em>Rockland Trust Co. </em>v. <em>South Shore Natl. Bank, </em>366 Mass. 74, 77 (1974); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Weymouth Agric. &amp; Indus. Soc., </em>389 Mass. 146, 149-150 (1983). The UCC itself so states plainly. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302(2); Massachusetts Code Comment, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302, at 479 (West 1990). Whether TSB, as payee, in fact qualifies as a holder in due course in the instant circumstances depends upon whether it satisfies the requirements that it was a holder of an instrument taken for value, in good faith, and without notice of any defenses against it. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302(1 <em>)(a)-(c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>TSB was undoubtedly a holder of the $200,000 note as defined in G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(20), as inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1 (\u201ca person who is in possession of ... an instrument . . . drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or his order. . .\u201d). The payee of an instrument in its possession is always a holder. See Hart &amp; Willier, 2 Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code Service \u00a7 11.02[1], at 11-19 (1994). TSB took the note for value when it deposited the $200,000 loan proceeds into the Taunton Regency\u2019s checking account in return for the note, which constituted its performance of the agreed consideration. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-303(a), (c); <em>Bricks Unlimited, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agee, </em>672 F.2d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1982). As to good faith, the judge expressly found that TSB was \u201cnot aware of how the note was signed\u201d and \u201c[a]t the time of the approval of the loan, TSB had no way of knowing whether . . . Gildroy\u2019s signature was genuine.\u201d These unchallenged findings are supported by the evidence and are sufficient to constitute the subjective, \u201chonesty in fact\u201d test for good faith in Massachusetts. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(19); Massachusetts Code Comment, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302(l)(b), at 478 (West 1990); <em>Industrial Natl. Bank of R.I. </em>v. <em>Leo\u2019s Used Car Exchange, Inc., </em>362 Mass. 797, 801-802 (1973); <em>Bowling Green, Inc. </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>425 F.2d 81, 85 (1st Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Finally, TSB had no \u201cnotice\u201d of any defenses available to Gildroy to avoid his obligation on the note, in the sense of having reason to know of it from all the facts and circumstances of which it was aware at the time. See G. L. c. 106, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1-201(25), 3-304(l)(6).* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Despite the judge\u2019s findings that TSB did not follow its usual procedures on this particular loan transaction, apparently because of its desire to attract additional business from Welch, those irregularities were not deemed sufficient to constitute negligence on TSB\u2019s part.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, a holder has no duty to inquire unless \u201cthe circumstances reveal a deliberate desire by the holder to evade knowledge of claims made by the maker.\u201d <em>Schwegmann Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Jefferson </em>v. <em>Simons, </em>880 F.2d 838, 842 (5th Cir. 1989). See also <em>Bricks Unlimited, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agee, </em>672 F.2d at 1259; <em>Carnegie Bank </em>v. <em>Shalleck, </em>256 N.J. Super. 23, 35 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">No such deliberately cultivated ignorance emerges or can be gleaned from the record before us. Compare <em>Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Ingel, </em>347 Mass. 119, 125 (1964) (even when the plaintiff-assignee of the note and the original payee had worked together on the financing, which made the assignee aware of complaints prior customers had lodged against the payee for its allegedly fraudulent representations, this was not sufficient for the assignee to have had reason to know of any fraud). However unorthodox TSB\u2019s handling of this loan may have been relative to its regular usages, no evidence was introduced, nor argument made, demonstrating any deviation by TSB from an applicable standard of care or from reasonable banking practices in similar loan transactions. (See note 1, <em>supra.) </em>The circumstances of the loan, albeit unusual, were not sufficient to put TSB on notice of Gil-droy\u2019s defense of fraud. Cf. <em>Carnegie Bank </em>v. <em>Shalleck, </em>256 N.J. Super, at 35 (\u201cWhile plaintiff should have employed better banking practices in deciding whether to make the loan to Anderson with or without Hagan\u2019s guaranty, no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>dence was presented that Carnegie was aware or even suspected a fraud was being perpetrated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Since TSB was a holder in due course, NBIS as its transferee acquired the rights of a holder in due course by virtue of its succession to all of TSB\u2019s interest. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-201(1); c. 168, \u00a7\u00a7 34 &amp; 34D; <em>Duxbury </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>388 Mass. 385, 388 (1983); Hart &amp; Willier, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 12.02[2], at 12-26 to 12-28. Those derivative rights are, however, \u201csubject to the defenses of any party to the instrument with whom the [original] holder has dealt.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Travi Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>First Bristol County Natl. Bank, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 32, 37 (1980). See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-305(2); Hart &amp; Willier, <em>supra. </em>Although the term \u201cdealt\u201d has been subject to no construction in Massachusetts and little elsewhere, we are persuaded that it requires a direct, face to face, personal interchange not here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The analysis of this aspect of the case begins with Uniform Commercial Code comment 2(c) to \u00a7 3-302, 2 U.L.A. 487-488 (1991), which sets forth an example of a payee who is deemed a full holder in due course in circumstances remarkably similar to the present case: \u201cA [Welch] and B [Gildroy] sign a note as co-makers ... A [Welch having] induce [d] B [Gildroy] to sign by fraud, and without authority from B [Gildroy] [A, Welch] delivers the note to P[ayee, TSB], who takes it for value, in good faith and without notice.\u201d Six additional examples of payees who are holders in due course are given in comment 2, all premising a payee who has not dealt personally and directly with the obligor on the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The few courts and treatises that have addressed the meaning of \u201cdealt\u201d in \u00a7 3-305(2) have linked the examples of \u00a7 3-302\u2019s comment 2 to the personal defenses preserved by \u00a7 3-305(2) and have opined that a payee who does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>actually deal with a drawer or maker (and otherwise qualifies as a holder in due course) takes free of those defenses (including lack of consideration). The rationale is that such a payee is not so directly and personally involved with the disputed aspects of the transaction as to be charged with knowledge of any fraud or other irregularity and therefore should not be deprived of holder in due course status. See <em>Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>34 Ill. App. 3d 458, 468-469 (1975); <em>Village Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Fed. Savs. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>231 Va. 408, 409-410, 412 (1986); 1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 14.7, at 718-719 (3d ed. 1988); Uniform Commercial Code (Revised) \u00a7 3-302, comment 4, case 2, 2 U.L.A. 65-66 (1991); 6 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 3-305: 87 (1993). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mark Twain Bank-Kansas City, 771 </em>F.2d 361, 365 (8th Cir. 1985). Contrast <em>Standard Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>3 Haw. App. 614, 617 (1983) (plaintiff seeking to enforce notes \u201cdealt\u201d with defendant maker because it explained the terms and conditions of the notes to the defendant and witnessed the defendant signing the notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The underlying philosophy of these authorities \u2014 that an innocent person who receives commercial paper in good faith and for value from one who has obtained it by a misrepresentation or fraud should be protected and allowed to enforce the obligation \u2014 is reflected in the law of contracts, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 164(2) &amp; comment e (1979), and the law of suretyship, see Restatement of Security \u00a7 119 (1941). Given the importance to our economy of facilitating commerce in general and the transferability and circulation of commercial paper in particular, such a principle appears appropriately invoked when construing the rights of an otherwise qualified holder in due course. Accordingly, we hold that TSB did not \u201cdeal\u201d with Gildroy within the meaning of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-305(2). TSB would not, therefore, be subject to Gildroy\u2019s lack of consideration (or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>other personal) defense, and neither is NBIS as successor in interest to TSB.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Even, however, were we to agree with Gildroy\u2019s unadorned assertion that he was a person with whom TSB \u201cdealt,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it would not support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defense of want of consideration was available to Gildroy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As earlier noted, TSB gave value for the note when it paid the loan proceeds into an account available to Welch and Jones \u2014 an indisputable detriment to TSB that legally satisfied the consideration requirement. See <em>Cottage St. Methodist Episcopal Church </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>121 Mass. 528, 529-530 (1877); <em>Graphic Arts Finishers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>357 Mass. 40, 42-43 (1970); <em>Marine Contractors Co. </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>365 Mass. 280, 284 (1974). At least two of the comakers, Welch and Jones, undoubtedly received direct benefit from TSB\u2019s performance by drawing out the proceeds of the loan. As the document Gildroy signed plainly stated, the liability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>comakers was joint and several. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-118(e). The fact that one of the joint and several obligors did not personally receive any benefit from the transaction is immaterial; consideration enjoyed by any one of the co-obligors is sufficient to support the promissory note. See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>714 F. Supp. 451, 454 (D. Colo. 1989); <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Abel, </em>379 S.W.2d 164, 165-166 (Mo. App. 1964); <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Boxwell Bros., Inc., </em>362 S.W.2d 884, 886 (Tex. Civ. App. 1962).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Finally, although Gildroy has not contested the judge\u2019s rejection of his fraud defense, we address it briefly, since the kind of fraud here alleged (sometimes referred to as \u201cfraud in the factum\u201d or fraud in the inception) is one of the \u201creal\u201d defenses that can be interposed against even the most purehearted and scrupulously attentive holder in due course: \u201csuch misrepresentation as has induced the party to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to obtain knowledge of its character or its essential terms.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-305(2)(c), as inserted by St. 1957, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>c. 765, \u00a7 1. The record, however, irrefutably deprives Gil-droy of such a defense. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>On his own testimony, he did have a reasonable opportunity to discover that he was being asked to sign a negotiable instrument. His failure to have done so was properly ruled negligent by the judge, since even casual examination would have immediately exposed and ended the fraud Welch was perpetrating upon him. Gildroy not only suffered no constraints preventing his reading the document, he admitted that he had seen enough of the top of the paper to assert, at his deposition, that the typed word \u201cCommercial\u201d (which appears next to and on the same line as the words \u201cLoan Note and Disclosure,\u201d printed in capital letters) was not on the document when he signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the Superior Court for a determination of NBIS\u2019s damages and further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"> Gildroy asserted at trial and here (in a cross appeal) that TSB\u2019s conduct in this respect (which the trial judge characterized as \u201ccutting corners\u201d) was negligent or commercially unreasonable. Although the judge found TSB\u2019s over-all handling of the transaction to be \u201crare,\u201d \u201cmost unusual,\u201d and even \u201ccontrary to the usual bank practices,\u201d he observed that there was no evidence introduced regarding the applicable standard of care or what reasonable bank practices were and that no provision of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) imposed any duty of care or of reasonable commercial practice on TBS in such a situation. Gildroy inaptly relies on G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-406, for the supposed existence of a general standard of commercial reasonableness; but that section of the UCC only applies where an instrument has been altered or contains an unauthorized signature, neither of which here obtains. Consequently, the judge correctly rejected Gildroy\u2019s negligence defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> Gildroy justified his failure to read the documents he signed at Welch\u2019s behest by stating that he paid attention only to \u201cformal\u201d documents such as would be involved in a loan closing, not to documents relating to preliminary matters such as application forms, which he did not deem important enough to read. This court has frequently commented on the dangers of such an imprudent attitude. See <em>Markell </em>v. <em>Sidney B. Pfeifer Foundation, Inc., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 412, 440 (1980); <em>Connecticut Jr. Republic </em>v. <em>Doherty, 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 107, 110 (1985); <em>Mayflower Seafoods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Integrity Credit Corp., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 453, 459 (1988); <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>Sturbridge Camping Club, Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 173, 175 n.5 (1992). The unfortunate consequences of executing legal documents without full appreciation of their significance have been bewailed in our culture for at least four centuries. See Shakespeare, Henry VI, Part II, act IV, sc. ii (\u201cIs not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That parchment, being scribbled o\u2019er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings; but I say, \u2018tis the bee\u2019s wax: for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> The trial judge found that NBIS \u201cpurchased the stock of TSB\u201d and that the note at issue \u201cwas one of the assets of TSB,\u201d though never endorsed to NBIS by TSB. NBIS oificers variously described the transaction as both an \u201cacquisition of] the assets of\u2019 TSB and as an \u201cacquisition of] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>all of the stock and assets of\u2019 TSB. Although no relevant documents reflecting this transaction are in the record, it appears to have been a consolidation pursuant to either G. L. c. 168, \u00a7 34, or \u00a7 34D, under either of which NBIS would be deemed a successor in interest which simply \u201cstepped into the shoes\u201d of TSB with respect to all existing rights and liabilities. Whatever the operative mechanism, there is no real dispute that NBIS effectively \u201cpurchased\u201d the note in issue along with all other assets of TSB by virtue of the acquisition transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> We reject NBIS\u2019s estoppel argument based upon Gildroy\u2019s failure to make complaint after TSB allegedly sent him a default notice. The record reveals that the notice was sent not to Gildroy\u2019s address as shown on the note, but rather to the address that accompanied Welch\u2019s signature. Although that was also the address of the hotel management firm that Gildroy occasionally visited, there was no evidence presented that it was ever his business or residential address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\"> Because NBIS was a derivative holder in due course by virtue of the \u201cshelter doctrine\u201d codified in \u00a7 3-201(1) of the UCC, we need not separately address the merits of the judge\u2019s alternative holding, that NBIS did not qualify as a holder in due course in its own right because it purchased the note \u201cas part of bulk transaction not in regular course of business of the transferor.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302(3)(c), as inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1. We note that there is no Massachusetts decision interpreting the bulk transaction exception to holder in due course status, save for an early opinion devoid of meaningful analysis in <em>Credit Indus. Corp. </em>v. <em>DiNanno, </em>29 Mass. App. Dec. 40, 43 (1964). At least two other jurisdictions have considered the provision in the context of a bank merger or consolidation. See <em>First Alabama Bank of Guntersville </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>402 So. 2d 992, 994 (Ala. Civ. App. 1981); <em>Rosa </em>v. <em>Colonial Bank, </em>207 Conn. 483, 489-491 (1988). Earlier holdings deal with the effect of bank consolidations on holder in due course status under the pre-UCC negotiable instruments law. See <em>National Bank of Lima </em>v. <em>Deaton, </em>279 Ky. 606, 610-611 (1939); <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Zipp, </em>90 S.W.2d. 668, 671 (Tex. Civ. App. 1936). We finally observe that NBIS might well not have been a \u201cholder,\u201d let alone a holder in due course in its own right, because TSB was the payee of the note and did not endorse it to NBIS. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(20), as appearing in St. 1983, c. 522, \u00a7 3, defining a \u201cholder\u201d as \u201ca person who is in possession of ... an instrument... drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank.\u201d Neither party has discussed this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> Contrast the original form of the UCC as first promulgated in Pennsylvania (P.L. 3, No. 1, 1953), which in \u00a7 3-302(l)(b) defined \u201cgood faith\u201d for holder in due course status as requiring \u201cobservance of the reasonable commercial standards of any business in which the holder may be engaged.\u201d Contrast also the 1990 revision of Article 3 by the American Law Institute, which similarly expands the definition of \u201cgood faith\u201d for Article 3 purposes to include \u201cthe observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing\u201d as well as \u201chonesty in fact.\u201d See Uniform Commercial Code (Revised) \u00a7 3-103(a)(4), 2 U.L.A. 22 (1991). The absence of such qualifying language in our UCC is additional support for the judge\u2019s rejection of Gildroy\u2019s negligence defense. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\"> The judge\u2019s findings mentioned in the preceding paragraph negate any actual knowledge of Welch\u2019s fraud on the part of TSB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> \u201c[N]egligence has [a] role in the determination of a holder\u2019s status as a holder in due course under \u00a7 3-302 [in that it] goes to the notice requirement of \u00a7 3-302(l)(c), as defined by \u00a7 3-304, and \u00a7 1-201(25).\u201d <em>Industrial Natl. Bank of R.I. </em>v. <em>Leo\u2019s Used Car Exchange, </em>362 Mass. at 802. No finding or evidence, however, supports Gildroy\u2019s contention that TSB was negligent in its handling of the transaction. See notes 1 and 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> This qualification of the rights of a holder in due course was presumably what the judge had in mind when he stated, as an alternative basis for his ruling, that since TSB \u201cwas an immediate party to the Note and the original makers . . . NBIS takes the Note subject to all defenses that the original makers had against the original payee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\"> The A.L.I.\u2019s 1990 revision of Article 3\u2019s definition of holder in due course provides illustrations of innocent payees not directly involved with an obligor who can, as in the examples under the prior version of \u00a7 3-302, comment 2(c), mentioned <em>supra, </em>be deemed holders in due course, and explicitly adds that such payees take free of the obligor\u2019s defenses. This is a helpful clarification of the principle implicit in the authorities discussed above. See Uniform Commercial Code (Revised) \u00a7 3-302, comment 4, 2 U.L.A. 64-66 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> Gildroy\u2019s brief is emphatic in distancing himself from TSB: \u201cGildroy and TSB never came face to face and never communicated with each other during the entire transaction. . . . [No representative] of the bank [TSB] ever bothered to communicate with Gildroy prior to the transaction. . . . Gildroy never attended any closing at the bank. . . . Even after the loan was executed there was no contact between Gildroy and TSB until Jones and Welch defaulted in payment.\u201d Nonetheless, he maintains that TSB still \u201cdealt\u201d with him and thereby rendered itself subject to his personal defense against liability on the note. He provides no authority or legal analysis for that naked contention. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>McCone </em>v. <em>New England Tel. </em>&amp; <em>Tel. Co., </em>393 Mass. 231, 236 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> The judge appeared to ground his ruling regarding the consideration issue on his determination that NBIS was not a holder in due course under any theory and was therefore subject to the defense of lack of consideration under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-408. Given our view that the consideration requirement was satisfied here, the actual basis for the judge\u2019s conclusion is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\"> The judge correctly acknowledged this principle of joint and several comaker liability and specifically stated that \u201cone comaker is liable even if the consideration for the note is given to another comaker.\u201d He erred, however, in his view that none of the three comakers actually benefited from the loan because the proceeds went to \u201ca separate entity,\u201d the Taunton Regency hotel, in light of the uncontested facts that the hotel was owned and controlled by Jones and Welch and that Welch was the sole authorized signatory for the hotel\u2019s checking account at TSB and actually drew the checks on that account, ultimately exhausting the loan proceeds. It is established in our law that the physical movement of consideration \u2014 whether from promisee directly to promisor, from promisee to a third party at the promisee\u2019s direction, or from a third person at the promisee\u2019s direction to the promisor \u2014 is irrelevant, so long as the promisee incurs a detriment or the promisor receives a benefit. See <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>346 Mass. 667, 671 (1964); <em>Marine Contractors Co. </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>365 Mass. at 286; <em>John Deere Co. </em>v. <em>Broomfield, </em>803 F.2d 408, 410 (8th Cir. 1986); <em>First City Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Zellner, </em>782 F. Supp. 232, 236 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 71 (4); 1 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 124 (1963). We agree with NBIS that courts throughout the United States have routinely imposed liability on individual comakers who themselves received no consideration, so long as loan funds were actually disbursed and at least one comaker or his designee has received a benefit. Gildroy has not cited a single authority from any jurisdiction to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b690-7\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aru-dedup-0\">(concurring). Although I concur in the result reached by the majority, I am hard pressed to accept the notion that in such circumstances as presented here there must be an affirmative showing of \u201cdeliberately cultivated ignorance\u201d on the part of the holder. See <em>Schwegmann Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Jefferson </em>v. <em>Simons, </em>880 F.2d 838, 842 (5th Cir. 1989). I deem TSB\u2019s handling of the loan not \u201cunorthodox\u201d but negligent \u2014 plainly contrary to proper banking practices. Here, TSB certainly placed itself, by such an improvident choice, in a precarious position, whereby it was plainly vulnerable to fraud. After saying all that, I concur in the result because an experienced businessman (let alone a Harvard M.B.A.) surely ought to know that he assumes a risk when he \u201cgets into bed\u201d with someone, as well as to know he must first read \u201cwhat he signs.\u201d Parenthetically, if that imperative was not inculcated firmly at \u201cbusiness school,\u201d he should be entitled to a refund of his tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Finally, I am compelled to point out that the bulk of the work product (i.e., research and analysis) evidenced in this opinion was done by the <em>court. </em>All too often this court is compelled to range far and wide from the parties\u2019 briefs to reach what I believe is the correct and proper legal solution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
