A judge of the Superior Court concluded that the plaintiff did not sustain his burden of justifying an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The claim for attorney\u2019s fees is based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982), which provides that in actions brought under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d In order to recover, the plaintiff must show that he was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d and that his complaint alleged a \u201csubstantial constitutional claim.\u201d <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>405 Mass. 74, 76 (1989). The defendants argue that the plaintiff does not satisfy either of these two inquiries and that, in any event, he cannot prevail because he is a pro se litigant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The plaintiff, a patient at the treatment center for sexually dangerous persons, brought this action alleging, among other grievances (in amended and supplemental complaints), that his rights were abridged in violation of State and Federal statutory and constitutional provisions. More particularly, he claimed that he was deprived of his right to reasonable telephone access, his right to receive unopened privileged mail, and his right to treatment. His contention with respect to his right to treatment was that although he had been classified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>as a patient with maximum privileges, including the right to have his room unlocked, his classification status was downgraded to moderate privilege with the result that he was afforded fewer treatment opportunities and benefits and, in addition, was housed with a number of violent and destructive patients. The reason for his changed classification was a policy instituted by the treatment center staff that only those patients who volunteered to \u201cdouble-bunk\u201d (share a room) would have maximum privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Prior to trial (on December 1, 1986) a preliminary injunction issued ordering the defendants to comply immediately with regulations relating to the processing and delivery of the plaintiffs privileged mail and telephone access. On July 7, 1987, the judge also ordered the defendants to take reasonable steps to prevent the plaintiff from becoming a victim of unlawful and violent actions of other patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">After a six-day trial, a judgment entered<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>ordering the defendants to comply with the regulations relating to their processing and delivery of the plaintiffs privileged mail (104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.03 [1] [a] [3][1986]\u00ae ) and telephone access (104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.03 [1] [d] [1986]) and declaring that the selection of ward assignments (minimum privilege, moderate privilege, and maximum privilege) could not be based on volunteering to double-bunk and that the plaintiff could not be precluded from assignment to maximum privilege status solely on the basis of his refusal to double-bunk. The judge declined to award damages because the plaintiff did not show that he was actually deprived of required treatment, and, presumably for this reason, as there was no further explanation, the judge denied the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">1. The plaintiff was a prevailing party under the tests set forth by the United States Supreme Court. \u201cA prevailing party [is] one who has succeeded on any significant claim affording it some of the relief sought, either pendente lite or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>at the conclusion of the litigation.\u201d <em>Texas State Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 791 (1989). \u201cThe touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792-793. <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>113 S. Ct. 566, 573 (1992). Here the plaintiff obtained interim and permanent injunctions ordering the defendants to comply with their regulations relative to the processing and delivery of the plaintiff\u2019s privileged mail and telephone access.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That no change in the regulations was ordered or that the defendants stipulated to the inclusion of the provisions of the preliminary injunction in a permanent order does not, as the defendants contend, prevent the plaintiff from being a prevailing party. See <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 129 (1980) (settlement or consent judgment does not weaken claim to fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The declaration that the plaintiff may not be precluded from assignment to maximum privilege status solely on the basis of his refusal to double-bunk altered materially the relations of the parties. It obviously \u201caffect[ed] the behavior of the defendant [s] toward the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>488 U.S. 1, 4 (1988), and produced \u201cthe termination of some conduct\u201d on the part of the defendants. <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>482 U.S. 755, 761 (1987). The plaintiff also obtained an order prior to trial requiring the defendants to take reasonable steps to protect him from unlawful and violent actions of other patients. In view of the interim and final relief accorded, the plaintiff achieved significant benefits by bringing the action. See <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>405 Mass. at 76. The defendants\u2019 claims to the contrary are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>2. As to the substantiality of the constitutional claims, a \u201cpainstakingly minimal standard\u201d is applicable. <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. </em>Welfare, 387 Mass. 312, 319 (1982). A claim meets the test unless \u201cit is obviously without merit or ... its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of [the Supreme Court] as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, quoting from <em>Hagans </em>v. <em>Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 537 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The question is \u201cwhether [the] claim is \u2018so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit,\u2019 as not to involve an appropriate controversy.\u201d <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>405 Mass. at 77, quoting from <em>Oneida Indian Nation </em>v. <em>County of Oneida, </em>414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As to telephone access, privileged mail, and maximum privileges, the minimal standards have been met. Prisoners have a \u201cliberty interest\u201d in \u201cuncensored communication by letter . . . even though qualified of necessity by the circumstances of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>395 Mass. 382, 386-387 (1985), quoting from <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 418 (1974). Civilly committed patients at the treatment center may be entitled to greater privileges than prisoners, and, indeed, the regulations, unlike those for prisoners, provide that a patient may be required to open mail in the presence of a staff member only if there is a reason to believe that contraband is enclosed. See 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.03 (l)(a)(3) (1986). An alleged violation of the regulation meets the requirement of constitutional substance. Similar constitutional considerations apply to telephone access. See <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>948 F.2d 388, 390-391 (7th Cir. 1991) (unreasonable restrictions on prisoner\u2019s telephone access may violate First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u201c[A] person committed for treatment of mental illness has a due process right to receive treatment . . . and the right to receive the least restrictive or least burdensome control nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>essary to pursue rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>410 Mass. 347, 360 (1991). See also <em>Thompson, petitioner, </em>394 Mass. 502, 505-506 (1985), discussing the rights of treatment center patients. The trial judge ruled that the plaintiff is \u201centitled to be housed in the least restrictive conditions which are consistent with [his] security needs under existing regulations\u201d and found that \u201c[t]he evidence supports the conclusion that the plaintiff [ ] [is] best suited to be placed on the maximum privilege ward.\u201d He concluded that volunteering for double-bunking is not an appropriate criterion and has \u201cno rational relationship\u201d to placement and that the plaintiff [was] entitled to a declaration that this criterion \u201cexceeded the discretion afforded to the Administrator under [104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.10 (1986)].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The interim order requiring the defendants to take reasonable steps to protect the plaintiff from other inmates also has constitutional overtones. <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982) (involuntarily committed resident of an institution for mentally retarded persons \u201cenjoys constitutionally protected interests in conditions of reasonable care and safety, reasonably nonrestrictive confinement conditions, and such training as may be required by these interests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Quite apart from the foregoing bases supporting the \u201csub-stantiality\u201d of the plaintiffs claims, the Massachusetts regulations which contain \u201c \u2018explicitly mandatory language in connection with requiring specific substantive predicates\u2019 [also may] create [constitutionally protected] liberty interests.\u201d <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, </em>415 Mass. 132, 137 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">That the judge followed the traditional policy of refraining from deciding the case on constitutional grounds and resolved the plaintiffs claims under State law \u2014 a basis which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>standing alone, would not support an award of fees under \u00a7 1988 \u2014 does not preclude an award of fees. The legislative history of \u00a7 1988 makes clear that Congress intended fees to be awarded if the \u201cconstitutional claims are \u2018substantial,\u2019 and arise from the same nucleus of facts on which the State law claims are based.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 317. See <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. at 132-133 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Once a plaintiff meets his burden of showing that he is a prevailing party and that he has raised \u201csubstantial\u201d constitutional claims, discretion to deny fees is limited; successful plaintiffs should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee in the absence of special circumstances which would render such an award unjust. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 89 n.1 (1989). <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 319. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>410 Mass. 188, 197 (1991). \u201c[T]he court must have, and express, special reasons if it is to refuse\u201d to award fees, <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>944 F.2d 949, 954 (1st Cir. 1991),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> unless the over-all success of the plaintiff is so minimal that the court may lawfully award no fees. See <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>113 S. Ct. at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">3. Having determined that several of the plaintiffs claims meet the requirement of \u201csubstantiality\u201d and that he is a prevailing party, we turn to the question whether the plaintiff may receive payment for the reasonable costs of standby counsel. Although the defendants are correct that a pro se litigant is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for his own services, <em>Kay </em>v. <em>Ehrler, </em>499 U.S. 432 (1991) (lawyer who represents himself not entitled to fees under \u00a7 1988), the plaintiff is not seeking compensation for his own efforts, but rather for attorney\u2019s fees that he has incurred. The language of \u00a7 1988 supports the recovery of such fees, see <em>supra </em>at 115, and there is no reason of policy which precludes an award of fees to a plaintiff who cannot afford full representation of counsel or who, for other reasons, chooses only to have the assistance of standby counsel. To the contrary, the linchpin of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>court\u2019s holding in <em>Kay </em>v. <em>Ehrler, supra, </em>was that \u201cawards of counsel fees to <em>pro se </em>litigants \u2014 even if limited to those who are members of the bar \u2014 would create a disincentive to employ counsel .... The statutory policy of furthering the successful prosecution of meritorious claims is better served by a rule that creates an incentive to retain counsel in every such case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438. Since the purpose of \u00a7 1988 is \u201cto enable potential plaintiffs to obtain the assistance of competent counsel in vindicating their rights,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>we conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, as established by the court, for the services of standby counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">4. The determination of the amount of fees to be awarded to the plaintiff requires a remand to the Superior Court. The plaintiff brought a number of claims on which he was unsuccessful. If those claims are \u201cdistinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent [by standby counsel] on the unsuccessful claim [s] should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. Where a lawsuit [, however,] consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney\u2019s fee reduced simply because the . . . court did not adopt each contention raised.\u201d <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 440 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Accordingly, that portion of the judgment which disallows attorney\u2019s fees is reversed and the matter is remanded for the judge to determine the reasonable fees to be awarded for standby counsel under the principles of <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Ecker-hart, supra. </em>See also <em>Nydam </em>v. <em>Lennerton, </em>948 F.2d 808, 812 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Title 104 Code Mass.
