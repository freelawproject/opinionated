L. c. 23IB, \u00a7 1(e).* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3****We summarize the procedural and undisputed factual history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The plaintiff broke his leg while working for the Sutton Corporation (Sutton) in the construction of the Cambridge-side Galleria project. Sutton was the earth-support systems subcontractor at that job site. The plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Sutton\u2019s insurance carrier and brought an action in the Superior Court for negligence against A. J. Welch Equipment Corporation (Welch), the excavation subcontractor, and Beaver Builders, Inc. (Beaver), the general contractor, of the Galleria project. In that action, Beaver filed claims against Sutton and Welch for indemnification based upon identical indemnification clauses in their subcontracts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, Welch filed claims for contribution against Beaver and Sutton. Sutton also filed a claim for contribution against Welch.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Prior to trial, Welch entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff for $115,000. The plaintiff then dismissed his claims against both Beaver and Welch. This left the cross claims and third-party complaints for indemnification and contribution for trial. All parties agreed that the case would be submitted to the jury on special questions after which the judge would decide the respective claims of contribution and indemnification. The special verdict questions asked only whether Beaver was negligent, whether Beaver proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and whether Sutton and Welch \u201ccaused\u201d the accident. The jury responded that Beaver was negligent and its negligence was the proximate cause of the accident and that both Welch and Sutton \u201ccaused\u201d the accident. Based on the jury\u2019s responses, the judge then ruled for Welch on its claim for contribution in the amount of $57,500 against Beaver and against Beaver on its claim for contribution from Welch. The judge also ruled that Beaver was not entitled to indemnification from Welch but was entitled to indemnification from Sutton for $57,500. The judge found for Welch on Sutton\u2019s claim for contribution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On appeal, Sutton claims that the judge erred in ruling that Beaver was entitled to indemnification from Sutton based on the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as appearing in St. 1985, c. 228, \u00a7 3, and the language of the indemnification clause. Sutton also claims that the judge erred in awarding Welch contribution from Beaver because G. L. c. 23IB, \u00a7 1(e), bars contribution when the party seeking contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>tion is obligated to indemnify the party from whom the contribution is sought. Finally, Sutton contends that where the indemnification clause in Welch\u2019s subcontract was identical to Sutton\u2019s indemnity clause in its subcontract, the judge erred in failing to find Welch liable to Beaver on its claim for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We address each of those claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">1. <em>Indemnification clause. </em>Sutton argues that a subcontractor cannot be held liable under an indemnity clause in a construction contract under the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, unless the subcontractor is found negligent. It claims that the jury\u2019s finding that it was a \u201ccause\u201d of the accident is not the equivalent of a finding of negligence and, thus, the indemnity clause of its contract does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The current version of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, declares void indemnity provisions in construction contracts when the subcontractor is obligated to indemnify any party for an injury, which is \u201cnot caused by the subcontractor or its employees, agents or subcontractors . . . .\u201d See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 81-82 (1989). See also <em>Harnois </em>v. <em>Quan-napowitt Dev., Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 288-289 (1993). In the <em>Harnois </em>case, which was decided after the trial court\u2019s decision, we advocated focusing on the language of the indemnity clause to determine its validity under \u00a7 29C rather than on the facts of the particular accident and assessment of fault of the parties. In that case, we held that the indemnity clause was void because it contained a provision requiring the subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor for an injury that may not have been caused by the subcontractor or its employees, agents, or subcontractors. <em>Id. </em>at 288-289. Unlike the indemnity clause in the <em>Harnois </em>case, Sutton\u2019s obligation to indemnify is limited to an injury resulting from the negligence or act or omission of Sutton or its agents \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by law.\u201d Because of that limitation, we do not consider the indemnity clause void under \u00a7 29C.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The question thus remains whether \u201ccause\u201d as used in \u00a7 29C requires a finding of negligence. There is no mention of negligence in \u00a7 29C even though the Legislature, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>earlier version of this statute, expressly provided that indemnity clauses which absolved indemnitees from their own negligence were against public policy and void. St. 1985, c. 228, \u00a7 3. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., supra. </em>That being so, one could assume that if the Legislature had intended to validate indemnity clauses in construction contracts only when the subcontractor or its agents and employees were negligent, rather than the cause of the loss, it would have said so. See <em>Bron-stein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 708 (1984). We need not, however, decide this issue because Sutton failed to raise it at trial. <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>410 Mass. 847, 850 n.7 (1991). <em>Lease-It, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 397 (1992). In fact, Sutton argued against this very interpretation and did not object to the special question to the jury which asked: \u201cDid the defendant, Sutton Corporation, cause the plaintiffs, Joseph Callahan, injuries?\u201d or the judge\u2019s instructions which differentiated between Beaver\u2019s liability based on negligence and Sutton\u2019s liability based on causation arising out of breach of contract or safety rules incorporated therein. Accordingly, we deem the issue waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Sutton next contends that the judge incorrectly determined that it was obligated to indemnify Beaver because the language of the indemnity clause did not clearly specify that Sutton would indemnify Beaver even if Beaver were found negligent. The mere fact that an indemnity clause does not expressly provide for indemnity even where the indemnitee is negligent will not preclude the right to indemnity if the intent sufficiently appears in the language and circumstances attending its execution. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Bay State Gas Co., </em>383 Mass. 218, 222-223 (1981). <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Dimeo, Inc., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 629 (1991). Here, the indemnity clause speaks of indemnification \u201cfrom and against any and all claims for bodily injury and death and for property damage or any other loss or damage suffered or incurred by the . . . Contractor\u201d to the fullest extent permitted by law. Based on the scope of that language and the situation of the parties, we conclude that the judge did not err in concluding that Sut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ton\u2019s contractual obligation covered claims resulting from the concurrent fault of both Sutton and Beaver. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., supra </em>at 79-81 (language of an indemnity clause, not substantially different from the subject clause, similarly construed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">2. <em>Contribution. </em>Sutton\u2019s liability to Beaver under its indemnity clause arises out of Welch\u2019s recovery of contribution from Beaver for one-half of Welch\u2019s settlement of plaintiff\u2019s claim. Sutton claims that since Welch is obligated to indemnify Beaver for the loss in question, Welch cannot obtain contribution from Beaver under the provisions of G. L. c. 231B, \u00a7 1(e). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Contribution and indemnity are mutually exclusive remedies. <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Unisys Corp., </em>410 Mass. 479, 482 (1991). General Laws c. 23IB, \u00a7 1(e), simply provides that there is no contribution in cases where a right of indemnity exists. See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>386 Mass. 95, 100-101 (1982); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., supra </em>at 78, 80-81. This interpretation is consonant with the views expressed by the drafters of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, 12 U.L.A. 66 (Master ed. 1975), and the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 886A(4) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">3. <em>Welch\u2019s and Sutton\u2019s liability for indemnification. </em>Sutton argues that the judge erred in failing to find Welch liable for indemnity to Beaver where Welch\u2019s subcontract contained an indemnity clause identical to the one contained in Sutton\u2019s contract. The judge\u2019s decision was based on his conclusion that it would have been inequitable to do so because it would have resulted in a windfall for Beaver. We do not agree. There is nothing to distinguish Welch\u2019s liability for indemnity to Beaver in the factual circumstances of this case from Sutton\u2019s liability to Beaver. Nevertheless, in light of our holding that Welch could not obtain contribution from Beaver, there has been no loss suffered by Beaver and consequently, no entitlement to indemnification from either Welch or Sutton.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Keljikian </em>v. <em>Star Brewing Co., </em>303 Mass. 53, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>54 (1939)(party seeking indemnification must establish that it was legally obligated to make payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The judgment is vacated. A new judgment is to enter: (1) for Beaver on Welch\u2019s claim for contribution; (2) for Welch on Beaver\u2019s cross claim for contribution; (3) for Sutton on Beaver\u2019s claim for indemnification; (4) for Welch on Beaver\u2019s cross claim for indemnification; and (5) for Welch on Sutton\u2019s cross claim for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\"> General Laws c. 23IB, \u00a7 1(e), as inserted by St. 1962, c. 730, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cThis chapter shall not impair any right of indemnity under existing law. Where one tortfeasor is entitled to indemnity from another, the right of the indemnity obligee shall be for indemnity and not contribution, and the indemnity obligor shall not be entitled to contribution from the obligee for any portion of his indemnity obligation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> The indemnity clause read as follows: \u201cTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Subcontractor shall defend and save the Owner and Contractor harmless and indemnified from and against any and all claims for bodily injury and death and for property damage or any other loss or damage suffered or incurred by the Owner, any separate contractors employed by the Owner, or by Contractor or any Subcontractor employed by the Owner or Contractor, resulting from the negligence or any act or omission of Subcontractor or his agents, or arising out of or in any way connected with the performance, attempted performance, or failure to perform the Work by Subcontractor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> Welch\u2019s claim for contribution against Sutton was dismissed before trial because Sutton, as the plaintiff\u2019s employer, was immune from tort liability based on its payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the plaintiff. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23. Sutton had paid to the plaintiff $56,405.74 through its workers\u2019 compensation carrier and its insurance carrier had waived its lien on the settlement of $115,000 received by the plaintiff from Welch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 29C, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\u201cAny provision for or in connection with a contract for construction, reconstruction, installation, alteration, remodeling, repair, demolition or maintenance work . .. which requires a subcontractor to indemnify any party for injury to persons or damage to property not caused by the subcontractor or its employees, agents or subcontractors, shall be void.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\"> Ordinarily, an indemnitee is entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in resisting a claim within the scope of the indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>nity clause even where the written indemnity agreement makes no specific reference to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Buckley Heating, Inc., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 973 (1986). Beaver may well have been entitled to the same, but where it did not file a cross appeal contesting the failure to award attorney\u2019s fees and questioned only whether and to what extent Sutton would have to reimburse Welch for the amount paid in settlement of the plaintiffs claim, we decline to remand to the trial court for determination of Beaver\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees and expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
