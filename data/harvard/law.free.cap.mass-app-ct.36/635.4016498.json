In his appeal, Vega challenges the admissibility of evidence that DNA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in samples of his blood matched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>DNA in seminal fluid on the victim\u2019s underwear. He also claims error in the denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty, instructions to the jury defining sodomy, and the imposition of a successive sentence on the conviction of natural rape to follow the sentence served on the conviction of unnatural rape (nineteen and one-half to twenty years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution [M.C.I.], Cedar Junction).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The victim, a native of Texas, had come to visit her ailing fifty-nine year old son in Revere and sojourned in his apartment in that city. Late in the afternoon on August 7, 1987, Debra Swasey, a woman friend of the victim\u2019s son, turned up at the Revere apartment for a change of clothes and a shower. She was accompanied by a man who was asked to wait outside. About one-half hour after he and the woman had left the Revere apartment in a blue van, he returned and secured entrance to the apartment on the pretext of wishing to talk to the victim about her son. There ensued brutal forced vaginal and anal rapes. The victim identified the defendant as the assailant. Other facts which the jury might have found from the evidence are best left to discussion of the various points of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">1. <em>Required finding of not guilty. </em>There was sufficient evidence against the defendant to take to the jury the charge of natural rape, and the defendant does not contend otherwise. The defendant does urge, however, that the evidence of unnatural, i.e., anal rape, failed under the standard formulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 216 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 428-429 (1993). Evidence of anal penetration, the defendant argues, is missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In her testimony, the victim, untutored in the niceties of legal presentation, was wont to proceed to the heart of the matter. When asked, \u201cAnd after the clothing was down, ma\u2019m, what happened,\u201d she responded: \u201cHe raped me.\u201d Asked to explain what the assailant had done, she said: \u201cHis penis went into my vagina.\u201d Asked what the assailant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>thereafter, she said, \u201cHe flipped me over and then he sodomized me.\u201d The phrase \u201csodomized me,\u201d the defendant contends, inadequately expresses the idea of penetration. In context and in terms of the ordinary meaning of \u201csodomy,\u201d anal copulation, the jury could have inferred penetration. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coderre, </em>360 Mass. 869 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 609, 611 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 947, 948 (1983). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Langelier, </em>136 Me. 320, 321 (1939). In any event, there was additional evidence. An emergency room nurse at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, who treated the victim, took swabs from the victim\u2019s rectal, as well as vaginal, area. Microscopic analysis revealed spermatozoa in the samples from the rectal area. Seminal fluid was also found on slides with samples from the rectal area and the anterior portion of the victim\u2019s underwear. There was fresh complaint testimony from the emergency room nurse \u2014 not received for substantive purposes \u2014 that the victim had told her that the assailant had first penetrated her vaginally and then flipped her over and penetrated her \u201cin her bottom.\u201d As to the propriety of that testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>V. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 657 (1992), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 523 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The motion for a required finding of not guilty on the count of unnatural rape was rightly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">2. <em>Admissibility of DNA evidence. </em>During the course of investigation of the rape and preparation of the case against Vega, the Commonwealth sent swatches with samples of the defendant\u2019s blood, rectal swabs from the victim, and samples of her clothes to Lifecodes Corporation in Valhalla, New York. Lifecodes\u2019 assignment was to analyze those samples to see if the DNA in the blood samples taken from Vega matched the DNA in the fluid samples swabbed from the victim and taken from her garments. Witnesses from Lifecodes were permitted to testify about the DNA identifying process in theory as well as the steps taken and conclusions reached on the basis of the samples studied in this case. Four probes or bands were studied and they matched. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the witnesses from Lifecodes testified that \u201cit\u2019s extremely unlikely that you would find anybody that would share [with some one else] bands on all four systems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Vega\u2019s trial occurred in late November, 1990. Earlier that year, in May, in another case,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a judge of the Superior Court had conducted a voir dire to determine whether the methodology as applied was accepted in the scientific community. See <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That judge had decided the evidence could be received and wrote a detailed memorandum articulating her reasons. On the strength of that memorandum, the trial judge in the instant case allowed the DNA comparison evidence offered by the government. That action was over a defense objection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the years following Vega\u2019s trial, the Supreme Judicial Court published a trilogy of cases dealing with DNA matching evidence: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218 (1991)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>413 Mass. 154 (1992); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347 (1993). The upshot of those cases was that while the underlying technique of DNA matching, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, was regarded as acceptable in the scientific community, see <em>Daggett </em>at 350 n.1, the methods of statistical analysis used to determine whether the DNA match might have been a random one were not so generally accepted and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>therefore, evidence of DNA testing was inadmissible. <em>Cumin, supra </em>at 227. <em>Daggett, supra </em>at 350. It follows that the evidence matching Vega\u2019s DNA with that found on the victim was wrongly admitted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although scientific evidence has the capacity to pack a potent evidentiary wallop, see <em>Curnin </em>at 219, it is open to a reviewing court to inquire whether the erroneously received evidence prejudiced the defendant\u2019s case; more particularly, whether \u201cthe error possibly weakened [the defendant\u2019s] case in some significant way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. at 352 n.5. We turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">3. <em>Prejudice to defendant from erroneous admission of DNA matching evidence. </em>The conventional evidence against Vega was formidable. He had first been observed by the victim when he accompanied Swasey to the Revere apartment. When, after leaving with Swasey, he returned alone, the victim recognized the man she later identified as the defendant as the person who had earlier accompanied Swasey. From the time she first saw the defendant until he left after the rape, an hour and a half had elapsed. Her exposure to the defendant was considerable, and it was daytime. An inquisitive and observant neighbor noticed the defendant arrive first with a woman, leave with her, then reappear and leave the Revere apartment at a time interval consistent with the rape. She observed the type of van the defendant arrived and left in each time he had come. Her description of that van, gray or faded powder blue and somewhat old, matched what the victim had described as the vehicle used by the defendant when he left after the assault. Indeed, the person the neighbor had observed had said \u201chello\u201d to her on his second visit. Both the victim and the neighbor independently identified the defendant from photo arrays. The victim made an in-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>identification at a probable cause hearing and at trial. During conversation with the victim preceding the sexual attack, the assailant had said he was employed as a carpet layer and had a brother who was in jail. That information was corroborated by a former coworker, James Moccio, called by the Commonwealth, and Vega\u2019s wife, who had been called by the defense. Both Moccia and Vega\u2019s wife testified that Vega owned a blue van.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In addition to this powerful web of evidence from percipient witnesses, the government offered evidence, through methods other than DNA matching, that semen recovered from the victim\u2019s slacks and underwear was consistent with having come from the defendant. The presentation of the DNA evidence, while hardly a minor episode in the trial \u2014 it consumed a day \u2014 ended in a far less dramatic fashion than in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. at 219, in which the jury were told that only \u201cone Caucasian in 59,000,000\u201d would have matching DNA. Rather, as we have observed, the jury were told, less compellingly, that a match was \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d In final argument, the prosecutor reviewed in some detail the evidence given by the victim, the neighbor, and Swasey, who had accompanied the defendant. The scientific evidence was underplayed. All that the prosecutor had to say about it was, \u201cyou also have all that scientific evidence which corroborates their identifications.\u201d As in <em>Daggett, </em>the conventional evidence is so powerful that the DNA evidence, particularly taking into account the manner in which it was soft-pedalled, did not weaken the defendant\u2019s case in any significant way. 416 Mass. 351 n.4, 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">4. <em>Successive sentences. </em>On the conviction of unnatural rape, i.e., the anal penetration, the judge imposed a sentence of from nineteen and one-half to twenty years at M.C.I., Cedar Junction. For the two counts of vaginal rape, the judge imposed a sentence of the same duration, to commence \u201cfrom and after\u201d the unnatural rape sentence. The judge, however, suspended the \u201cfrom and after\u201d sentence, subject to probation for ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The defendant contends that the judge erred in imposing successive sentences for offenses, which, however much they may be susceptible of separate identification, nonetheless occurred in the course of one criminal episode. The question was discussed \u2014 in the context of a quite different crime \u2014 in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 27-31 (1985). There the defendants had counterfeited a night deposit box, attached it to a bank, and helped themselves to the night\u2019s deposits, placed there by seven separate customers. The court held that the theft had been a single larcenous episode and that subjecting the defendants to trial and punishment for seven indictments \u2014 one for each depositor \u2014 was duplica-tive and, hence, unlawful. We are to consider \u201cthe realities of the offenses and the circumstances within which they occur.\u201d <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 677, 684 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 663 (1979). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1001, 1003 (1982), we described a second penetration of a rape victim during the same episode as a separate crime. Surely the victim must so experience it, especially when, as here, the acts differed in kind. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tarrant, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1020 (1982) (discrete robberies from the same victim during the course of one invasion of the building in which that victim lived). The realities of the multiple attacks on the victim warranted \u2014 although they did not require \u2014 multiple indictments and consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Our discussion of the foregoing points disposes of two other matters raised by the defendant\u2019s appeal, and we do not give them separate attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-17\"> Deoxyribonucleic acid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> That case was <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>later reviewed at 416 Mass. 347 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\"> See also the re-examination of that standard in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>113 S.
