Ruzicka. On July 2, 1991, the Department of Employment and Training (DET) found Ru-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>zicka to be ineligible within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 24(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for financial benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The plaintiff worked for Barry Wright Corporation until February 9, 1990, when he was separated from his employment. Upon termination, he received a single, lump sum payment equivalent to six months\u2019 wages, pursuant to an agreement with his employer. In addition, his medical and life insurance coverage was continued for the six-month period. When Ruzicka applied for unemployment benefits in March of 1990, DET determined that he was ineligible because the lump sum payment was continuation pay and thus remuneration under the provisions of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(r)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DET informed Ruzicka that, because the lump sum would be deemed to apply to that six-month period, he would not be eligible for benefits until August 11, 1990. The plaintiff does not contest this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Ruzicka became a self-employed consultant from May, 1990 until May, 1991. Because he was self-employed, he did not reapply for benefits in August, 1990. After he lost his consulting work in May, 1991, however, he reapplied for unemployment benefits on June 15, 1991. The base period for his new claim was determined to be June 10, 1990, through June 8, 1991.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This period included the last two months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>(June and July, 1990) of the time Ruzicka was deemed by DET to have received remuneration in the form of a lump sum payment from Barry Wright Corporation. DET denied the claim, reasoning that Ruzicka had not been \u201cpaid wages in the base period\u201d as required by G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 24(a). The plaintiff appealed from DET\u2019s decision to the District Court, which affirmed, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">This case turns on the interpretation of several sections of the Massachusetts Employment Security Law, G. L. c. 151 A, particularly, \u00a7\u00a7 1(f)(3), (1 )(\u25a0$), 24, and 31.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *At issue is the treatment, for purposes of unemployment benefit eligibility, of lump sum payments received at separation. In order to be eligible, Ruzicka must have earned wages within the statutory base period preceding his claim. The question is whether lump sum payments deemed remuneration by DET should count as \u201cwages earned\u201d for subsequent unemployment benefits claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Until 1992, DET distinguished between \u201cseverance pay,\u201d which was not considered remuneration, and \u201ccontinuation pay,\u201d which was.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The theoretical construct that underlies the treatment of \u201ccontinuation pay\u201d as remuneration, and that now underlies the treatment of all lump sums received at separation as remuneration, is one of a continuing employment relationship. The attribution of lump sums to periods after their receipt effectively satisfies DET\u2019s concern that, to limit eligibility, claimants ought to have a \u201cminimum level of earnings as a prerequisite.\u201d <em>Naples </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>412 Mass. 631, 634 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>If the individual is treated as still sufficiently connected with the employer so that he is not in \u201cunemployment\u201d by virtue of the receipt of \u201cremuneration,\u201d then he or she has demonstrated the sort of recent connection with the labor market for which the minimum earnings requirement is the test. DET\u2019s allocation of continuation pay (and severance pay as well, under the amended \u00a7 l[f][3]) to a period after its receipt treats it as, in effect, a private substitute for unemployment compensation. Once the period of allocation of the lump sum ends, however, the claimant is in the same position as any other newly unemployed worker, i.e., in need of the financial support of unemployment benefits. To refuse to treat a lump sum as wages constructively received during the base period frustrates the fundamental purpose of the statute and leaves workers who are now effectively newly unemployed without any benefits to support themselves and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">DET concedes, in the instant case, that continuation pay is included within the term \u201cwages\u201d under \u00a7 l(s)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but contends that it is to be treated, in a lump sum case, as all paid when it is received, regardless of whether DET deems it to be constructively received over a period of weeks under \u00a7 1(f)(3). The impact of this analysis on Ruzicka is that the continuation pay that he received in February, 1990, as a lump sum serves to disqualify him from receiving benefits for the six-month period immediately following his separation from his employer, yet, for the purposes of establishing a base period of earned wages, the continuation pay does not serve to establish monetary eligibility under \u00a7 24(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>result is perverse and results in an illogical scheme that could not have been intended by the Legislature when it enacted the relevant provisions of the Employment Security Law.* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 244 (1984) (adopting a \u201ccommon-sense interpretation\u201d of the relevant provisions rather than the \u201cdepartment\u2019s interpretation of its regulations [that] seems inconsistent with their terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We adopt an interpretation of the statute that harmonizes the statutory provisions and leads to a more just and equitable result.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We think that continuation pay should be treated as wages earned and paid during the period to which they are applied for the purposes of both \u00a7 l(r)(3) and \u00a7 24(a). Instead of being treated as paid at the time the lump sum is actually received (in this case, February, 1990), continuation pay would be spread over the \u201ccontinuation period.\u201d Such a construction is consistent with the principal statutory purpose of c. 151 A, which is to \u201clighten the burden which now falls on . . . unemployed worker[s] and [their] families].\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74, as amended by St. 1990, c. 177, \u00a7 340. See <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 351, 352 (1984). See also <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 242 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We conclude that DET committed an error of law in its interpretation and application of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 24(a). See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). Moreover, \u201cwe [are] led to the interpretation which we have given to the statute by considering the harsh and counterproductive result which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>follow from denying the claimant benefits.\u201d <em>Emerson, supra </em>at 353. Concomitantly, \u201cwe are guided by the principle that, \u2018[w]here the draftsmanship of a statute is faulty or lacks precision, it is our duty to give the statute a reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 622 (1983), quoting from <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Assn., </em>385 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1982). The impact of DET\u2019s interpretation is clear: had Ruzicka opted not to engage in self-employment, he would have been eligible to apply for unemployment benefits in August of 1990. Contrary to the assertions of DET, Ruzicka is not seeking to base his claim on ineligible self-employment. He merely seeks to be treated as if he had actually worked during the period from June 10 to August 11, 1990, consistent with DET\u2019s treatment of him on his first claim. \u201cThe effect [of DET\u2019s interpretation] is to reward the idle and punish the ambitious. We shall not lend judicial approval to this result.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We reverse the judgment affirming the denial of unemployment benefits to the plaintiff and remand the matter to the District Court for entry of a new judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 24, as amended through St. 1977, c. 720, \u00a7 26, provides in pertinent part, \u201cAn individual, in order to be eligible for benefits under this chapter, shall \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\u201c(a) Have been paid wages in the base period amounting to at least thirty times the weekly benefit rate, but not less than twelve hundred dollars . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\"> General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 1(f)(3), as appearing in St. 1957, c. 632, provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cRemuneration shall be deemed to have been received in such week or weeks in which it was earned or for such week or weeks, including any fractions thereof, to which it can reasonably be considered to apply.
