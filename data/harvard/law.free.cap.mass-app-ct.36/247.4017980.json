He brought suit against the rim manufacturer, Kelsey-Hayes Company, and the tire manufacturer, Uniroyal Tire Company, Inc., claiming breach of warranty in the design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>and manufacture of the tire and rim. The plaintiff also brought a claim under G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">After a twelve-day trial,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge submitted the breach of warranty claims to the jury upon special questions. The jury, finding the defendants liable for breach of warranty, awarded the plaintiff $500,000 in damages. The defendants appeal, claiming that upon the answers of the jury to one of the special questions (quoted below), the defendants were entitled to judgment as matter of law. The plaintiff cross-appeals from the judge\u2019s refusal to award c. 93A damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">1. <em>Correia affirmative defense to breach of warranty. </em>In response to special questions 1 though 7(b), the jury found that the defendants had breached their warranties of merchantability with respect to the design of the tire and the rim and that the defects had proxim\u00e1tely caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Of particular importance is question number seven:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">\u201c7. Which, if any, of the following was a substantial factor in causing the incident of October 16, 1984?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">a. Unfitness of the tire</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">b. Unfitness of the rim</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">c. Mr. Velleca\u2019s act or failure to act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">d. Other\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">In instructing the jury in regard to question 7(c), the judge added the following statements, see Mass.R.Civ.P 49(a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with regard to question 7(c): \u201cWith respect to Mr. Velleca\u2019s act or failure to act, that is when you\u2019re evaluating whether or not Mr. Velleca\u2019s act or failure to act was [a] factor, a substantial factor, what you have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>consider was whether or not Mr. Velleca knew of the existence of the danger and whether he understood and appreciated its magnitude, its seriousness, and whether he understood and appreciated its unreasonable character . . . With respect to (c), the defendant has the burden of persuading you.\u201d There was no objection to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The jury answered question 7(c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5in the affirmative, and the judge declined the defendants\u2019 motion to enter judgment for the defendants. The defendants argue that \u201cbecause the Court\u2019s charge to the jury on Special Question 7(c) clearly instructed the jurors to consider each element of the conscious misuse defense, the Court must assume that the jury found that the affirmative defense had been proven when it responded in the affirmative.\u201d By \u201cconscious misuse defense\u201d the defendants evidently intended to refer to <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">To bar warranty recovery by the plaintiff, the <em>Correia </em>doctrine<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> required a finding by the fact finder that Velleca \u201cunreasonably . . . use[d] a product which he [knew] to be defective and dangerous.\u201d See <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. at 355, 357. The difficulty here is that two essential elements of the doctrine were never given to the jury for their findings. First, we have emphasized that the defendant must prove <em>both </em>that the plaintiff knew of the product\u2019s defect <em>and </em>that he knew the danger created by the defect. <em>Goulet </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 310, 314 (1991) (\u201cThe jury must first determine whether the plaintiff knew that the machine was defective. Next, the jury must determine whether the user knew . . . that the defect . . . created a danger to the user\u201d). Knowledge that a product is dangerous, standing alone, is not enough. Without a defective product the defendant cannot be held liable, and without proof that the user knew of that defect and that the defect created a danger to himself, there is no basis for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>plying the <em>Correia </em>doctrine. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Chance Mfg. Co., </em>398 Mass. 32, 34 (1986). The judge\u2019s instructions failed to point out that the jury were obliged to determine whether the plaintiff <em>knew </em>that the product was defective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Second, the judge\u2019s instructions failed to inform the jury that if the jury determine that the plaintiff knew the tire and rim were defective and dangerous, the jury must also determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s use of the defective and dangerous products was unreasonable. <em>Correia </em>at 355, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendants argue that counsel and the judge intended question 7(c) to refer to the <em>Correia </em>doctrine. Even if so,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that understanding is of no importance; what matters is what the jury could reasonably understand from the special question and the instruction given them by the judge. As to that there is no doubt. Essential elements of the <em>Correia </em>doctrine were omitted, and the defendants failed to bring that fact to the judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Before the jury were discharged, counsel for the defendants brought to the judge\u2019s attention their argument that the jury\u2019s answer to question 7(c) was conclusively in their favor as to the <em>Correia </em>issue, and the jury\u2019s answer to question eight<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> presented an inconsistency. On that basis, the defendants moved \u201cto have the matter of the inconsistency between the answer to question 7(c) and the answer to question 8 recommitted to the jury.\u201d The motion was denied. The defendants did not demand that the judge submit to the jury the omitted questions: did the plaintiff <em>know </em>that the tire and rim (which the jury had found were \u201cunfit\u201d) were defective as well as dangerous? And did the plaintiff, knowing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>defective and dangerous conditions of the tire and rim, unreasonably use such products?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Massachusetts R.Civ.P 49(a) provides that when special questions are submitted to a jury, and a question of fact is omitted, and the jury has been discharged, the right to trial by jury as to such issue is waived. The trial judge may make a finding on that issue, failing which the court \u201cshall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.\u201d Since the judge entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, he is deemed to have made either (or both) of the omitted findings in accordance with the judgment \u2014 that the plaintiff did not know that the products were defective, and that the plaintiff did not use the two products unreasonably. Since those findings were not clearly erroneous the judgment must stand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same principles were applied in <em>Hawco </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>398 Mass. 1006 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">2. <em>General Laws c. 93A liability. </em>The judge found, contrary to the jury\u2019s findings, that the plaintiff failed to prove that the tire and rim introduced in evidence were those involved in the accident. He also concluded that the sole cause of the accident was the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmishandling of the tire, the rim, and equipment he was using in his attempt to put the tire on the rim.\u201d These findings, although inconsistent with those found by the jury, are not clearly erroneous and must stand. See <em>Chamberlayne Sch. &amp; Chamberlayne Jr. College </em>v. <em>Banker, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 354-355 (1991); <em>Wyler </em>v. <em>Bonnell Motors, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 567 (1993). The plaintiff\u2019s contrary arguments, which we have reviewed, have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-13\"> The entire transcript of the trial is not before us. The appendix consists of selected portions of the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-15\"> We view the special questions in light of the judge\u2019s instructions. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 802 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> The jury also answered 7(a) and (b) in the affirmative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\"> In <em>Colter </em>v. <em>Barber-Greene Co., </em>403 Mass. 50, 60 n.12 (1988), the court described the holding in <em>Correia </em>as \u201cthe <em>Correia </em>doctrine or the doctrine of unreasonable use.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\"> Whether the products were defective is not at issue; the jury so found in answer to the previous special questions. The issues at hand are whether the plaintiff was aware of the defect, and whether, knowing of the defect and the danger, he unreasonably used the products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> It is not clear what was intended. Neither the verdict slips nor the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury pointed out that if the jury answered question 7(c) in the affirmative they need not answer question 9 regarding the plaintiff\u2019s damages, and the defendants did not object to the judge\u2019s failure to give such an instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\"> Question 8 inquired whether the plaintiff\u2019s act or failure to act was \u201cthe only cause of the incident.\u201d The jury replied, \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> The result we reach is the same as that implicit in the jury\u2019s finding of damages: that the defendants had not succeeded in their defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
