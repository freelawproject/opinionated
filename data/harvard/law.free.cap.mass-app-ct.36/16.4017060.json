L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof was insufficient. The plaintiffs appeal from judgments of dismissal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which were entered in the Superior Court after they failed to file the requisite bond.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issues raised are (1) whether the offer of proof was sufficient and (2) whether the tribunal erred in admitting certain evidence offered by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof consisted of an opinion letter and statement of qualifications of an expert, discharge summaries and operation reports of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMMC) for admissions of Harriet K. Booth (Booth) on April 14, 1988, and May 11, 1988, and two letters dated November 8, 1988, and November 28, 1989, from a physician who treated Booth after the events that are the subject of her action. These submissions establish the following factual background. Booth was admitted to UMMC on April 14, 1988, for the repair of an incisional scar that was associated with earlier abdominal surgery. The defendant Dr. Silva performed the repair on April 15, 1988, and the defendant Visiting Nurses Association (VNA) attended to Booth after April 21, 1988, the date of her discharge. Subsequent to the operation, Booth developed a wound infection, and she was readmitted to UMMC on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>11, 1988, where Dr. Silva performed a second operation to explore and debride her abdominal wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 expert wrote that Dr. Silva \u201cdeparted from the standard of medical care by failing to observe the onset of [Booth\u2019s] abdominal wound infection while the patient was in the hospital [in April], even though the signs of a wound with unexplained drainage [were] present from the day before discharge. . . .\u201d He further stated that Dr. Silva \u201chad every reason to follow the patient and her infection personally in his office during the interim between 4/24/88 and 5/11/88 when she came back in hospital with a relatively extensive wound infection.\u201d In arriving at these opinions, the expert relied on the following information which he set forth in his letter but which was not otherwise contained in the offer of proof: while Booth was in the hospital \u201ca house officer\u201d was concerned enough about her infection to order a culture on April 20, 1988,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to put her on \u201can inappropriate antibiotic\u201d; that the records do not indicate that Dr. Silva informed himself or was informed about the results of the culture; there is no indication in the UMMC records of any progress notes by Dr. Silva and that, therefore, there is \u201cnothing which indicates he saw the wound after the [April] surgery\u201d; \u201c[t]here is no information to suggest Dr. Silva inquired of the V.N.A. nurses how the patient, who was his medical responsibility was faring under their care.\u201d The expert also noted that Dr. Silva\u2019s failure to exercise \u201ctimely and proper medical responsibility\u201d permitted the infection to \u201cprogress to an unnecessarily extensive degree\u201d with attendant damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The expert also stated that the Commonwealth, acting through UMMC, \u201cdeparted very significantly from the standard of care\u201d by not bringing the report of the wound culture to the attention of Dr. Silva. He further wrote, \u201cThere is every indication that the report was put on the record after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the patient had gone home and never brought to a responsible medical person\u2019s attention.\u201d With respect to VNA, he opined that its nurses departed significantly from the applicable \u201cstandard of expected nursing care by not reporting the obvious clinical progress noted in their records<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of this patient\u2019s wound infection, to the responsible medical person, Dr. Wayne Silva\u201d and that these departures from the applicable standards of care caused harm to Booth. Neither the culture report nor the nurses\u2019 records to which the expert alluded are contained in the offer of proof. During the hearing, the tribunal, at the request of counsel for Dr. Silva, agreed to consider records of Booth\u2019s visits to a UMMC clinic on April 25, 1988, and May 9, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The only independent support in the offer of proof for any of the statements made by the expert are contained in the UMMC records and consisted of the following. (1) According to the discharge report dated April 21, 1988, Booth, on her fifth post-operative day, \u201cwas noted to have a little bit of bloody discharge in the midpoint of her incision.\u201d (2) The May 17, 1988, discharge summary indicated that Booth\u2019s \u201cpost-operative course . . . was complicated by a wound infection which was treated with antibiotics and home dressing changes.\u201d (3) Dr. Silva\u2019s May 11, 1988, report states that the patient \u201cat home [after her April 21, 1988, discharge] developed a pocket beneath her wound closure which eventually opened.\u201d The sole mention of VNA in the offer of proof, other than in the expert\u2019s letter, was a statement in the UMMC discharge summary that the patient \u201cwas discharged on 4/21/88 with VNA for dressing changes. . . .\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer\u2019s oral presentation at the tribunal hearing was confined to a review of the expert\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the offer of proof. </em>The controlling statute establishes the essential inquiry for a medical malpractice tribunal \u2014 whether \u201cthe evidence presented if properly substantiated is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry or whether the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>case is merely an unfortunate medical result.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, as inserted by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5. Beyond that, the statute offers a tribunal little guidance other than to indicate that \u201c[a]dmissible evidence shall include, but not be limited to, hospital and medical records, nurses\u2019 notes, x-rays and other records kept in the usual course . . ., statements of fact or opinion on a subject contained in a published treatise, periodical, book or pamphlet or statements by experts without the necessity of such experts appearing at [the] hearing.\u201d Appellate decisions have fleshed out the applicable standard by establishing that \u201cthe tribunal\u2019s task should be compared ... to the trial judge\u2019s function in ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 578 (1978). Under that directed verdict test, \u201c[a] plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof as to negligence will prevail before a malpractice tribunal ... (1) if a doctor-patient relationship is shown, (2) if there is evidence that the doctor\u2019s performance did not conform to good medical practice, and (3) if damage resulted therefrom.\u201d <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980). The same standard applies to any \u201cprovider of health care\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 60B.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">No issue is raised whether the requisite patient-health care provider relationship existed between Booth and the defendants or whether she suffered damage from their alleged negligence. We deal, therefore, only with the question whether the offer of proof sufficiently established the existence of \u201cevidence\u201d that the several defendants did not conform to good medical practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">An acceptable offer of proof must comprise more than mere conclusory allegations or statements of counsel. <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. 464, 467-468 (1980). <em>Kulas </em>v. <em>Weeber, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 983, 984 (1985). The statement of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert in this case goes well beyond allegation. He supports his contention that Dr. Silva failed adequately to follow and attend to his patient by reference to particularized evidence of the presence of infection while Booth was hospitalized and to an absence of records demonstrating that Dr. Silva saw the wound after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>surgery, informed himself of the results of the culture, or made proper inquiry of the visiting nurses. He buttresses his opinion of substandard conduct of UMMC by stating that the culture report was not brought to the attention of a responsible medical person, and he specifically faults VNA for not reporting \u201cclinical progress\u201d noted in their records.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The defendants correctly point out that, with respect to UMMC and VNA, there is no factual evidence in the offer of proof outside of that recited in the expert\u2019s statement to support his conclusions. They contend that the offer of proof therefore falls short. Although the question is a close one, we disagree. Whether there must be evidence in the offer of proof extrinsic to and supportive of the opinion of the expert has not been addressed squarely by our appellate decisions, and, while there are intimations to the contrary,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we conclude that, in light of the words of the statute, its purpose, and the current evidential requirements for admission of expert opinion, such extrinsic factual showing is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The disjunctive listing of various forms of \u201cadmissible evidence\u201d in \u00a7 60B includes the category of \u201cstatements by experts.\u201d A strict reading, coupled with the observation that such admissible evidence awaits proper substantiation not before the tribunal but \u201cat trial,\u201d <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. at 467-468, indicates that a factually based statement by a qualified expert, without more, is sufficient to meet the tribunal standard. The terms of the statute do not signal a difference between the substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tiation requirement for an expert\u2019s opinion and the other admissible forms of tribunal evidence. Nor is our conclusion avoided by treating the issue as involving not substantiation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but rather foundational basis, since, even at trial, the traditional rule has been changed so that an expert may base his opinion upon knowledge of facts not in evidence so long as such facts are independently admissible. <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986) (\u201cSuch . . . change . . . eliminate [s] the necessity of producing exhibits and witnesses whose sole function is to construct a proper foundation for the expert\u2019s opinion\u201d). Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 7.10.2, at 414-415 (6th ed. 1994). To the extent that a tribunal rejects an offer of proof on the basis that an expert formed his opinion on facts which do not appear in the medical record, it engages \u201cin an appraisal of the weight and credibility of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, an exercise not permitted to a malpractice tribunal.\u201d <em>DiNozzi </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 973, 974 (1985), citing <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. at 468. Moreover, \u201callowance should be made for the fact that the hearing before the tribunal ordinarily precedes discovery. In particular, inadequacies in defendants\u2019 records should not disadvantage the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201cThe apparent [legislative] purpose [for enactment of \u00a7 60B] was to discourage frivolous claims whose defense would tend to increase premium charges for medical malpractice insurance. . . .\u201d <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 655 n.4 (1977). <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>Gardner Pierce Nursing &amp; Rest Home, Inc., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 639, 641 (1980). That objective would be ill-served by tribunal rejection of the opinions of assumedly qualified experts, generally presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>by counsel operating under the ethical strictures of Mass.R.Civ.P. 11(a), 365 Mass. 753 (1974), merely because the factual assertions expressed in those opinions are not corroborated by other submissions in the offer of proof. Not only would such demanding threshold testing increase the likelihood of meritorious actions being screened out along with frivolous claims, it also would run counter to the course of developing appellate lenity toward \u00a7 60B offers of proof. See <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Avedikian, </em>412 Mass. 481, 483-484 (1992) (the imprinting and signing of the abbreviation \u201cD.M.D.\u201d after the expert\u2019s name on an opinion letter typed on the letterhead of a professional association \u201cmet the \u2018extremely lenient\u2019 standard of establishing an expert\u2019s qualifications before a medical malpractice tribunal\u201d); <em>Mataitis </em>v. <em>St. Goar, </em>416 Mass. 325, 327 (1993) (\u201ca plaintiff\u2019s presentation to a tribunal need not state, what a defendant physician should have done when that presentation adequately states that the defendant negligently failed to act and that the plaintiff was harmed as a result\u201d); <em>Kilmartin </em>v. <em>Lowell Gen. Hosp., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (1986) (indicating that an offer of proof ought to be given a \u201cpermissibly indulgent reading\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">2. <em>The defendants\u2019 evidence. </em>When the tribunal, at the defendants\u2019 request, received in evidence the records of two clinic visits by Booth, it acted well within its statutory authority to \u201csummon or subpoena [admissible evidence or experts] to substantiate or clarify any evidence which has been presented before it . . . .\u201d Those records reveal that Booth\u2019s infection was treated during a clinic visit with Dr. Silva or his associate on April 25, 1988, four days after her discharge from the hospital, and again on May 9, 1988. At its best, this information does not address those aspects of the expert\u2019s opinion that allege substandard treatment in the course of Booth\u2019s hospitalization and while at home prior to April 25, 1988, and the plaintiffs still have a sufficient offer of proof. Moreover, given the directed verdict standard, we doubt whether evidence additional to that contained in the offer of proof may be used by the tribunal to diminish the offer. Compare <em>Kopycinski </em>v. <em>Aserkoff, </em>410 Mass. 410, 418 (1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>(\u201cAny factual dispute as to the \u2018meaning\u2019 of the record [before a medical malpractice tribunal] is for the jury\u201d); <em>Kilmartin </em>v. <em>Lowell Gen. Hosp., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 902 (\u201cThe weight to be accorded [an expert\u2019s] opinion in relation to contrary evidence belongs at a later stage of proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Accordingly, the judgments of dismissal are vacated, and the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is to be reinstated. The determination of the tribunal as to each defendant is to be replaced by a decision that the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof, if properly substantiated, is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-11\"> Separate judgments were entered on motions filed pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b49-12\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 60B, as amended by St. 1986, c. 351, \u00a7 21, states in pertinent part: \u201cIf a finding is made for the defendant or defendants in the case the plaintiff may pursue the claim through the usual judicial process only upon filing bond in the amount of six thousand dollars in the aggregate ....
