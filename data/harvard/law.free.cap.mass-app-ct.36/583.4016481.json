Christopher McCaffrey of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d with his daughter, a child under the age of sixteen. We agree with McCaffrey that the testimony of the fresh complaint witness (the child\u2019s mother and McCaffrey\u2019s estranged wife) exceeded the permissible bounds of such testimony, to his prejudice, and accordingly reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The child, Erin (a pseudonym), who was five years old at the time of trial, testified on direct examination that, when she was two, McCaffrey had inserted his finger into her vagina. On cross-examination, Erin admitted that this had happened only once. When Erin\u2019s mother was next called as a fresh complaint witness, McCaffrey moved at sidebar for a voir dire of her proposed testimony, on the ground that it would include improper details beyond those testified to by Erin. The trial judge denied his motion. The prosecutor then alerted the judge that Erin had earlier disclosed more information to her mother than she had disclosed in her testimony \u2014 including a charge of fellatio \u2014 and that the prosecutor was concerned about whether she should ask the mother about such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The judge professed an awareness that fresh complaint evidence is not to be used in any substantive, but only a corroborative manner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 396 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 446 (1991). He nonetheless instructed the prosecutor that everything Erin had revealed to her mother should be presented to the jury, stating that he regarded the additional disclosures as \u201ca material thing that the jury ought to evaluate as to whether or not that, in fact, occurred,\u201d and further observing that he did not \u201cwant any [of the mother\u2019s] testimony truncated in any way . . . [because] [t] his is an inquiry into the truth and we\u2019re entitled to know what happened.\u201d He also announced that he would be giving an appropriate limiting instruction regarding fresh complaint testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Erin\u2019s mother proceeded to testify that in October, 1989, Erin told her that \u201cher father had put his weenie in her mouth and that it tasted yucky.\u201d Immediately after the mother made this statement, the judge asked her to repeat it. After doing so, the mother went on to testify that in March, 1990, Erin had told her that \u201cher daddy had poked\u201d her private parts. Asked by her mother at that time to show what she meant, Erin \u201ctook her index finger of her right hand, put it into her underwear and into her vagina.\u201d Following the mother\u2019s direct testimony, the judge instructed the jury specially on fresh complaint evidence, instructions which he later repeated in his general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On appeal the Commonwealth has conceded, as it must, that the mother\u2019s testimony regarding the October, 1989, \u201cweenie\u201d incident exceeded the proper limits of fresh complaint.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth contends, however, that any er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ror was harmless because the testimony \u201cdid not fill gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case,\u201d and because any risk of prejudice to McCaffrey was \u201cameliorated\u201d and \u201cminimized\u201d by the judge\u2019s reiterated fresh complaint instructions (the propriety of which McCaffrey does not challenge). We are not persuaded by this \u201charmless error\u201d argument. The formulaic and unelaborated contention that the mother\u2019s superfluous testimony did not \u201cfill gaps\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s case is subverted by the Commonwealth\u2019s acknowledgement that the testimony introduced new substantive detail and did extend beyond mere corroboration. The prohibition against gap filling simply reflects the fundamental premise that fresh complaint testimony can be utilized for corroborative purposes only and not as substantive evidence of the elements of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Although curative instructions <em>\u201cusually </em>render [ ] any error in the introduction of prejudicial evidence harmless,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jackson, 384 Mass. 572, 579 (1981) (emphasis added), we do not think that those given in this case sufficiently dissipated the prejudice to McCaffrey that inevitably flowed from the revelation of the October, 1989, incident \u2014 an encounter involving an alleged act that might well have been contemplated by a jury of ordinary sensibilities as not only \u201cunnatural\u201d but as a revolting if not monstrous exploitation of a vulnerable infant. The judge\u2019s instructions were neither as \u201cforceful\u201d nor as \u201cclear\u201d as the Commonwealth suggests. Despite stating that the mother\u2019s testimony was corroborative only and that the central concern for the jury in connection with the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt was Erin\u2019s testimony, the judge delivered fresh complaint instructions that were essentially \u201cstandard,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sevieri, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 745, 754 (1986), and \u201cboilerplate,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallego, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 720 (1989), without an explicit definition of the term or explanation of the function of corroboration. Cf. <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 660 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 674 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Rather than providing \u201cexplicit warnings\u201d to the jury, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallego, supra </em>at 720, that addressed the specific problem created by the mother\u2019s excess testimony, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 271 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 296 (1990), the judge may have exacerbated the problem. He effectively focused the jury\u2019s attention directly on the October, 1989, incident by telling them several times that they could consider \u201cany statements\u201d that Erin made in determining her credibility; and in that connection they could consider statements attributed to Erin by her mother. It is not difficult to envision the jury\u2019s perplexity, in attempting to distinguish between what Erin had said while testifying and what her mother had testified she said, after the judge concluded the charge by stressing that \u201cessentially this case boils down to what [Erin] said actually occurred and your determination of her credibility.\u201d Instructions that are ambiguous or tend to create jury confusion on critical issues cannot be deemed sufficiently curative, at least where the error requiring mitigation created a substantial risk of prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Tin<em>gley, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 706, 711-712 (1992). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 508-511 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. at 674; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, 417 </em>Mass. at 271-272; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 539-540 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We have no doubt that the error (to which McCaffrey strenuously objected) entailed serious potential prejudice to the defense. Erin testified to only one incident of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d involving digital penetration. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 444, 446, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracino, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 787, 791-792 (1993) (multiple episodes of sexual assault testified to). The Commonwealth\u2019s case proving that one event was far from overwhelming. It turned entirely on Erin\u2019s credibility \u2014 an issue that the jury were expressly directed to evaluate by reference to the mother\u2019s testimony regarding the distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>and distinctly more disturbing October, 1989, indecent act. That testimony was the very first accusation against the defendant that the jury heard the mother make on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The putative actuality of the fellatio accusation was immediately enhanced, at the judge\u2019s insistence, by the mother\u2019s repetition of her testimony. Such testimonial charges of sexual molestation of a child are recognized as being inherently \u201cinflammatory.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. at 506; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 352-353 (1994). Having been twice described in testimony, the imputation was thrice indirectly referred to in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument as being included in Erin\u2019s \u201callegations\u201d against her father. As she concluded her summation, the prosecutor specifically asked the jury to remember Erin\u2019s striking response to her molestation \u2014 \u201cyucky\u201d \u2014 the very description which Erin was alleged by her mother to have given of her reaction to the October, 1989, oral penetration incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Examining the error, as we must, in the context of the whole trial, we find \u201cnothing in the fresh complaint instructions or the charge in its entirety which provides us with a reliable basis for concluding that the risk [that the jury may have relied in its deliberations on the inadmissible reference to the separate act of sexual molestation mentioned by the fresh complaint witness but not the victim] was somehow ameliorated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tingley, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 711. Even had the instructions been technically correct, we would nonetheless be presented with one of the rare situations in which \u201cthe risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow [even proper] instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 548 (1971). Such a risk obtains \u201c[particularly in sexual assault cases [where] the extraneous evidence may have a gripping quality and asking the jury to disregard it may be tantamount to asking the jury to ignore that an elephant has walked through the jury box.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>34 Mass. App. Ct. 676, 680 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>417 Mass. 348 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">McCaffrey\u2019s jury, however, were instructed not to disregard but rather to consider carefully the erroneously included evidence, which implicated the central issue in the case and which the prosecutor effectively kept before the jury. Here, the unignorable was more akin to a herd of elephants indelibly trampling that evidence into the jurors\u2019 collective consciousness. In these circumstances, we \u201ccannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the [jury\u2019s] judgment was not substantially swayed by the error . . . [and] that the judge\u2019s error in admitting the improper testimony was not prejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. at 353. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirouac, </em>405 Mass. 557, 565 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>417 Mass. at 271-272; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tingley, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 711-712.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">McCaffrey\u2019s remaining assignments of error require little discussion, except for one that may arise at any retrial. He argues (for the first time on appeal) that Erin was never formally sworn at trial; that her testimony was, therefore, inadmissible; and accordingly, that he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty (even though his motion for such a finding did not mention this supposed defect). His contention falls short of demonstrating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967). The record of the judge\u2019s inquiries of and directions to Erin regarding telling the truth support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>judge\u2019s discretionary conclusion that the child understood the difference between the truth and lying and the importance of testifying truthfully.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *The judge\u2019s exchanges with the child witness effectively served the underlying purpose of the oath, and no more could be reasonably required of an infant deemed competent to testify, but manifestly lacking in theological understanding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatisos, </em>238 Mass. 322, 325-326 (1921); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. 325, 329 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>400 Mass. 534, 542-543 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rockwood, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1137, 1138 (1989); 6 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1827 (2)(Chadbourn ed. 1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">McCaffrey\u2019s complaint that his cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert was prejudicially impaired because of the denial of his request for pretrial disclosure of the expert testimony is also belied by the record. McCaffrey\u2019s counsel had over four months to review all of the expert\u2019s office notes and treatment records relating to Erin and was made aware of the expert\u2019s name, address, and status as a potential expert witness at least three weeks prior to trial. Nothing has been presented, beyond conclusory assertion, indicating the inadequacy of that lead time for preparation of effective cross-examination. No continuance to prepare cross-examination was sought. No funds for retainer of a rival expert were requested. No prejudice has been shown. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 630-631 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">McCaffrey\u2019s final claim is that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert was allowed to invade the province of the jury by providing testimony that had the effect of bolstering Erin\u2019s credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He has raised a troublesome issue. The witness (a psychologist and expert in the area of sexual abuse of children) first testified that she counseled sexually abused children and that such children exhibit certain general behavioral characteristics. She then was permitted to testify, over McCaffrey\u2019s objections, that Erin was currently her patient; that she had been treating Erin for about a year; that at the beginning of the therapy Erin had revealed that she had be\u00e9n sexually abused by her father; and that Erin had been placed in therapy groups for sexually abused children. The expert further described Erin\u2019s conduct during the early course of treatment in terms that the jury could not have failed to note resembled the behavior the expert had earlier testified to as characteristic of sexually abused children.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">It is settled that an expert may not \u201coffer his [or her] opinion on issues that the jury are equally competent to assess, such as credibility of witnesses. On such questions, the influence of an expert\u2019s opinion may threaten the independence of the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982) (citations omitted). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. at 504. There appears to be particular risk of undue influence when an expert\u2019s testimony can be construed as impliedly supporting the truthfulness of a victim in sexual abuse prosecutions. \u201cAs is often the case where there are charges of rape or sexual assault, the question of guilt or innocence rests in large part \u2018upon whether the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>believed the victim\u2019s version of what happened or the defendant [\u2019s].\u201d\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendrala, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402 (1985), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 667 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We have previously acknowledged this risk by admonishing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cIn offering an expert who would testify about the \u2018general characteristics\u2019 [of child victims of sexual abuse], the Commonwealth must take care not to lead the expert to trespass unduly on the jury\u2019s province to assess the credibility of witnesses, in particular the child as witness .... [T] he prosecution [must] . . . steer the expert clear of the question of the truthfulness of the particular child and in that connection to avoid involvement in the question whether the particular child was in fact abused or whether her behavior did or did not in fact conform to the \u2018general characteristics.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 827, 832-833 &amp; n.6 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 628 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, ante </em>433, 444-445 (1994). Allowing the psychologist here to testify as both behavioral expert and treating therapist may well have approached too closely the forbidden issue of the victim\u2019s credibility. The fact that she had accepted Erin as a patient to be treated as a sexually abused child could easily give rise to the jury\u2019s inference that she had accepted Erin\u2019s allegations against her father as true and was providing her professional services as a result, thereby endorsing Erin\u2019s credibility as a victim of parental sexual molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Without deciding the issue whether the behavioral expert\u2019s testimony in her dual role<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as Erin\u2019s therapist was itself error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>requiring reversal,* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we urge the Commonwealth in any retrial to pay careful heed to the teachings of <em>Dockham </em>and <em>O\u2019Brien </em>by utilizing sexual abuse experts who have no connection with and make no references to the child victim or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>her family, lest the very real prospect of prejudicial error invalidate the proceeding. The verdict is set aside, the conviction is reversed, and the case is to stand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> Since the trial of this case, we have declared that when there is forewarning that proposed fresh complaint witnesses may describe alleged sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ual offenses by the defendant not testified to by the victim, \u201cit is better to conduct a voir dire examination of the witness so that the judge may prune out extraneous matter before the jury hears it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 676, 680 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>417 Mass. 348 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> Hearsay evidence that the victim seasonably made an out-of-court complaint to a witness after a sexual assault has, despite misgivings, been held admissible as part of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, not only regarding the fact that the complaint was made, but also extending to the details of the complaint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 657 (1992). Courts have \u201cnever insisted that fresh complaint testimony be sanitized to match exactly the testimony of the complaining witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 670 (1992). It is equally established that fresh complaint witnesses \u201cmay not testify to details which add substantively to the complainant\u2019s account.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 446 (1991). \u201c[G]nly those details to which the victim has testified generally at trial are admissible as corroboration by way of evidence of a prior fresh complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. at 659 n.8. \u201c[T]he acts about which the [fresh complaint] witness testifies . . . must have been testified to by the complainant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 351 (1994). \u201c[W]here a [fresh complaint] witness testifies regarding details of an event that the witness has not testified to more generally, we have stated that such testimony is not permissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. at 670.

Erin\u2019s testimony was limited to one incident involving the defendant\u2019s inserting his finger into her vagina. The mother\u2019s testimony that Erin told her the defendant had inserted his penis into Erin\u2019s mouth reflected an entirely distinct, noncumulative event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that did not corroborate Erin nor constitute merely elaborative details of her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\"> Compare as to the issue of prejudice <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. at 659-660 (\u201cprejudice is self-evident when [the victim\u2019s] version of an incident is allowed to be repeated again and again,\u201d as in effect occurred here with repeated direct and indirect references to the oral penetration allegation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. at 505-506 (admission of victim\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s prior \u201cbad acts\u201d of sexual molestation of children other than the sexual offense charged in the indictment held prejudicial error; it \u201cdiverts the attention of the jury from the [crime] immediately before it; and by showing the defendant to have been a knave on other occasions, creates a prejudice which may cause injustice to be done him\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> The judge twice asked Erin to \u201cagree that when you testify now, you\u2019ll swear to tell us the truth.\u201d The child affirmatively responded both times and indicated that she realized that her failure to tell the truth would result in punishment.

He has, however, shown us nothing that demonstrates any abuse of the trial judge\u2019s wide discretion with respect to the admission of expert testimony generally, including evaluating the qualifications of proposed experts, and the use of expert testimony regarding the behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children specifically.
