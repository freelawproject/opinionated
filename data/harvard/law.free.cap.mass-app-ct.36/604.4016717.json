L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, after a trial, without jury, in the District Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">The evidence supporting the conviction consisted essentially of the testimony of two police officers who stated that upon arriving at the apartment of Wanda Quiles within a minute of receiving a radio transmission, \u201c[s]he appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>be very upset. Her entire face was wet with tears,\u201d and \u201c[s]he was hysterical, crying; very, very emotional, upset, . . . and very nervous.\u201d The police officers testified that Quiles was alone in the apartment and told them that she was upset because she and the defendant \u201cwere just involved in an argument,\u201d which occurred \u201cjust before our arrival [at] her apartment.\u201d They also testified, over objection, that she told them that the defendant hit and bit her in the course of their argument. The police officers testified to observing bite marks on Quiles\u2019s body which generally were consistent with her description of what had happened. The officers also testified that she said several kitchen chairs had fallen in the course of the fight, and one of the officers testified to seeing chairs tipped over and \u201cother things thrown about\u201d in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Called by the prosecution, Ms. Quiles denied that the defendant had bitten her, claimed that she had arranged to have a friend staying at her house bite her \u201c[b]efore the cops came,\u201d and essentially otherwise invoked her rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution with respect to all other questions. Before proceeding with his case, the defendant unsuccessfully moved for a dismissal on the ground that he was effectively denied his right of cross-examination. His motions for a required finding of not guilty made at the close of the prosecution\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s cases were also denied. The defendant essentially argues that Quiles\u2019s out-of-court statements were erroneously admitted in evidence and that he was denied his constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Given the officers\u2019 observations of the physical disarray in the apartment, Quiles\u2019s excited emotional state, the bite marks on her body, her statement that the confrontation with the defendant had \u201cjust\u201d occurred, and the brief lapse of time between the officers\u2019 being called and arriving at the apartment, it was well within the judge\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to admit Quiles\u2019s out-of-court statements under the spontaneous exclamation exception<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the hearsay rule. <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 285 (1990). \u201cFor the purpose of the . . . exception ... an utterance is spontaneous if it is made under the influence of an exciting event and before the declarant has had time to contrive or fabricate the remark, and thus it has sufficient indicia of reliability. . . . The spontaneous utterance must qualify, characterize, and explain the underlying event that prompted the excited utterance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fuller, 399 Mass. 678 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>413 Mass. 693 (1992). Here, Quiles\u2019s statements clearly spoke to and described the events that prompted them, and there was ample evidence of their spontaneity.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims that the out-of-court statements should not have been admitted since there was no evidence of their spontaneity independent of the statements themselves. This argument ignores the independent evidence of spontaneity in the form of the police officers\u2019 response time and their observations of Quiles\u2019s excited state, the bite marks, and the disarray within the apartment. It also runs counter to the principle underlying the analogous, \u201cgenerally prevailing practice\u201d under which \u201cthe statement itself is taken as sufficient proof of the exciting event.\u201d 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 217-218 (4th ed. 1992). Contrast <em>People </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>433 Mich. 268 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The defendant also contends that he was deprived of his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by Quiles\u2019s reliance on her Fifth Amendment rights. \u201c [Exceptions to the hearsay rule, including . . . spontaneous exclamations ... are part of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>law.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>406 Mass. 1201, 1213 (1989). Notwithstanding the importance of cross-examination in our jurisprudence, \u201cwhere proffered hearsay has sufficient guarantees of reliability to come within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 356 (1992). Moreover, the technical unavailability of Quiles established by her invocation of her Fifth Amendment rights effectively satisfied Sixth Amendment requirements. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65-66 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 740-749 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, </em>397 Mass. 633, 636-638 (1986). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass. 534, 545 (1988). <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1210-1211. It is also significant that the defendant, in his limited cross-examination, was able to elicit testimony from Quiles that she was angry at the defendant on the day that she had spoken to the police officers and that she had not been bitten by the defendant but rather by an accommodating friend. Further cross-examination was unlikely to be more impeaching. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283 (1979), is misplaced since that decision merely would have supported the allowance of a motion to strike \u201c[s]ome or all of the direct testimony\u201d of Quiles based upon her invocation of her constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 292-293. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirouac, </em>405 Mass. 557, 562 &amp; n.5 (1989). Such striking would not reach the out-of-court statements related by the police officers. In view of our decision as to their admissibility, those statements comprise evidence sufficient to withstand the defendant\u2019s motions for a required finding of not guilty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> The general exception involves a statement variously described as a spontaneous declaration, spontaneous utterance, and excited utterance.
