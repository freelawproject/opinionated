See <em>Northmeadow Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Northeastern Fire Ins. Co. of Pa., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 329, 331 &amp; n.2 (1988), and cases cited. See also <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. 606, 612 (1987). The void can likely be blamed on the boiler plate parlance contained in most insurance contracts, which fails to address the question whether \u201cexcess\u201d insurance \u201cdrops down\u201d to the next lowest level of liability when underlying insurers become insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On December 19, 1985, John W. MacNeill was felled by a hydraulic liftgate attached to the rear of a truck he was planning to drive. As a result, MacNeill became paraplegic and brought a tort action in the Superior Court in 1987. His wife, Annis MacNeill, joined in the action with a loss of consortium claim. The truck was owned by Metropolitan Leasing, Inc. (Metropolitan), and leased to Casey and Hayes, Inc. (Casey), both named as defendants in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">At the time of the accident Metropolitan and Casey were insured under three general liability policies: first, a primary policy issued by Liberty Mutual (Liberty) with limits of $1,000,000; second, an umbrella or excess policy issued by Integrity Insurance Company (Integrity) with coverage between $1,000,000 and $11,000,000; and third, an excess insurance policy issued by Pacific Employers Insurance Company (Pacific) for the layer of liability between $11,000,000 and $21,000,000. While the underlying case against Metropolitan and Casey was pending, the second-level excess insurer, Integrity, became insolvent, opening the question whether Pacific\u2019s third-level excess coverage \u201cdrops down,\u201d i.e., provides coverage for Metropolitan and Casey in the event the base policy of $1,000,000 becomes inadequate to cover their potential exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Metropolitan and Casey brought a declaratory judgment action (G. L. c. 231 A) to establish the liability of the third-level carrier, Pacific. Cross motions for summary judgment were filed in October 1991. After a hearing, in January 1992, a Superior Court judge determined that language in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Pacific\u2019s policy created an ambiguity along the lines of the policy analyzed in <em>Northmeadow, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 332-333. On that construction of the language, she concluded coverage \u201cdropped down\u201d and that Pacific was required to indemnify Metropolitan and Casey for any judgment against them in favor of the MacNeills.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">However, the last judicial words on the subject had not been written. Shortly after the judge\u2019s decision in the instant case, the Supreme Judicial Court, in <em>Vickodil </em>v. <em>Lexington Ins. Co., </em>412 Mass. 132 (1992), held that similar policy language could not \u201creasonably be construed to provide coverage in excess of \u2018collectible\u2019 insurance\u201d and that where the excess insurer\u2019s obligation was clearly limited by other provisions in the policy to that effect, the policy did not \u201cdrop down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135-136. After further briefing and argument in light of <em>Vickodil, </em>the judge denied Pacific\u2019s motion for reconsideration. A final and separate judgment entered pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), and Pacific appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The ambiguity, as perceived by the judge, is described in her memorandum:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u201cThe first document which must be examined is Pacific\u2019s Certificate of Excess Insurance (\u2018the Certificate\u2019), which does not expressly address the consequences of the insolvency of the primary insurer. Item 5 of the certificate identifies Integrity as the primary carrier which is providing $10,000,000 (umbrella liability) in primary insurance. Item 6 describes excess insurance as $10,000,000. The certificate contains the following relevant provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">\u2018B. NOW, this certificate is to indemnify the Insured in accordance with the applicable insuring agreements, exclusions and conditions of the primary insurance for excess loss as specified in Item 6 (Description of Excess Insurance) of the declarations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u2018F. This certificate may be cancelled by the Insured by surrender thereof to [Pacific] or any of its authorized agents, or by mailing to [Pacific] written notice stating when thereafter such cancellation shall be effective, <em>it being agreed, however, that in the event of cancellation or termination of the primary insurance, this certificate, to the extent of such cancellation or termination, shall cease to apply at the same time without notice to the Insured.' </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u201cParagraph F is the only portion of the Certificate to address the obligation of the excess insurer to the extent of the absence of the primary insurance. It provides that the excess insurance shall \u2018cease to apply\u2019 in the event of cancellation or termination \u2018to the extent of such cancellation or termination.\u2019 Although the certificate does not define these terms, the usual and ordinary meaning of the terms cancellation and termination does not encompass absence of insurance coverage due to insolvency. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We learn from the <em>Vickodil </em>case that a mere failure of the excess policy to deal with the consequences of insolvency does not, by itself, create ambiguity. <em>Vickodil, supra </em>at 135. Rather, the specific language of the policy provisions bearing on the subject should determine whether ambiguity exists. See <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>399 Mass. 598, 600 (1987); <em>Pinheiro </em>v. <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assoc. of Mass., </em>406 Mass. 288, 294 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">1. <em>Paragraph F of the Pacific policy. </em>Paragraph F of Pacific\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Excess Insurance\u201d is the only section of the Pacific policy which speaks to the obligation of the excess insurer in the absence of the second-level carrier. Metropolitan and Casey compare the Paragraph F language to the language of the excess insurance policies quoted in <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>399 Mass. at 599-600 &amp; n.3, and <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. at 608-610 &amp; n.2, both cases in which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>found the policy language created ambiguity as to what would happen if the underlying insurer became insolvent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We conclude that the policies in those cases contain language unlike the policy at issue in this case. In <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>399 Mass. at 599-600, the policy language, quoted in the margin, specifically contemplated that coverage would \u201cdrop down\u201d under specified circumstances. A plain reading of that policy\u2019s provisions indicates that the amount in excess of which the policy would provide coverage (the excess coverage lower limit) would change based upon the amount of available underlying insurance. By contrast, the Pacific certificate contemplated that its coverage would \u201ccease to apply\u201d to the \u201cextent of . . . cancellation or termination\u201d of the underlying insurance. Nowhere does Paragraph F, or any other pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>vision in the Pacific certificate, contemplate a change in the excess coverage lower limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In the <em>Lincoln </em>policy, quoted in the margin, postoccurrence events affected the policy\u2019s excess coverage lower limit. <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins., </em>399 Mass. at 611. The policy specifically tied the excess coverage lower limit to the amount of underlying insurance \u201cvalid and collectible . . . whether or not described in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance.\u201d By comparison, the Pacific certificate stated very specifically that coverage was in excess of the underlying insurance on the schedule, and listed no postoccurrence events or conditions of the underlying insurance\u2019s validity or collectibility to which the amount of its excess coverage lower limit was tied.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Taken out of context, the insureds\u2019 reading of these two cases is plausible. When, however, the policy provisions are compared, we think that Pacific\u2019s policy certificate cannot reasonably be construed to provide for excess coverage in amounts different from those specifically stated on the schedules. See <em>Vickodil </em>v. <em>Lexington Ins. Co., </em>412 Mass. at 135-136.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Furthermore, the Pacific policy contained no \u201cdrop down\u201d provision, in contrast to the <em>Continental </em>and <em>Lincoln </em>policies which had ambiguous \u201cdrop down\u201d provisions. This distinction is \"fatal to the insureds\u2019 argument. Although the meaning of the clause: \u201cto the extent of such termination or cancellation,\u201d is unclear, the subsequent modifying phrase, \u201cshall cease to apply,\u201d contemplates a <em>loss </em>of excess coverage upon certain conditions subsequent, not an extension of excess coverage into the realm of the scheduled underlying insurers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The language may be imprecise but it is clear that the coverage does not \u201cdrop down,\u201d nor is it otherwise affected by a second-level insurer\u2019s insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>2. <em>Excess insurance description. </em>In <em>Vickodil </em>v. <em>Lexington Ins. Co., </em>412 Mass. at 135, the court determined that the policy language could not \u201creasonably be construed to provide coverage in excess of \u2018collectible\u2019 insurance,\u201d and that Lexington\u2019s commitment was clearly defined that it would \u201cpay excess of the commitments made by applicable underlying insurers.\u201d The language in the Pacific certificate is not distinguishable in any important respect from the Lexington policy construed in Vickodil.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Superior Court judge found it significant that language in the Lexington policy agreeing to indemnify against loss \u201cwhich is in excess of the total limit(s) of all underlying insurance\u201d was absent from the Pacific certificate. We, however, find this statement from the Lexington policy analogous to the Pacific language indemnifying against \u201cexcess loss as specified in Item 6 (Description of Excess of Insurance).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Vickodils, who sought excess coverage under the Lexington policy, argued unsuccessfully that the ambiguity was created by the descriptive words attached to the word \u201cexcess\u201d (\u201cof the total limits of all Underlying Insurance\u201d). They contended that this phrase meant that if the underlying insurance dropped to zero, the excess insurance would cover the entire loss. The court rejected this interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">By comparison, because there is no clause in the Pacific certificate modifying the words \u201cexcess loss,\u201d that language alone cannot avail the insureds. The unadorned words \u201cexcess loss,\u201d cannot be construed to mean that the coverage will drop down.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>3. <em>Following form language. </em>We mention briefly one other argument made by Metropolitan and Casey. They contend that because the Pacific policy \u201cfollows form\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to Integrity\u2019s second-level excess policy, and that because, the Integrity policy is ambiguous and would, therefore, drop down in the event of insolvency of the primary insurer, the Pacific policy should also drop down into the place of the Integrity policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Pacific, on the other hand, contends that the \u201cfollowing form\u201d language means only that the policy covers the same risks as the underlying insurer, and has nothing to do with the excess policy\u2019s lower limits or the events which trigger its applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We need only look to the \u201cfollowing form\u201d provision of the Pacific certificate to determine the effect that language may have on Pacific\u2019s liability. Paragraph B of the Pacific certificate, the \u201cfollowing form\u201d clause, provides, \u201cNOW, this certificate is to indemnify the Insured in accordance with the <em>applicable </em>insuring agreements, exclusions and conditions of the primary insurance for excess loss as specified in Item 6 . . . of the declarations\u201d (emphasis added). Because of the insolvency, the Integrity policy no longer has any effect and cannot be invoked to provide coverage. We do not think this translates into an <em>applicable </em>insuring agreement. The potential ambiguity of the Integrity policy notwithstanding, its form is not followed with regard to the \u201cdrop down\u201d provision under the express terms of the Pacific policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment is reversed. A new judgment is to enter declaring that Pacific\u2019s coverage does not drop down to fill the void created by Integrity\u2019s insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> The Continental policy construed in <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Continental Cas.

The limits of liability of any Underlying Insurance Policy shall be deemed applicable irrespective of any defense which the underlying insurer may assert because of the insured\u2019s failure to comply with any condition of the Policy subsequent to an occurrence.\u201d Also, the policy provided that \u201c[t]he insurance afforded by this Policy shall be excess insurance over any other valid and <em>collectible </em>insurance available to the Insured <em>whether or not described in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance\" </em>(emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 611.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> This clause is more like a \u201cfollowing form\u201d clause than a \u201cdrop down\u201d clause. It anticipates the underlying insurers terminating or cancelling all coverage, or just some type or aspect of coverage. The Pacific contract would follow that form, and cancel or terminate \u201cto the [same] extent\u201d as the underlying insurers.
