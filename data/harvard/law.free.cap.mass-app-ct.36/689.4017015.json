Costello, guilty of unlawfully having intercourse with a child under sixteen years of age, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23. The defendant challenges the conviction on numerous grounds, none of which requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The jury could have found the following facts. The parents of the complainant became friendly with the defendant, Costello, in the mid 1970\u2019s, when the complainant, Claudia,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was about seven years old. Claudia, her parents, and her sisters were then living in Canton. The events referred to in the indictment occurred seven years later when Claudia was fourteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">At the beginning of the relationship between the defendant and Claudia\u2019s parents, Costello visited the family on the weekends and one or two times during the week. In 1978 or 1979, Costello began to visit two or three times each week but only during the daytime when Claudia\u2019s father was working, and he left before her father returned home. Claudia and her sisters had an \u201cuncle-type relationship\u201d with Costello at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Subsequently, Claudia\u2019s family moved to Walpole, and around October, 1984, her parents separated. Claudia went to live in Attleboro with her mother, her younger sister, and her brother, where she continued her close friendship with Costello. Her twin sister and older sister stayed in Walpole with their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The Attleboro house, which Costello eventually made his home, had three bedrooms upstairs, one bedroom downstairs, and a finished basement. The defendant did not have a room of his own but slept with Claudia\u2019s mother or on the couch downstairs. The incidents that are the subject of the indictments began in October of 1984, a few weeks after Claudia\u2019s mother moved to the Attleboro home, and continued through February of 1985. Costello eventually moved out of the Att-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>leboro house sometime in April of 1985. During the summer of 1985 Claudia\u2019s mother and Costello resumed their relationship but only for a short time. Ultimately, Claudia\u2019s parents reconciled their differences and moved back together.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In May of 1987, Costello instituted a paternity action, seeking custody or visitation rights to Claudia\u2019s brother, who was born in November, 1981. Upon hearing that Costello wanted custody, Claudia told her mother of her sexual encounters with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\"><em>The sexual encounters. </em>The indictment charges Costello with committing unlawful acts of sexual intercourse with and abuse of a child from on or about October 1, 1984, to about February 28, 1985. At trial, Claudia testified to four incidents during this period: October 9, 1984, November 24, 1984, December 1984, and the middle of or late February, 1985. The following is a summary of Claudia\u2019s testimony about these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The October 9, 1984, incident occurred in her brother\u2019s upstairs bedroom. The brother was sleeping in his mother\u2019s room, as he often did. Claudia was sleeping in her brother\u2019s room. She was awakened by Costello \u201ctickling [her] bum and rubbing his . . . hand up and down [her] back.\u201d Claudia was scared, and she protested. Costello persisted, and sexual intercourse followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">On November 24, 1984, Claudia was again asleep in her brother\u2019s bedroom when she was awakened by Costello. This time Claudia insisted that they leave the upstairs for fear they would be discovered. Claudia and Costello went downstairs to the room used as a living room. As she sat on a day bed smoking a cigarette, Costello came behind her with his hands around her chest. She asked him, \u201cAm I crazy or are you crazy?\u201d To which he answered, \u201cNo, we are both crazy.\u201d Costello removed his clothing, and they engaged in another episode of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">In December of 1984, Claudia had fallen asleep watching television on the day bed in the living room. She was again awakened by Costello and again they had intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>In mid or late February, 1985, Claudia was in the basement of the house playing pool with Costello. She sat down on the bench of an exercise machine and performed some weightlifting repetitions. Costello went up behind her and started to do pushups. She got up and sat on Costello\u2019s bed in the basement; there they had the fourth act of intercourse. According to Claudia\u2019s testimony, this was the last occasion on which she and Costello had sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\"><em>Fresh complaint testimony. </em>At trial, the Commonwealth called Claudia\u2019s therapist, Frederick Auerilo, a psychiatric social worker, to testify as a fresh complaint witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over the defendant\u2019s objection, he was permitted to testify as to statements made by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Claudia\u2019s discussion with the therapist took place twelve months after the last incident, and the issue before us is whether the delay was too long. She first saw Auerilo in January, 1986 (at the suggestion of a physician treating her for gastrointestinal symptoms), and, under questioning by him in February, 1986, told him of her relationship with the defendant. Although reluctant to discuss her encounters with the defendant, she indicated to the therapist that there had been sexual relations more than once. She was uncomfortable in listing the exact dates. The therapist gave her \u201ckind of many parameters, and I said, did it happen within the past year?\u201d She answered, \u201cYes.\u201d At a later time she was more specific and stated, \u201cMay or June of 1985 [was] a time when they had intercourse.\u201d The therapist did not testify to any other aspects or details of the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Prior to Auerilo\u2019s fresh complaint testimony, Claudia, when questioned at trial as to why she didn\u2019t tell her parents, had explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">Q. \u201cDid you ever have any conversation with the defendant about your telling your mother?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>A. \u201cLater on I, you know, I was like, I had told him that my mother was going to find out. And he is like, [Claudia], your mother can\u2019t. And he said, your mother will kick you and I both out of the house. And I was like, [w]ell, I guess I can just go live with my father or something. And he says, [Claudia], your father hates me and you don\u2019t think for a minute that if he found out that you were doing this with me, that he is going to want you to live there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Q. \u201cDid you ever tell your father?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">A. \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">Q. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">A. \u201cBecause I was scared, and I thought that \u2014 I thought it was my fault. I thought I brought, I thought I was making him do it, or I thought that, you know, in order for him to be a friend of mine, or in order for me to have someone close to me, that if he had to do this, you know, that wasn\u2019t a big sacrifice to me then. You know, it was like, well, at least I have somebody, you know, with me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Claudia also testified that after the defendant moved out of the house, she was \u201cvery, very upset\u201d because \u201che filled a lot of void in my life.\u201d Thereafter, she continued to see him until her mother told her if she ever saw him again, she would \u201ckick me out of the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">In determining whether the delay in reporting the encounters is reasonable, the analysis \u201cshould be flexible and attended by due consideration of factors which reasonably might cause a child to repress the urge to cry out to a third person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, ante </em>433, 439 (1994). While passage of time is important, \u201cfreshness\u201d is \u201cnot solely' a question of the clock or calendar.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 413 (1991). Among the factors \u201cone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>considers [are] whether threats or other kinds of intimidation were applied which might inhibit the first utterance of complaint, and . . . what was the relationship between the complainant and the person accused of the crime.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Here, the victim was close to the defendant and was afraid of losing his friendship. She was afraid her parents would find out, be upset, and, perhaps, \u201ckick her out.\u201d Moreover, she was confused as to whether she had been at fault. Indeed, in nearly every weekly session with her therapist she discussed \u201cher feelings about what had happened . . . and whether or not she would ever tell her parents, how she may, if she were to, what she would do about it, her feelings towards Mr. Costello, her ambivalence, her guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">While complaints as means of corroboration lose reliability with the passage of time, in this case the judge, in his discretion, properly could consider Claudia\u2019s fear of her parents\u2019 finding out, her guilt, and her ambivalence toward the defendant as sufficient explanation for her earlier failure to divulge the relationship to anyone other than her girlfriend. His conclusion that her statements to the therapist were sufficiently reliable to be admissible as fresh complaint was, in these circumstances, warranted. The therapist\u2019s testimony was not inflammatory, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 352-353 (1994), and, while the date given to the therapist as to one incident was not totally consistent with Claudia\u2019s direct testimony, the discrepancy was inconsequential. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tingley, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 706, 709-710 (1992). The May-June date does not appear to be an additional incident not charged but rather a failure on the part of Claudia to remember the exact date of one of the rapes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The fresh complaint evidence was also, in large part, cumulative. In November or December, 1984, Claudia first told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>her girlfriend, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>about what was happening, and the girlfriend testified to one, at least, of the incidents. Moreover, Claudia and a policewoman, without objection, testified that she had informed three people of \u201cthese incidents,\u201d namely, her girlfriend, her boss, and her therapist.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><em>Limited cross-examination regarding Claudia\u2019s sexual knowledge. </em>The defendant contends that there was error in restricting the defendant\u2019s cross-examination regarding Claudia\u2019s sexual knowledge. Defense counsel sought to elicit from Claudia and her therapist evidence of her knowledge of sex gained from sexual activity with a man other than Costello, allegedly occurring in January of 1986. General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 21B, the so-called rape shield law, ordinarily prohibits such inquiry. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, </em>399 Mass. 811, 814-817 (1987), is not warranted. In that case, the defendant was held entitled to a voir dire examination to show that the victim had been abused in the past. Had that earlier experience been similar to the abuse alleged, the court held that that evidence would be admissible to show that the past abuse, rather than any experience with the defendant, explained how the victim (ten years old at the time of trial) acquired sufficient information to describe the sexual acts. <em>Ruffen </em>is inapposite. A fourteen year old testifying when she is eighteen (almost nineteen) years old may be assumed to have sufficient knowledge about sexual matters to discuss intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\"><em>Request for a mistrial. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erroneously denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>trial after Claudia\u2019s girlfriend, a prosecution witness, made irrelevant and potentially prejudicial outbursts during cross-examination. Among other nonresponsive comments, she stated that Claudia was upset because she thought Costello had impregnated her and that the defendant had shown them pornographic films and had offered them alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The nonresponsive remarks were potentially prejudicial, but \u201c[t]he decision to deny a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the judge. Here, the judge relied on curative instructions as an adequate means to correct any error and to remedy any prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 232 (1989) (citations omitted). The curative instructions were clear and prompt \u2014 the jury were instructed immediately after hearing the outbursts of the witness that the remarks were not responsive, were to be disregarded, and that no attention should be paid to them. The judge also admonished the witness in the presence of the jury. We will presume the jury followed those instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 228-229 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. 267, 281 &amp; n.10 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\"><em>Closing argument. </em>The defendant also challenges the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. We emphasize that the concern of the appellate courts in regard to prosecutorial misconduct has been expressed repeatedly. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 903 (1983). \u201c[Ejxtemporized arguments only serve to increase the burdens on the trial judge and to provide grist for the appellate mill.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grammo, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 447, 457 (1979). Improper comments to the jury are only self-defeating. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 472 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The prosecutor said the following in her closing argument: \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that just a little too good to be true? . . . Isn\u2019t Rick Costello\u2019s, I\u2019m a wonderful human being, I\u2019m being railroaded by this vicious family, isn\u2019t that just a little too good to be true? Or is he really such a great guy? Maybe he just sent his halo out to the cleaners for this week.\u201d These comments improperly attacked the character of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 575 (1977) (attack on character of defendant improper where that was not an issue at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The prosecutor also remarked that, for the jury to believe the defendant\u2019s version of the facts, all the prosecution witnesses had to have conspired against him. These remarks should not have been made. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 115 (1987). Nevertheless, these remarks, even considered with the prosecutor\u2019s other improper comments, do not justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We have reviewed the remaining arguments of the defendant and conclude that they have no merit and warrant no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\"> The name of the complainant is fictitious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\"> The Commonwealth also called one other fresh complaint witness, Claudia\u2019s girlfriend. The defendant only challenges the propriety of admitting the therapist\u2019s testimony under the fresh complaint doctrine, not the friend\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> Claudia clearly testified that there were four incidents. A policewoman, Elena Clarke, was a witness for the defendant. On cross-examination, without objection, she also testified that the victim told her of four incidents. Thus the statement of the therapist that it happened more than once and the fact that he (or Claudia) erred as to one date added little, if anything, of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\"> We also note that the focus of the defense as expressed to the judge in bench conferences was that the episodes were invented and only came to light after the defendant instituted his paternity action in May, 1987, seeking visitation rights to the victim\u2019s brother. After the therapist\u2019s testimony, the defendant no longer made this claim. Had the fresh complaint testimony of the therapist been excluded, and had the defendant made the claim of recent fabrication, Claudia\u2019s statements to the therapist in February, 1986, would have been admissible to rebut the claim that her informing her mother in 1987 was the product of bias against the defendant on account of his paternity suit and a recent contrivance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>371 Mass. 363, 370-371 (1976). Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.15, at 329 (6th ed. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b729-8\">Gillerman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4l\">(dissenting, with whom Greenberg, J., joins). Hearsay evidence of fresh complaint is admissible to corroborate the complainant\u2019s testimony because it \u201callows rape victims who . . . complain promptly to eliminate any unwarranted skepticism arising from lack of evidence of a prompt complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 658 (1992). The doctrine is persistently troublesome because it is both \u201cmischievous,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 412 (1991), and remedial. It is mischievous unless the complaint is \u201ctruly \u2018fresh\u2019 \u201cas time extends itself, a complaint loses character as a spontaneous accusation after grievous wrong; moreover, opportunity grows for invention or distortion of an event by mistake, twist of memory, fantasizing, contrivance, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 413. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 526-527 (1991).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The doctrine is remedial because it permits a response to \u201cthe societal tendency to disbelieve sexual assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>victims and to presume that a rape victim will make a prompt complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. at 658. But where the fresh complaint is not obviously fresh, the risk of prevarication may outweigh the benefit of corroborative testimony. The judge has the responsibility to resolve this common, vexing problem by deciding whether to admit the hearsay testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Where the complainant is an adult, \u201cfreshness\u201d is usually a matter of hours or days, and the problem is not acute. See the appendices to the <em>Dion </em>opinion. 30 Mass. App. Ct. at 416-417. The rub comes where, as here, the complainant is a child, and the requirement of hours or days is extended to months or years. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, 417 </em>Mass. 810, 814-815 (1994) (in cases involving children, \u201c[cjourts have been flexible in applying the usual fresh complaint strictures . . .\u201d). The rationale is understandable: cases where a child is the complainant \u201cconstitute a factually distinct branch of the fresh complaint doctrine . . . [because] special consideration [is given] to the natural fear, ignorance, and susceptibility to intimidations that is unique to a young child\u2019s make-up.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 229 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The cases vary considerably in their details,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but in general the requirement of promptness has been relaxed where the child complainant is too frightened to tell of the abusive events because the defendant, often a family member, has threatened the child with dire consequences if the sexual abuse is mentioned.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the threats, the fear, and the intimidation end \u2014 commonly when the defendant severs rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tions with the family \u2014 disclosure frequently follows, presumably because of a child\u2019s natural inclination to seek comfort from the terror of sexual abuse. It is this extended period of nondisclosure that the judge must analyze before coming to a decision. Does the proffered reason for the delay, for example, reveal that the defendant effectively suppressed any complaint the child would likely have expressed? If not \u2014 that is, if the complainant did not intend to accuse the defendant until years later under entirely different circumstances \u2014 then the doctrine of fresh complaint has no place in the trial of the case. It is only the promptness of a complaint (including any excused delay) that effectively meets societal \u201cskepticism arising from lack of evidence of a prompt complaint,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. at 658, for a stale complaint raises the possibility that the accusation may be an afterthought, motivated by a grievance arising out of a later, unrelated event.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">With these considerations in mind, we turn to the facts. The majority would excuse the delay in disclosure because Claudia \u201cwas afraid her parents would find out, be upset, and, perhaps, \u2018kick her out.\u2019 \u201d I believe that this misunderstands and misinterprets the testimony. In colloquy between the judge and Auerilo, Claudia\u2019s therapist, during the voir dire of Auerilo, the judge, discussing Claudia\u2019s behavior, said, \u201c[I]f there was, in capital letters, a single precipitating problem in her life, it was the tumultuous behavior at home, the fighting between mother and father, the split-up and the break-up, and some of the kids going one way, and her, the other kids going the other way . . . [that] motivated her . . . to have sex with . . . [the defendant]. In fairness, I should tell you she has already testified to that. She said there was a void in her life, and he made her feel comfortable, and she got to want to be with him.\u201d Further, there was no evidence that the defendant behaved violently toward Claudia. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>noted, Claudia was aware of the significance of what she and the defendant were doing. \u201cAm I crazy or are you crazy?\u201d she asked the defendant before their second sexual encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">It is plain to me, as I believe it was to the judge, that the explanation for the long-delayed disclosure was Claudia\u2019s desire to conceal and perpetuate her secret relationship with the defendant. Her only fear was that if her parents \u201cfound out\u201d they would bring an end to her relationship with the defendant \u2014 a relationship that she felt, as the judge said, filled a \u201cvoid in her life.\u201d In my view, admitting fresh complaint testimony is truly mischievous when the judge, as here, permits a long-delayed disclosure where that delay is chosen by the complainant, not out of fear, but solely to conceal and protect her relationship to the defendant. On this understanding of the facts, which I believe to be correct, the period of nondisclosure starts with the first sexual encounter in October, 1984. The disclosure to Auerilo was in February, 1986. On that basis, I conclude that this case is controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 414. The fact that the disclosure to Auerilo was eventually made in the course of therapy, and not as a complaint or accusation at all, only adds to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s decision to admit Auerilo\u2019s testimony was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">There is one further difficulty with the majority\u2019s decision. Costello, as the majority opinion notes, moved out of the Johnson home sometime in April, 1985. Thus ten months passed by before Claudia revealed the relationship to Auer-ilo, and it was not until sometime in mid-1987 that Claudia told her mother upon hearing of the defendant\u2019s paternity action. If, for any reason I am unable to see, one regards Claudia\u2019s initial silence as the product of the defendant\u2019s threatening behavior, certainly when the defendant left the house the intimidation ended, leaving no explanation for Claudia\u2019s continued silence other than her uncoerced decision to tell nothing of what happened in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The judge\u2019s error in admitting hearsay evidence of a \u201ccomplaint\u201d that was stale by choice and not by fear or intimida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tion was highly prejudicial. The jury asked for and received the transcript of Auerilo\u2019s testimony. Whatever reasonable doubt that may have existed at that point dissipated under the weight of the testimony of an expert psychiatric social worker. The defendant should be entitled to a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 414 n.10.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\"> The Supreme Judicial Court has also noted that there is a potential danger that the jury will use the evidence as proof that the offense actually occurred rather than for the limited purpose of corroboration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 646 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> The cases are collected in the appendices to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>35 Mass. 211, 219-220 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> In the case of a very young child, ignorance of what is going on may explain the delay in disclosure. Here, however, we have a distinctly mature minor who thoroughly appreciated the significance of what she and the defendant were doing. As the majority note, Claudia, on the second occasion of intercourse, \u201cinsisted that they leave the upstairs for fear they would be discovered.\u201d Once downstairs, she asked the defendant, \u201cAm I crazy or are you crazy?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\"> In this case, for example, charges against the defendant were not brought until after Claudia complained to her mother, but, as the majority notes, that complaint was precipitated by the paternity action instituted in 1987 by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
