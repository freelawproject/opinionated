The complaint sought an injunction requiring the building inspector to issue a certificate of occupancy for the land and building at 320 Charger Street, Revere, which the trustees owned. R&amp;S Realty Trust alleged that the building inspector believed that all building code and zoning ordinance requirements had been met, but that on or about February 2,\u00cd1990, he, the inspector, had received a letter from counsel to an abutter that the intended use of 320 Charger Street was not a permitted use in the industrial zone and, therefore, would violate the Revere zoning ordinance. Less than two months later, the plaintiff in this action (Bendetson)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> moved to intervene in the prior Land Court action. The motion was allowed, and Bendetson became a defendant in the prior proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">With regard to the Land Court action, Bendetson, as appellant in these proceedings, has not included in the record before us (i) his motion to intervene, (ii) the answer he filed to the complaint, (iii) the stipulation of uncontested facts the parties filed with the judge, (iv) any portion of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of the three-day trial, or (v) a copy of the posttrial memorandum of law submitted to the judge of the Land Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">What we do have regarding the prior Land Court action \u2014 and the basis upon which we must decide the issue of claim preclusion \u2014 is a copy of the complaint, a copy of the decision of the judge of the Land Court, a copy of a letter from Bendetson\u2019s counsel to the building inspector dated October 1, 1990 (five months before the final day of the Land Court trial, April 2, 1991), and a copy of the relevant provisions of the zoning ordinance of the city of Revere.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The purpose of Bendetson\u2019s letter of October 1 was to complain about the use of the property at 320 Charger Street. After referring to the then pending Land Court action in which the inspector was a codefendant, the letter argues that the property at 320 Charger Street is used for the storage of a \u201cfleet of trash collection vehicles and trash containers,\u201d and that such use violates the zoning ordinance of the city of Revere because the outdoor storage of vehicles is available \u201conly when incidental to the operation of a business or industry\u201d as provided in \u00a7 17.16.720 of the Revere zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The judge of the Land Court in the prior proceedings found \u2014 and there is no basis on this scant record to challenge the finding \u2014 the use of the premises to be the following: \u201cThe garage/maintenance portion is used for minor repairs of Laidlaw\u2019s vehicles. The fenced in black-topped area behind and on the sides of the Structure is used to park Laidlaw\u2019s seventy-seven vehicles. The vehicles are off-site during the day, they return approximately between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. and leave approximately between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.\u201d5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>On the basis of his findings of fact, the Land Court judge confirmed his earlier preliminary injunction ordering the issuance of an occupancy permit. He concluded that the \u201cpresent uses\u201d of the land and buildings at 320 Charger Street were in compliance with the Revere zoning ordinance because the uses to which the property was being put were allowed as of right in an industrial zone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 17.48.130 of the Revere zoning ordinance provides that the building inspector is authorized to issue occupancy permits provided that there has been compliance with all the provisions of the Revere zoning ordinance regarding the building and \u201cthe use of the . . . premises in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">According to the judge\u2019s decision, Bendetson also argued that the occupancy permit should not issue because (i) the structure violated the area limitations set forth in the State building code, and (ii) because the plaintiffs did not have a required fuel storage license. The judge dismissed both arguments as being without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Most important, the judge\u2019s decision made no reference to the argument made in these proceedings (and in Bendetson\u2019s October 2, 1990, letter) \u2014 that the certificate of occupancy should not issue because the use of the premises constitutes the outdoor storage of vehicles and containers and thereby violates the zoning ordinance of the city of Revere. We must assume that the omission of any reference to that argument is attributable to the failure of Bendetson to put that argument forward in the trial court. That argument, then, is made for the first time in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">There is no dispute that the judgment in the prior Land Court proceedings was entered with prejudice and is a valid and final judgment binding upon the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Claim preclusion forecloses the litigation of all matters that were or should have been litigated in the first action. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>18 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>App. Ct. 786, 793 (1984) (the doctrine of res judicata assures that judgments are conclusive, and precludes relitigation of issues that were or could have been raised in the original action). The purpose of the rule is to prevent the splitting of a cause of action where the party to be precluded had both the opportunity and the incentive to litigate the matter fully in the first lawsuit. <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 24 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Bendetson\u2019s argument is simply that, on the undisputed facts found by the judge in the Land Court, there is a demonstrated violation of the provisions of the Revere zoning ordinance (\u00a7 17.16.270) arising out of the alleged \u201cstorage\u201d of motor vehicles and containers on the property. Bendetson acknowledges that this argument was never raised or decided in the Land Court action, and the question before us is whether the claims extinguished in the first action and the claims asserted in these proceedings arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24(1) (1982); <em>Saint Louis </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Center, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 393, 399 (1991). The issue is to be determined \u201cpragmatically.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24(2) (1982). \u201cWhether the facts are related in origin or motivation and whether they form a convenient trial unit are among the considerations.\u201d <em>Saint Louis, supra </em>at 399. If the second action merely presents \u201cdifferent . . . legal theories to support . . . [the] claim, or seeks different remedies,\u201d the second action is barred. <em>Heacock, supra </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">It is clear to us that Bendetson\u2019s argument is merely a new legal theory for the claim that the defendants asserted in the prior Land Court proceedings \u2014 that the owners of 320 Charger Street were not entitled to an occupancy permit. It makes no difference, for claim preclusion purposes, whether Bendetson argues, as he does in these proceedings, that the occupancy permit should not issue because of violations of the \u201cstorage\u201d provisions of the Revere zoning ordinance, or whether he argues, as he did in the prior proceedings, that the occupancy permit should not issue because of violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>of the provisions of the State building code or the provisions of law relating to the storage of fuel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All of these arguments arise out of and attempt to characterize the same set of operative facts \u2014 the actual use of the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The Land Court judge expressly concluded that the owners of 320 Charger Street were entitled to an occupancy permit because their use of the property was \u201callowed as of right in an industrial zone under the [Revere zoning] ordinance.\u201d Bendetson took no appeal from that final judgment, and we accept that judgment as correct. See <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 642 (1991). He is not now entitled to reopen the issue of the Revere zoning ordinance and relitigate the claim of the unavailability of an occupancy permit on yet another theory. This is especially so given Bendetson\u2019s letter of October 1, 1990 (well before the completion of the Land Court action), where the present formulation of Bendetson\u2019s claim is clearly stated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Bendetson was obliged in the first action to put forward every reason, every argument, and every theory he intended to assert as grounds for the illegality of an occupancy permit; there was no legal impediment to his doing so. He cannot choose to hold back one theory to await the outcome of different theories. To permit that possibility would defeat the goal of judicial efficiency and the conclusiveness of judgments. See <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>Amoco Oil Co., </em>725 F.2d 627, 632 (11th Cir. 1984); <em>Matter of Howe, </em>913 F.2d 1138, 1143-1147 (5th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-17\"> \u201cThe doctrine of claim preclusion makes a valid, final judgment conclusive on the parties and their privies, and bars further litigation of all matters that were or should have been adjudicated in the action.\u201d <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 23 (1988). The plaintiff argues that the doctrine does not apply only because there is not an identity of claims in this case and in the prior Land Court case discussed in the text. Thus we will confine our discussion of the doctrine to that single issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\"> The plaintiff, Richard K. Bendetson, is the trustee of Exeter House Realty Trust, which holds title to a ninety-one unit, four-story residential apartment building at 315 Charger Street in Revere, directly across the street from the property at issue in these proceedings (the locus). The locus includes a two-story office building and a garage-maintenance structure with fourteen bays, and is owned by R&amp;S Realty Trust (\u201cR&amp;S\u201d), the plaintiff in the Land Court action. A portion of the office space and all of the garage-maintenance section is leased to Laidlaw Waste Systems (Laidlaw), a refuse collection company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> The record before us does not include the letter of February 2, 1990, from the abutter\u2019s counsel, but because it was the plaintiff in these proceedings \u2014 Bendetson \u2014 who intervened in the Land Court action shortly thereafter, we assume that the abutter referred to in the Land Court complaint was the party (Bendetson) who intervened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> We also know that the Land Court case was consolidated with two other cases (with which we need not be concerned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\"> The plaintiff's argument that these findings are relevant only to the request for a fuel storage license is plainly wrong. While the findings appear in the judge\u2019s discussion of a fuel storage permit, they are plainly findings of fact for all relevant purposes in the case. Furthermore, the judge\u2019s decision in the present proceedings states that the \u201cparties do not dispute\u201d that the use of the land is as described by the Land Court judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"> The judge cited \u00a7 17.60.040 of the Revere zoning ordinance, sub-paragraph \u201cB\u201d of which provides that the building inspector may not grant any certificate or permit for any new use of a building or land which would be in violation of the Revere zoning ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\"> Bendetson attempts to construct the argument that the Land Court judge merely considered whether the occupancy permit should issue for the use of the premises as a maintenance facility and executive offices, that being the intended use stated in the application for the permit \u2014 and that that is a different matter entirely from the present claim that the permit should not issue because of the alleged unlawful storage of vehicles. It is sufficient to note that an occupancy permit may not issue under the Revere zoning ordinance unless the applicant is in compliance with <em>all </em>the provisions of the ordinance, see \u00a7 17.48.130, and the judge found that the applicant was in full compliance with the zoning ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"> We reject Bendetson\u2019s argument that the building inspector waived the defense of res judicata by failing to plead it as an affirmative defense in its answer. Massachusetts R.Civ.P. 8(c), 365 Mass. 750 (1974), requires that res judicata be pleaded, see Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 8.6, at 198 (1974 &amp; Supp. 1994), and failure to comply with this rule, without more, is sufficient for holding that the defense is not available to a defendant for the first time on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Middlesex &amp; Boston St. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>371 Mass. 849, 859 (1977); <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 471 (1991). However, we consider the defense properly asserted here where the defendant raised the argument in his brief in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the plaintiff raised a counter-argument in his reply brief. Cf. <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., supra </em>at 471 (where party did not plead waiver as affirmative defense, <em>and </em>issue was not raised or consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ered in trial court, the defense could not be raised for the first time on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
