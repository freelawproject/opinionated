We reverse on the ground of prejudicial error in the admission of fresh complaint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Born on March 7, 1975, the daughter, whom we shall call Martha, was fifteen years old at the time of the trial in December of 1990. She testified that the first of the sexual contacts by her father, who was separated from her mother, occurred when she was \u201cabout five\u201d years old during one of her overnight visitations at his residence. She stated that this incident involved sexual intercourse and that various forms of sexual contact by her father<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> occurred on almost all of her weekly overnight visits with him at his apartments over the next nine years. She acknowledged that she never told anyone of this abuse during that period. She testified that the last such incident occurred between November 3, 1988, and December 5, 1988, and that her father never threatened her or told her not to tell anyone or that the sexual contact would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>be a secret between them. Her first report of abuse by her father occurred in October, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">1. <em>Indictments. </em>The indictments alleged unlawful sexual acts as follows: three in Quincy between January 1, 1981, and January 1, 1983; two in Quincy between January 1, 1981, and January 1, 1984; seven in Holbrook between January 1, 1984, and October 1, 1988; and two between November 3, 1988, and December 5, 1988, in Holbrook. A bill of particulars filed by the Commonwealth provided specific information as to the nature of the sexual act alleged in each of the indictments but did not more precisely identify the time of any offense. At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case and over the objection of the defendant, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to amend the five indictments alleging incidents in Quincy and the related information in the bill of particulars by changing the termination date of the periods alleged from January 1, 1983, and January 1, 1984, to December 30, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The defendant moved neither to dismiss the indictments nor to strike or amplify the bill of particulars. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brenner, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 930 (1984); Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1296 (2d ed. 1983). His argument to us, that the lack of specificity in the indictments deprived him of a fair trial, not only overlooks the substantial authority permitting imprecise dates in indictments for crimes involving young victims, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 467-469 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 203 (1983), but also ignores that he did not challenge at trial the evidence of his private access to Martha during the times in question. Instead, his defense was constructed on total denial of any impropriety. Given Martha\u2019s trial testimony of weekly sexual contact over a period of approximately nine years, the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of regular and frequent private access to her during that time, and his argument at trial that it was highly unlikely that so many repeated instances of abuse would be unnoticed for so long a period, he hardly can complain that a lack of specificity disadvantaged his defense. For the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>reason, and because the precise time of the alleged sexual contacts was not an essential element of the crimes charged, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 467; G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 20, the judge did not err in permitting the amendment of five of the indictments. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jervis, </em>368 Mass. 638, 644 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>379 Mass. 671, 676 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">2. <em>Fresh complaint evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the fresh complaint evidence relied upon by the prosecution was too remote from the acts complained of and therefore should not have been admitted. He also claims that there was an impermissible \u201cpiling on\u201d of fresh complaint witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">a. <em>Promptness of complaints. </em>The witnesses who testified to Martha\u2019s having told them of being abused by the defendant were, in the order of their testimony, a psychiatrist, Martha\u2019s mother, a social worker, a pediatrician, a police officer and an investigator for the Department of Social Services (DSS). These six witnesses testified to Martha\u2019s complaining to them at various times between October of 1989 and January 8, 1990. The first of the complaints was made in October of 1989 to a social worker at Westwood Lodge, an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The other complaints were in response to inquiries precipitated by the first revelation. Martha\u2019s confinement to Westwood Lodge was her second to that institution and her fourth hospitalization in approximately a year for various emotional, psychological and physical problems.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She was first hospitalized at the Judge Baker Center at Children\u2019s Hospital after suffering seizures in the fall of 1988. She testified that her father\u2019s last molestation of her occurred between her release from Children\u2019s Hospital and her admission to McLean Hospital in December of 1988. Her confinement to McLean was followed by her treatment at Westwood Lodge from which she was first discharged on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>June 27, 1989. During this admission she spoke of being abused by her cousins, but specifically denied being abused by anyone else, including her father. This period of confinement marked the end of her regular overnight visits with the defendant, except for a brief vacation with him on Cape Cod during the summer of 1989. She testified that the defendant masturbated in her presence during this stay with him. Shortly after this vacation, she was readmitted to Westwood Lodge and it was during this second admission that her first complaint of abuse was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The first fresh complaint witness, a psychiatrist who treated Martha at Westwood Lodge, testified that Martha\u2019s first complaint, to her in early October, 1989, was of her father\u2019s masturbating in her presence over a course of years. When the witness was asked whether Martha said anything else, the judge overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and characterized the requested testimony as part of a fresh complaint. The psychiatrist then testified that Martha, over the course of the next month, told of having intercourse with her father when she was approximately four years old. There was no objection to the psychiatrist\u2019s agreeing that there was nothing in Martha\u2019s behavior and symptoms that was \u201cinconsistent with a child who is sexually abused over a number of years.\u201d In unobjected-to redirect testimony, the witness testified to general correlations and consistencies between sexual abuse and several of the conditions and disorders she attributed to Martha.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Martha\u2019s mother was the second fresh complaint witness. After specific objection based on the untimeliness of Martha\u2019s conversation with her, she was permitted to testify that Martha first told her, in October of 1989, of her father having sexual intercourse with her \u201cwhen she was very young,\u201d and that three weeks later, she told her about later abuse \u201call through her childhood\u201d but without recounting much detail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The third fresh complaint witness was the social worker to whom Martha first complained of sexual abuse. She testified that Martha, in response to a question, told her in October of 1989 that the defendant had had intercourse with her. After a voir dire, and over objection by the defendant, the witness told of Martha telling her that she recalled the abuse as a result of having her memory jogged by a staff person coming into the room at night. She also stated that Martha had first said there was one incident of abuse and later that sexual abuse occurred repeatedly over several years. The social worker further testified that Martha did not describe the sexual contacts in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The next witness was a pediatrician specializing in adolescent medicine and child abuse and neglect who examined Martha on January 8, 1990, and testified, over objection, to a history of sexual abuse by the defendant related to her by Martha and her mother. The judge allowed the testimony \u201cas a basis of the doctor\u2019s opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The witness told of Martha\u2019s reporting that she had experienced \u201cgenital intercourse contact with her father\u201d from the time she was five to seven years old until the fall of 1988. The witness then described the physical examination she conducted and, in response to several unobjected-to questions, testified essentially that the findings derived from that examination were \u201cnot inconsistent with that kind of a history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The last two fresh complaint witnesses, testifying essentially without objection, were a police officer and an investigator for DSS who had spoken to Martha as a result of reports of sexual abuse by personnel at Westwood Lodge. The police officer, who was assigned to the sexual assault unit of the district attorney\u2019s office, interviewed Martha on January 5, 1990, and testified about Martha\u2019s detailed recounting of a long history of sexual abuse, repeating considerable specific information to the jury. The DSS investigator testified con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>cerning an interview on November 8, 1989, in which Martha spoke to her in general terms of being abused by her father when she was about four years old and to frequent later instances of his having sexual intercourse with her and masturbating in her presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Although the defendant failed to object to the fresh complaint testimony of some of the witnesses and perhaps did not challenge the others as directly as he might have, his protests with respect to promptness were sufficient to implicate the trial judge\u2019s duty of careful scrutiny to make certain that \u201cthe prejudice inherent in the admission of borderline fresh complaint evidence [did not] outweigh its probative value, particularly since the average jury might have difficulty in understanding and applying fairly the usual limiting instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lagacy, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 622, 627 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, we determine that the admission of this evidence, viewed in the light of its undue repetition (see 2[b], <em>infra), </em>created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, ante </em>65, 70-71 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In reviewing the admissibility of fresh complaint evidence, the test we apply is \u201cwhether the victim\u2019s actions were reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>400 Mass. 639, 652 (1987). See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.18.2, at 341-342 (6th ed. 1994). Our courts \u201chave not insisted on great promptness for fresh complaints in prosecutions involving child sexual abuse,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 228-229 (1989), and have acknowledged that fresh complaint analysis in such cases should be flexible and attended by due consideration of factors which reasonably might cause a child to repress the urge to cry out to a third person. See <em>id. </em>at 229; <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 625-626 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 413 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 491 (1991); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence, <em>supra </em>at 342. Among the factors which have been recognized as relevant to the determination of whether a child\u2019s complaint is reasonably prompt are \u201cthe child\u2019s age, the length of time the child has been away from an abusive setting, whether the perpetrator used threats or coercion, and whether the perpetrator is a relative or close friend of the child.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, supra </em>at 626. While cases have cataloged decisional experience, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 524-526 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, supra, </em>app. B at 416-417; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 211, app. at 219-220 (1993), and noted the approximate outer limits of previously admitted fresh complaint testimony, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 215, no absolute time limits for such testimony have been established. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, supra </em>at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In explaining her failure to report the abuse until approximately nine years after it started and about ten months after the last incident, Martha testified that \u201c[a]t first it was just very confusing and I didn\u2019t know. Then later on, when I started questioning, I thought that I didn\u2019t want to get him into trouble, and that I wanted, I mean I loved my father, and the good parts of him made up, almost made up for the bad parts.\u201d Throughout her testimony she spoke of ambivalent feelings \u2014 of having strong love for the defendant while at the same time concealing his abuse of her because of her fear that he might be jailed and that she would be unable to see him.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We recognize that in the general circumstances of this case, \u201cthe promptness of a complaint is usually measured from the date when the victim leaves the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 672 n.9 (1987). Also, although Martha did not reside with the defendant, the repeated abuse to which she testified, of itself suggests elements of control which reasonably may have in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>hibited her from complaining to a third person until after the pattern of weekly abuse ended or was significantly interrupted. In assessing the promptness of her complaints, we focus, therefore, entirely on the period between her admission to McLean Hospital in December, 1988, and the times of her report of abuse to the fresh complaint witnesses. While that time span of approximately ten to thirteen months falls well within the outer limits of the decided cases, we conclude that the complaints were on the borderline of admissibility for the following reasons: (1) in December, 1988, when the pattern of abuse was interrupted by her hospitalization, Martha was not a small child but rather an intelligent and articulate, albeit profoundly troubled, teenager<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; (2) although she was inhibited by her love and concern for the defendant, there was no evidence of any threat, intimidation or persuasion by him<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; (3) the complaints were not spontaneous but rather were responses to inquiries by the reporting witnesses and were made a considerable time after Martha had been asked during her first hospitalization at Westwood Lodge whether her father had abused her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">While these factors, viewed separately, might not lead us to treat the judge\u2019s admission of any of the complaints as being outside of his considerable discretion, see <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, supra </em>at 673, together they raise real doubt about the timeliness of the complaints which, when combined with the prejudicial effect of the number of fresh complaint witnesses, creates sufficient risk of prejudice to the defendant to require a new trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">b. <em>Repetitive complaints. </em>\u201c[Repetitive testimony from several witnesses regarding the details of the complaint may lend undue credibility to the complainant\u2019s testimony,\u201d and judges should, therefore, exercise caution in permitting fresh complaint testimony from numerous witnesses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 659-660 (1992). The risk of such \u201cpiling on\u201d of evidence is that a \u201cjury will use the details of the fresh complaints as substantive evidence that the crime actually occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 646 (1991). Here the doctrinal purpose of fresh complaint testimony \u2014 to counteract the possible discrediting effect of the absence of evidence of a prompt report<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 was satisfied well before the sixth witness took the stand. The potential mischief in repetitive testimony was realized when all of the complaint witnesses testified to reports made within a narrow time span and in response to interrelated inquiries made as part of the same treatment and investigative setting. The substantial risk that the sheer number of witnesses would cause the jury to treat their testimony as substantive, rather than corroborative, evidence was further increased by the prejudicial circumstance of the fifth and sixth witnesses testifying in considerable detail about the sexual abuse recounted by Martha.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>c. <em>Writings. </em>We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that certain of Martha\u2019s poems and letters<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> should not have been admitted in evidence. Not only were they reflective of Martha\u2019s state of mind but they properly were introduced to rebut the implication of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Martha that her allegations were recent contrivances born of her disagreement with her father with respect to whether she should be placed in a residential institutional setting upon her discharge from Westwood Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">3. <em>The motion for a new trial. </em>On November 7, 1991, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial grounded on claims of newly discovered evidence consisting of: (1) evidence that Martha, subsequent to trial, accused her stepfather of sexually abusing her since she was approximately five years old with the last incident occurring on April 17, 1991; she further alleged that her stepfather, who resided in her mother\u2019s and Martha\u2019s home during much of that period and married the mother in April of 1990, had sexual intercourse with her when she was approximately eight or nine years old; and (2) evidence that Martha accused a high school guidance counselor of abusing her sometime after the conviction of her father. In light of our decision and the possibility that further evidence may be adduced with relation to the subject matter of these accusations, we think it best to leave any related evidentiary issues to the judgment of the judge who will preside over any retrial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>4. <em>Issues which may arise upon retrial. </em>Although the following issues were not argued to us and therefore were not factored into our decision, we address them because of the possibility they may arise upon retrial. Improper and prejudicial hearsay may have been insinuated in the trial when the third fresh complaint witness, the social worker, went well beyond relating corroborating evidence and told of Martha speaking to her of a recent event which triggered her memory of abuse, an event not referred to by Martha in her own testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 351 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 527 (1991). Also, the psychiatrist and pediatrician, in addition to testifying to complaints of abuse made to them by Martha, rendered opinions that Martha\u2019s behavior, symptoms and physical condition were consistent with the type of repeated sexual abuse reported by her. Not only did this opinion evidence cross the line between description of typical symptoms of sexually abused children and testimony relating those symptoms to the victim in the case, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. at 628-629; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 421 (1990), but it also created a substantial risk of the jury giving substantive effect to the same witnesses\u2019s fresh complaint testimony. Notwithstanding the theoretical right of a qualified fresh complaint witness also to testify to the general characteristics of sexually abused children, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 827, 832 (1994), prosecutors would be well advised to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>avoid such juxtaposition and, if it occurs, trial judges should be alert to its considerable prejudicial potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Upon retrial, the prosecution should be limited to calling only a reasonable number of fresh complaint witnesses and such witnesses, along with any other experts,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> should not be permitted to opine as to whether Martha\u2019s behavior or condition in any way conformed to or was consistent with the general characteristics of a sexually abused child.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\"> The defendant was sentenced to a term of not less than thirty years and not more than forty years at Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Cedar Junction on one of the rape indictments and to various concurrent terms on each of the other indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\"> She testified that in addition to having sexual intercourse with her, her father would rub her breasts, put his fingers in her vagina and have her masturbate him. She also testified to his masturbating in her presence during overnight and day visits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> The testimony of the therapist who treated Martha during her first admission to Westwood Lodge, and a staff psychiatrist who treated her during the second admission, indicated that Martha suffered from chronic depression, anorexia nervosa, pseudo-seizures, self-destructive behavior, flashbacks and borderline personality disorder, accompanied by related physical problems, but that she was not psychotic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\"> The judge, just prior to this point, gave an appropriate instruction to the jurors explaining to them their function with respect to fresh complaint testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> If the pediatrician\u2019s testimony was admitted as evidence that Martha was the victim of sexual abuse, there was no need of identifying the perpetrator. We, therefore, view the pediatrician\u2019s testimony as also having been admitted as fresh complaint evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\"> We again call attention to the preferred practice of preliminary analysis and express ruling on whether a complaint is late as matter of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 413 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 211, 217 n.11 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> Although there was expert evidence that delayed disclosure is often associated with child abuse, there was no mention of hospital confinement as a contributing factor to such delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\"> Some cases have permitted delayed disclosure on the basis of inhibiting influences, notwithstanding the absence of evidence of threat, intimidation, or persuasion by the defendant. However, they generally involve abuse which occurs and ends while the victim is quite young. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bremer, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 930 (1984) (victim was seven and eight years old during abuse; no mention in opinion of evidence of threat, intimidation or persuasion by the defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rockwood, </em>27 Mass.

Such information may raise issues of admissibility to be analyzed- under the principles enunciated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bo-hannon, </em>376 Mass. 90 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 152 n.4 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hrycenko, </em>417 Mass. 309, 318-319 (1994); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rathburn, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 699 (1988). The applicability of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, may also have to be addressed together with exceptions to that statute, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, </em>399 Mass. 811, 814-817 (1987), and along with issues of whether such accusations are relevant, see <em>id. </em>at 816; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baxter, ante </em>45 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> An expert called by the prosecution agreed, without objection, that certain facts she was asked to assume, which were based on previously admitted evidence, would not be \u201cinconsistent with a child who was sexually abused from age five to approximately age fourteen by her father.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
