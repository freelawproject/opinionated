The plaintiff advances alternate theories: first, he alleges that the services were rendered directly to Modern, and thus, Modern owed him for their fair value. Alternatively, he claims that he is entitled to recover under a payment bond issued by the defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company (National) to Modern with respect to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in holding that the plaintiff sufficiently complied with the notice requirement of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, the payment bond statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to permit recovery on the bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think that in the particular circumstances presented here the judge properly could conclude the statutory notice and statement of claim requirements of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The relevant facts are taken from the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff was engaged in February, 1990, by J.S.L. Corporation (J.S.L.), a subcontractor to Modern on this project, to perform trucking and hauling services. Upon completion of his work, he submitted a bill to J.S.L. for $1,678.75. Shortly thereafter, he received a check from Modern, made payable jointly to J.S.L. and to him, for $1,580. When he received the check, J.S.L. had already endorsed it. The plaintiff deposited the check and then sought to obtain the difference he was owed by notifying both J.S.L. and Modern. The bookkeeper for Modern told him that the company paid for hauling services at the rate of $40 per hour, whereas he, Bastianelli, had billed at $42.50 per hour. The plaintiff persisted in his demand, and eventually Modern sent him a second check for the difference of $98.75. This second check initially was issued to the plaintiff and J.S.L. jointly, but when J.S.L. refused to endorse it, another check was issued to the plaintiff alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In June, 1990, the plaintiff did some more work for J.S.L. on the same project. Upon completion, the plaintiff sent an invoice for his work to Modern, made out to J.S.L. in care of Modern. The daily time slips, which were forwarded with the invoice, were all addressed to J.S.L. Modern initially declined to pay the plaintiff, taking the position that it had paid J.S.L. what J.S.L. was due and that the plaintiff had to look to J.S.L. for payment. A later offer by Modern to pay a compromise amount was declined by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The judge correctly stated that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, \u201cdoes not prescribe the form of the required notice\u201d and all that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the claimant is required to do is state with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party for whom the work was performed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concluding that the invoice accompanied by the daily slips fulfilled this notice requirement, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover $1,955 from the surety company under its bond and to reasonable legal fees. National appeals from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">National argues that the plaintiff did not comply with the notice requirement of the statute because the invoices sent by the plaintiff to Modern did not reasonably put it on notice that the plaintiff was seeking recovery from the general contractor under the payment bond statute. See <em>Cinder Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Schena Constr. Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 929 (1986). There was no reversible error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The defendant places principal reliance on Federal case law to support its argument that invoices are not sufficient to constitute notice. See <em>United States ex rel American Radiator &amp; Standard Corp. </em>v. <em>Northwestern Engr. Co., </em>122 F.2d 600, 602 (8th Cir. 1941). However, in that case, the claimant submitted the invoices only to the subcontractor who, in turn, \u201cappeared\u201d to have given them to the general contractor merely for use in arriving at estimated payments which the government was to make. A later Federal case, <em>United States ex rel Blue Circle West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tucson Mech. Contracting, </em>921 F.2d 911, 914 (9th Cir. 1990), is likewise inap-posite. Similarly, in a case cited by the defendant, <em>Barboza </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 323, 325, 327-328 (1984), the claimant\u2019s written notice to the general contractor was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In the circumstances of this case, where the general contractor had previously paid the claimant directly, had notice of the subcontractor\u2019s lack of cooperation, received its own copy of the invoice (and daily time slips) from the claimant, and offered a compromise amount to the claimant, \u201c[w]e cannot say the judge\u2019s ultimate finding that the claim of notice met the requirements of the statute \u2018is either clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the relevant legal standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Worcester Air Conditioning Co. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 352, 357 (1982), quoting from <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>369 Mass. 501, 508 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We make one final comment. Given the amount of money at stake ($1,955) and the fact of <em>actual knowledge </em>by the general contractor, we ordinarily would consider imposing sanctions on the appellant\u2019s attorney (see <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 457 [1993]), but for his claim that the matter at issue here is of great importance and genuine concern to the construction bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> At the jury-waived trial, the judge ruled in favor of Modern on all counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\"> It has not been made to appear, nor has it been argued, that the judge\u2019s findings are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\"> The judge stated that Modern \u201cdoes not dispute that it received the invoice and backup material within the time period prescribed in the statute.\u201d That statement is challenged on appeal, but see note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> As to a claim that the plaintiff failed to send notice by registered or certified mail, it is sufficient to say that \u201c[i]f actual timely notice is proved . . . , failure to comply with [such] requirement is not a fatal deviation from statutory procedures.\u201d <em>Cinder Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Schena Constr. Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 929, and cases cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
