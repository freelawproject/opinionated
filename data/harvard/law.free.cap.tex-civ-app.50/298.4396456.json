No duty rests upon the consignee to give notice to the company that he is about to unload the ear, and in case of injury to a consignee or his employe while so engaged, caused by moving the car, the burden is upon the company to show facts which would relieve it from, the duty of knowing or anticipating the presence of. such person in the ear at the time.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-10\">Appeal from the District Court of Hill County.

The plaintiff was not a trespasser, but was lawfully in the car on the track and it was the duty of the appellee to so operate its cars as not to injure the appellant, at least it was its duty not to be guilty of negligence. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Thomas, 107 S. W., 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Mr. Thompson, in his excellent work on Negligence, vol. 2, sec. 1841, states the rule thus. \u201cWhere the shippers or consignees of car loads of freight assume the task of loading or unloading the cars on the side track of the company, with its consent, express or implied, the company is not at liberty to act toward them or their servants as though they were trespassers or bare licensees, but is bound to exercise ordinary care to the end of avoiding injury to them while so engaged. If, therefore, while so engaged, and without negligence on their own part, other than that inattention to their own safety which an absorption in their duties in which they are engaged naturally produces, they are hurt by the negligence of the employes of the railway company they have an action for damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">In such a case as this the railway company should have anticipated the presence of some one at the car and should have operated the cars with that in view to avoid injury, and negligence in handling cars, if any, will not relieve it from liability if it occasions the injury. The railway company owed plaintiff the duty of care not to injure him, and this did not depend upon .whether or not it knew of his presence in the car. Watson v. Railway Company, 66 Iowa, 164. Therefore, the charge relieving the railway company from the consequences of its negligence, if any, if they did not know or could not have known by reasonable care, was at least misleading, because plaintiff\u2019s presence should have been anticipated and the employes have acted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Tinder the facts we think the court erred in leaving it to the jury to determine whether or not plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in not advising appellee of his presence at the car, at the time of the injury. The railway company had placed the car on the side track to be unloaded and thereby impliedly invited the plaintiff to unload, and his presence there for that purpose was lawful and should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>expected by the employes, and he, to avoid negligence, was under no obligation to warn the company of his presence at the car at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">If the employes negligently propelled cars against the fruit car and injured the plaintiff, it devolved upon the company to show facts that would relieve it from the duty of knowing, or anticipating, the presence of plaintiff in the car at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
