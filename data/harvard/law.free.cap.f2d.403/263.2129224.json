The specification describes the state of the prior art:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-22\">Although hair bands or protectors have been proposed heretofore for the same general purpose they were objectionable for one reason or another. Primarily, prior protectors required moving the arms behind the head when the user applied the protector and such prior devices were not readily adjustable to the hair line of the forehead and the back of the neck. Moreover, such prior protectors were tied by means of tapes at their ends or had fasteners at the back of the head which were difficult to engage. Additionally, fasteners at the back included projections of one kind or another which were objectionable because they could not be seen by the user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-23\">Appellant\u2019s solution to those problems is a band having (1) an elastic secured centrally of its lower edge to provide a gathering or pocket for receiving the hair at the back of the neck, and (2) a fastener at its ends to permit the wearer to secure the ends at the forehead, as reflected in claims 1 and 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-24\">1. A hair protector comprising an elongate band having a longitudinal upper edge and a longitudinal lower edge, an elastic secured to said lower edge between the ends thereof and only along the center portion thereof, said band being gathered where it is secured to said elastic to provide a hair receiving pocket, and a fastener on the ends of said band.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-25\">2. A hair protector as defined in claim 1 wherein said fastener is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>prised of flexible patches having interengageable mating surfaces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Claims 3 and 4 differ from the above in additionally reciting particular materials of which the band is made, but appellant does not appear to have attached any patentable significance to those limitations below.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The examiner noted that Kursh shows an elongated band used to protect the hair during the application and removal of cosmetics. The band is fastened at the forehead by tying and is of a length to encircle the head twice at the hairline, although it \u201cmay be cut in half or shorter lengths, and used as a hair bow, or as a bandeau.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] \u201d The bandeau, said the board, \u201cwill be substantially of the same length as appellant\u2019s and would lack only the fastening patches and the elastic gathering, which are shown to be conventional means for the same purpose in the art by the patents to Reinsberg and Toellner, respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Our review of the record in light of appellant\u2019s arguments satisfies us that the board did not commit the reversible error complained of. While we appreciate appellant\u2019s position, we agree with the examiner and board that one of ordinary skill in this art would find it obvious to adapt the snood of Toellner\u2019s head covering, designed as it is to \u201ccover and confine hair worn in a variety of hair styl\u00e9s,\u201d for use as a portion of the band of Kursh, particularly if it were found that Kursh\u2019s band tended to unduly bind the hair to the wearer\u2019s head. Similarly, the substitution of convenient interengageable plastic patches for the tie fastening means of Kursh would be obvious to those in the relevant art in view of Reinsberg\u2019s disclosure of the use of the former fastening means<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to secure the front flaps of his hair screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">SMITH, J., participated in the hearing of this case but died before a decision was reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-17\">.
