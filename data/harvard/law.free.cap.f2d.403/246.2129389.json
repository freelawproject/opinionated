The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on June 28, 1968, wherein he recommended that plaintiff is entitled to recover disability retirement pay, computed on the basis of a disability rating of 40 per centum, from the day following the date of his removal from the Temporary Disability Retired List, less such deductions as may be appropriate, with judgment to be entered for plaintiff and the amount of recovery to be determined in further proceedings pursuant to Rule 47 (c). Although defendant obtained extensions of time for the purpose of filing exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s opinion and report, neither side filed exceptions and on October 1, 1968, the parties filed a stipulation for entry of judgment, based upon the recommendation made by the commissioner, stipulating that judgment be entered for plaintiff in the sum of $18,-034.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Since the court agrees with the commissioner\u2019s opinion, findings and recommended conclusion of law, it hereby adopts the same, as hereinafter set forth, together with the stipulation of the parties filed October 1,1968, as the basis for its judgment in this case. Therefore plaintiff is entitled to recover and judgment is entered for plaintiff in the sum of $18,034.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">GAMER, Commissioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">On September 1, 1955, plaintiff, a doctor and Army captain, was, after, separation from the service for physical disability, placed on the Temporary Disability Retired List. While on such list he received disability retirement pay. However, on June 30, 1960, plaintiff was, upon a finding that he was then deemed physically fit for active duty, removed from the list. His disability retirement pay thereupon ceased. Plaintiff then applied to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to correct his records to show he was actually physically unfit on June 30, 1960, with a permanent disability rating of 40 percent. However, on December 16, 1964, the Board, after a hearing, concluded that the finding that plaintiff was fit for duty at the time he was removed from the Temporary Disability Retired List was neither erroneous nor unjust, and accordingly recommended that plaintiff\u2019s application be denied. On February 10, 1965, the Secretary of the Army approved the Board\u2019s findings and recommendation and denied plaintiff\u2019s application, and on March 30, 1965, plaintiff filed his petition herein, claiming such action to be arbitrary, without substantial evidentiary support, and legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">Prior to his tour of duty in the Army (July 1, 1953 \u2014 September 1, 1955) which led to his being placed on the Temporary Disability Retired List, plaintiff had, from July 1, 1943, to December 22, 1945, served on active duty in the Navy as an enlisted man. He had incurred an ulcer during such Navy service, for which, after release from active duty, he received a 10 percent disability rating from the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>After his release from such active Navy duty, plaintiff completed his studies at medical school. He then became a hospital intern and thereafter a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In 1950, the so-called Medical Registrants Act (amending the Selective Service Act of 1948) was passed (Pub. L. No. <em>779, </em>Sept. 9, 1950, 64 Stat. 826) in response to the Services\u2019 needs arising from the outbreak of the Korean conflict. The Act authorized the President to require, on the basis of requisitions submitted by the Department of Defense, the special registration of certain persons (i. e., below age fifty) qualified in specified medical and allied specialist categories and needed by the Services, with persons called thereunder to be \u201cliable for induction for not to exceed twenty-one months of service in the Armed Forces.\u201d (Sec. 1)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Because of his ulcer condition, plaintiff had been classified in the draft as physically disqualified (4-F). However, on December 24, 1952, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Anna Rosenberg, issued a memorandum to the Secretary of the Army pertaining to \u201cPhysical Standards for Physicians * * which stated that \u201cIt shall be the policy of the Department of Defense to consider all physicians * * * potentially acceptable for military service, provided they can reasonably be expected to be productive in the Armed Forces,\u201d and that such policy permitted \u201cthe re-evaluation of certain physicians * * * who as a result of previous physical examinations have been classified as physically disqualified because of substandard physical findings.\u201d The memorandum went on to provide that \u201cIn general, those with static impairment and those with chronic progressive or recurrent diseases, if asymptomatic or relatively so are considered to be acceptable for service.\u201d Promptly after the issuance of this new policy, sometimes referred to as the \u201cRosenberg standards,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s draft board ordered him to report for an Armed Forces Physical Examination, which was had on January <em>7, </em>1953. Plaintiff\u2019s history showed that, during the approximately eight-year period from its inception in 1945 to the physical examination in 1953, his ulcer had hemorrhaged three times; first in 1946, while he was a medical student (and which was during his strenuous, concentrated and accelerated naval medical training pro-' gram), and when plaintiff\u2019s ulcer condition was first confirmed; the second, three years later, in 1949, while he was a hospital intern (during a period of unusually arduous duty, intensified by a polio epidemic in the community) ; and the third time, again some three years later, in 1952, while he was a hospital resident (apparently induced by cortisone treatments for an asthmatic condition, and considered as a minimal episode). This last episode had occurred only four months prior to the physical examination. During the three-year periods between the hemorrhages, plaintiff had been relatively symptom free, and was able to control his condition successfully with occasional antacid medication and by maintaining a restricted diet. Except for the hemorrhage periods themselves and the following periods of convalescence, plaintiff\u2019s condition did not seriously interfere with his work, and at the time of his examination he was again quite symptom free, although still observing diet and medication requirements. However, despite the \u201cRosenberg standards\u201d, and the then apparently quiescent state of plaintiff\u2019s ulcer, the examining physician, after noting plaintiff\u2019s history of three hemorrhages and that plaintiff was \u201cstill on treatment,\u201d found plaintiff to be disqualified for military service (the Rosenberg memorandum also stating that the new policy promulgated should not \u201cbe construed to mean\u201d that the persons covered thereby should be \u201cassigned to duties * * * which are beyond the limitations imposed by their physical capabilities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Shortly thereafter the Army\u2019s Adjutant General, by memorandum of January 12, 1953, advised the various Commanders in Chief that, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Rosenberg standards, \u201cexamining physicians and reviewing authorities\u201d were permitted \u201cto use their discretion in the application of existing physical standards if the special registrant can be reasonably expected to be physically capable of performing military service and to remain so for a reasonable period of time.\u201d The memorandum listed certain \u201cconditions * * * previously considered as a cause for rejection [which] may now be considered as acceptable for appropriate assignment consideration.\u201d One of such conditions listed was \u201cPeptic ulcers, unless complicated by obstruction or verified history of repeated hemorrhage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On March 9, 1953, the Medical Section, First Army, in reviewing plaintiff\u2019s case, concluded that plaintiff should serve, finding him \u201cto be physically qualified for general military duty with waiver for duodenal ulcer.\u201d Apparently, the Section did not feel that plaintiff\u2019s case showed a \u201chistory of repeated hemorrhage\u201d within the meaning of the Adjutant General\u2019s memorandum, there also being no indication of obstruction complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Instead of thus being subject to the draft, plaintiff promptly thereafter applied to the Army for extended active duty, and on April 17, 1953, was commissioned as First Lieutenant, Medical Corps, United States Army Reserve. The appointment was subject, however, to a medical examination showing qualification for such service. Accordingly, plaintiff underwent another physical examination. Again the physician conducting such examination concluded (after a consultation with a gastroenterologist) that, because of the hemorrhage history, plaintiff was \u201cnot qualified for General Service,\u201d but once more the Medical Section found him so qualified \u201cwith waiver for history of duodenal ulcer,\u201d and plaintiff was shortly thereafter ordered to report for active duty on July 1, 1953 (his VA 10 percent compensation award ceasing upon such date). Two months later, plaintiff found himself in Korea.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Although the Korean Armistice had been signed on July 27, 1953, shortly before plaintiff arrived in Korea in September 1953, the area was still officially classified as a \u201ccombat zone,\u201d and remained so classified throughout the period of plaintiff\u2019s tour of duty there, i. e., to January 1955. For the most part, plaintiff\u2019s duties were arduous and at times hazardous. Generally working twelve hours a day, plus many night calls, he handled, with inadequate help, a very large patient load. He had very little time off. For a period of some five months (October 1953 \u2014 February 1954) he was in charge of the 12th Dispensary at Pusan. A great fire broke out in Pusan in November 1953, in which about a third of the city was destroyed, and plaintiff was in charge, for approximately a month, of a hospital train in the city\u2019s port area, which was set up to serve 35,000-40,000 refugees. Thereafter, plaintiff served for a period on a hospital train transporting injured soldiers from Chongkok to Wonju, which was north of the 38th parallel, the area still being subject to sporadic fighting (sections of the railroad having been blown up, and the train itself being equipped with gun plates and mounted guns). He then served for a period in Sokchori, which was north of what had been the main resistance line, and where there was still some guerrilla warfare. A second great fire occurred in Pusan in January 1954, when plaintiff took charge of another hospital train for another month, during which time he (and four less well-trained Korean doctors) treated approximately one thousand patients a day. Thereafter, he took charge of the 132nd Dispensary at Pusan. In addition to the American military, he had to serve the needs of Korean military units, Red Cross and United Nations personnel, and members of the Merchant Marine. Between March 1954 and January 1955, plaintiff was sometimes required, in addition to his full-time medical duties, to perform dangerous intelligence work relating to traffic in narcotics from 4-5 a. m. to 8 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The severe nervous tension and strain to which plaintiff was subjected during his difficult assignments were not, of course, favorable to his ulcer condition. He could not maintain a disciplined ulcer diet, nor, considering his long hours, huge patient load, extended periods of little or no sleep, and supervisory responsibilities, could he obtain adequate rest or relaxation. The general conditions under which plaintiff was required to serve were often quite adverse. At Sokchori, the temperature did not go above zero, plaintiff\u2019s quarters consisting of thin plywood barracks with small kerosene heaters. On the Chongkok hospital train, there was no heat at all for six days, and no running water.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Plaintiff performed his duties with such distinction that he received many commendations, as well as the Bronze Star Medal, his citations noting his \u201cmeritorious achievement,\u201d his \u201cunusual ability,\u201d his \u201coutstanding initiative and constant devotion to duty,\u201d and his giving \u201cunstintingly of his time to fulfill his mission.\u201d However, the arduous service took its physical toll. Shortly after his arrival in Korea in September 1953, he had experienced ulcer pains and some hemorrhage. He was, however, with treatment at the dispensary, able to continue with his duties without significant interruption, despite some food difficulties (inability to retain food, loss of appetite, abdominal distension), and soon thereafter the ulcer again became relatively quiescent, with only minor episodes experienced until October 1954. In that month, however, plaintiff suffered an acute exacerbation. X-rays indicated a \u201cdeformed duodenal bulb.\u201d He experienced sharp pains almost daily, a condition which persisted throughout his remaining Korean period of assignment. During such period, he experienced nausea, vomiting (caused by inability to retain food, indicating some obstruction, and requiring small multiple feedings), and five hemorrhage episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">On January 24, 1955, plaintiff\u2019s tour of duty in Korea ended and he was returned to the United States for service at the Army Hospital at Fort McPherson, Georgia. Before entering on such assignment, however, plaintiff, attempting to recuperate, first took a month\u2019s leave, but his symptoms persisted. Although serving at the hospital as a resident physician, he himself received treatment there on an out-patient basis. He complained of almost constant pain. In February 1955, plaintiff experienced two hemorrhages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> X-rays indicated a partial closing (stenosis) of the pylorus (the region of the opening from the stomach into the intestine in which the duodenal cap is located and through which cap everything from the stomach passes). Hospitalization was considered, but, due to the doctor shortage, plaintiff was asked to carry on as best he could, and he did. However, with his symptoms persisting, plaintiff was, on June 9,1955, finally admitted as a patient at the Fort Benning Army Hospital. X-rays again indicated a chronic deformed duodenal cap and \u201cmarked pyloric stenosis.\u201d The Chief of the hospital\u2019s Gastroenterology Section diagnosed plaintiff\u2019s condition as an active duodenal ulcer and recommended that plaintiff appear before a medical board \u201cfor consideration of separation from the service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">On June 21, 1955, plaintiff was transferred back to Fort McPherson Army Hospital, his duty station, but this time as a patient, and on June 24, 1955, a Disposition Board diagnosed plaintiff\u2019s condition as \u201culcer, duodenum * * * with pyloric obstruction,\u201d a condition which it found originated in 1945 while he was in the Navy but which was permanently aggravated by his Army service. It accordingly recommended that plaintiff appear before a physical evaluation board.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">On July 5, 1955, plaintiff appeared before a Physical Evaluation Board at Fort McPherson, which heard testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>from plaintiff, the Chief of Medicine at the hospital, who had examined and was treating plaintiff (who testified, among other things, that, in his opinion, plaintiff was at that time, \u201ctotally incapacitated for routine medical practice\u201d and that his ability to engage in the practice of medicine in the future would be impaired since he would not be able to \u201cparticipate in a full-time medical practice without damage to his health\u201d), and the doctor in charge of the hospital (whose opinion also was that plaintiff was not physically capable of performing the type of duty required at the hospital and that his ability to carry on a civilian medical practice would be impaired). The Board, finding that plaintiff \u201cis beyond any doubt physically incapacitated to continue in any capacity in his office, rank, or grade\u201d and that \u201cfollowing separation from the military service, this individual\u2019s capacity for gainful civilian occupation will be comparably impaired,\u201d found plaintiff to be permanently unfit for service as a result of a \u201cmoderately severe\u201d duodenal ulcer with a 40 percent disability rating (in accordance with the Veterans Administration Schedule for Rating Disabilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">However, upon review, the Army Physical Review Council (in the Adjutant General\u2019s Office), although finding that \u201caccording to evidence of record and well established medical principles,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s ulcer \u201coriginated prior to military service but was aggravated during service,\u201d but nevertheless feeling that plaintiff\u2019s disability was \u201cof such nature that it may improve sufficiently within a five year period\u201d so as to render him fit for military service, concluded that plaintiff\u2019s case justified reevaluation in eighteen months. It further concluded that, since plaintiff\u2019s defect \u201cwas ratable at 10 percentum at the time of entry into active military service and at 40 percentum * * * at the time of final evaluation,\u201d therefore \u201cthe net disability resulting from aggravation during service is 30 percentum.\u201d Plaintiff accepted the findings of the Council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Under Title IV of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802, \u00a7\u00a7 401-414,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> each service Secretary is required to establish a temporary disability retired list upon which members of the service who are unfit by reason of physical disability incurred while entitled to receive basic pay are entitled to receive disability retirement pay, provided that the disability is at least 30 percent in accordance with the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, and that \u201caccepted medical principles indicate that such disability may be of a permanent nature\u201d (\u00a7 402(a)). The Act further provides that the member\u2019s name cannot be on such list more than five years (\u00a7 402 (d) ), with periodic physical examinations required at least once every eighteen months to determine whether there has been any change in the disability (\u00a7 402 (e) ). If, either as a result of any such periodic examination, or at the end of five years, it is determined that the disability (at least 30 percent) is permanent, the member is then removed from the temporary list and becomes permanently retired. However, if any such determination is that the disability is less than 30 percent, the member is then removed from the temporary list and is separated from the service with entitlement only to disability severance pay. If not made prior thereto, the Secretary concerned is required, at the end of the five-year period, to make a final determination. (Id.) Furthermore, if, as a result of any such periodic examination, the member (of a Reserve component, which plaintiff was) is found to be physically fit, he is (subject to his consent) reappointed in his component (\u00a7 405(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>In accordance with said provisions of the Career Compensation Act, plaintiff was, effective September 1, 1955, placed on the Army\u2019s Temporary Disability Retired List, receiving disability retirement pay based upon his grade (Captain) and years of service. He then entered the private practice of medicine, restricting his hours, however, so as to avoid undue stress and strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Thereafter, plaintiff remained on such list, receiving disability retirement pay, until June 30, 1960, almost five years, upon which date he was removed therefrom. During such period he had four periodic examinations. Following the last one, plaintiff was declared physically fit for active duty. Plaintiff then applied to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to correct his records to show he was in fact permanently physically unfit on June 30, 1960, with a disability rating of 40 percent and therefore eligible to continue to receive disability retirement pay. After a hearing, however, and upon also considering the records in plaintiff\u2019s case, including an opinion from the Surgeon General, the Board concluded that the finding that plaintiff was fit for duty at the time he was removed from the Temporary Disability Retired List \u201cwas not in error or unjust,\u201d and recommended that plaintiff\u2019s application for correction of his records be denied, a recommendation which the Secretary of the Army approved on February 10, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">For the following reasons, it is concluded that the action that was taken in denying plaintiff further disability retirement pay on the grounds that he was physically fit for active duty is so contrary to the compelling weight of the evidence that it cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Correction Board does not indicate, by any kind of reasoned analysis, the evidentiary basis for its fundamental ultimate finding that \u201cupon his [plaintiff\u2019s] removal from the Temporary Disability Retired List, there is no recorded, verified, or documented period of ulcer disease, to a degree to warrant a finding of unfitness for duty.\u201d Nor is it possible, by an independent analysis of the evidence, to detect upon what the finding is based, since all the probative evidence is the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">There apparently is no attack by the Board upon the original action taken in 1955 by the Army Physical Review Council and the Adjutant General, acting for the Secretary, in affirming the Physical Evaluation Board\u2019s finding that the 10 percent ulcer disability plaintiff had when he entered Army service in 1953 \u201cwas aggravated during service\u201d to 40 percent, and in therefore placing plaintiff upon the Temporary Disability Retired List. Nor, in the light of the evidence as set forth above concerning the severe exacerbation plaintiff suffered toward the end of his extremely arduous Korean tour of duty, the sustained manifestation of painful symptoms thereafter, including five hemorrhage episodes in Korea and two more after his return to the United States, his hospital treatments, and the numerous physical examinations and X-rays, all showing, among other things, a chronic deformed duodenal cap condition, could any such attack be successfully made. In addition, shortly after his separation from the Army, plaintiff was further examined by the VA and was similarly rated 40 percent disabled, the disability again being described as an aggravation resulting from his Army service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Consequently, defendant\u2019s present contention \u201cthat plaintiff\u2019s condition during his entire [Army] military service [i. <em>e., </em>from July 1, 1953, to September 1,1955] remained substantially the same as the condition that existed before his 1953 military service\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br., pp. 19-20) is not only rebutted by the overwhelming weight of the probative evidence of record, but is also not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>supported by any of the Secretary\u2019s own findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Accordingly, the conclusion in 1960 that plaintiff was then fit for active duty necessarily means that sometime between 1955, when plaintiff was properly placed on the Temporary Disability Retired List with a 40 percent disability rating, and 1960, when he was removed from the list as being fit for duty, his ulcer condition either became cured or at least so improved as to render him so physically fit, and that such was his condition at the time of his release on June 30, 1960. Since, as shown, placement on the Temporary Disability Retired List follows a binding Secretarial finding of then existing physical disability to a degree warranting the receipt of disability retirement pay, which disability \u201cmay be\u201d permanent, it is only the condition which exists at the time of removal from the list that is pertinent. Nolte v. United States, 177 Ct.Cl. 1069 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The evidence shows, however, that during such 1955-1960 period, plaintiff had four periodic physical examinations and none indicated any such cure or marked improvement from the 40 percent disability finding made in 1955. As shown below, they all indicated, on the other hand, not only no such improvement, but that his condition had become permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On February 5, 1967, a Medical Board, following plaintiff\u2019s first periodic examination, concluded that plaintiff had a chronic duodenal ulcer, with \u201cscarring resultant stenosis,\u201d that his \u201cdisability has become permanent,\u201d that he was unfit for duty, and that he should appear before a physical evaluation board for reevaluation (as to permanency). On review, however, it was determined that plaintiff should continue on the Temporary Disability Retired List without, at that time, a physical evaluation board reevaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">On July 8, 1958, plaintiff underwent his second periodic examination. His symptoms of pain had continued, he had, in the summer of 1957, had another hemorrhage, and he was under the care of physicians. He was on a six-to-eight times\u2019 daily feeding schedule, was on antacid medication, and, when unable to obtain the required eight-to-nine hours\u2019 rest daily, experienced more severe symptoms and required additional therapy. After X-rays again showed a \u201cdeformed\u201d and \u201cconstricted\u201d duodenal bulb <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Medical Board once more concluded that plaintiff had a \u201cchronic duodenal ulcer with exacerbations and remissions,\u201d that, under plaintiff\u2019s restricted practice \u201cadjusted to his limitations of rest and diet,\u201d he was functioning \u201cnormally,\u201d but that a \u201cflareup of symptoms\u201d would in all probability result from a \u201cdeviation from this routine.\u201d Accordingly, since it concluded that plaintiff was \u201cincapacitated for further military service\u201d despite the fact that \u201c[i]n a restricted environment he is able to perform satisfactory work in civilian life,\u201d and, further, that his \u201cdisability has become permanent,\u201d it recommended that plaintiff \u201cappear before a Physical Evaluation Board with a view to permanent disability retirement.\u201d This time the Medical Board\u2019s recommendation that plaintiff appear before a Physical Evaluation Board was approved and, on August 28, 1958, plaintiff did so appear (after, however, plaintiff had, in the latter part of July 1958 experienced another hemorrhage episode, which had lasted about two days). After a hearing, the Physical Evaluation Board too found plaintiff \u201cphysically unfit for further military service,\u201d 'again rating the disability 40 percent. However, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>still felt that plaintiff should remain on the Temporary List and be reevaluated in a year (the Board\u2019s findings and recommendation being approved by the Army Review Council).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In the latter part of 1958, plaintiff experienced a disabling episode of hepatitis, the illness clearing up during the first half of 1959. However, it was followed by a period when his ulcer pain symptoms became particularly troublesome (apparently, however, without any hemorrhage episodes). Plaintiff was not able to return to his practice until around July 1, 1959, and then only on a basis of further reducing his previously restricted work-hour schedule by 50 percent, thereby cutting his practice in half.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On September 8, 1959, plaintiff underwent his third periodic physical examination, which included another X-ray series. At that time plaintiff, whether as a result of his reduced work schedule or otherwise, was feeling better, the ulcer then apparently being in a state of remission. However, the Medical Board again concluded that plaintiff was permanently disabled to a degree warranting disability compensation. Nevertheless, it recommended his continuation on the Temporary List,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which recommendation was adopted by the Adjutant General.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Following his third periodic examination, plaintiff found that, despite his continuing to maintain his 50 percent work schedule, his ulcer symptoms persisted. He suffered epigastric burning pains, for which medication was required and which, at times, interfered with his sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s fourth and final periodic examination was conducted on February 24, 1960, only around five and one-half months after the previous one. The Medical Board, after reviewing plaintiff\u2019s history, including his symptoms and condition since his last examination, concluded that the previous diagnoses were still appropriate, that plaintiff\u2019s ulcer disability \u201cpersists,\u201d and, as had each of the three previous Medical Boards, that the disability had been \u201cpermanently aggravated by active duty.\u201d It recommended his appearance before a physical evaluation board.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">After such Physical Evaluation Board proceedings, the Board, on March 24, 1960, found plaintiff to be \u201cphysically unfit for further military service by reason of\u201d his ulcer. The disability was rated \u201cmoderately severe\u201d (\u201cwithout obstruction, but with history of hemorrhages\u201d), carrying a rating of 40 percent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>However, on May 3, 1960, plaintiff was advised by the Adjutant General that the Army Physical Review Council had, after reviewing the Physical Eval\u00faation Board proceedings, recommended that \u201cyou be deemed physically fit for the performance of active military duty commensurate with your age and rank. There was no analysis of the evidence upon which the Review Council\u2019s conclusion and recommendation were based or any explanation or reasons given for the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"Aak\">On June 7, 1960, plaintiff was advised by the Adjutant General that the Army Physical Disability Appeal Board had, following plaintiff\u2019s protest and rebuttal of the Review Council\u2019s recommendation, concurred in the Council\u2019s findings that plaintiff was physically fit for active duty. Again there was nothing in the way of an analysis of the evidence or any reasons given upon which such concurrence was based.</p>\n<p id=\"A9A\">Following plaintiff\u2019s removal from the Temporary Disability Retired List on June 30, 1960, and his October 18, 1961, application to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to correct his records to show that he was, on such date, permanently physically unfit for active duty, such Board sought an opinion from the Surgeon General. That office, on August 9, 1962, expressed the opinion that there is no medical evidence that the applicant had an active duodenal u cer at the time of separation,\u201d and that plaintiff was therefore \u2018fit for active military service at the time of his separation. It thus concluded that there was no merit to plaintiffs complaint of error or injustice m the medical aspects of his separation from the service.\u201d Agam, however, there was no analysis of the evidence or reasons given upon which the conclusion was based.</p>\n<p id=\"A_X\">In 1963 plaintiff, because of his ulcer condition, gave up the private practice of medicine. He then became a hospital resident experimenting in the field of artificial kidneys, and the following year became employed by a company making such kidneys. On this employment his work hours were substantially his own, his time being spent principally on research work and writing,</p>\n<p id=\"At6\">Thereafter, on December 16, 1964, the Correction Board held a hearing on plaintiff\u2019s application, at which plaintiff was the only witness. Following the hearing, the Board, on such date, recommended that plaintiff\u2019s application be denied. It conciuded that, as of the date of his removal from the Temporary List, there was \u00abn0 recorded, verified, or documented period of ulcer disease, to a degree to warrant a finding of unfitness for duty,\u201d and that during the five-year period he was on such list ,\u201cthere is no evidence of necessity for prolonged or frequent hospitalization, other than for periodic evaluation, unequivocal X-Ray findings of ulcer activity, objective and verified episodes of recurrent bleeding, 0r perforation or obstruction.\u201d It further found that the policy under which Special Registrants were inducted, despite disqualifying defects, \u201cmust be considered in final physical evaluation; otherwise, all Registrants inducted with such defects would be found unfit for duty at time of separation and retired for disability, without respect as to whether sufficient permanent aggravation of such condition was incurred during service to warrant retirement therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7n\">This detailed review of the approxi_ mately five_year (September 1, 1955-June 3Q 1960) period that plaintiff waG on the ligt ghowg that up to May 3? 1960&gt; there wag complete unanimity by four Medical Boardg twelve doctorg)&gt; two phygical Evaluation Boards&gt; and one Physical Review Council&gt; that piaintiff wag incapacitated to a degree warranting the continued receipt of disability retirement pay_ Certainly no cure or marked improvement is indicated in this period which covered practically the entire time plaintiff was on the list. Nor were these conclusions the product of superficial consideration. They were based on four periodic physical examinations by Medical Boards, and at least two X-ray series. The Boards all concluded that plaintiff\u2019s disability was permanent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that he was unfit for duty with a 40 percent rating. The X-rays showed a deformed and constricted (due to scarring) duodenal bulb. Allowing for short periods of remission (ulcer being typically an exacerbation-remission type of ailment), for the most part plaintiff\u2019s symptoms of pain (epigastric burning) persisted throughout the entire peirod. Hemorrhage had occurred at least twice during the period and plaintiff was on constant medication. At the beginning of the period he practiced medicine but, because of his need for rest and avoidance of undue strain, the practice was on a restricted basis. Commencing in 1959, however, which was in the latter part of his stay on the list, he found it necessary to cut even this restricted activity in half. After such a long history and consistent record of obviously well-grounded unanimous medical opinion, and after the fourth and final Medical Board\u2019s conclusion on February 24, 1960, that plaintiff\u2019s ulcer disability \u201cpersists\u201d and had been \u201cpermanently aggravated by active duty\u201d (all of which confirmed the diagnosis and conclusions of the third Medical Board proceedings just five and one-half months before), with such conclusion, on the basis of its own proceedings, being approved by the Physical Evaluation Board on March 24, 1960, how the Army Physical Review Council could, on the identical record, suddenly arrive at the diametrically opposite determination, <em>i. e., </em>that plaintiff was \u201cphysically fit for the performance of active military duty,\u201d simply cannot be understood. Nor can the mystery be solved by any explanation, based on an analysis of the evidence or otherwise, that is offered by the Council or by the Adjutant General in reporting the Council\u2019s decision to the plaintiff. For there is no such explanation or analysis. All that we have is the naked ultimate conclusion that plaintiff was \u201cphysically fit.\u201d Such a determination, \u201cconclusionary in nature,\u201d making it impossible to \u201cdetermine what weight was given to the evidence,\u201d and which does not \u201cdiscuss the details or specify precisely what items of evidence were considered,\u201d cannot be sustained. Smith v. United States, 168 Ct. Cl. 545, 552 (1964); accord, Cooper v. United States, 178 Ct.Cl. 277 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In <em>Cooper </em>too, also an ulcer disability case, the court, after observing that \u201cnothing could be more natural than to accord greater weight to the opinions of the physicians who saw, heard, interviewed, and examined the patient than is given to the opinions of physicians who have reviewed a paper record only\u201d (p. 311), noted that, as in the instant case, \u201c[t]he determination that plaintiff was fit for duty was made by the Physical Review Council on the same evidence, presumably, that had persuaded two separate Physical Evaluation Boards to recommend a 40 percent rating, and on the basis of which an earlier Physical Review Council * * * \u201d had also recommended a disability rating (pp. 314-315), and yet there was \u201cno explanation in the evidence * * * as to how the Physical Review Council arrived at its determination.\u201d (p. 315)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Without specific facts to explain the Physical Review Council\u2019s recommendation, efforts to appraise the reasoning upon which it was based or the motivation behind it would result only in speculation. The essential fact remains that the council\u2019s determination of fit for duty is not only lacking in support by substantial evidence; it is unsupported by any evidence whatever. The recommended finding must therefore be deemed to have been arbitrary, if not capricious. (Id., pp. 315-316)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Such \u201carbitration action by the Physical Review Council,\u201d the court held, \u201ccompromised the decisional process and deprived it of the integrity to which the plaintiff was entitled.\u201d (p. 316) It therefore invalidated the Secretary\u2019s final determination which too rejected the 40 percent rating recommended by the Physical Evaluation Boards, and gave judgment for plaintiff on the basis of such rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The only possible \u201cexplanation\u201d plaintiff was then given for the finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>he was \u201cphysically fit for the performanee of active military duty commensurate with\u201d his age and rank was the broad statement of the Adjutant General, in advising plaintiff of the Physical Review Council\u2019s action, that: \u201cThis finding is in accord with current Army medical standards of fitness and unfitness for retention on active duty. (Paragraph 1, AR 40-504 and physical standards for Special Registrants under Public Law 779).\u201d However, the parenthetically referred to AR 40-504 is hardly enlightening as justification since Paragraph 55 thereof says that an active ulcer \u201cmay make the individual unfit\u201d; that \u201c [i]t is necessary to individualize in each case\u201d; and that \u201c[gjenerally an individual should be considered as unfit for service when symptoms persist to a severe degree following adequate medical treatment and when there is a history of frequent recurrences, obstruction, perforation or recurrent bleeding.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s \u201csymptoms\u201d had certainly persisted \u201cto a severe degree following adequate medical treatment,\u201d and plaintiff\u2019s case also showed \u201ca history of frequent recurrences\u201d and \u201crecurrent bleeding,\u201d plaintiff having experienced, in addition to the three bleeding episodes prior to entry into the Army service, the numerous episodes he suffered in Army service, both in Korea (at ieast one in September 1953 and five during October 1954 \u2014 January 1955), as well as thereafter in the States (two in February 1955, and two more while on the Temporary List (one in the summer of 1957 and one in July 1958)). Thus, there was nothing in this part of the Regulation which served to bar plaintiff\u2019s claim, and there is, as stated, no explanation of what the Council was relying on in the Regulation to effect such a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"Arc\">Nor is the simple reference to the Rosenberg standards or policy any more enlightening. Indeed, the mere reference to such standards is inconsistent with the previous finding of physical fitness, for, as defendant concedes, the policy was directed to those who were admittedly unfit under the usual standards but whose disabilities, by the application of the waiver doctrine, could nevertheless be considered of such degree as not to prevent their being useful to the services.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The \u201cuse of a waiver in the original appointment * * * means that one is not fit for general service.\u201d Cosgriff v. United States, 737, 387 F.2d 390, 394, 181 Ct.Cl. 730 (1967). Thus the reference to the Rosenberg standards could rationally only mean that plaintiff\u2019s disability was no greater in 1960 than it was when he entered service in 1953 with the 10 percent disability. Although generally \u201c[t]his court * * * does not seek to apply the standards for original appointment and for retention to the question of entitlement to disability retirement, since the standards for the two fields are entirely different,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> nevertheless, if plaintiff\u2019s disability in 1960 was only 10 percent and thus no more than what it was when he reentered service in 1953, it seems clear that he would not be entitled to compensation. Indeed, this is defendant\u2019s present position for, although it now concedes that plaintiff was not physically fit (thus rejecting the findings to such effect by the Physical Review Council and the Physical Disability Appeal Board, which were in turn adopted by the Secretary), it nevertheless contends that his disability in 1960 did not exceed what it had been on entry into Army service in 1953. But the same hereinabove detailed review of the numerous 40 percent disability findings made while plaintiff was on the Temporary List, and the solid evidence on which they were based, which served to compel a rejection of the \u201cphysically fit\u201d findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>similarly served to compel a rejection of any 10 percent disability finding which may be deemed to be implicit in the Adjutant General\u2019s reference to the \u201cphysical standards for Special Registrants under Public Law 779.\u201d Of course, defendant\u2019s contention of a 10 percent disability in 1960 is based upon, and is only an extension of, its above-noted contention that when plaintif came out of the Army in 1955, he at that time too had only a 10 percent disability, a contention which, as shown, flies in the face of the Army\u2019s own well-grounded finding that plaintiff\u2019s disability had been aggravated to 40 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Nor was the action taken, on plaintiff\u2019s appeal, by the Army Physical Disability Appeal Board any more meaningful. The only advice plaintiff received with respect thereto was that \u201c[t]he Appeal Board concurred with the findings of the Review Council in that you are deemed physically fit for active duty.\u201d This time there was no reference at all, parenthetical or otherwise, to the Rosenberg standards, with the 10 percent disability inference that would be implicit in such reference. The Appeal Board apparently felt that this doctor who was, with constantly recurring pains, and with a considerable rest, diet, and medication regimen, conducting a private practice on a restricted, half-time basis, would be able, on a completely \u201cphysically fit\u201d basis, to assume a full schedule of military duties as a physician, for the Adjutant General, in advising plaintiff of the Appeal Board\u2019s \u201cphysically fit\u201d finding, enclosed an application which plaintiff could submit for \u201crecall to extended active duty.\u201d The final \u201cArmy Special Orders\u201d entered, by order of the Secretary of the Army, following the \u201cfinal determination\u201d of the Appeal Board, declared plaintiff \u201cto be physically fit for active duty,\u201d a conclusion which, as stated, defendant itself now concedes was erroneous. The testimony of both of defendant\u2019s medical experts at the trial herein was to the effect that plaintiff was not (except for the Rosenberg policy) physically fit for duty in 1960 when he was removed from the Temporary List.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">On the basis of the above considerations and analysis, plaintiff\u2019s inexplicable removal from the Temporary Disability Retired List on June 30, 1960, with the finding that he was then physically fit for active duty, must be considered to have constituted arbitrary and capricious action. McGiven v. United States, 183 Ct.Cl. 920 (1968). Cf. Brozik v. United States, 180 Ct.Cl. 546 (1967), where the court rejected an insufficiently explained ultimate fitness finding by an Army Physical Evaluation Board and Physical Review Council, resulting in removal from the Temporary Disability Retired List without further disability pay, such fitness finding being made in the face of previously consistent unfitness findings by four Medical Boards and a Physical Evaluation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Nothing that has taken place in plaintiff\u2019s case subsequent to such June 30, 1960 removal serves to weaken this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The Surgeon General\u2019s opinion of August 9, 1962, expressed to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records, again does not discuss or analyze any aspect of plaintiff\u2019s long medical history or otherwise indicate the basis for the conclusion \u201cthat there is no medical evidence that the applicant had an active duodenal ulcer at the time of separation and that he was unfit for active military service at the time of his separation.\u201d Such \u201csuperficial * * * cursory advice of the Surgeon General * * * couched in broad conclusions rather than a reasoned discussion of the evidence\u201d is entitled to little weight. Dayley v. United States, 180 Ct.Cl. 1136, 1146 (1967). To the same effect is Lawler v. United States, 169 Ct.Cl. 644, 647 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The Board\u2019s own findings and conclusions of December 16, 1964, in which it stated that \u201cit concurs in the opinion of the Surgeon General\u2019s Office,\u201d are little better. Other than plaintiff\u2019s own testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>mony, the Board had no new evidence. It concluded (its finding No. 4) that, following plaintiff\u2019s placement on the Temporary List, \u201cthere is no evidence of necessity for prolonged or frequent hospitalization, other than for periodic evaluation, unequivocal X-Ray findings of ulcer activity, objective and verified episodes of recurrent bleeding, or perforation or obstruction.\u201d However, there is no indication that any regulation pertaining to ulcer cases made \u201cprolonged or frequent hospitalization\u201d a prerequisite to a finding of unfitness for duty. The above-mentioned and quoted AR 40-504, which sets forth the \u201cStandards Of Fitness and Unfitness For Retention On Active Duty,\u201d did not. \u201cProlonged hospitalization\u201d is only mentioned therein as one of four factors in connection with the question of aggravation of an ulcer which existed prior to entry on active duty, and relates to such hospitalization as having occurred \u201cin the service.\u201d As shown there were valid aggravation findings made by the Army in 1955 when plaintiff was placed on the Temporary List. Nor is it evident what the Board meant by \u201cunequivocal X-Ray findings of ulcer activity,\u201d or again what it was relying on in making such reference. As noted, the periodic examination X-rays that were taken while plaintiff was on the Temporary List (as well as the prior X-rays) showed a deformed and scarred duodenal bulb. Indeed, these X-rays were important factors in causing the Medical and Physical Evaluation Boards to conclude that plaintiff had a permanently disabling chronic doudenal ulcer. One of defendant\u2019s own medical experts at the trial testified that the \u201cscarring of the duodenal bulb\u201d shown by the X-rays taken while plaintiff was on the list \u201cis indicative of some activity of his ulcer disease.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, again the pertinent AR 40-504 (Paragraph 55) does not make X-rays of the type described by the Board a prerequisite to an unfitness finding, \u201cX-ray evidence of an active ulcer\u201d being mentioned therein only in the same \u201caggravation\u201d portion as contained the reference to \u201cprolonged hospitalization.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And the same considerations apply to the \u201cobjective and verified episodes of recurrent bleeding, or perforation or obstruction\u201d portion of the Board\u2019s statement. This language too is essentially that of the \u201caggravation\u201d portion of the Regulation. As noted, the portion of the Regulation here applicable simply says that \u201can individual should be considered as unfit for service when symptoms persist to a severe degree following adequate medical treatment and when there is a history of frequent recurrences, obstruction, perforation or recurrent bleeding.\u201d That plaintiff\u2019s frequently recurring symptoms persisted to such a degree as to cause a drastic curtailment of his medical practice by the time he was removed from the list is nowhere denied but not even mentioned by the Board, as well as the \u201crecurrent bleeding,\u201d of which there were two occurrences while plaintiff was on the list.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, by the time plaintiff testified before the Board, he had given up his practice entirely to take up private employment involving essentially research and writing,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this severe limitation on his normal civilian pursuits also remaining unmentioned by the Board. Events subsequent to release are properly to be considered in making a determination of physical witness as to the release date. Walters v. United States, 358 F.2d 957, 962, 175 Ct.Cl. 215, 225 (1966); Harper v. United States, 310 F.2d 405, 408, 159 Ct.Cl. 135, 140-141 (1962). Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Board\u2019s basic conclusion (its finding No. 1) that upon plaintiff\u2019s removal from the list, there was \u201cno recorded, verified, or documented period of ulcer disease, to a degree to warrant a finding of unfitness for duty\u201d is, like the previous Physical Review Council\u2019s and Surgeon General\u2019s similar finding, not based on any reasoned analysis of the evidence, and similarly contradicts without any explanation the directly opposite conclusion arrived at by the four Medical and the two Physical Evaluation Boards. As was stated in Beckham v. United States, 392 F.2d 619, 622-623, 183 Ct.Cl. 628, 636 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">* * * there is no satisfactory showing on the record that the Board\u2019s determination was based upon a balanced consideration of all the evidence available and presented. A naked conclusion and mere recitation that the opinion is based upon all of the evidence without an analysis of the evidence in writing * * * is inimical to a rational system of administrative determination and ultimately inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">No exception can be taken to the Board\u2019s conclusion (its finding No. 7) that the \u201cpolicy\u201d of \u201cinducting Special Registrants who were considered to have disqualifying defects * * * must be considered in final physical evaluation; otherwise, all Registrants inducted with such defects would be found unfit for duty at time of separation and retired for disability, without respect as to whether sufficient permanent aggravation of such condition was incurred during service to warrant retirement therefor.\u201d (It should be observed, however, that if, by this \u201cConclusion\u201d the Bo\u00e1rd was conceding that, in 1960, plaintiff was unfit, but not more so than when he was inducted in 1953, it should have said so, instead of flatly finding, inconsistently, that a finding of unfitness for duty was not then warranted.) But here the evidence that was presented to the Board was overwhelming that, as four Medical Boards, two Physical Evaluation Boards, and one Physical Review Council had found, plaintiff\u2019s 1955 aggravated 40 percent disability condition had persisted throughout his period on the list and up to the time of his removal therefrom in 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Nor do the trial proceedings conducted herein serve in any way to alter the conclusion that plaintiff should have been permanently retired upon his removal from the list in 1960. The only witnesses, in addition to plaintiff himself, were an expert medical witness offered by plaintiff and two such experts offered by defendant (none of the experts having examined plaintiff, but instead testifying only on the basis of the medical history as set forth in the quite voluminous records pertaining to plaintiff\u2019s case). Plaintiff\u2019s testimony indicated a continuation of his ulcer pain symptoms, manifesting themselves, on a quite constant basis, as a dull type of pain in the upper gastric region, and sometimes as much as twice a month, as sharp pains, such episodes lasting as long as ten days. More than usual quantities of work or tension are likely to bring on such episodes. He maintains an ulcer diet and medication regimen. At the time he testified he was unemployed. He had terminated the essentially research and writing employment he had when he testified before the Correction Board because of the traveling and irregular hours it sometimes required. Plaintiff\u2019s expert, a qualified specialist in internal medicine and gastroenterology (who had served in the Navy as a doctor and was familiar with service medical standards), concluded that plaintiff\u2019s condition was worse in 1960 than it had been in 1955 and that it would be a rare situation for anyone who had an ulcer as long as plaintiff did to become permanently healed, although there might be temporary remissions. He pointed out that a long history of exacerbations and remissions indicates that there is no permanent healing but that instead there is a basic underlying pathological process. He testified that hemorrhaging and obstruction are only individual factors in determining fitness for duty and that a proved ulcer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>without either obstruction or hemorrhaging, would be disabling. He concluded that a physician with an ulcer so severe that he could function on only a 50 percent medical practice basis in civilian life \u25a0 \u2014 which was plaintiff\u2019s situation in 1960 when he was suddenly declared by the Physical Review Council and the Disability Appeal Board to be physically fit for active duty \u2014 would certainly not be fit to function as a doctor in the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The testimony of one of defendant\u2019s experts <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (also a qualified specialist in internal medicine and gastroneurology) was to the effect that, on the basis of hemorrhage frequency and absence of evidence of obstruction, there was in his opinion no significant difference between plaintiff\u2019s condition in 1953, when he returned to active duty, and 1960, when he was removed from the list. But clearly this places too great stress on the individual hemorrhage and obstruction factors. AR 40-504 places primary emphasis on the situation \u201cwhen symptoms persist to a severe degree following adequate medical treatment and when there is a history of frequent recurrences * * *\u00bb \u201cObstruction, perforation or recurrent bleeding\u201d are mentioned only as other factors to be taken into consideration.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That so much importance was not placed upon such an individual factor as obstruction while plaintiff was on the Temporary, List is indicated by the fact that plaintiff was, for almost five years, retained on the list even though the evidence of obstruction which was indicated at the time he was first placed on the list thereafter no longer manifested itself.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">The Physical Evaluation Board\u2019s evaluation after plaintiff\u2019s final periodic examination was that of a moderately severe duodenal uncer, without obstruction, but with a history of hemorrhage, and rated 40 percent disabling. And as to the important symptoms factor, the witness admitted that in 1953 plaintiff was asymptomatic while in 1960 he was experiencing symptoms two or three times a week. It seems difficult indeed to conclude that plaintiff\u2019s condition in 1953 and 1960 was substantially the same when, in 1953, he was able to function normally as a physician on a full-time basis, without any significantly inhibitory symptoms (as he was also able to so function between the bleeding episodes in the 1945-1953 period), but in 1960 he was regularly experiencing incapacitating symptoms and could, therefore, only fimction on a restricted 50 percent basis, while observing, in addition, a strict rest, diet, and medication ulcer regimen, which the record makes plain was far from the situation in 1953. Furthermore, as to the hemorrhaging, upon which so much stress was placed, the witness construed the record to show only one bleeding incident while plaintiff was on the Temporary List, i. e., that which occurred in the summer of 1957, to which reference was made in the Medical Board proceedings on plaintiff\u2019s second periodic examination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, the witness appears to have missed a second bleeding incident which occurred in July 1958, to which plaintiff testified in his first Physical Evaluation Board proceeding a month later.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Defendant\u2019s second witness, a well-qualified expert in internal medicine, also felt plaintiff\u2019s condition in 1953 and 1960 to have been substantially similar. However, this opinion was based upon the supposition that plaintiff\u2019s ulcer was \u201cactive\u201d at both times.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But here too insignificant consideration was plainly given to the fact that, although technically the ulcer may be said to have been \u201cactive\u201d in 1953 when plaintiff was inducted, it was nevertheless asymptomatic at such time, whereas, as the expert himself noted, in 1960 plaintiff\u2019s symptoms of pain were occurring two or three times a week.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nor, apparently, did he give any consideration to the fact that, when plaintiff was inducted in 1953, his activities do not appear in any significant way to have been inhibited by his asymptomatic ulcer (which was further demonstrated by his arduous, long-hours\u2019 work schedules in Korea, during which he was \u201ccalled many times during the night in medical emergencies,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>) while in 1960 he was able to operate only on a sharply restricted half-time basis. And, although this witness too, contrary to AR 40-504, appeared to place more stress on the individual obstruction and hemorrhage factors than on the basic symptomatology, he too pointed to only one bleeding incident while plaintiff was on the list, although, as noted, the record indicates that there were two.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">For all of the above reasons, the conclusion is compelled that at the time of his removal from the Temporary Disability Retired List on June 30, 1960, plaintiff was not physically fit to perform active military duty commensurate with his age and rank. The 40 percent disability for which plaintiff had been carried on the list since September 1, 1955, and which was reaffirmed by the Physical Evaluation Board\u2019s finding of March 24, 1960, still existed on June 30, 1960, and should, under the provisions of Section 402 of the Career Compensation Act, have been considered to be of a permanent nature. Accordingly, such Physical Evaluation Board's 40 percent disability finding stands \u201cunimpaired,\u201d McGiven v. United States, supra, 183 Ct.Cl. at 938, and properly forms the basis for judgment herein. McGiven v. United States, supra; Cooper v. United States, supra. Plaintiff should have been retired as of such June 30, 1960 date with disability pay based upon such 40 percent disability rating.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Judgment to such effect should be granted, the amount due to be determined in further proceedings under Rule 47(c).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\">.

One of defendant\u2019s own medical experts (Dr. Everett B. Cooper) testified at the trial that, in his opinion, based on a review of the medical records, plaintiff\u2019s condition was worse in 1955 after his Korean service than it was when he entered the service in 1953. (Tr., pp. 201, 212)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. Despite the constriction, plaintiff\u2019s stomach had emptied without difficulty so that the Board concluded that plaintiff\u2019s ulcer condition was \u201cwithout obstruction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\">. Although the \u201cProceedings\u201d record stated that the ulcer condition had been \u201cPermanently aggravated by active duty\u201d (Joint Ex. 57, p. 4, Block 20), and that the \u201cDegree\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cDisability For Military Service\u201d was \u201cPermanent\u201d (id., Block 31), nevertheless, the \u201cClinical Abstract\u201d attached thereto concluded with the \u201cRecommendation\u201d that plaintiff \u201cbe continued on TDRL [Temporary Disability Retired List] status,\u201d and the Board\u2019s final diagnosis, made October 8, 1959, stated that plaintiff\u2019s disability \u201cmay be permanent.\u201d (Joint Ex. 57, p. 1)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The disability was rated 30 percent by the Medical Board. As shown, plaintiff\u2019s net disability rating, after deducting the 10 percent that had been waived at the time he reentered service in 1953. was 30 percent. Previously, however, the disability had been specifically set forth as 40 percent, less 10 percent, making a net of 30 percent. The VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities contained no 30 percent rating for ulcer.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">The X-rays again showed no obstruction, despite the same constriction in the duodenal bulb previously indicated. The radiologist\u2019s \u201cImpression\u201d was that the constriction represented \u201cresidual scarring * * * secondary to a healed duodenal ulcer.\u201d Obviously, however, the Board did not consider the fact that the radiologist referred to the ulcer as \u201chealed\u201d as indicating plaintiff\u2019s troubles were over since it still considered plaintiff to be permanently disabled to a degree warranting continuation of disability compensation. As previously indicated, the second Medical Board had concluded that plaintiff\u2019s ulcer was \u201cchronic,\u201d but with \u201cexacerbations and remissions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b308-16\">.

Although plaintiff\u2019s disability was, while he was on the Temporary List, rated 40 percent under the Veterans Administration Schedule for Rating Disabilities (finding 62), defendant decided to deduct 10 percent, representing his rated disability at the time of \u201centry into service\u201d as determined by the Veterans Administration, making a net disability rating of 30 percent instead of 40 percent, his pay being based on such 30 percent basis (findings 35, 36). There appears, however, to have been no warrant for such 10 percent deduction since such 10 percent disability was service-incurred. Beckham v. United States, 392 F.2d 619, 183 Ct.Cl. 628 (1968). Paragraph 21(c) of AR 600-140, dated October 28, 1958, which was in effect when plaintiff was removed from the list, provided that a disability incurred during one period of service which recurs or is aggravated during a subsequent period, is, regardless of the intervening time, presumed to have recurred or to have been aggravated in line of duty. Finding 53(a). Defendant concedes that there is no disability in this case that can properly be considered as noncompensable due to the fact that it existed prior to service, the references by the Army to plaintiff\u2019s disability being \u201cEPTS\u201d (existing prior to service) referring only to plaintiff\u2019s service as an officer.
