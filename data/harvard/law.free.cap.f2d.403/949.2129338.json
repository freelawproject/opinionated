C. O\u2019Neil Trucks Pty. Ltd., an Australian corporation, which action alleges violation by petitioner of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-23\">In that action petitioner, contending for lack of venue, moved that the action be dismissed or transferred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court found that petitioner \u201ctransacts business\u201d in Hawaii and concluded that the action properly was brought in Hawaii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>under \u00a7 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">In the alternative petitioner moved, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for change of venue \u201cfor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.\u201d This motion the District Court also denied. Its opinion appears sub nom. L. C. O\u2019Neil Trucks, Pty. Ltd. v. Pacific Car and Foundry Co., 278 F.Supp. 839 (D. Hawaii 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">These proceedings followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">\n<em>The Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Petitioner, a Washington corporation, manufactures two lines of trucks, Ken-worth and Peterbilt, through separate divisions of the company. The Kenworth division has factories in Seattle, Washington, which is also petitioner\u2019s home office. The Peterbilt division has a factory in Newark, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">L. C. O\u2019Neil Trucks, Pty., Ltd., the plaintiff in the Hawaiian action, was organized in 1963 under the laws of New South Wales for the purpose of serving as Australian distributor of petitioner\u2019s Peterbilt trucks. In 1965 it was advised by petitioner that Peterbilt trucks would no longer be supplied to Australia and was appointed distributor of petitioner\u2019s Kenworth trucks. In 1967 its franchises were terminated by petitioner. In its action brought in Hawaii it charges that the termination resulted from a conspiracy (to which petitioner was party) contrary to \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act to monopolize the exportation of heavy duty trucks from the United States to Australia and to eliminate O\u2019Neil as an importer. It seeks damages in the sum of $8,250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-21\">\n<em>Propriety of Review by Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-22\">This court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in line with the rule in other circuits,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *has held that orders respecting venue entered under \u00a7 1404(a) and \u00a7 1406(a) are interlocutory in nature and are not appealable prior to final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-23\">This court has also held that orders entered under \u00a7 1406(a) are not reviewable in mandamus, at least in absence of extraordinary circumstances. Gulf Research &amp; Development Co. v. Harrison, 185 F.2d 457 (9th Cir. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-24\">This court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in line with the rule in most other circuits,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will, however, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>view on mandamus clearly erroneous orders entered under \u00a7 1404(a). Accordingly we direct our attention to the order of the District Court denying motion for change of venue under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">It is argued that this practice of review by mandamus should be re-examined in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s sharp criticism of undue resort to mandamus in Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">That case is readily distinguishable. As stressed by the Supreme Court, <em>Will </em>involved interlocutory review on behalf of the United States in a criminal case. Issuance of the writ there not only violated the policy against piecemeal appeal; it was totally contrary to the established policy that appeals by the Government are not favored in criminal cases, Carroll v. United States, 354 U.S. 394, 77 S.Ct. 1332, 1 L.Ed.2d 1442 (1957), and it was inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy resolution of the charges against him. DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">In contrast the petition before us is not truly an instance of piecemeal appeal. A decision denying change of venue is complete and final in itself. It is not a step toward final judgment on the merits which will merge in such final judgment. Instead, it is collateral to and separable from the rights asserted in the action. Venue provisions deal with rights too important to be denied review. Yet error in denying change of venue cannot be effectively remedied on appeal from final judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The purpose of the rule is to avoid the disruption, expense, and inconvenience parties and witnesses must suffer by having the trial in an improper forum. To require litigants to await final judgment for relief serves to defeat the very purpose of the venue rule by requiring them to submit to the disadvantages from which the rule is designed to relieve them. Once trial has been completed damages cannot be collected for the extra expense suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">This does not mean that review on mandamus is available in all instances since the factors favoring immediate review may be present in varying degrees. While there can be no doubt that there exists the \u201cnaked power\u201d to issue the writ,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the power is to be exercised only in the \u201csound discretion of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>The exercise of that \u201csound discretion\u201d requires the weighing of numerous factors, including the possible disruption of orderly trial processes as opposed by the hardship and loss of rights that may result from delay of review,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the saving of an expensive and protracted trial that leads nowhere but to a complete retrial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Judged by these standards we conclude that mandamus is proper here. It is apparent that the trial will be a long and protracted one, with voluminous documentary evidence and a host of witnesses. The irremediable hardship that might result is substantially in excess of the usual inconvenience of an unnecessary trial. The orders here complained of were issued well before trial and there will be no wasteful repetition of judicial effort in the event of transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">\n<em>The Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">In support of its motion for change of venue under \u00a7 1404(a) petitioner made a strong showing of inconvenience. Many witnesses, including several members of petitioner\u2019s corporate staff, would have to travel from the mainland to Hawaii in order to give testimony with consequent disruption of the conduct of petitioner\u2019s operation. Documents generally demanded by O\u2019Neil in pretrial motion for production, the originals or duplicates of which would have to be shipped to Hawaii, would include a substantial portion of up to one thousand file drawers of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">O\u2019Neil did not bother to dispute this showing except to suggest that it was grossly exaggerated and that any inconvenience could be eliminated by resort to depositions. Further it made no showing worth mentioning that its own convenience would be served by its choice of forum. Instead, it relied on its right as plaintiff to select its forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\"> There can be no doubt that in antitrust cases the plaintiff is given a wide choice of forum. This is made clear by the language of \u00a7 12 of the Clayton Act (footnote 2, supra), and the construction judicially placed on the words \u201ctransacts business.\u201d That language is given a broader meaning than has traditionally been given the \u201cengaging in business\u201d articulation of presence within a state. The words are to be taken in the \u201cordinary and usual sense\u201d in which they may be used in the business world. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 47 S.Ct. 400, 71 L.Ed. 684 (1927). They are intended to substitute \u201cpractical business conceptions for the previous hair-splitting legal technicalities.\u201d United States v. Scophony Corp., 333 U.S. 795, 808, 68 S.Ct. 855, 862, 92 L.Ed. 1091 (1948). Courts of appeals have refined the concept. A corporation can transact business without ever entering a state; without having salesmen or agents present there. Artful arrangements such as the geography of minute incidents of contracting (e. g., designation of place of title transfer) do not alter the substance of relationships. If the corporation in a practical business sense <em>has </em>business within the state it may be said to be <em>in </em>business there.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>The reason for this broad interpretation is relevant here. The legislative idea was that when a plaintiff has had business transactions with the defendant through which the defendant has injured him, the plaintiff should not be forced to follow the defendant into the defendant\u2019s home district. United States v. Scophony Corp., supra. The purpose of the Act is to allow the plaintiff, who has been hurt in his dealings with the defendant, to bring suit where the \u201cdefendant had committed violations of the Act and inflicted the forbidden injuries.\u201d United States v. National City Lines, 334 U.S. 573, 583, 68 S.Ct. 1169, 1175, 92 L.Ed. 1584 (1948). This purpose was recognized by this court in Eastland Construction Co. v. Keasbey &amp; Mattison Co., 358 F.2d 777 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">On the other hand the Supreme Court has noted that Congress was not willing to extend the plaintiff\u2019s right to choice of venue beyond reasonable limits. In United States v. National City Lines, supra, it notes that bills providing for unlimited choice were rejected by Congress. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">\u201cCongress therefore was not indifferent to possibilities of abuse involved in the various proposals for change. Exactly the opposite was true. For the broader proposals were not rejected because they gave the plaintiff the choice. They were rejected because the choice given was too wide, giving plaintiffs the power to bring suit and force trial in districts far removed from the places where the company was incorporated, had its headquarters, or carried on its business * * *. Congress was not willing to give plaintiff free rein to haul defendant hither and yon at their caprice * * *. But neither was it willing to allow defendants to hamper or defeat effective enforcement by claiming immunity to suit in a district where by a course of conduct they had violated the Act with the resulting outlawed consequences.\u201d 334 U.S. 587, 588, 68 S.Ct. 1177.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">In Courtesy Chevrolet, Inc. v. Tennessee Walking Horse Ass\u2019n, 334 F.2d 860, 865 (1965), this court, in stating the appropriate test, drew from International Shoe Co. v. Washington Office of Unemployment Comp., 326 U.S. 310, 317, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95, 161 A.L.R. 1057 (1945): There must be \u201c * * * such contacts of the corporation with the state of the forum as to make it reasonable * * * to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum, then, is not the final word. In judging the weight to be given such a choice, as is the case with other types of actions, consideration must be given to the extent both of the defendant\u2019s business contacts with the chosen forum and of the plaintiff\u2019s contacts, including those relating to his cause of action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the operative facts have not occurred within the forum of original selection and that forum has no particular interest in the parties or the subject matter, the plaintiff\u2019s choice is entitled only to minimal consideration.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>In this case no contacts of any substance with the State of Hawaii existed as to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">Petitioner is not to be \u201cfound\u201d in Hawaii, nor can it be said that in the usual sense it is \u201cengaged in business\u201d there. It maintains no office there. No employee or agent is stationed there. It does, however, have distributors there who buy from petitioner and sell at retail. It has sent agents there for the purpose of promoting sales of Peterbilt trucks by its distributors. (Three trips in <em>iy2 </em>years were made for this purpose. Two other trips were made during this period apparently for unrelated purposes.) A bare case of the \u201ctransacting\u201d of business might thus be found.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The business transacted, however, is not transacted with O\u2019Neil. O\u2019Neil had no relationship with petitioner\u2019s Hawaiian business. O\u2019Neil\u2019s business was limited to Australia. O\u2019Neil\u2019s claim of injury had nothing to do with Hawaii. If injury was suffered it was in Australia. O\u2019Neil\u2019s witnesses and evidentiary materials are almost entirely located elsewhere. The only factors recited as connecting O\u2019Neil\u2019s alleged cause of action with Hawaii relate to the Hawaiian situs of a modest portion of the preliminary negotiations leading up to O\u2019Neil\u2019s Australian distributorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">In support of O\u2019Neil\u2019s choice of forum emphasis is laid upon the fact that Hawaii is the closest federal judicial district to O\u2019Neil\u2019s home base. This fact is, however, meaningless in the absence of some showing that it therefore served the interests of O\u2019Neil\u2019s convenience. Such a showing, as we have noted, is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">Emphasis has also been laid upon the fact that O\u2019Neil of necessity must suffer the inconvenience of suing away from home, with the implication that it is somehow unfair that it should suffer alone. The inconvenience, however, is not attributable to the petitioner, nor to the laws of the United States, but only to the fact of foreign origin. It will not promote justice to attempt to equalize inconvenience in such a case. This would do little more than detract from the quality of the trial<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or increase the cost of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\">We are left, then, with a choice of forum supported only by the fact that it was chosen. Such a choice cannot prevail under \u00a7 1404(a) against the showing of inconvenience here made by the petitioner. Chicago, R.I. &amp; Pac. R.R. v. Igoe, 220 F.2d 299 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 822, 76 S.Ct. 49, 100 L.Ed. 735 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">In the light of our disposition we need not discuss the other issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">A writ of mandamus shall issue directing the respondent to vacate the order of the District Court denying change of venue under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404 (a) and to entertain anew petitioner\u2019s motion in that regard.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-16\">\u201cThe district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">\u201cAny suit, action or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">. 28 U.S.C. <em>\u00a7 </em>1404(a) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-13\">\u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">.

These holdings may well cast doubt on the rule against appealability of \u00a7 1404 (a) and \u00a7 1406(a) orders (footnotes 4 and 5, supra). The specification of factors that should control on the decision to grant prompt review does, however, provide strong support for our conclusion. Absent a right of prompt appeal (which still remains to be established), the availability of review on mandamus is a practical necessity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">.

Petitioner argues with substantial force that venue based on the phrase \u201ctransacts business\u201d in \u00a7 12 of the Olayton Act requires that the cause of action be related to the activity constituting the transacting of business.

The District Court, relying primarily on the terms of the distributor contracts, found that petitioner exercised extensive control over its distributors. On examination of the record, this court has serious doubts that such a finding could be sustained. For example, the fact that one of the distributors was also ,a distributor for other manufacturers casts doubt on the finding of extensive control. The finding that the distributors act merely as transmitting agents for orders taken from customers rather than as purchasers from the petitioner is contrary to the plain wording of the contract which states that the distributors purchase the trucks. Also it is apparently inconsistent with the findings that the distributors can cancel <em>their oivn </em>orders only on the approval of petitioner, and that <em>the distributor </em>is bound by the contract to purchase even though Pacific Car changes price and design. The latter finding itself appears to be contrary to the terms of the contract; the distributors are bound by price changes only if they do not cancel their orders within 10 days of notice of change of price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">.
