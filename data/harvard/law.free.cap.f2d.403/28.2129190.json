(Bookheim) to Globe Food Sales Co., Inc. (Globe) on July 18, 1962 and was duly recorded three weeks later. From the conflicting testimony, the Referee found that the consideration for the mortgage was merchandise delivered by Globe to the bankrupt one week before the execution of the mortgage. The principal issue on appeal is whether that mortgage is void under \u00a7 15 of the New York Stock Corporation Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 59, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\u201cNo conveyance * * * nor any * * * lien created or security given by [the corporation] or by any officer * * * when the corporation is insolvent or its insolvency is imminent, with the intent of giving a preference * * * shall be valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">To set aside the transfer under \u00a7 15, the complaining creditor must establish, among other things, that insolvency existed or was imminent at the time when the transfer was made; that the transfer resulted in a preference; and that the transferor intended to give a preference to the transferee. Haberman v. Larens Corp., 35 N.Y.S.2d 533, 535 (Sup.Ct.1942); In re Anjopa Paper &amp; Board Manuf. Co., 269 F.Supp. 241, 263 (S.D.N.Y.1967). The petitioners have not carried their burden with respect to these three issues. There is evidence, including the continued operation of the bankrupt for eight months, to support a finding that insolvency was not imminent. Globe delivered the merchandise on condition that Bookheim give the mortgage; and such new and fair consideration belies the existence of a preference. Shaw v. Jewel Radio Corporation, 6 A.D.2d 707, 174 N.Y.S.2d 315 (1958). Finally, there is sufficient evidence from which the Referee could fairly have concluded that Bookheim did not intend to prefer Globe over other creditors. Since the Referee\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, based as they are in large part on the credibility of witnesses, the determination of the validity of the mortgage was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b83-12\">LUMBARD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">I dissent. I would remand to the district court for a specific finding on whether Bookheim was \u201cinsolvent, or its insolvency imminent\u201d at the time the mortgage was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">The referee did not make such a finding because he wrongly believed that Section 15 would not apply if the transfer was made for a fair present consideration, and because he did not make this finding, his finding of \u201cno intent to prefer\u201d is also suspect. The district court did not repeat this error, but instead glossed over the referee\u2019s failure by saying that his decision, \u201cread as a whole, finds the corporation was not insolvent or in danger of imminent insolvency\u201d when the mortgage was given. The court thought its finding was justified because the referee had believed the president of Bookheim when he said that he had no intention of going into bankruptcy at the time the mortgage was given. This is not enough to support the required finding on the question of insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">The language of the statute is plain and unambiguous; there is no reason why the court should not make findings equally plain and unambiguous based upon the record or the findings of the referee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
