Since none of the challenged statements in the presentence report were determinative factors in his sentencing, the prisoner\u2019s complaint is groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-26\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-14\">. In February, 1966, Parness filed a motion under Section 2255, 28 U.S.C.A. to correct or vacate his sentence on the ground that it had been based upon \u201cmaterially erroneous information with respect to the petitioner\u2019s background\u201d which was \u201chighly prejudicial.\u201d The sentencing judge heard and denied the motion. We affirmed at 368 F.2d 327 (3 Cir. 1966), cert. den. 386 U.S. 1012, 87 S.Ct. 1358, 18 L.Ed.2d 442 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
