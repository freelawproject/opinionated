A diversity suit to recover the fire damage was instituted in the District Court against Humble Oil and Refining Company, a gasoline supplier, and A. O. Smith Corporation, successor-in-interest to the manufacturer of a certain gasoline pump. A twelve-day non-jury trial followed, and the court, after receiving 2,000 pages of transcribed testimony, rendered judgment in favor of both defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both plaintiffs have appealed from the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-23\">In April, 1954 an Erie Meter Systems Model #910 gasoline pump was installed in the garage by Cemico, then the gasoline supplier of Yellow Cab. The pump was purchased from Erie Meter Systems by Cemico. In October, 1955 Yellow Cab changed its supplier from Cemico to Humble, and purchased Cemieo\u2019s pump. As an accommodation to its new customer, Humble purchased the pump from Yellow Cab and leased it back on a free basis. Yellow Cab em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>ployed no regular gasoline pump attendants; each driver filled his cab\u2019s tank at the completion of his shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">As required by the equipment lease, Humble serviced and repaired the equipment from time to time, either through its own employees or through the services of independent contractors. In October, 1963 one of these contractors, Jabe, installed, a new type heavy-duty flexsteel hose on the pump.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In April, 1964 two mishaps occurred. On April 20, the bumper of a cab hooked the flexsteel hose, and, as the driver drove his vehicle in the garage, the hose stretched extensively, and a quantity of gasoline leaked from the pumping equipment to the floor. Yellow Cab then shut down the pump. An investigation by the service contractor disclosed that a metal meter casting had fractured within the pump; the entire meter unit, including the metal cover casting was replaced, and the pump returned to service.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Nine days later, on April 29, a similar incident occurred. One of the drivers failed to remove the hose from his cab\u2019s tank before driving away from the pump. This caused the hose to jerk and stretch violently, bending the metal pipe coupling to which it was attached at the pump. Although most of the Yellow Cab employees witnessing this misadventure were aware of the leakage which had followed the accident nine days before, no one inspected the pump. Instead, another driver who had observed the violent jerking of the hose proceeded to place the pump in operation to fill his own tank. Shortly thereafter, gasoline was discovered on the floor near the pump. This time the spilled gasoline erupted into flames, and the entire building and a large number of cabs were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">All parties agreed that the leakage of gasoline had been caused by the inability of the pump mechanism to relieve excess pressure which had been created within the system. The basic factual dispute was on the issue of what caused a dysfunction of certain pressure-relief valves.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">The pre-trial statement of the plaintiffs and their evidence presented at trial disclose that they proceeded on various theories of liability. As to Humble: (1) defendant should be held to \u201cthe strict liability doctrine as applied to suppliers as well as manufacturers of equipment\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (2) defendant breached the high degree of care to which it should be held because the equipment dispensed \u201ca highly volatile and dangerous substance\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (3) defendant failed to inspect and maintain the equipment properly, \u201cand as a result thereof, the relief valve system malfunctioned\u201d due to \u201c * * * either a clogging with excessive grit or dirt, or to improper adjustment by Humble Oil Company or its agents\u201d; (4) defendant provided a pump containing a casting which was \u201cnot adequate or proper\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>As to A. 0. Smith: (1) defendant improperly designed the meter head, furnishing a casting of \u201crelatively poor grade material and the thickness of the casting was less than required under good engineering principles and practices\u201d; (2) defendant failed to provide \u201cfail safe\u201d devices to furnish a warning relating to the buildup of pressures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The defendants contended that the proximate cause of the fire was the negligence of the Yellow Cab driver in failing to remove the nozzle from the tank prior to the cab\u2019s pulling away from the pump. They produced testimony that the pulling of the hose caused the steel components of the hose to contract, creating a buildup of pressure which led to. the fracture of the casting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The court agreed with the defendants. It concluded that the fire was caused by the negligence of the plaintiff Yellow Cab, specifically indicating that the fire resulted from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-8\">\u201c * * * the failure of the driver whose duty it was to remove the nozzle from the filler pipe before driving away from the pump, so to do. Nor is it a defense to argue as plaintiff does, that he could not have been aware of the exact nature of the danger involved; it is sufficient that he be, or should be, reasonably aware that the natural consequences of his act be dangerous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">The court said it had no difficulty in finding that the failure to remove the nozzle from the tank was negligence and that \u201csuch negligence was the proximate cause of the fire\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \u201cfindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses\u201d. The Court defined the meaning of \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1949): \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>In reviewing the decision of the District Court, our responsibility is not to substitute findings we could have made had we been the fact-finding tribunal; our sole function is to review the record to determine whether the findings of the District Court were clearly erroneous, i. e., whether we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d. Eastern Express, Inc. v. Mack Warehouse Corp., 326 F.2d 554 (3 Cir. 1964); International Industries, Inc. v. Warren Petroleum Corp., 248 F.2d 696 (3 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 943, 78 S.Ct. 529, 2 L.Ed.2d 523 (1959); Williams v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 262 F.2d 253 (3 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 969, 79 S.Ct. 880, 3 L.Ed.2d 836 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The basic evidence on liability was introduced by expert witnesses. The matter of weighing the credibility and persuasiveness of expert opinion is the unique function of the trier of fact. We stated in Brett v. J. M. Carras, Inc., 203 F.2d 451 (3 Cir. 1953), that the findings of the trial judge will not be disturbed \u201cwhere those findings are based on conflicting oral testimony and where, as here, the district court had full opportunity to observe the witnesses and to appraise their demeanor.\u201d 203 F.2d at 453. More recently, in Hadco Products, Inc. v. Frank Dini Co., 401 F.2d 462 (1968), we ruled that a choice between two permissible views by the fact finder is not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d within the meaning of Rule 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The District Court accepted the testimony of the defense witnesses and rejected that of the plaintiffs. We cannot conclude that it was clearly erroneous to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Plaintiffs now assert an alternative argument: that defendants were negligent in installing the flexsteel hose because it was foreseeable that certain uses of this hose would cause an extraordinary internal pressure which would fracture the meter casting. They argue that both defendants were chargeable with such knowledge, and hence were negligent in not rectifying the condition or issuing a warning about it. The argument is ingenious when viewed in the context of the history of this case. This theory was not advanced by plaintiffs in their pre-trial statements nor in their case-in-chief; moreover, the thrust of their own expert testimony was that the flexsteel hose could not have created the rupture in the casting. The examination of plaintiffs\u2019 expert Crankshaw (Appendix, page 657a) reveals :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">\u201cQ. Is it your testimony, then, that if the high pressure relief valve was clean, that the jerking of the hose on the morning of April 29, 1964, could not have ruptured the cover of the meter ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\">A. I think that is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Apart from this patently inconsistent position of plaintiffs, the testimony indicated that the Underwriter\u2019s Laboratories, the recognized testing agency in the trade,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had placed its stamp of approval on the use of the flexsteel hose with gasoline pumps and that the hose was in general use in the trade.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It was only during the progress of this case that experts retained by defendants to conduct experiments for trial testimony discovered the peculiar characteristics of diameter-contraction, pressure-accumulation present in the hose.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The test is one of foreseeability. The trial judge concluded that Humble could not have reasonably foreseen such characteristics and consequences; to reverse that conclusion would be tantamount to a declaration that it was foreseeable as a matter of law. This we cannot do. To hold that the defendants should have known in 1964 the idiosyncracies of the flexsteel hose which were not discovered by experts until 1967, is to ignore the realities of the case, namely, that the flexsteel hose was not a component of the pump as originally manufactured, that its use was initiated over nine years after the meter was sold and installed, that the defendants were neither manufacturers nor dealers in hoses, that the flexsteel hose had received the approval of the Underwriter\u2019s Laboratories, and that it was in general use in the trade. The Supreme Court\u2019s observation in Brady v. Southern Ry. Co., 320 U.S. 476, 64 S.Ct. 232, 88 L.Ed. 239 (1943) is apropos: \u201cEvents too remote to require reasonable prevision need not be anticipated.\u201d 320 U.S. at 483, 64 S. Ct. at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">There remains the question of the possible liability of both defendants under Section 402A of .the Restatement of Torts 2d, adopted \u201cas the law of Pennsylvania\u201d in Webb v. Zern, 422 Pa. 424, 220 A.2d 853 (1966).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Assuming that A. O. Smith Corporation, as successor to Erie Meter Systems, could be considered the \u201cseller\u201d of the pump, it is clear that no liability can be imposed under Section 402A. An essential requirement for the imposition of such liability is that the product reach the ultimate user or consumer \u201cwithout substantial change in the condition in which it was sold\u201d. The section specifically provides that a seller may not be held responsible for damages brought about by a modification of his product constituting a substantial change.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">Nine years and seven months after the pump was sold, a new type hose, containing a steel wire braid component and capable of creating unusual pressure dynamics when violently stretched, replaced the type of hose ordinarily furnished with the pump. We hold that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>was a substantial change in the condition of the product and that the doctrine of strict liability may not be applied to defendant A. 0. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We now turn to defendant Humble, at whose direction the service contractor installed the flexsteel hose. Preliminarily, we must decide whether Humble can properly be classified as a \u201cseller\u201d or moreover, \u201ca seller engaged in the business of selling such a product\u201d, within the provisions of Section 402A. If Humble is not such a seller, then no responsibility may attach under the doctrine of strict liability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The trial court concluded: \u201cThe evidence showed that Humble was not in the business of selling pumps. It showed, on the contrary, that the pump in question was purchased by plaintiffs from Cemico and sold, still in place, to Humble who then leased it to plaintiffs. To find Humble liable under Section 402A because it furnished the pump assembly would thus be contrary to both the law and facts of the case.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 275 F.Supp. at 868. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In an effort to overcome these findings, plaintiffs urge the application of 402A because the pump was a \u201ccontainer\u201d of Humble\u2019s product, gasoline.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This approach completely misconstrues the meaning of that term as it is used in the Restatement. A keg is certainly a container for beer<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; a bottle is equally as much a container for beverages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> When the keg is considered with beer, and a bottle with beverages, the combinations are, in the view of the Restatement, \u201cpurchased by the user or consumer as an integrated whole * * * the container cannot logically be separated from the contents when the two are sold as a unit.\u201d The product and the actual container are considered as one unit when the test suggested by Professor Prosser is met: when the two are sold as an integrated whole, and it is inconceivable that anyone would buy one without the other.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We resist the inescapable conclusion to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that gasoline is packaged and marketed in pumps.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">The trial court found that Humble was not a seller within the meaning of Section 402A. We concur in that conclusion. Because this finding is dispositive of the appeal, no further consideration of this issue is necessary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Similarly, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>not become necessary for us to pass upon the issues of unitary enterprise and the exculpatory clause in the indemnification agreement which were raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AqN\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-24\">.

The reason for installing the new type hose was the inability of the regular hose to withstand the unusual wear-and-tear caused by the cab drivers\u2019 self-service filling station operation. There was evidence of five instances of damage to the pump hose by cab drivers prior to the switch to the new type.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">.

In his opinion, the trial judge states: \u201cDefendants\u2019 theory of the case rests upon a fact given little weight' by the plaintiffs. Noting that preceding each instance of casting fracture, the hose had been subjected to a violent jerk, Humble formulated the theory that it was the jerk, and not the inoperative valves, which caused the casting fractures. Using a pump assembly and piping constructed to simulate the conditions which obtained at the Yellow Cab garage, defendants demonstrated to the Court that even in a properly maintained and cleaned pump assembly, with all valves thereby presumably operative, the meter head casting could he fractured simply by having a man stretch the hose to its full length and give it a sharp jerk. Defendants\u2019 experts explained this phenomenon by reference to the physical characteristics of the hose installed on the pump at the Yellow Cab garage and at the demonstrations. The hose, a Goodyear Flexsteel brand, is constructed of wire braid encased in rubber, which gives it greater strength and resistance to crushing, as when driven over by an automobile. As indicated, defendants\u2019 witnesses testified that this hose had been installed on the pump at the Yellow Cab garage because the abuse given other hoses had resulted in their being crushed and unsuitable for use. A peculiar characteristic of this hose, however, defendants\u2019 experts testified, was that because of the wire mesh construction, the bore of the hose, when stretched, tended to decrease at a rate greater than the length increased, resulting in a sharp reduction of volume and corresponding sharp increase in pressure, which, when transmitted back along the pipe to the meter head easting, caused the fracture.\u201d 275 F.Supp. at 866-867.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">.

Evidence of common usage, custom or practice does not rule out negligence; it is nonetheless relevant to a determination of the standard of reasonable care and prudence to which the defendants are held. Forry v. Gulf Oil Corp., 428 Pa. 334, 237 A.2d 593 (1968); Donnelly v. Fred Whittaker Co., 364 Pa. 387, 72 A.2d 61 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b825-5\">. Since the decision in <em>Weil), </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled on other aspects of Section 402A in Ferraro v. Ford Motor Co., 423 Pa. 324, 223 A.2d 746 (1966); Forry v. Gulf Oil Corp., supra, and Bialek v. Pittsburgh Brewing Co., 430 Pa. 176, 242 A.2d 231 (1968). In <em>Ferraro </em>the Court held that if the buyer knows of the defect and voluntarily and unreasonably proceeds to use it, he is precluded from recovery. <em>Bialele </em>emphasized that liability imposed under Section 402A is for <em>selling </em>the product and not for causing the defect. Thus, sellers in the distributive chain are equally as liable as the manufacturer who produced the defective product. In <em>Forry, </em>an equally divided court held that where the plaintiff alleged damages caused jointly by the use of a defective product and the active negligence of a third party, both elements of defective production and negligence must be established to impose liability on either.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\"><em>Webb </em>was decided on June 24, 1966, the same day as Miller v. Preitz, 422 Pa. 383, 221 A.2d 320. The concurring and dissenting opinions by Justice Jones and Justice Roberts set forth in elaborate detail the case law of Pennsylvania with respect to strict product liability where the action is contractual, based on breach of warranty resulting from a defect in the product. In interpreting the Uniform Commercial Code, Act of April 6, 1953, P.L. 3, \u00a7 2-318, as amended by the Act of October 2, 1959, P.L. 1023, \u00a7 2, 12A P.S. \u00a7 2-318 (Supp., 1965), it was held that the right to recover in contract extended only to the immediate buyer of the product or those persons specifically described in the Code, and that, unless privity of contract (either factually or code-wise) be established, no right of recovery exists. Hochgertel v. Canada Dry Corp., 409 Pa. 610, 187 A.2d 575 (1963). This distinction between the liability of remote manufacturers based on whether the suit was brought in contract or tort was recently abandoned in Kassab v. Central Soya, Pa., 246 A.2d 848 (1968). Specifically overruling the <em>Miller </em>case, the court held that: \u201c * * * Pennsylvania should join the fast growing list of jurisdictions that have eliminated the privity requirement in assumpsit suits by purchasers against remote manufacturers for breach of implied warranty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\">. A distinction must be drawn between the general liability of a \u201csupplier\u201d of chattels, as set forth in Chapter 14 of the Restatement of Torts, which is grounded in negligence, and the specific liability of a \u201cseller\u201d, as contained in Section 402A, which is based on strict liability. Although Section 402A is located in Chapter 14, its comment \u201ca\u201d clearly statutes that its inclusion is \u201cfor convenience of reference and comparison with other sections dealing with negligence\u201d. For example, Sections 407 and 408, specifically deal with the liability of \u201clessors of chattels\u201d, and are based not on strict liability, but on general principles of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\">.
