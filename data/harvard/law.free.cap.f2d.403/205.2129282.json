Kern, for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant contends, among other things, that the district court erred in holding that both his guilty plea and written confession were voluntary, and that his confession was properly admitted into evidence at the state court hearing to determine his degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-27\">We have carefully examined the entire record in this case, and we have concluded that all of appellant\u2019s contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-28\">Accordingly, the order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
