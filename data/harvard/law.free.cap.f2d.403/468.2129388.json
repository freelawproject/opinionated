Defendant has served his jail sentence and paid the fine and costs. Subsequent to defendant\u2019s conviction the Government moved in the District Court to withdraw the bribe money \u2014 $300\u2014which it had deposited in the registry of the office of the Clerk of the District Court. The Court denied the motion and ordered the money returned to the defendant. The Government appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">The contested issue on appeal is whether, under the circumstances of this case, the District Court\u2019s- return of the bribe money to the defendant, a convicted briber, was a matter subject to the Court\u2019s discretion. We hold that it was not and therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s order..</p>\n<p id=\"b522-24\">At the hearing before the District Court the defendant urged that he was in \u201crather dire financial straits,\u201d that he had a retarded son to support, and that the circumstances surrounding the offense presented a \u201cclear flavor of entrapment.\u201d Defendant now contends that these factors, along with others contained in the pre-sentence report, formed a basis authorizing the Court in the exercise of discretion to order the bribe money returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-25\">On the facts here involved, we perceive no permissible area for the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ercise of such a discretion. While the two relevant statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> do not vest an indefeasable interest to bribe money in the United States, they contain nothing which makes it discretionary with the Court as to whether or not the money will be returned to the convicted briber. It is our opinion that a person seeking return of money deposited pursuant to \u00a7 3612 must demonstrate a right to the return of the money to him. And, in this connection, we are of the view that the holding in Clark v. United States, 102 U.S. 322, 26 L.Ed. 181, is dispositive of this case. In Clark it was pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cClearly this was bribery, and placed the claimants and the man they corrupted <em>in pari delicto. </em>They could not recover back from him the money they paid, neither can they from the United States after it has been taken from him * * * \u201d 102 U.S. at 331-332.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In this connection, United States v. Thomas, 75 F.2d 369, 371 (5th Cir. 1935) observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201c * * * If he was guilty of bribery, he could not have recovered the bribe money back from the customs officers, and has no better claim against the United States. Clark v. United States, 102 U.S. 322, 332, 26 L.Ed. 181; St. Louis, V. &amp; T. H. R. Co. v. Terre Haute &amp; I. R. R. Co., 145 U.S. 393, 407, 12 S. Ct. 953, 36 L.Ed. 748; Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., 197 U.S. 244, 295, 25 S.Ct. 493, 49 L.Ed. 739.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">See also United States v. Galbreath, 8 F.2d 360 (D.C.N.D.Cal.1925); Arter v. Byington, 44 Ill. 468 (1807); Goodrich v. Tenney, 44 Ill.App. 331 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\"> A convicted briber forfeits any right he had to the bribe money. Therefore, ordinarily, the Government alone is entitled to the money used to bribe its agent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">We are not persuaded by United States v. Connoughton, 39 F.2d 237 (D.C.E.D. N.Y.1930), heavily relied upon by the defendant, insofar as it may be taken as expressing a contrary view.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">The order below is therefore reversed. Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612.

Any claimant entitled any such money may, on petition to the court and upon notice to the United States attorney and full proof of the right thereto, obtain an order directing payment to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-22\">. The Government distinguishes the case where the bribe money belongs to someone other than the briber, in which case that party, and not the Government, would be entitled to the money.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b523-17\">HASTINGS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AiI\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">Although this case is concerned with the small sum of $300 and with the unpleasant circumstance of attempted bribery of a government employee, I am compelled to dissent because I believe an important question of law is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">Iovenelli was indicted by a federal grand jury charging defendant with giving $300 to an agent of the Treasury Department of the United States with intent to influence his decision and action on a matter in connection with income tax returns pending before him in his official capacity, in violation of Title 18, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">Defendant was represented by able counsel and entered a plea of not guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>to the charge. After discovery proceedings in the trial court, and acting on the advice of counsel, defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty. The guilty plea was accepted by the district court and defendant was adjudged guilty thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Subsequently, the cause was referred for pre-sentence investigation and a report was made to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to a term of probation for a period of two years, the first 90 days of which were to be served in a county jail, and was fined $1,000 and costs. Defendant served the 90-day term in a county jail, paid the $1,000 fine and costs in full and in addition fully paid the underlying civil tax liability and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Defendant did not appeal his conviction and is currently on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Following defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence, the Government deposited the sum of $300 in the registry of the office of the clerk of the district court, such sum representing a part of its evidence of prosecution for attempted bribery.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">About a year later, after defendant had served his jail sentence and satisfied his fine and costs, the United States moved in the district court for entry of an order commanding the clerk of such court to withdraw the sum of $300 previously deposited in the clerk\u2019s registry and pay it to the United States Treasury to the credit of and for the use of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Defendant appeared by his trial counsel and objected to the Government\u2019s motion for forfeiture. A hearing was had thereon in the district court, the Honorable William J. Lynch presiding. The district court denied the Government\u2019s motion and ordered the $300 paid to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Subsequently, the United States moved for reconsideration of the order of payment to defendant and, after a hearing thereon, the motion for reconsideration was denied. The United States appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">The controlling statute in this proceeding is Title 18, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3612, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">\u201cMoneys received or tendered in evidence in any United States Court, or before any officer thereof, which have been paid to or received by any official as a bribe, shall, after the final disposition of the case, proceeding or investigation, be deposited in the registry of the court to be disposed of in accordance with the order of the court, to be subject, however, to the provisions of section 2042 of Title 28.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">The majority opinion states that the \u201ccontested issue on appeal is whether, under the circumstances of this case, the District Court\u2019s return of the bribe money to the defendant, a convicted briber, was a matter subject to the Court\u2019s discretion.\u201d The majority held that it was not and reversed the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">The majority further states \u201cthat a person seeking return of money deposited pursuant to \u00a7 3612 must demonstrate a right to the return of the money to him\u201d and found the holding in Clark v. United States, 102 U.S. 322, 26 L.Ed. 181 (1880) to be \u201cdispositive of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKm\">The majority finally concludes that a \u201cconvicted briber forfeits any right he had to the bribe money. Therefore, ordinarily, the Government alone is entitled to the money used to bribe its agent,\u201d distinguishing the case where the bribe money belongs to someone other than the briber.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">I respectfully disagree on the statement of the contested issue before us and on the legal conclusions drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">The Government and the majority concede, as well they must, that the relevant statutory provisions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cdo not vest an indefeasable interest to bribe money in the United States,\u201d but state that \u201cthey contain nothing which makes it discretion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ary with the Court as to whether or not the money will be returned to the convicted briber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In my view, the statute expressly leaves the disposition of bribe moneys deposited in the registry of the court \u201cto be disposed of in accordance with the order of the court * * Congress did not see fit to provide for an automatic forfeiture as it coul\u00a1d have done. Yet, that is the effect of the majority holding. The statute gives no direction to the district court on the disposition to be made. It obviously leaves this decision to the district court, in the exercise of its discretion under the facts of each individual ease. To hold otherwise, it appears to me, violates the clear meaning of the statute. See United States v. Connoughton, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 39 F.2d 237 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">I find no case holding that the statute does <em>not </em>leave requested disposition to the discretion of the trial court. Clark v. United States, supra, found dispositive of this case by the majority, is clearly not applicable here. <em>Clark </em>was a <em>civil action </em>brought by plaintiffs to recover from the United States bribe money paid by them to a customs agent. It was paid for the release from government seizure of a shipment of cotton during the Civil War at the Port of New Orleans. A special commission in New Orleans was appointed by the Secretary of War, with the sanction of President Lincoln, and it investigated the matter. The commission placed the corrupt government official in solitary confinement and the proceeds of the bribe money were confiscated by the commission and eventually were deposited in the treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In <em>Clark, </em>the Court held that this was bribery (and not extortion as claimed) and \u201cplaced the claimants and the man they corrupted <em>in pari delicto. </em>They could not recover back from him the <em>money </em>they paid, neither can they from the United States after <em>it has been taken from him </em>[the corrupt official] <em>as a punishment for his faithlessness to his trust.\u201d </em>Emphasis supplied. The Court clearly refused to relieve plaintiffs from an illegal contract. <em>Clark </em>was not a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">The majority\u2019s reliance on quoted dictum in United States v. Thomas, 5 Cir., 75 F.2d 369 (1935), is similarly misplaced. In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendant had been charged with bribery and after the <em>charge was </em>abandoned (following a plea to a lesser charge) and limitations had run against prosecution therefor, sought return of the alleged bribe money. The trial court rejected the Government\u2019s answer, without a hearing, that the money was paid as a bribe, on the ground that since defendant could no longer be prosecuted for bribery he was entitled to return of the money. The Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded for a hearing on the factual questions presented by the Government\u2019s rejected answer. No one could quarrel with such a remandment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">Believing as I do that \u00a7 3612, supra, permits the district court to exercise its discretion under appropriate circumstances,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the remaining question for this court to determine is whether the Government has made such a clear showing of abuse of discretion as to require a reversal. I think not. The Government has not faced up to this issue, relying instead on its legal contention that bribe money is not recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">In the hearing before the district court it was advised of the facts of the case, including the overtones of entrapment. In satisfying his legal obligations, as well as his 90 days imprisonment, the defendant was in dire financial straits. It was urged that defendant was of minimal intelligence quotient himself and had the care of a retarded son. The trial court had the benefit of its personal observation of defendant in open court on several occasions. And, the trial court had the further benefit of the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tion contained in the pre-sentence investigation report, which is not available to us on appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Without in any sense condoning attempted bribery or in any manner suggesting how I might have viewed the circumstances of this case in passing on the merits of the Government\u2019s motion for forfeiture, had I been on the trial bench, I would hold that the Government has not sustained its burden of showing that the district court was guilty of a manifest abuse of discretion in entering the order on appeal. We should not substitute our discretionary judgment for that of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Under the facts of this case, I would affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2042 is relevant here only where it states: \u201cNo money deposited shall be withdrawn except by order of court.\u201d No five year period has elapsed in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\">. I approve the holding in United States v. Connoughton, supra, to the effect that \u00a7 3612, supra, (a similar section there) \u201cinvites the exercise of discretion under appropriate circumstances.\u201d A refund of bribe money was ordered in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
