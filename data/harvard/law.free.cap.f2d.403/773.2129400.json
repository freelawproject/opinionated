The appellant has alleged that he was unable to appeal from this judgment, due to his indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-24\">Effective July 1, 1967, several months prior to the date on which the appellant\u2019s Federal habeas petition was finally adjudicated, the State of Georgia enacted its new Habeas Corpus Act, Georgia Code \u00a7 50-127. The statute provides that the exclusive post-conviction remedy for a state convict, beyond the direct appeal, is by petition for habeas corpus filed in the state superior court of the county where the applicant is being detained. The statute also expands the scope of grounds upon which the writ can be granted. See Peters v. Rutledge, 5 Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 731 [June 6, 1965], and cases there cited; State of Texas v. Payton, 5 Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>216. The appellant has not sought to avail himself of this remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed for the reason that the appellant has failed to exhaust his available state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
