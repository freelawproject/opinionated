Following a full evidentiary hearing at which appellant was represented by court-appointed counsel, the district court concluded that there was no merit to appellant\u2019s contentions and denied the writ, 280 F.Supp. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">Having carefully reviewed that record and the opinion of the district court, we have concluded that the findings of the district court are not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment must be and hereby is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
