On February 25, 1965, Catfish King, Inc., a corporation wholly owned by the husband, sold certain property, and, in accordance with the earlier consent judgment, $15,000 of the proceeds of the sale was paid over to the wife. In May 1965 the corporation was declared a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-26\">On a plenary hearing in which Trustee sought to recapture the funds from the former wife, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Court found that the assets sold on February 25 were the assets of the corporation, Catfish King, Inc., rather than the husband. Consequently, the sale proceeds paid to the wife ($15,000) was the money of the corporation. The Court found further that the transfer to the wife was without consideration, and that at the time of the transfer the corporation was insolvent. These facts bring the transaction squarely within the definition of fraudulent transfer contained in Section 67(d) (2) (a) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The District Court\u2019s fact findings more than pass muster under F.R. Civ.P. 52(a). The burden of showing that the findings are clearly erroneous \u2014not carried here \u2014 is on the party attacking them. See Chaney v. City of Galveston, 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 774. The trial judge\u2019s findings have adequate basis as does his judgment that transfer by the corporation must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
