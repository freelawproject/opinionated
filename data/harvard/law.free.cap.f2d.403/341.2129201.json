Counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-21\">I stayed up last night trying to prepare for this case based on what he wanted. Now I realized the handicaps I have been under, and I have been appointed, your Honor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-22\">THE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-23\">COUNSEL: And he never told me about his disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-24\">THE COURT: My only point is whether or not at the present time there is some question concerning his mental competence, because if there is why I should have him examined by a psychiatrist. My only question to you is not what you have advised him to do, which I will disavow, but whether or not he has given any indication to you that he couldn\u2019t understand the proceedings and he has been able to tell you what he wanted about this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-25\">COUNSEL: No. He has been in fact trying to call too many shots here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-26\">THE COURT: All right. Very well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-27\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then rested for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-28\">The case was submitted without argument. The judge, sitting without a jury, found appellant guilty. The court ordered a presentence report and continued the case for sentence for approximately thirty days, to September 18, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-29\">On that date the court, on its own motion, ordered the defendant \u201cexamined as to his competency,\u201d and continued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>case to October 9, 1967, \u201cfor hearing on competency and all further proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">On September 20 the court appointed a psychiatrist, Dr. Marcus Crahan, to examine appellant and determine whether appellant had the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his own defense, and whether he \u201cwas legally insane\u201d at the time of the commission of the offenses for which he had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Dr. Crahan filed his report on October 9. On the same date, the court received Veterans Administration records requested by Dr. Crahan which detailed appellant\u2019s medical history. These were then transmitted to Dr. Crahan, and the hearing was continued to October 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Dr. Crahan\u2019s October 9 report was based upon an interview with appellant, the Veterans Administration records not then being available. Appellant\u2019s narrative, as summarized in Dr. Crahan\u2019s report, included the following recitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In 1944 appellant received a skull fracture from a hand grenade explosion while in the Army. Appellant was treated at several government hospitals, which he named, and at the Menninger Clinic. In May 1945 appellant was given a medical, service-connected discharge on the basis of dementia praecox. In 1953 he returned to the Menninger Clinic for six or eight months, suffering from headaches, nervous spells, blackouts, and collapse. He received shock therapy and medication. After his discharge from the Menninger Clinic, appellant engaged in professional boxing, fighting 103 bouts. He quit boxing in 1958 \u2014 his license was revoked when it was learned that he was suffering from dementia praecox. Sometime between 1958 and 1960 his illness recurred. The Veterans Administration advised him to quit working, and raised his disability compensation. He began to feel better, and worked until 1964 when his headaches began to bother him again. The Veterans Administration again advised him to quit working, and he did so until June or July 1965. On two occasions, he attempted suicide, the last sometime after August 1964. The offenses with which he was charged occurred in July, August, and September of that year. He drank close to a pint of whiskey a day, \u201cuntil the dizzy spells or fainting spells or pressure go away.\u201d He thought he had \u201ca form of incompetency where I do things on impulse, and if this is true I do want to be treated.\u201d He was receiving total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Dr. Crahan concluded that although appellant\u2019s future prognosis was questionable, appellant was able to understand the proceedings against him, and was \u201clegally sane\u201d both at the time of the examination and at the time the offenses were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Appellant\u2019s counsel received a copy of this October 9 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">On October 23, Dr. Crahan filed a supplemental report based upon an examination of the Veterans Administration records. Some of the information contained in these records is described in Dr. Crahan\u2019s report, including the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Appellant received a head injury in September 1944 while in the Army and was hospitalized. He complained of dizzy spells and gave a history of head injuries while boxing before entering the service. X-rays taken on January 10, 1945, showed a calcified hematoma of the skull. In March 1945, appellant \u201cwas transferred to Winter General Hospital\u201d where he remained until his discharge on May 31, 1945, with a 10 per cent disability rating based upon a \u201ccondition aggravated by service in World War II, \u2018encephalopathy, post-traumatic, secondary to repeated trauma to head during boxing bouts prior to induction ; otitis media, right, mild.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">On December 23, 1947, an examining doctor wrote, \u201cHe undoubtedly has sustained injury to his brain during his boxing periods and this is shown not only by his complaints but also by his X-ray of the brain and his general attitude to things. * * * This examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>believes that a diagnosis of encephalopathy, post-traumatic, is justifiable. * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">On August 13, 1953, appellant \u201cwas admitted for a second time to Winter Veterans Administration Hospital * * complaining of blackouts, headaches, and dizziness.\u201d The diagnosis was as follows: \u201cClinical impression: (a) prognosis guarded; (b) competency: the patient is incompetent; (c) disposition: continue hospitalization. Diagnosis: Schizophrenic reaction, schizoid affected type, severe, manifested by delusions of grandeur, delusions of persecution, extreme narcissism, faulty associations, tension, faulty judgment, and hypomanic behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On January 20, 1954, appellant was declared 100 per cent disabled. On May 24, 1956, a Veterans Administration letter states, \u201cThe veteran\u2019s psychosis is rateable at 100% * *</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">After summarizing these and other portions of appellant\u2019s Veterans Administration record, Dr. Crahan stated that he adhered to the conclusions stated in his original report.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel received a copy of Dr. Crahan\u2019s supplemental report.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">On the day Dr. Crahan\u2019s supplemental report was filed, October 23, the trial court held a hearing on competency and for sentencing. The government submitted Dr. Crahan\u2019s reports. The court inquired whether appellant had any evidence to offer. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated that appellant had written a letter which appellant wished to read to the court. The court permitted appellant to read his letter. In it, appellant presented his definition of dementia praecox, \u201cwhat I now suffer,\u201d and concluded, \u201cIf Dr. Marcus Crahan does not agree with the above definition then I should like the services of two other psychiatric examinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Appellant\u2019s counsel offered nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The court found appellant competent.</p>\n<p id=\"ASh\">Proceeding to sentence, the court heard from appellant personally, then asked appellant\u2019s counsel if he had anything to say. Counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">I have seen the probation report and I have reviewed Dr. Crahan\u2019s report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">However, as I say, I am not completely convinced in my own mind that this man is not in need of medical care based on the previous testimony made before your Honor and also on the fact when he read this letter on the definition of dementia praecox, I could see where some of the items would fit in with Dr. Crahan\u2019s report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">Accordingly I would submit that your Honor would in his sentencing provide for some medical care for this defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then stated in response to the court\u2019s inquiry that there was no legal reason why sentence should not be pronounced. The court proceeded to sentence appellant to a total imprisonment of ten years, and a fine of $1,500. The sole specification of error is that the trial court\u2019s finding of competency to stand trial was arbitrary and unwarranted because the court simply adopted the conclusion of Dr. Crahan as its own judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">The trial judge is not to be faulted. It was the trial judge who brought appellant\u2019s disability to light. It was the trial judge, on his own motion, who initiated the inquiry into appellant\u2019s competency, secured the services of a psychiatrist, and set the matter for hearing. The trial judge had nothing but the appointed psychiatrist\u2019s reports to base his decision upon, for nothing else was presented to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-19\">Appellant\u2019s counsel does not fare so well. He made no pretrial inquiry into appellant\u2019s disability, though reason for inquiry had been fairly presented to him. When appellant\u2019s condition was disclosed on the record at trial, counsel made no request for a continuance to enable him to investigate but simply rested appellant\u2019s defense. Cf. Brooks v. State of Texas, 381 F.2d 619, 622-623 (5th Cir. 1967); Hintz v. Beto, 379 F.2d 937, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>941-942 (5th Cir. 1967). He did not move, then or thereafter, for an inquiry into appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial, or his mental capacity to commit the offense, although the necessity for such inquiry was obvious. Counsel offered no evidence to assist the court in its determination of these critical issues, either by examination of Dr. Crahan or by offering proof of independent facts and opinion. Because of counsel\u2019s defaults, the many questions suggested by the factual recitations in Dr. Crahan\u2019s reports relating to appellant\u2019s condition went unanswered, and the record was wholly inadequate for a proper determination of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Ordinarily, adequacy of representation can be determined only by a hearing directed to that issue at which evidence is produced relating to facts outside the trial record. Here, however, it appears from the face of the trial record that counsel\u2019s efforts fell below minimum constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
