In September 1962, the National Labor Relations Board, after an unfair labor practice proceeding, issued a decision and order directing Miami Coca-Bottling Company to reinstate with back pay certain employees discriminatorily discharged in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act. In November 1963, this Court entered a decree enforcing the Board\u2019s decision and order. 324 F.2d 501. The Trial Examiner conducted hearings in June and in August 1964 to determine the amount due each discriminatee. Thereafter, the Board, in its Supplemental Decision and Order issued April 14, 1965, affirmed the Trial Examiner\u2019s decision requiring the respondent to pay specified amounts of backpay to the discriminatees. 151 NLRB 1701. In August 1966, this Court upheld the Board's position except with regard to one of the discharged employees, Robert W. Shepard. 360 F.2d 569. As to Shepard, the Court overruled various objections to his being awarded backpay, but sustained the respondent\u2019s contention that the Trial Examiner erred in prohibiting the employer\u2019s cross-examining Shepard about his sources of income during the backpay period. We remanded the relevant portion of the order, holding that the examiner \u201cshould have permitted the cross-examination [of Shepard] in order to obtain a \u2018full and true disclosure of the facts\u2019 360 F.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">On remand, a supplemental hearing was held October 3, 1966, devoted exclusively to cross-examination of Shepard by Mr. David A. Barthoff, one of the attorneys for the respondent. At the end of the hearing, Mr. Barthoff reserved the right to file a brief. The Trial Examiner set October <em>24 </em>as the due date. On October 12 the Examiner received the respondent\u2019s application for leave to take depositions of Robert Shepard, his wife, Mrs. Irene Shepard, John Mackie (owner of the Klondike Bar, where Mrs. Shepard had been employed), and Mickey Killen (Shepard\u2019s employer during the first year of the backpay period). On October <em>18 the </em>respondent <em>filed </em>a Motion for Extension of time for filing his brief. Several days later, Mr. Barthoff requested that he be allowed to take the depositions or, in the alternative, that the hearing be reopened to permit the respondent to examine the four witnesses on the open record. The Trial Examiner denied these applications. He issued his Supplemental Decision on Remand on November 1, 1966, reaffirming his original award to Shepard since, despite the \u201cconsiderable latitude\u201d given the respondent in cross-examining Shepard, no evidence was adduced to alter the original determination. March 27, 1967, the Board adopted the findings and recommendations of the Trial Examiner and now asks us to enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">The respondent opposes enforcement of the Board\u2019s order on the ground that it did not receive a \u201cfull and fair\u201d hearing upon the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">Before the second hearing the Company filed an application to take the depositions of Shepard and others. The <em>Company sought to question </em>Shepard as to the whereabouts of two interim employers, Mickey Killen and Jimmy Dico, allegedly because it had not been able to locate these men before the original backpay hearing. The Regional Director denied this request for two reasons: at the first hearing Shepard had been examined about his earnings while employed by Killen and Dico, so that consideration of these sources of information was outside the scope of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>mand; Shepard would be presented as a witness at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">The respondent then filed Interrogatories and a Second Application for Leave to Take Depositions. This application stated that the respondent \u201cdesires to take the deposition * * * regarding not only the matters set forth in the earlier application * * * but also to probe Shepard\u2019s other sources of income during the backpay period, in order to properly prepare for the hearing\u201d. The interrogatories asked that Shepard state \u201call sources of income, of whatever nature\u201d, including \u201cfringe benefits of any monetary value\u201d during the backpay period. The Director denied both requests, stating that \u201cthe Board\u2019s procedures make no provision for pre-trial discovery (Walsh-Lumpkin Wholesale Truck Company, 129 NLRB 294, 296) and that the requirement of \u00a7 10(b) of the Act, that unfair labor practice proceedings before the Board \u2018shall so far as practicable, be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of the United States\u2019 relates only \u2018to the introduction of evidence before the Board and not to the pre-trial privileges accorded parties to judicial proceedings\u2019 Del E. Webb Construction Company, 95 NLRB 377, footnote 2\u201d. The Director concluded therefore that the respondent had shown \u201cinsufficient cause why protection of its rights requires a pre-hearing examination of Robert W. Shepard in this situation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">If he meant, as he seems to say, that there is no pre-trial discovery in labor proceedings, the Director erred. The Board\u2019s regulations expressly provide for pre-trial depositions, \u201cif in his discretion good cause has been shown\u201d. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.30(a). In a similar case, N.L.R.B. v. Safeway Steel Scaffolds Company of Georgia, 5 Cir. 1967, 383 F.2d 273, this Court pointed out that \u00a7 102.30(a) provides for the taking of pre-trial depositions and that \u00a7 10(b) of the Act \u201cwould appear to give a trial examiner authority to permit the taking of depositions in any case where such a procedure would be practical\u201d. We concluded that \u201cthe examiner was wrong in holding that there is absolutely no provision for pretrial discovery\u201d. 383 F.2d at 277. If discovery is practicable in the circumstances of the case and if it is not used to harass or coerce employees, \u201c[t]he Board, acting in a quasi judicial capacity as it does, should freely permit discovery procedure in order that the rights of all parties may be properly protected\u201d. N. L. R. B. v. Southern Materials Company, Inc., 4 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">In his brief filed in this Court, General Counsel apparently overlooked the Director\u2019s error. The brief rephrases the Director\u2019s reasons as based \u201con the grounds that the Board\u2019s procedures make no provision for pretrial discovery <em>as a matter of right, </em>and respondent had shown \u2018insufficient cause\u2019 to believe such discovery was <em>essential </em>to the \u2018protection of its rights\u2019 \u201d. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">As in <em>Safeway Steel, </em>however, the error was not fatal. The Director reached the right result in spite of using the wrong reason. At the original back-pay hearing the Company was permitted to question Shepard freely about his employment by Killen and Dico. The record demonstrates that the respondent knew of their addresses at the hearing, if not before. Mr. Barthoff and Shepard agreed that Killen\u2019s correct address was 665 Northeast 66 Street, and Mr. Barthoff indicated that he had received this information the preceding Saturday. As to Dico, Mr. Barthoff referred to an \u201caddress which we found out from [Shepard] this morning\u201d. Thus, if the respondent failed to interview Killen and Dico, it was not for lack of information as to their whereabouts; the respondent did not need to depose Shepard in this regard. Nor was it necessary to depose him as to \u201cother sources of income\u201d. He was presented as a witness, and the Company was given an unlimited opportunity to question him at the remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>hearing. In short, the respondent failed at the threshold to present good cause to take prehearing depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Second, the respondent contends that at the remand hearing the Trial Examiner \u201cunlawfully limited\u201d the scope of the cross-examination of Shepard. The purpose of the hearing was to permit the Company to establish Shepard\u2019s income during the backpay period, and in particular during the first year when the Board\u2019s backpay specification showed only $400 earned, as an employee of Mickey Killen. Questioned by respondent's counsel, Shepard testified that during that first year he had withdrawn \u201capproximately $1000 from a credit union account, had received about $330 in unemployment compensation, and had also lived on his wife\u2019s earnings as a waitress at the Klondike Bar \u2014 \u201cbetween the tips and what other money she made probably $75 a week\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">It is true that the Trial Examiner sustained objection to certain questions as vague. The respondent particularly objects to its not being allowed to ask Shepard if he had received any other \u201cthings of value\u201d during the backpay period from any persons other than those he had already named in the earlier hearing. Later, however, the Company was permitted to elicit the specific income information. It was also permitted to ask whether Shepard had received \u201cany other things of monetary value during the first year following [his] discharge\u201d. When Shepard answered \u201cNo,\u201d the Company followed up with questions about his receiving \u201cany other things of monetary value\u201d from \u201cany interim employer\u201d or \u201cfrom any other person other than those you have already named\u201d. To make sure Shepard understood what the Company meant by \u201cmonetary value\u201d, Shepard was asked specifically about \u201cany fringe benefits which you did not testify to before, such as the use of a Company car, hospitalization or other insurance, clothing allowance, cleaning allowances, Company uniform * * * free lunches * * * free transportation\u201d. To all these questions, Shepard answered \u201cNo.\u201d In effect, the Company was permitted unlimited inquiry into Shepard\u2019s income during the backpay period, from whatever source and in whatever form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">Third, the respondent objects to the examiner\u2019s refusal to reopen the hearing because of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">Two days after the hearing, Mr. Barthoff telephoned John Mackie, owner of the Klondike Bar where Mrs. Shepard had worked in 1961-62. Mr. Mackie informed him that Mrs. Shepard had worked only part-time, was paid only $25 a week in wages, and had received \u201calmost nothing\u201d in tips. This information contradicts Shepard\u2019s testimony that while out of work he lived on his wife\u2019s weekly earnings of $75. Moreover, it would imply that Shepard had other, undisclosed sources of income that should be set off against the backpay award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">The Company, in applying for a reopening of the hearing, pointed out that the Regional Director\u2019s denial of prehearing discovery had made it impossible for the Company to reach Mackie until after the hearing. It, therefore, applied for leave to depose Mackie, Shepard and others, or, in the alternative, to reopen the hearing. Mackie\u2019s name did not come up until the hearing. Since the Company was denied discovery, the Company could pursue Mackie\u2019s story only by a post-hearing investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-15\">On this showing, the Trial Examiner might properly have reopened the hearing. But it was not an abuse of discretion to deny the respondent\u2019s motion. There comes a time when even labor hearings must draw to an end. This case has crawled along since 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">Even assuming that Mrs. Shephard\u2019s tips did not exceed $5 per week, and her salary amounted to $25, her weekly earnings of $30 would come to $1600 yearly. And, as the remand hearing de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>veloped, to this sum must be added what Shepard was paid by Mickey Killen ($440), drew from savings ($1000), and received from unemployment compensation ($330). The total is $3300 during this year \u2014 enough to exist on, if not to live well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Moreover, the Trial Examiner was entitled to be skeptical about the reliability of Mackie\u2019s report of Mrs. Shepard\u2019s earnings. Mackie gave this information \u2014about matters four or five years before \u2014 off the top of his head. It is difficult to understand why respondent did not immediately interview Mackie and examine his records to ascertain the actual facts about Mrs. Shepard\u2019s employment. Not having done so, the Company was not in a position to make the specific offer of proof which the Board\u2019s rules contemplate (\u00a7 102.48(d)), when it sought to have the Trial Examiner reopen the hearing. Nor did it investigate this matter later, so that when it appealed from the Trial Examiner to the Board, it still had nothing more probative to offer on the question of Mrs. Shepard\u2019s earnings than the report of a phone call to Mackie.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The Trial Examiner and the Board could reasonably conclude that the respondent\u2019s allegation about Mackie, even if true, would not require it to discredit Shepard\u2019s testimony and disqualify him from any award of backpay. Accordingly, the Board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Finally, the Company contends that the Trial Examiner\u2019s refusal to extend the time for filing its brief requires another remand. The record is short. The only issues are procedural. These were argued in the post-hearing applications for depositions or for reopening the record. The Trial Examiner\u2019s action did not prejudice the Company\u2019s case. See Safeway Steel and the cases there cited. 383 F.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s Second Supplemental Order should and will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
