He appeals on the ground that the proofs before the District Judge were insufficient to establish that'he had knowledge that the stolen car in which he was arrested was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-28\">Our review of the evidential record indicates that there was ample evidence from which the District Judge could properly have inferred that he did have such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-29\">Among other evidential factors, appellant\u2019s testimony was in direct conflict with that of the owner of the stolen automobile. The District Judge believed the latter. The credibility of wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>nesses is an issue for the trier of the facts. Butzman v.
