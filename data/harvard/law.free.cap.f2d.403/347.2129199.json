The officer being , ,, in that vicinity when he received the report\u2019 soon thereafter observed a white Falcon going east on the highway and proceeded to give chase, finally stopping the vehicle. Appellant and his co-defendant, Jenders, both dressed in military \u201e . ,, , . fatigue clothing, were the occupants of car\u2019 Jenders in the driver s seat. The officer asked to see the car registration certificate and Jenders\u2019 driver\u2019s license. When neither was produeed the officer pressed the two men for theSe items \u00b0f identification. Under these circumstances, appellant jumped from the car and stated: \u201cAll right, you got us and we stole the car.\u201d Moments later State Police Officer arrived at the scene to assist Officer Moreno. Both suspects then pro- .... duced military identification cards and admitted being absent without leave.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The officers placed both men under arrest; advised them of their rights; <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and proceeded to search them before taking them to Las Cruces where they appeared before a justice of the peace. The evidence is conflicting as to exactly what transpired at that time but appellant admitted that he knew he was confined to the county jail to be held for the military authorities. Moreno testified that as soon as he incarcerated the two men he notified the proper military authorities by telephone that the two were being held.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">An Agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed both men during the late afternoon of December 30 after advising them of their rights and procuring from appellant a written waiver of rights. Appellant again admitted the theft of the car and the fact that he was AWOL from the Marines. Sometime after 5:00 p. m. that Saturday afternoon, the F.B.I. Agent contacted the United States Commissioner at Las Cruces and the Commissioner set the appearance date for the two men for the following Tuesday, January 2, with Sunday and New Year\u2019s Day intervening.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Appellant, at the trial, admitted that he and Jenders stole the car in San Diego, transported it to New Mexico and that he drove the ear about a hundred miles during the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The points raised here are so unsubstantial and lacking in merit that they are easily disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Appellant first says that his arrest was illegal and that he was not sufficiently advised of his Constitutional rights prior to making the admissions to Officer Moreno. The officer had inforj mation that two men, wearing military fatigue clothing and driving a white Falcon car, attempted to sell the car at a curio shop. This information was clearly sufficient to justify the officer in stopping the car and inquiring about the car\u2019s registration certificate and the driver\u2019s license. Once the car was stopped by the officer and in the course of the investigation appellant volunteered the admissions that the car was stolen and that he was AWOL from the Marines. These were not forced, coerced or involuntary admissions, but were produced by on-the-scene questioning concerning state ear registration and driver\u2019s license requirements. As such they are excepted from the rule laid down in Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 477, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The investigation had certainly not reached the accusatory stage and no effort had been made by Officer Moreno to elicit <em>any </em>admission from either appellant or Jenders, the driver of the car. With these admissions the officer legally arrested the two men and incident to the arrests, searched the persons of both men and the automobile in which they were riding. The search of the car was made after appellant and Jenders had admitted the ear did not belong to them, thus the search was not an invasion of their property rights or of their privacy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">Appellant contends that the oral statements made to the F.B.I. Agent were not admissible in that such statements were the product of the earlier illegal statements made by him to Officer Moreno and were \u201cin violation of the McNabb-Mallory Rule.\u201d The first part of this point has been previously dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>cussed. The undisputed evidence shows that Sablowski was booked in the county-jail at 11:20 a. m. following his arrest and appearance before a state magistrate earlier that morning. F.B.I. Agent Farrell interviewed him some four hours later after procuring a signed waiver of his rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant then proceeded to voluntarily and freely tell the agent all of the facts surrounding the theft and transportation of the car. The agent thus confirmed that appellant had committed a federal offense and immediately went to the office of the United States Commissioner to secure a time for the appearance of appellant before such officer. It was then about 5:00 p. m. on Saturday, the next day was Sunday, the day following was New Year\u2019s Day, so the appearance date was set for Tuesday, January 2. The evidence does not show that appellant was questioned at any time by anyone during the interval between Saturday and Tuesday. The Government also correctly points out the further fact that appellant was admittedly AWOL from the Marines and the statutes expressly authorize civil law enforcement officers, state and federal, to apprehend straying members of the Armed Forces and to detain them for delivery into the custody of the proper armed forces authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This certainly precludes any possibility that appellant was illegally held in custody during this interval, although the case eventually became a federal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> The co-defendant, Jenders, pri- or to the trial of appellant, entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced. He appeared as a witness for the Government in appellant\u2019s trial and testified, without objection, generally to the facts of the case and was cross-examined. Appellant now urges error in permitting Officer Moreno to testify to statements made by Jenders, in the presence of appellant, at the time the car was stopped on the highway and the arrests made. To support this argument, appellant relies on Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). This reliance is clearly misplaced. There is no similarity between the facts here and those presented in that case. Jenders\u2019 statements were all made in the presence of appellant at a time when the two co-defendants were actually perpetrating the crime for which they were later charged. In addition, all of Jenders\u2019 statements that are questioned now were a part of the res gestae. Wong Sun is not applicable to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Appellant\u2019s attack upon the sufficiency of the evidence is wholly without merit. By his own testimony at his trial he admitted sufficient facts to support all of the elements of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"A-e\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A2I\">. There was some conflict between the testimony of the officer and that of appellant but this conflict was resolved by the trial judge at the hearing upon defendant\u2019s motion to suppress in favor of the officer\u2019s testimony. Appellant testified in his own behalf at the trial and the jury apparently chose to resolve the conflict in the same manner,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-4\">. \u201c12-30-67 4:01\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201cBefore we ask you any questions, you must understand your rights.
