In his application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis the appellant had asserted that the sentence \u201cwas unduly severe and not supported by the history and background of the defendant and the charge.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-19\">The appellant had been arrested upon a complaint lodged April 3, 1967 charging Barnett with \u201ccarrying a deadly weapon after a previous conviction of Title 22 Section 3204 D.C.Code.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following his arrest, he filed a pro se motion for release pending trial setting forth that he had been \u201ccharged with the of-fence [sic] of A.D.W. after convection [sic].\u201d An indictment having been filed May 24, 1967, counsel was appointed and a plea of not guilty was entered. On November 17, 1967, the appellant entered his plea of guilty to the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-20\">That the appellant was fully aware of his predicament is beyond peradventure. The District Judge moreover queried the appellant in detail before accepting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>guilty plea. He thus ascertained that the appellant had entered his plea of guilty realizing that he was guilty, stated that he had received no promises or threats and informed the judge that he had fully discussed his plea with his counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-4\">The Court: Do you understand everything that he has told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-6\">Defendant Barnett: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-7\">The Court: Has he advised you of the possible sentence that could be imposed by the court because you enter this plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-8\">Defendant Barnett: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-9\">The Court: Have you had frequent contact with Mr. Lambeth, your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">Defendant Barnett: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-11\">The Court: Are you fully satisfied with Mr. Lambeth\u2019s services as an attorney representing you in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-12\">Defendant Barnett: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">The court thereupon accepted the appellant\u2019s guilty plea and continued the case for sentence at a later date with the judge further announcing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-15\">And at the time of sentencing, we will see what the situation is at that time, and what happens between now and that time will greatly influence the decision of the Court with respect to the imposition of sentence in this case. \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">The judge cautioned the accused with reference to the work release program concluding: \u201cDo not fail to report back to that jail when you<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are supposed to.\u201d The situation turned out unhappily. By January 19, 1968, it developed that the appellant had not reported back to the jail since January 1, 1968, and thereupon a bench warrant was issued. Following arrest on January 26, 1968, the appellant was before the trial judge for sentence. Appointed counsel again appearing pleaded earnestly in behalf of the accused. Counsel referred to the earlier record and sought to emphasize that \u201cThere is only one serious conviction, and that was of larceny which is 13 years ago.\u201d Then afforded allocution, the appellant expressed appreciation for what the court had done for him and that \u201cthe Court gave me a chance.\u201d The judge commented that counsel had consulted the judge no less than six times concerning Barnett. He stated that he had received \u201cmore letters from the District Jail about you than I have had about all the rest since I put you on work release.\u201d Even so, the judge continued, granting that Barnett had not been reporting to the jail on time, the judge had hoped to give the appellant \u201csome opportunity\u201d to see if he could not get straightened out in the community. Barnett hoped, he said, that \u201cthe Court would be as lenient as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-18\">So it was that the judge in pronouncing sentence had taken account of the guilty plea and the previous felony conviction and pronounced a sentence \u201cfor a period of not less than three nor more than ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-19\">We do not agree with the contention that the sentence was \u201cunduly severe\u201d or that it had not been \u201csupported by the history and background\u201d of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">We are left with the abiding conclusion, based on the record before us and after our study of the transcripts, that there had been no misguided or ill-informed decision on the part of the appellant to waive a trial and to enter his guilty plea. Neither from the appellant nor from his counsel was there a hint of surprise after sentence was pronounced. Despite Barnett\u2019s understandable disappointment after his extended colloquy with the judge, there was no later motion under Rule 32(d) to withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-21\">No basis has here been exhibited to predicate a conclusion that the trial judge as a matter of law had not complied<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. The record does not establish that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>had failed to determine that the plea had been made voluntarily, after proper advice, with an understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences <footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-11\">. The record discloses among various prior convictions, those of housebreaking in 1952, grand larceny in 1955 and receiving, stolen property in 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-12\">. That section provides for a sentence for not more than ten years in the event of a previous conviction either of \u00a7 3204 or of a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b973-13\">. The Government at that time had also lodged an information as to Barnett\u2019s 1955 conviction of grand larceny thus bringing this case squarely within the penalty provisions of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3204 (1967). <em>See </em>Kendrick v. United States, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 173, 238 F.2d 34 (1956). Had there been no previous felony conviction and no previous conviction of carrying a concealed weapon, the penalty could have been no greater than a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both as provided in D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3215 (1967). <em>Of. </em>Jackson v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 328, 221 F.2d 883 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b974-22\">. <em>Gf. </em>United States v. Martin, 389 F.2d 383 (4 Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b975-20\">. Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); Smith v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 404, 407, 324 F.2d 436, 439, rehearing <em>en </em>banc denied (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 978, 11 L.Ed.2d 975 (1964).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-22\">In view of the frequency with which the courts are confronted with post-conviction claims such as had been advanced in the instant case, sentencing judges may deem it desirable to get on the record an affirmative statement from an accused as to what he understands the possible sentence to be. Thus the \u201cconsequences\u201d requirement of Rule 11 may the more readily be met.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
