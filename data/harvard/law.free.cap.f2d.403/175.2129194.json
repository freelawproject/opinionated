Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 98-102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Congress has, by directing the Board to consider \u201cthe wishes of the persons residing or owning property in the neighborhood\u201d in issuing licenses, recognized that the operation of an establishment such as The Crazy Horse may trouble its neighbors. 25 D.C.Code \u00a7 115(a) (5) (1967). The appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that many of its members reside or own property within the neighborhood of The Crazy Horse. If so established, the required nexus would therefore be present for a suit by the neighbors. <em>Cf. </em>Wolpe v. Poretsky, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 141, 144 F.2d 505, cert. denied, 323 U.S. 777, 65 S.Ct. 190, 89 L.Ed. 621 (1944). Since the association is an authorized spokesman organized to promote these interests for its individual members, it too has standing to sue in order to protect their interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">. Specifically, the appellant claims that the Board acted illegally in reissuing the license by erroneously finding that the establishment was a bona fide restaurant under 25 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 103(n), 111(g) (1967), and that the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its consideration of the objections of persons residing or owning property in the neighborhood, thereby violating 25 D.C.Code 115(a) (5) (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">. <em>See </em>NAACP v.
