Appellant waived trial by jury. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced by the court, and has appealed. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-23\"> We have examined the record and are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient. We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in the rulings which it made regarding the time allowed appellant\u2019s counsel to examine statements produced under the Jencks Act. The court did not finally reject appellant\u2019s request for access to portions of the grand jury transcript; it offered to consider the request upon the condition that it be submitted in the form of a motion supported by an affidavit. The condition was reasonable ; appellant failed to comply with it. We doubt there was any error, and hold there was none affecting substantial rights, in the judge\u2019s efforts to expedite the trial, his control of cross-examination, and his rulings admitting and excluding evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-24\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
