The unit was activated on May 13, 1968. Anticipating this, in late April he wrote two letters to his Commanding Officer seeking exemption from active duty pursuant to Army Regulations because of extreme personal and community hardship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to \u201cextreme personal hardship,\u201d he submitted that his wife was suffering from a psychiatric disord\u00e9r, that his presence in the household materially aided her and tended to promote her recovery, and that his departure would have a serious and immediate deteriorating effect. Two psychiatrists and a psychologist attested the seriousness of her ailment; one of the psychiatrists and the psychologist confirmed the likelihood that Schonbrun\u2019s departure would have a harmful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>effect. Further confirmation was afforded by a letter from the Rabbi of the Schonbruns\u2019 synagogue and by a Lutheran pastor. The case for \u201cextreme community hardship\u201d was that Schonbrun had been teaching a class of 10 severely disturbed boys in a Special Service School located in a poverty area in Queens, with great success. His value there was attested by the Principal of the school, the Assistant Principal, and the Social Studies Chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">On May 6 Schonbrun was given a 30-day extension and was told to contact Fort Wadsworth for further instructions before this expired. While not officially notified, he learned that his application had been denied. He claims this was without assignment of reasons, although Army Regulations 601-25, 3-14, require that when the area commander denies the request, he must \u201cnotify the member of such denial and the reason therefor, together with his right to appeal such decision.\u201d Schonbrun appealed, submitting additional letters from the President of the Parents\u2019 Association of the School and the Chairman of the Permanent Coordinating Committee of the Permanent Coordinating Council of Jamaica, N. Y., and a further letter from his wife\u2019s psychiatrist. He was notified that the appeals board had denied this on the ground that \u201cthe case did not meet the criteria for exemption from involuntary call to active duty as established in AR 601-25.\u201d An application for reconsideration offering additional evidence and questioning the methods and procedure of the appeals board proved fruitless, and Schonbrun was ordered to report for active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">He then began this proceeding for habeas corpus in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Judge Weinstein denied the application. On the community aspect, he said that the weighing of hardship to the community in losing the reservist and of hardship to the United States in losing his service on active duty was \u201cpeculiarly the kind of decision that must be made by the military.\u201d On the personal aspect he thought this was \u201cnot a matter peculiar to this reservist\u201d since \u201cto a lesser or greater degree wives and families of those who are called into the Armed Services suffer great hardship.\u201d After granting a re-hearing to take further evidence, the nature of which does not appear, he adhered to his decision and dismissed the writ. This court granted a stay pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The jurisdiction of the district court to grant a writ of habeas corpus is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, which makes the writ available only when a petitioner is \u201cin custody.\u201d The statute \u201cdoes not attempt to mark the boundaries of. \u2018custody,\u2019 \u201d and courts have long recognized that \u201cbesides physical imprisonment, there are other restraints on a man\u2019s liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally, which have been thought sufficient * * * to support the issuance of habeas corpus.\u201d Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 238-240, 83 S.Ct. 373, 375-376, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963); see also Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968). Decisions make clear that Schonbrun\u2019s status as a member of the armed forces imposes such a restraint on his liberty. Jones v. Cunningham, supra, 371 U.S. at 240, 83 S. Ct. 373; U. S. ex rel. Altieri v. Flint, 54 F.Supp. 889 (D.Conn.1943), aff\u2019d on opinion below, 142 F.2d 62 (2 Cir. 1944); Hammond v. Lenfest, 398 F.2d 705, 710-712 (2 Cir. 1968); see R. Sokol, A Handbook of Federal Habeas Corpus \u00a7 5.3 (1965). An inquiry into the legality of this restraint would be within the traditional function of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Schonbrun does not seek, however, to be discharged from membership in the armed forces. He has enlisted voluntarily in the Army and concedes its continued jurisdiction over him; he challenges only the order requiring him to report' for active duty. He differs in this respect from one who seeks to be discharged entirely from the military, as in Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Hammond v. Lenfest, supra, or who challenges the validity of imprisonment under court-martial proceedings, cf. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953). Generally habeas corpus is available only to a petitioner who is entitled to release from unlawful restraint, and is not a means of testing the conditions of admittedly lawful custody. Application of Hodge, 262 F.2d 778 (9 Cir. 1958); Harris v. Settle, 322 F.2d 908 (8 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 1171, 12 L.Ed.2d 179 (1964); U. S. ex rel. Knight v. Ragen, 337 F.2d 426 (7 Cir. 1944). On the other hand, habeas corpus will lie to test the legality of a change from probation or parole to imprisonment. Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (1941); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967) [state habeas]; Arketa v. Wilson, 373 F.2d 582, 584 (9 Cir. 1967). Arguably a transfer from reserve status to active duty is attracted by the analogy of this latter line of eases rather than the former, although a change in duty assignments of a soldier or sailor in active service would not be. Yet to hold that habeas lies in such a case would require a rather close distinction of the decisions that it is not available to a selective service registrant before induction. See De-Rozario v. Commanding Officer, 390 F.2d 532, 535-536 (9 Cir. 1968), and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"> Whether or not habeas corpus is available, the district court was free to treat the petition as one for mandamus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, which vests the district court with \u201coriginal jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d Sehonbrun makes no claim that the Army has not acted \u201cwithin its jurisdiction under valid law,\u201d see Winters v. United States, 281 F.Supp. 289, 299 (E.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 390 F.2d 879 (2 Cir. 1968); Fox v. Brown, 402 F.2d 837 (2 Cir. 1968) (Lumbard, C. J., concurring); his complaint is of an abuse of discretion in denying his request for an exemption. The committee reports recommending enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 made clear that the courts were \u201cnot to direct or influence the exercise of discretion of the officer or agency in the making of the decision,\u201d see 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News, 87th Cong. 2d Sess., pp. 2784, 2785 (1962), and the statute has been so construed, Smith v. United States, 333 F.2d 70 (10 Cir. 1964). We recognize that, despite this, official conduct may have gone so far beyond any rational exercise of discretion as to call for mandamus even when the action is within the letter of the authority granted. See Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 181-82 (1965); Byse &amp; Fiocca, Section 1361 of the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 and \u201cNonstatutory\u201d Judicial Review of Federal Administrative Action, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 308, 333-35 (1967). But the necessity for expedition in the military\u2019s administration of personnel admittedly subject to its jurisdiction raises a serious question whether the courts should apply this principle with respect to a call-up order, and if that be the correct result in mandamus, the result should not be different even if habeas or an injunction are also available remedies. Contrast Wong Wing Hang v. I. N. S., 360 F.2d 715, 717-18 (2 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The very purpose of a \u201cready reserve\u201d is that the reserve shall be ready. Under the regulations, delay or exemption from active duty in hardship cases is authorized but not required. The hardship must be \u201cextreme,\u201d and while the regulations wisely give more specific content to this criterion, a good deal is necessarily left to the judgment of the commanding officer. In contrast to the yea or nay character of entitlement to the conscientious objection exemption, administration of the hardship exemption necessarily involves a balancing of the individual\u2019s claims against the nation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>needs, and the balance may differ from time to time and from place to place in a manner beyond the competence of a court to decide. While no one could reasonably assert that the country would perish if Schonbrun did not serve with his company, delay in the call-up of a reservist, even during the period necessary for judicial consideration of his claim to discretionary exemption, inevitably means either a gap in the unit or the call of another reservist who otherwise might not have been reached. Although Schonbrun\u2019s case is appealing, especially his personal hardship claim which was scarcely disposed of by the comment of the district judge, the courts must have regard to the flood of unmeritorious applications that might be loosed by such interference with the military\u2019s exercise of discretion and the effect of the delays caused by these in the efficient administration of personnel who have voluntarily become part of the armed forces. We conclude that this is a subject on which civil review of discretionary action by the military should be declined\u2014 and this irrespective of the rubric under which the action is brought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the Army\u2019s alleged violation of its own regulations, in failing to give notice of denial of his initial request and the reasons for it, might stand differently, Schonbrun was not prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\">.

The <em>extent to </em>which the Administrative Procedure Act applies to actions of the military is far from clear. Section 4, which governs rulemaking, excludes \u201cany military, naval or foreign affairs function of the United States,\u201d and \u00a7 5, which deals with adjudication, exempts \u201cthe conduct of military, naval or foreign affairs functions.\u201d However, the breadth of the definition of \u201cagency\u201d in \u00a7 2(a) indicates that the \u201cagency action\u201d of which \u00a7 10 speaks embraces far more than adjudication and rulemaking. \u201cAgency\u201d appears to include the military, except \u201ccourts martial and military commissions,\u201d \u201cmilitary or naval authority exercised in the field in time of war or in occupied territory,\u201d and the Selective Service System. Thus, the call up of reservists would seem <em>to </em>be subject to the provision of \u00a7 10 that, except so far as \u201cstatutes preclude judicial review\u201d or \u201cagency action is by law committed to agency discretion,\u201d judicial review shall be afforded to \u201cany person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute.\u201d Our holding here that the cor-\"*] reetness of a discretionary refusal to j grant the hardship exemption is not sub- . ject to review by the courts necessarily represents a determination that such a re- . fusal \u201cis by law committed to agency discretion\u201d so far as to render inapplica- j ble the provisions of \u00a7 10(e).
