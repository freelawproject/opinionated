The action was brought under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, and the maritime law by the plaintiff against his alleged employers for injuries suffered while employed as a leverman on the dredge \u201cAlameda\u201d, then operating in the waters of Osaka Bay, Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-26\">The District Court found and this court agrees that the trial record conclusively established that neither defendant was the plaintiff\u2019s employer. The evidence, including the employment contract, required the conclusion that the defendants were not in control of the \u201cAlameda\u201d at the time of the accident and that a different company was the plaintiff\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-27\">The facts in the present case do not leave room for a contrary conclusion as was the case in Trent v. Atlantic City Electric Co., 3d Cir. 1964, 334 F.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-28\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
