He was paroled in April, 1966, by the Florida Probation and Parole Commission. While on parole he was indicted and tried for another alleged rape, occurring February 1, 1967. He was acquitted by the jury at a trial for this offense, concluded April 7, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-22\">A parole violator\u2019s warrant was issued for him on February 2, 1967, with hearing thereon held June 19, 1967, after the conclusion of the rape trial. His parole was revoked as a result of that hearing, not for the rape offense, but for the alleged assault and beating of one Byron Lucia, the boyfriend of the alleged rape victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This assault, if it occurred at all, occurred as a part of the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-23\">We have considered the claims advanced to the district court and to this Court by the appellant including double jeopardy, violation of the appellant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination by the questioning of him by his parole officer at the time of arrest, and the denial of a due process hearing before the Florida Probation and Parole Commission. In this connection we have carefully studied the record before the district court. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>prejudicial error is made to appear as to any of the contentions raised. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-13\">.
