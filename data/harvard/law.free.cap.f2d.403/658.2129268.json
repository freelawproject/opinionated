The judgment of the District Court vacated a contrary holding by the Bankruptcy Referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-28\">On January 23, 1967, Johnston &amp; Murphy Shoes, Inc., delivered a shipment of shoes to Mel Golde Shoes, Inc., at Louisville, Kentucky. The following day appellees, Meinhard Commercial Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tion and William Iselin &amp; Company, levied attachments against the entire inventory of Golde. On February 2, Golde filed a petition in the United States District Court seeking relief under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. The petition\u2019s averment that Golde was \u201cunable to pay its unsecured debts as they mature\u201d disclosed Golde\u2019s insolvency within the meaning of Kentucky\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Referee so found. On February 1, 1967, the day before the Chapter XI petition was filed, Johnston &amp; Murphy, exercising the right given by above K.R.S. \u00a7 355.2-702(2), made timely demand for the return of the shoes. This was followed by a reclamation petition in the bankruptcy court. The referee held that Johnston &amp; Murphy's right of reclamation was superior to any lien rights of the attaching creditors. He was of the view, however, that the Chapter XI proceeding would be unworkable if the shoes were returned and granted appellant the status of a secured creditor in lieu of return of the shoes. The propriety of this procedure is not challenged if Johnston &amp; Murphy\u2019s reclamation right is superior to any rights of the attaching creditors. In the District Court, the referee\u2019s order was overruled in an Opinion and Order which concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cIt is Therefore Ordered that the Referee\u2019s order dated April 7, 1967, is hereby overruled and that Johnston <em>&amp; </em>Murphy Shoes, Inc., having failed to establish its statutory right to reclamation before certain other creditors became lien creditors, is to be treated as a creditor with an unperfected security interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Under K.R.S. \u00a7 355.2-702(2), supra, Johnston &amp; Murphy had the right to reclaim the shoes shipped to the insolvent Mel Golde unless such right is taken away by subparagraph (3) of \u00a7 355.2-702, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">\u201c(3) The seller\u2019s right to reclaim under subsection (2) is subject to the <em>rights </em>of a buyer in ordinary course or other good faith purchaser <em>or lien creditor under this article </em>(KRS 355.2-403). * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">It is, and was, the contention of the appellee creditors that they became \u201clien creditors\u201d by virtue of their attachments, pursuant to K.R.S. \u00a7 355.9-301 (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We must, accordingly, look to K.R.S. \u00a7 355.2-403 for delineation of the \u201crights\u201d of lien creditors. The caption of K.R.S. \u00a7 355.2-403 advises that it deals with \u201cPower to transfer; good faith purchase of goods; \u2018entrusting\u2019 \u201d and provides no help to a solution of the problem here, but concludes in its final subsection (4) that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-14\">\u201c(4) the rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the Articles on Secured Transactions (Article 9), Bulk Transfers (Article 6) and Documents of Title (Article 7).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">Inasmuch as Bulk Transfers and Documents of Title have no relevance here, we move on to Article 9, which in its first section, K.R.S. \u00a7 355.9-101, states, \u201cThis article shall be known and may be cited as Uniform Commercial <em>Code </em>\u2014 Secured <em>Transactions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) The District Judge and the appellee creditors assume that the section of Article 9 that has relevance here is in its Part 3 which bears the catchline \u201cRights of Third Parties; Perfected and Unperfected Security Interest; Rules of Priority.\u201d They rely specifically on K.R.S. \u00a7 355.9-301 entitled, \u201cPersons who take priority over <em>uwperfected security interests; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u2018lien creditor\u2019 \u201d and providing, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), an unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201c(b) a person who becomes a lien creditor without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Basically, appellees\u2019 position, upheld by the District Judge, is that Johnston &amp; Murphy\u2019s status is \u201cto be treated as a creditor with an <em>unperfected </em>security interest.\u201d We do not read the quoted section of the statute as defining or throwing any light upon the \u201crights\u201d of a \u201clien creditor\u201d vis-a-vis the right of reclamation of a defrauded seller under \u00a7 355.2-702(2). This latter right is not a \u201csecurity interest\u201d in the goods sold and Johnston &amp; Murphy are not attempting to assert a \u201csecurity interest\u201d to support their position. Thus, at the end of this circuitous statutory journey, we arrive at the conclusion that Kentucky\u2019s Commercial Code does not contain any provision defining the relative priorities of a creditor as against a reclaiming seller. Such being the situation, we must turn to relevant common law of Kentucky for the needed answer. The Commercial Code in K.R.S. \u00a7 355.1-103 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apg\">\u201c355.1-103 <em>Supplementary general principles of law applicable. </em>Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this chapter, the principles of law and equity * <em>* </em>* shall supplement its provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">We consider that the early decision of Lane &amp; 'Bartlett v. Robinson, 57 Ky.Rep. 496 (1857) announced Kentucky\u2019s agreement with the general rule that a defrauded seller\u2019s right to reclaim his goods is superior to any right of attaching creditors. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201cAnd no reason exists why, as between attaching creditors and vendors asserting an enforceable equity growing out of the contract of sale, the latter should not be preferred. It would certainly be unjust to subject to the payment of the debts of their fraudulent vendee, goods he had improperly obtained from them, and which, in equity, they were entitled to reclaim. This would virtually secure to such vendee the fruits of his fraud by the payment of his debts to the extent of the value of the goods, and defeat the equity of the vendor and the object of the statute.\u201d 57 Ky.Rep. at 502-503.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">We consider that the rights of the unpaid seller \u2014 given by \u00a7 355.2-702(2)- \u2014 were tantamount to those available to a defrauded seller. In the Official Comment to the Code, its draftsmen say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">\u201c2. Subsection (2) takes as its base line the proposition that any receipt of goods on credit by an insolvent buyer amounts to <em>a tacit business misrepresentation of solvency and therefore is fraudulent as against </em>the particular seller.\u201d Uniform Commercial Code, 1962 Official Text with Comments, p. 190. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">In In re Monson, 127 F.Supp. 625, 626 (W.D.Ky.1955), Chief Judge Roy Shelbourne recognized and enforced Kentucky law which gives priority to a defrauded seller\u2019s right of reclamation over the liens of a trustee in bankruptcy. This view received support in Volume 79 of the Harvard Law Review at p. 610:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-13\">\u201cThe lack of substantive direction in the Code as to the power of a lien creditor suggests that prior state law may still be followed. * * * Where, as in the majority of jurisdictions, preCode law allows the defrauded seller to defeat the claim of a levying creditor, * * * the seller will prevail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">The case of In re Kravitz, 278 F.2d 820 (3rd Cir. 1960) has been cited by both the appellant and the appellees in support of their respective positions, but we consider that if it has any relevance here it supports the position we take. The question there involved was whether a seller\u2019s right of reclamation granted by \u00a7 2-701 of the Uniform Commercial Code could be enforced against the lien of a trustee in bankruptcy. The Third Circuit held that it could not because <em>under </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number><em>Pennsylvania law </em>the rights of a trustee in bankruptcy as a \u201clien creditor\u201d were superior to a defrauded seller. The Court there recognized that the Code Sections did not contain the needed rule. It said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cIt is perfectly clear that, while Section 70, sub. c of the Bankruptcy Act makes the trustee an ideal lien creditor, what such a lien creditor gets is determined by the law of the state involved, here Pennsylvania.\u201d 278 F.2d at 822.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APZ\">Conversely, looking to Kentucky law, we hold that the appellant Johnston &amp; Murphy\u2019s right to reclaim the goods sold to the debtor took priority over appellees\u2019 attachment liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed with direction that further proceedings be had in conformity with the order of the Referee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-15\">. \u201cK.R.S. 355.2-702 <em>Seller\u2019s remedies on discovery of buyer\u2019s insolvency.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-16\">\u201c(2) Where the seller discovers that the buyer has received goods on credit while insolvent he may reclaim the goods upon demand made within ten days after the receipt * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">. \u201cK.R.S. \u00a7 355.1-201(23):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">A person is \u2018insolvent\u2019 who either lias ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business or cannot pay his debts as they become due or is insolvent within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-16\">. \u201cK.R.S. \u00a7 355.9-301.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-17\">(3) A \u2018lien creditor\u2019 means a creditor who lias acquired a lien on the property involved by attachment, levy or the like * ifc J*</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
