The order was entered to remedy alleged violations of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act and the discharge of four employees found by the Board to be in violation of Section 8(a) (3). Except for the order that employee Robert W. Moore be reinstated with backpay, we enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">The Board found that appellant violated Section 8(a) (1) by interrogating and threatening employees about their union activities. It further found that a retroactive wage increase was made to forestall union organization, in violation of the same section. Employees Robert Evans, Floyd Langston, Claude Hebert, and Robert W. Moore were found to have been discharged discriminatorily because of their union activities in violation of Section 8(a) (3). The company was ordered to cease and desist from unfair labor practices, to reinstate the four employees, and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">In December, 1965, Reading &amp; Bates assembled a complex and costly all-weather floating platform in Cook Inlet, near Anchorage, Alaska, and began oil drilling operations. Donald R. Stewart was superintendent of the platform involved (Platform B); and tool pushers Charles Coleman and William J. L\u2019Hirondelle were Stewart\u2019s assistants. The rig was manned largely by workers from the Louisiana off-shore oil rigs. Experienced crews were difficult to find and keep due to severe weather and working conditions. Workers were not replaced easily; and a resignation usually caused an increase in other workers\u2019 duties until a replacement was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-18\">In late December, 1965, or early January, 1966, six union-affiliated roustabouts were hired to assist the Reading &amp; Bates crew on Platform B. The union men received higher pay than company men for comparable work, which, caused dissatisfaction among company employees. Almost simultaneously, organizational efforts began. The remaining facts of the alleged violations, and the inferences to be drawn from them, have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>been in dispute. The Trial Examiner\u2019s findings, which the Board adopted substantially intact, resolved almost all of the factual issues against the employer, Our only inquiry is whether the Board's findings are founded on \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d, considering the record as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 1950, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"AMt\">_ .. . . ,.. .... <em>Section 8(a) (1) violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">The record, viewed as a whole, contains evidence which substantiates the findings of 8(a) (1) violations. It is undisputed that the company instituted a 10% wage increase for company employees on January 26, retroactive to January 23. Substantial evidence supports the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding that, prior to the increase, company management knew about organizational efforts and employee dissatisfaction with wages; that interrogation occurred and threats were made by company supervisors; and that tool pusher Coleman remarked after the increase \u201c[wjhat do you think about the union now?</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">Giving employees a raise is not an 8(a) (1) violation unless it is done to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights of self-organization. An employer\u2019s interrogation of employees likewise is not a violation of Section 8(a) (1), <em>per se. </em>When interrogation is accompanied by implied or express threats of reprisal, or an atmosphere of hostility toward organization, and a wage increase is instituted to discourage organization, the Board may conclude as it did here that the employer intended to interfere with employees self-organization through in-e\u2122ftlon\u2019 threats and the wage in\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">\n<em>Section 8(a) (8) violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">Section 8(a) (3) of the Act makes it an unfair labor practice to discriminate in regard to tenure of employment to discourage membership in a labor organization. An employee\u2019s discharge is violative of 8(a) (3) when both discrimination and an intent to discourage union membership are shown, NLRB v. Brown, 1965, 380 U.S. 278, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839; American Shipbuilding Co. v. NLRB, 1965, 380 U.S. 300, 85 S.Ct. 955, 13 L.Ed.2d 855; NLRB v. Neuhoff Bros. Packers, Inc., 5 Cir. 1968, 398 F.2d 640. The employer\u2019s right to discharge an employee for \u201ccause\u201d is in no way impaired. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c). Cause, however, may not be used to camouflage a discriminatory discharge designed to discourage union membership. If the employee\u2019s misdeeds are so flagrant that he would almost certainly have been fired regardless of anti-union animus, then there is no \u201cdiscrimination\u201d within the mean-ing of 8(a) (3). The Board may look to the employer\u2019s intent, or the dominant motive behind discharge to determine whether discrimination has occurred, NLRB v. O. A. Fuller Super Markets, Inc., 5 Cir. 1967, 374 F.2d 197, 200. No 8(a) (3) violation occurs however, unless the employer acts discriminatorily with intent to discourage union membership, and such improper motive is a cause without which the employee would not be discharged. NLRB v. Neuhoff, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">Reading &amp; Bateg contends that all foUr discharges were for \u201ccause\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (c); but the Board found that the employees were discharged in violation of 8(a) (3). Substantial evidence underlies the Board\u2019s ruling, except as to Robert W. Moore. Robert E. Evans, Floyd Langston, and Claude_ Hebert were discharged with some justifieation; but, viewed as a whole, we cannot say that the record clearly precludes the Board\u2019s decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, supra,</p>\n<p id=\"A45\"> The Trial Examiner\u2019s findings and conclusions, and proposed Order which the Board adopted, fail to specifically find or conclude that the discharges were (1) discriminatory and &lt;2&gt; \u201ctended to discourage union membership. Instead, the discharges were found to have stemmed from anti-union animus, resulting, <em>ipso facto, </em>in 8(a) (3) violations. Nevertheless, we con-elude from our study of the record that evidence supports the inferences the Board must have drawn to find 8(a) (3) violations in the cases of Evans, Lang-ston and Claude Hebert. However, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>is insufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that Robert W. Moore\u2019s discharge was discriminatory; so enforcement of that portion of the Board\u2019s order must be denied. \u201cDiscrimination consists in treating like cases differently.\u201d Frosty Morn Meats, Inc. v. NLRB, 5 Cir. 1961, 296 F.2d 617, 621. Moore was discharged for sleeping on the job, an offense which under company policy called for \u201cautomatic\u201d termination. This rule was enforced with an even hand, evidenced by the fact that tool pusher L\u2019Hirondelle\u2019s brother had been caught sleeping on the job on a prior occasion and had been discharged forthwith. Moore\u2019s misdeed was of such a nature that he would certainly have been fired regardless of company anti-union animus. Discrimination plays no part in such a discharge; thus there is no violation of 8(a) (3). NLRB v. O. A. Fuller Super Markets, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The company has maintained throughout that maritime standards govern its employee relations on the floating platform. The validity and application of that contention may be pretermitted in this case. If appellant\u2019s contention is correct, then at best it would give the company greater license to discharge an employee for \u201ccause\u201d. Our decision in this ease would not be any different even if appellant\u2019s position were adopted. Accordingly, the order on review will be enforced except as it relates to Robert W. Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Enforced in part, enforcement denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b66-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
