The instruction given on guilty knowledge was as good as the one submitted by the defendant, and it was adequate. The trial judge was a little impatient at one point, but the jury was adequately instructed on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-22\">Other objections here were not properly made or preserved in the trial court, but we find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-23\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
