A lumbar myelogram was performed and was interpreted as being within normal limits. Claimant\u2019s neurosurgeon nevertheless had the impression that claimant has a herniated intervertebral disc and advised surgical intervention. Claimant was reluctant to accept his advice for fear that the operation might not be successful. His surgeon was of the opinion that without surgery claimant would be permanently unable to return to his <em>usual </em>work.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">The Secretary\u2019s neurosurgeon had x-rays taken. They did not disclose a ruptured disc and confirmed his diagnosis that claimant\u2019s back was entirely normal and adequate. There was no proof that claimant\u2019s fear of surgery was based on reasonable grounds, but the Secretary\u2019s neurosurgeon stated that it was understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">The Hearing Examiner made no finding that claimant had a ruptured disc. He found only that claimant had a back problem of sufficient impairment to preclude his engaging in his usual employment as a coal miner; that he was able to engage in \u201clight, simple sedentary employment\u201d; and that such employment was available in the general area of claimant\u2019s residence. Massey v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 146 (6th Cir. 1965). The Hearing Examiner further found that claimant\u2019s alleged condition of ruptured disc was remediable and that he had no reasonable basis for not submitting to the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">The findings of the Hearing Examiner were adopted by the Appeals Council and were affirmed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-19\">In our opinion, there was substantial evidence to support these findings of fact and they are binding on us. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
