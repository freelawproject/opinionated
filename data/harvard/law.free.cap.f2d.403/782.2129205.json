His case has been before this Court many times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The present appeal is from the district court\u2019s denial of Bearden\u2019s second motion to vacate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contentions on appeal are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>stated in the brief of Bearden\u2019s appointed counsel, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-4\">\u201cWhen eye witnesses to the alleged crime were permitted, over objections, to deliberate as and with jurors in the secrecy of the jury room, Bearden was denied his constitutional rights to (a) trial by jury; (b) trial by fair and impartial jury; (c) public trial; (d) confront the witnesses; (e) due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">\u201cBearden was denied \u2018substantive rights\u2019 at his trial and [it] constituted plain error when the jury was improperly permitted to view petitioner\u2019s co-defendant pleading guilty at the beginning of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The facts alleged in the motion in support of the first contention are the same as those which formed the basis of Bearden\u2019s motion for change of venue, the denial of which was affirmed by this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court also ruled against Bearden on direct appeal as to the second contention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Bearden\u2019s present section 2255 motion is not barred by res judicata for that doctrine is not applicable to habeas corpus petitions or to section 2255 motions. Heflin v. United States, 1959, 358 U.S. 415, 420, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed. 2d 407; Salinger v. Loisel, 1924, 265 U.S. 224, 230, 44 S.Ct. 519, 68 L.Ed. 989; Birehfield v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 296 F.2d 120, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">That is not to say, however, that every defendant who has been unsuccessful on appeal can compel a re-trial of the same issues in a collateral proceeding, since the courts in post-conviction relief applications may exercise a sound judicial discretion to decline to re-try issues fully and finally litigated in the proceedings leading to judgment of conviction and direct appeal therefrom. Del Genio v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 304 (per curiam); compare Porter v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 298 F.2d 461, 464.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">Applying the above approach, we conclude that the \u201cprejudicial publicity\u201d issue was adequately neutralized by the trial judge\u2019s instructions to and interrogation of the veniremen before the jury selection process was initiated. This same point was fully and finally litigated on direct appeal from denial of the motion for change of venue and was decided adversely to Bearden. While appellant\u2019s counsel has argued that a substantially different case law standard has subsequently evolved<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> compelling this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>to reconsider Bearden\u2019s contentions, we find each of the later cases relied on to be distinguishable. The prejudicial publicity which made the trial unfair in those cases occurred immediately before and during the trial and involved editorial comment urging conviction to assuage public outrage. Under some circumstances, observation of an event,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> whether on-the-seene or via live television coverage, might not impair the judgment of a prospective juror to the extent that the test of Irvin v. Dowd, 1961, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751, cannot insure selection of a fair and impartial jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has heretofore rejected the theory that <em>any </em>exposure of a juror to information acquired outside the courtroom would make that juror per se partial. United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, 1956, 351 U.S. 454, 462, 76 S.Ct. 965, 100 L.Ed. 1331. The rationale is premised upon simple practicality. Reynolds v. United States, 1878, 98 U.S. 145, 155-156, 25 L.Ed. 244, and the burden is on Bearden to show that essential unfairness occurred not as a matter of speculation, but as a demonstrable reality. Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 1942, 317 U.S. 269, 281, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268. We, therefore, adhere to our earlier decision on this issue. Del Genio v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">A re-examination of some of the facts will indicate why we are more concerned with the jury\u2019s observation of the son\u2019s guilty plea and the judge\u2019s comment in his jury charge recapitulating the plea circumstances without any cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Leon Bearden and his son, Cody, were jointly indicted. They appeared for arraignment together and were individually identified to the veniremen by the court. During a recess for lunch after empaneling the jury, the government agreed to dismiss the original indictment as to the son if he would plead guilty to \u201cjuvenile delinquency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">With the jury in the box, father and son were arraigned together. Cody Bearden was instructed on his option to be charged either as a juvenile or as an adult felon, and he expressed his preference for the former. He was then read a newly drafted charge which, but for the preface invoking the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was substantially identical to the original joint indictment. He stated that he understood the charge and then plead guilty, admitting participation in the kidnapping, interstate transportation of a stolen airplane, and obstruction of commerce. The government was then granted a dismissal of the original indictment as to the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Immediately thereafter, Leon Bearden was arraigned; he was read the original indictment, and he plead \u201cnot guilty.\u201d The jury then heard his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">At the conclusion of the arguments to the jury, the court charged the jury, including therein a reference to the son\u2019s earlier guilty plea,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and gave no cautionary instruction to disregard the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In considering this issue on direct appeal, this Court acknowledged the continued vitality of its rule enunciated in Scarborough v. United States, 5 Cir. 1956, 232 F.2d 412, and Babb v. United States, 5 Cir. 1955, 218 F.2d 538.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the <em>Scarborough-Babb </em>rule, we held the jury\u2019s observation of the son\u2019s guilty plea and the failure of the court to give cautionary instructions in the charge were \u201charmless\u201d error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We observed that the failure of the trial court to give a cautionary charge to the jury to disregard the observed plea <em>might have </em>constituted \u201cplain error\u201d cognizable under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), but for the facts that the defendant made no motion thereon or objected thereto, we had already reversed the life sentence, and the evidence of Bearden\u2019s guilt was <em>\u201coverwhelming.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That opinion reflected no consideration of the judicial comment on Cody Bearden\u2019s plea, although it had been, <em>inter alia, </em>the basis for dissent in the earlier decision vacated for want of equal oral argument opportunity. See Bearden v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 532, 539 (dissent), rehearing denied, 307 F.2d 506, vacated and remanded, 372 U.S. 252, 83 S.Ct. 875, 9 L.Ed.2d 732 (1963). Certainly, the observation together with the judicial comment thereon, reinforces the possibility of the applicability of the \u201cplain error\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">While this Court has many times refused to permit error to be raised for the first time on appeal,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it has also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>consistently emphasized a willingness to carefully scrutinize the record for plain errors affecting substantial rights which are noticeable under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52 (b), notwithstanding lack of objection. See e. g., Rivers v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 400 F.2d 935; Alexander v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 101, 103 n. 3. Moreover Fed.R.Crim. P. 30, precluding assignment of error as to any portion of a jury charge not objected to before the jury retires, will not bar invocation of Rule 52(b) where instructions have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Braswell v. United States, 5 Cir. 1952, 200 F.2d 597. See Herzog v. United States, 9 Cir. 1956, 235 F.2d 664, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 844, 77 S.Ct. 54, 1 L.Ed.2d 59. See also 8 Moore\u2019s, Federal Practice, 2d ed. 1968, jj 52.03 [2] p. 52-9. Nevertheless, the advice of Mr. Justice Frankfurter should be considered before disregarding Rule 30 in favor of a sua sponte invocation of Rule 52(b) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-4\">\u201cIn reviewing criminal cases it is particularly important for appellate courts to re-live the whole trial imaginatively and not to extract from episodes in isolation abstract questions of evidence and procedure. To turn a criminal appeal into a quest for error no more promotes the ends of justice than to acquiesce in low standards of criminal prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Johnson v. United States, 1943, 318 U.S. 189, 202, 63 S.Ct. 549, 555, 87 L.Ed. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">On direct appeal, this Court concluded that the jury\u2019s observation of Cody Bearden\u2019s plea was not proscribed by the <em>Scarborough-Babb </em>rule, 320 F.2d at 103. We agree. Moreover, the inclusion in the charge of the comment on the joint indictment and the son\u2019s plea was no more than a chronological narrative, unfortunate perhaps,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but the language used in this instance was devoid of prejudicial intent or impact. Compare Trussell v. United States, 6 Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 478, 480; United States v. Toner, 3 Cir. 1949, 173 F.2d 140. See United States v. Wilcher, 7 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 117, 120-121; 4 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice, Wright ed., \u00a7 2583, pp. 498-499. Certainly, it fails to rise to the level of judicial unfairness condemned in Quercia v. United States, 1933, 289 U.S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321; nor does the comment amount to even an expression of opinion as to guilt of the accused. Cf. Kyle v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">We earlier concluded that Bearden\u2019s guilt was established by the \u201coverwhelming\u201d weight of the evidence. 320 F.2d at 104. The \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d standard has recently been condemned when constitutionally protected rights are at issue. Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But evidence of guilt in this case was so clear and undisputed that we conclude the jury\u2019s observation of the son\u2019s plea and the unnecessary comment thereon in the charge were \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. State of California, supra, 386 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>23-24, 87 S.Ct. 824; see Fahy v. State of Connecticut, 1963, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"AzX\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-23\">. Sec Bearden v.
