BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A3f\">Appellant Spencer seeks review of an order of the Federal District Court denying his petition for habeas corpus. In 1960 Spencer was convicted in a Florida State Court of first degree murder and sentenced to die in the electric chair. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed his conviction. Spencer v. State, Fla., 1961, 133 So.2d 729. Appellant raises a massive assault founded on his claim that he was denied counsel during prolonged interrogation which resulted in a confession, the confession was not voluntary, and that his court-appointed counsel in the State Court rendered ineffective assistance, thus denying his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Because we find that Spencer has failed to exhaust his available State remedies, we vacate the judgment of the Federal District Court without prejudice to Spencer to apply for relief in the Florida State Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Under the umbrella of Spencer\u2019s broad assertion that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, he raises many specific and serious claims, some of which depend on an authoritative pronouncement of Florida law, and none of which have been presented to the Florida Courts either on appeal or by habeas corpus. Among the issues raised are these. (1) The confession introduced at Spencer\u2019s State Court Trial was involuntary and was extracted from him during a prolonged period of interrogation under coercive circumstances without benefit of counsel. (2) He should have been granted a change of venue due to massive pretrial publicity (even at this late date the parties differ in their interpretation of the Florida venue statutes). (3) The inadequacy of the voir dire examination of the prospective jurors. (4) The illegality of a post-arrest search and seizure made without a warrant and the admission of evidence seized in that search. (5) The status of Mary Hampton (who Spencer claims is his common law wife) and her competency to testify against him. (6) The introduction of prejudicial evidence of other crimes. And (7) the failure of defense counsel to request any jury instructions. Spencer has failed to raise these contentions either on appeal to the Florida Supreme Court or by a motion under Florida\u2019s post-conviction procedure rule. Thus he has not exhausted an available state post-conviction remedy as required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">On April 1, 1963, Fla.R.Crim. P. 1 (now Rule 1.850, 33 F.S.A.) became effective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This rule is patterned after its Federal counterpart 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. This post-conviction remedy which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>was available to Spencer before he filed his writ of habeas corpus in Federal Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides sweeping relief from any sentence imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of the State of Florida, or any sentence otherwise subject to collateral attack. A prisoner is entitled to apply to the sentencing court for relief <em>at any time. </em>The sentencing court has broad powers to vacate the sentence, discharge the prisoner, resentence the prisoner, grant a new trial, or correct the sentence in any appropriate way. There is no doubt that Florida has provided an effective, efficient post-conviction remedy which will afford Spencer a full review of his claimed errors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">In the interest of comity we must as to all of the issues now asserted, put the fact finding and law finding responsibility squarely on the Florida Courts where, initially at least, it belongs. We do not intimate even a possible whisper of a hint of a suggestion as to how these contentions will be resolved. However, in the setting of this case, they are extremely serious and warrant appropriate judicial inquiry and determination. The remedy prescribed and open-mindedly administered by the Florida Courts will afford Spencer an opportunity to present his contentions adequately and fully develop them in evidentiary hearings as required. This gives full effectiveness to our current practices for Florida,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>well as for Texas,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Georgia,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Louisiana,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Mississippi.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"> The judgment of the Federal District Court denying the writ is therefore vacated<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to provide Spencer with an opportunity to apply to the Florida Courts for relief. After having exhausted his State remedies, if Spencer is dissatisfied, he \u201ccan [then] return to the Federal Court for its inescapably independent judgment on federal issues.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Acf\">Vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\">.

Fla.R.Crim.P. 1.850 became effective April 1, 1963. Spencer filed his writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court on April 2, 1963. The result would be the same even if the dates were reversed. We do not send Spencer back to the Florida Courts on the mere technicality that Florida\u2019s post-conviction remedy became effective on the day <em>before </em>Spencer filed his writ in Federal Court. As we said in Peters v. Rutledge, 5 Cir., 1968, 397 F.2d 731, 736, \u2018\u2018[W]e have made it clear that we ought to effectuate the policies underlying such statutes [post-conviction remedies] by making immediate use of them even in older cases now requiring an evidentiary hearing, not jiostponing application of the new procedure to cases arising in the state court after enactment of the post-conviction remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZyH\">The result is likewise the same even if Spencer\u2019s first contention, concerning the introduction of an involuntary confession, had been presented to the Florida Supreme Court on appeal sinee a factual hearing is now needed. \u201c[I]n the interest of comity we require that constitutional challenges to state convictions should first be presented to the state courts. * * * [E]ven though the issue has been presented to the state courts so that it is technically ripe for Federal habeas, if an evidentiary hearing is required then that hearing should be had ordinarily in those state courts where a fully effective, practicable procedure is available under state law.\u201d Peters v.
