The hearing had been on a commitment by a justice of the peace for threatening to kill all white men.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">An attachment for contempt in not obeying the order of the court was issued and served on the Overseers of Davidson township.

In this the court was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">We see no error in the proceedings, therefore decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
