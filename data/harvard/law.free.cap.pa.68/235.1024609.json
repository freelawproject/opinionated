J., the plaintiff testified that he and the defendant owned adjoining lands :\u2014 \u201cI proposed to build a fence; defendant did not want to build and was not going to turn any cattle in, nor I, and we agreed not to put up any division fence; I put no cattle on mine.\u201d He then testified that the defendant\u2019s colts got on to his corn and oats and did him injury, to the value of $60. The defendant gave evidence in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">The court charged: * * * \u201c That if adjoining owners agree to occupy and use their respective lands without a division fence, they are each bound so to occupy and use their respective properties that the one shall not injure the crops of the other. If you believe there was such an arrangement between these parties, then we charge you- that the plaintiff may recover in this suit whatever damage he may have suffered in his crops by the trespasses of defendant\u2019s colts, and this would be the case if nothing was said about the defendant\u2019s not turning his colts out, if the parties agreed to each occupy and use his own land without a division fence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">The defendant took out a writ of error and assigned the charge for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-9\"><em>W- 3.

Smith 227.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-10\"><em>8. 3- Pimmiak, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"A6L\">by Agnew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0\">Owing to the legislation in this state in relation to fences, it has been held that an owner of improved land, who leaves it without a fence, cannot recover for the inadvertent trespass of a neighbor\u2019s cattle: \u25a0 Gregg <em>v. </em>Gregg, 5 P. F. Smith 227. But this rule, which flows solely from the breach of a statute duty, is not applicable to a case like this, where the duty to fence was not only common to both parties, but was waived by mutual consent. This is the case of adjoining improved lands governed by the Act of 11th March 1842, Pamph. L. 62, where each owner, if he would escape the burthen of fencing his whole land within his line, must pay for the one-half of the cost of a partition-fence, the expense of which is to be assessed by the township auditors. The keeping up of the partition-fence being a common duty, it was in the power of both to waive it; and they would clearly be liable to each other for trespasses upon each other\u2019s fields. After an agreement not to fence between themselves, it does not lie in the mouth of either party to set up the statute duty to fence under the Act of 1700 as a bar to a recovery for the trespasses of his cattle. Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>waived the duty on part of his neighbor in consideration of his neighbor\u2019s waiver of his duty, he is estopped from denying his own duty of keeping up his cattle. Gregg <em>v. </em>Gregg was not a case between the owners of adjoining improved lands, and is therefore no authority for this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
