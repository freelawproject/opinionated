The commissioners reported this sale and purchase to the Court of Quarter Sessions, who, on the 13th of November 1868, confirmed the report. On the 6th of April 1869, plaintiff received $45,000, and brought this suit to recover the balance, alleging that the price bore interest from the date of his agreement with the commissioners. The Court of Quarter Sessions had, previously to the payment on account, adjudged that the plaintiff was entitled to interest from the date of the confirmation of the report, and the District Court, after a verdict for the larger amount, $2175, gave judgment on points of law reserved for $1115.10, the balance due after the payment of April 9th 1869, calculating interest only from the date of the confirmation of the report of the commissioners, with interest on that balance to the date of verdict. The plaintiff brought this writ of error, and assigned for error, not entering judgment for the plaintiff for the whole amount of the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-13\"><em>J.

The learned court below held that the amount thus agreed upon bore interest not from the date of the original agreement but from the confirmation. In this we think they were entirely right. These proceedings were all subsequent to the passage of the Act of April 14th 1868, Pamph. L. 1083, the 10th section of which declares that \u201c whenever any report of the said commissioners shall have been confirmed by the court, the valuation made shall be forthwith payable by the city of Philadelphia.\u201d It was certainly within the power of the legislature so to provide, and it would be contrary to all rule to make the city liable for interest upon a demand before it is by law payable. It will be observed that there is a marked difference between this language and that employed in the Act of March 26th 1867, Pamph. L. 547, under which Haley <em>v. </em>The City, antea p. 45, has just been decided. In coming to an agreement as to the valuation both parties must have known that it was subject to the approbation of the court when alone it would have become payable, and they must be considered to have regulated their terms accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
