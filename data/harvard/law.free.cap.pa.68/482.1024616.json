I wrote the will at the request of Mr. Folmar, and at his dictation. I am satisfied in my mind that I wrote the will as he ordered me. I am satisfied in my mind that I made known to testator the contents of the will, because it is my rule to do so in all cases, to read and explain before signing. I cannot recollect any particular words that he said, but I am satisfied in my mind that I wrote his name to the will by his direction and request. I am satisfied in my mind that I would not have written his name to the will unless directed by him to do so. Testator was at the time sick in bed; appeared to be weak but of sound mind. Not certain if he was physically able to write his name or not. He died in a few days after the will was written. Mathias Anstadt and Stephen Yoder were called as witnesses. The signing of the will was done in the presence of the witnesses and acknowledged before them. Anstadt and Yoder the witnesses are both dead. I was present when the will was admitted to probate, Anstadt and Yoder were present as witnesses in the register\u2019s office \u2014 think they were sworn as witnesses to the will. I saw Anstadt and Yoder, the witnesses, sign their names to the will. I * do not recollect any particular words, but I am satisfied that the testator directed me to write his name to the will, as I have always been very particular in executing wills. I do not recollect anything said by him particularly, but am satisfied that I would not have done so unless requested \u2014 it was not my custom to write a man\u2019s name, unless specially requested. Anstadt died soon after Folmar. Yoder died ten or twelve years ago.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-15\">There was evidence that at the execution of the will the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>tator was very sick and from stiffness of his arm was unable to write; but there was no evidence that he requested any one to sign his name.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXl\">May 18th 1871,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">The auditor reported: \u201c That the evidence of the execution of the will is entirely too vague and inexplicit, and wants the essential requisites necessary to constitute it a will, to wit: \u2018 The express direction to another to sign his name to the will,\u2019 as required by the statute of 1833, and the decisions thereon. lie therefore decides that the paper purporting to be the last will and testament of Theobald Eolmar, deceased, is not a will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">\u201c The funds arising out of the personal estate are insufficient to pay the expenses of this audit; he therefore makes no distribution.\u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-8\">The report, after exceptions, was confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court.

The distribution of the proceeds was referred to an auditor, and before this auditor the will was impugned as imperfectly executed, so held to be by him, and his report confirmed by the court. We think this was an error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>After a probate of a will, which is prim\u00e1 facie sufficient evidence of the due execution of it even as to real estate, and no contest has taken place upon it for more than twenty-one years, and a title founded upon it in the mean time, nothing less than clear and satisfactory evidence of a strong character should be permitted to rebut the <em>prima facie </em>effect of the probate. Clearly there was nothing in the testimony of Peter Levy so clear and satisfactory as to rebut the strong presumption in favor of the will. But this question becomes of no importance under the provisions of the 7th section of the Act of 22d April 1856, declaring that the probate shall be <em>conclusive </em>as to real estate unless <em>within five years </em>from the date of such probate those interested to controvert it, shall, by <em>caveat and action at law duly pursued, </em>contest the validity of such will as to such realty. The proviso to this section gave to persons who would be sooner barred by the act, two years after its date to make the contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">That this act is retrospective is decided in Kenyon <em>v. </em>Stewart, 8 Wright 180. See also Maul <em>v. </em>Rider, 1 P. F. Smith 384-5. It is true that Woodward, J., remarks in the opinion that if the party to be affected be not of full age an embarrassing question might arise, such as was discussed in Miller <em>v. </em>Franciscus, 4 Wright 339, alluding to the application of the exceptions contained in the General Limitation Act of 1785, \u00a7 3, to the Act of 1856, But in the later case of Warfield <em>v. </em>Fox, 3 P. F. Smith 382, where the question directly arose, it was held that the Act of 1856 makes no exception in favor of <em>minors </em>and <em>femes covert, </em>and that the exceptions in the Act of 1785 could not be applied. \u201c We hold, therefore (said Strong, J.), that the probate by the register of the proper county of any will devising real estate is conclusive upon all persons, whether infants, <em>femes covert, non compotes mentis </em>or not, unless within five years from the date of such probate the validity of the will shall be contested in the manner pointed out by the 7th section of the Act of 1856.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The decree of the court below is therefore reversed, and the record is order to be remitted, with an order to proceed to make distribution of the fund in question to the persons entitled to the same under the will of Theobald Folmar, deceased, the costs of the proceedings and of this appeal to be paid out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
