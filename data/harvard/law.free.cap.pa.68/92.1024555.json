S. Richards retained annually the sum of $270 for interest from 1850 to 1858; that he retained one-half the net proceeds of the leases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-12\">Other evidence was offered on both sides, not necessary to be referred to, except evidence by the plaintiff that besides his indebtedness to Judge Richards he was deeply in debt between June 1849 and April 1851 to other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-13\">The court stated the case to the jury as presented by the evidence and charged :i\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-14\">* * * \u201cThese are the papers executed by the parties, and [under them, in view of the other evidence in the cause* the legal rights of these parties are to be settled by the jury]. It is claimed on behalf of the plaintiff, that the sum of $4500, the repayment of which was provided for by the agreement of the 21st of July 1849, formed the sole consideration for the conveyance of the preceding day; that the absolute character of the deed was qualified by the agreement, which is alleged to be a defeasance, and that the papers, taken together, amounted to a mortgage. And upon this view of the legal rights of the parties the court are asked for binding instructions that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict for the whole of his claim, upon the jury finding that the $4500 provided for in the agreement have been fully paid. The fact of this payment is asserted on the part of the plaintiff to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>found in the receipt by Judge Richards of ore-rents from Reeves, Ruck &amp; Co., over and above the amount he was entitled to receive as the equitable owner of one-third of the property. The manner of this suggested form of payment the jury will readily understand. The evidence shows that fifteen different settlements were made between Judge Richards and Dr. Oakeley, between the 1st of January 1853 and the 11th of June 1859. The moneys due from Reeves, Buck &amp; Co. were paid to Judge Richards, who charged the general account in the first instance with taxes and expenses, and then retained, each year, the sum of $270 for interest, withholding at each settlement one-half of the net balance and paying to Dr. Oakeley the remaining half. The plaintiff\u2019s theory is, that equitably Judge Richards was entitled to withhold but one-third of the rents after the deduction of expenses, and that his receipt of the excess, in connection with the $270 retained annually for interest, the whole of the $4500 was paid. If the court were warranted in giving the legal instructions asked for by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, it would only remain for them to submit the question of the fact of this payment to the jury, and there would probably be little difficulty in reaching a result, as it would depend upon a calculation of amounts which are ascertained in the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">\u201c The court, however, are not able to give the instructions asked for. It has been held as a rule of law that no form of words can deprive a mortgagor of his right to redeem his land. * * * In view of the principles of law relied upon, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel insisting that the papers in question show that the deed from Oakeley to Richards was in consideration of a pre-existing debt, and that the agreement for a reconveyance on the repayment of that debt was contemporaneous with the deed, insist upon a disposition of the whole case by instructions from the court to the jury that the transaction amounted to a mortgage. On the other hand a ruling in favor of the defendant is contended for because, on the face of the papers, it is shown that the deed and agreement were not of contemporaneous date, and because, in the view of his counsel, the agreement was for a conditional sale by its very terms. If the facts of the case were such as to justify the application of the rule of law for which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contend, the right of the plaintiff to recover, the repayment of the debt being proved, would perhaps be the necessary result of such an application. But [the court are not at liberty, under this evidence, to assume the disposition of the cause. They are bound to submit to the jury, under the papers and other evidence, the question as to what the real nature of the transaction between Judge Richards and Dr. Oakeley was].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">\u201c There is no proof of ^character so distinct as to justify the court in adopting it, as to what was- the real consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>conveyance of the 20th of July 1849. It does not appear affirmatively that the $4500 mentioned in the agreement formed the sole consideration for the deed. [It is for the jury to connect this deed with the agreement of the following day, if they are to be connected. If, under the evidence, the jury find that the $4500 stipulated in the agreement to be repaid, formed the whole debt of Dr. Oakeley to Judge Richards, and included all the liabilities for the doctor which the judge assumed; that the deed was/made in view of, and in order to secure the payment of that indebtedness ; and that the agreement was made for a reconveyance upon such repayment, then the principles of law which have been read to you are to be applied, and the whole contract, taken together, is to be treated as a mortgage of such interest in the property as Dr. Oakeley owned. In that case, notwithstanding the stipulation for the reconveyance of one-half of the property, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict for two-thirds], because the law would treat the contract of the parties as a mortgage, and would limit his rights to a recovery of his debt and interest. There would then remain the simple question as to whether the debt of $4500, with its interest, had been fully paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">\u201c The jury will thus understand that it is their duty to pass upon this whole cause. And they will perform this duty in the light given them by all the evidence that has been submitted. The testimony of Washington Richards is submitted for consideration, with the memorandum sworn to by Mrs. McElroy. In regard to this memorandum, it does not, in the opinion of the court, help or hinder the case upon either side, but it is before the jury in its connection with the other proofs on which they will have to pass. They are to consider all the facts in disposing of the main question presented to them \u2014 the family relations, as well as the business relations which existed between Judge Richards and Dr. Oakeley, \u2014 the pecuniary position of the doctor at the time, the sort of partnership in the mines which the parties formed, the transactions connected with the mines before the execution of the deed of the 20th of July 1849, and the dealings, arrangements and settlements between them after the execution of the deed and agreement, which the jury shall find to have been proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">\u201c [If the jury find it proved that the sum mentioned in the agreement was the only consideration for the deed, and that the real contract of the parties was to secure the repayment of that sum, and shall find it proved also that the sum has been repaid, the verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff for his entire interest in the land, as that interest was held previous to the execution of the deed.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">\u201c [If, on the other hand, it shall he found that there were other considerations of an extent and kind that made it just and equitable that Judge Richards should retain the one-half of the net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>rents of the property, and just and equitable also that he should retain one-half of the property itself, then, although the jury should find the $4500 to have been paid, the right of the plaintiff would be limited to a verdict for one-half of the land.] <em>* * *</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>\u201c </em>In any event, a verdict is to be rendered in favor of the plaintiff. If the sum of $4500 provided for in the agreement has been fully paid,.and the jury find, under the instructions given them, that the contract of the parties was to secure its payment as a stipulated debt, the verdict should be for two-thirds of the land in controversy. If they find that the money has been paid, and still find that there were other motives and considerations than the $4500 for the execution of the conveyance, and that, in reality, the transaction-was intended to he a contract of sale for a valuable consideration, and not a mortgage, a verdict for one-half only of the land can be rendered. If the jury find that, in whole or in part, the money has not been paid, the jury are to ascertain the sum actually due on this account from Dr. Oakeley, and render a verdict for the plaintiff for two-thirds, or for one-half of the land, as they shall find the actual original contract to require, subject to the payment within a stipulated time, of the balance which shall remain unpaid.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for two-thirds of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">The defendant removed the record to the Supreme Court, and there assigned the following errors :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

It is therefore dismissed without further notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th and 9th errors bring up a single question, to wit: the effect of the agreement of July 21st 1849. We discover no error in the court\u2019s submitting to the jury this agreement as evidence, with the other facts in the ease, that the deeds of July 20th 1849, were but a mortgage of the estates conveyed by these deeds to Matthew S. Richards, of the one-half of the property set forth in the agreement. But we think there was no sufficient evidence to submit to them, that the deeds were only a mortgage of two-thirds of the property. It has been frequently said of late by this court, that the doctrine of a scintilla of evidence is not law, and that a mere spark of evidence jraght not to carry a case to the jury. The evidence must be sufficient to found upon it a reasonable probability of the existence of the fact asserted, and not a mere possibility; and especially when its pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>pose is to contradict a solemn writing of tbe parties stating the fact otherwise. In this case the agreement of July 21st 1849 sets forth, clearly and without qualification or douht, that the estate to be reconveyed by M. S. Richards to George W. Oakeley was the undivided half part of the 10 acres and 97 perches conveyed by the deeds of July 20th 1849, upon repayment of the sum of $4500 and interest; and that Oakeley, as the actuary and agent of Richards of the mines, vineyards, &amp;c., should pay to Richards, after deducting reasonable costs and expenses, one-half of'the profits for his share. This proportion is corroborated by the conduct of the parties for many years while both lived, in the payment of the interest and the division of the profits. Now there is absolutely nothing in the testimony of Washington Richards, and the memorandum testified to by Mrs. McElroy, to contradict this proportion (the one-half), or to prove that the true proportion was two-thirds to be reconveyed. We are not at liberty to infer from the statement of Judge Richards to Washington <em>Richards; </em>that he was managing the property of Dr. Oakeley, and when the debt was paid, it was to be his property again; that he meant a different proportion from that stated in the written contract. The fact that the deeds conveyed two-thirds of the property to Judge Richards is not alone a sufficient reason to overturn the express terms of the agreement of July\\21st 1849. Oakeley was then deeply in debt to Richards and also to others, and unable to pay his creditors. The reasonable interpretation of the entire transaction, is, that the deeds were made to equalize the ownership of the parties, as well as to secure repayment advanced or to be advanced; and therefore that the deeds were absolute as to the one-sixth, thus making Richards\u2019s ownership one-half, and were a security for the repayment of the $4500, upon the one-half left in Oakeley. When parties have thus put their bargain in writing and have acted in accordance with it for so many years, it is error to permit a different interest to be found by a jury on such dubious and uncertain evidence as the statement of Washington Richards. It is undoubtedly true that Judge Richards was managing the property for the benefit of Oakeley, his brother-in-law, together with himself. He never denied this, and the memorandum referred to by Mrs. McElroy, proves no more. But how much of the property or what proportion did he mean ? He gave it no name, and signified nothing contrary to his contract. It is now, after his death, a graceless act in the plaintiffs to ask a jury to infer a mere possibility of two-thirds against the positive agreement of both parties that the security for the money should rest upon one-half only; and against their own interpretation of it for years. Eor this error the judgment must be reversed. The 7th and 8th assignments are not according to rule and will not be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
