Yan Auken against Daniel Y. Drake and Rachel Drake. On the 6th of February 1866, Daniel, claiming to own the land, and he and the widow being in possession, by articles agreed to sell it to Brown, the plaintiff: \u2014 this contract Drake refused to carry out. On the 16th of May 1868, the land devised was sold by the sheriff under executions upon the Yan Auken judgment, and was purchased by the plaintiff for $2505.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">Mary Ann Drake, the youngest child of Ephraim Drake, attained the age of twenty one-years, October 16th 1868. The widow is living, never having married, and is one of the defendants in this case. She and Daniel live on the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">On the trial of the ejectment, the court (Barrett, P. J.) charged: \u2014 * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-9\">\u201c At the time of the sale, the widow had in the land only an estate for years to terminate at a fixed period. After its termination, she was to have a living off of it, but would not be entitled to the possession. She is now entitled to the possession. Daniel Y. Drake had an estate under the will; an estate in remainder. It was a vested remainder, and was the subject of a levy and sale under the judgment against him. The sheriff\u2019s deed conveyed that right to the plaintiffs. After the 16th. of October 1868, Daniel Y. Drake was entitled to the land in fee simple: true there were conditions that required his acceptance, but can his intention to accept be doubted ? He was in the actual possession with his mother. He claimed the land and tried to make sale of it. He was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>possession-when the suit was commenced, and is defending under his title obtained through the will of his father. It is not a contest with creditors, but between himself and the sheriff\u2019s vendee. The plaintiff has by means of a judicial sale the title of Daniel V. Drake, and as Rachel Drake is not entitled to the possession, the verdict of the jury should be for the plaintiff for the premises in dispute.\u201d The verdict was for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJ3\">March 30th 1871,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">The proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale were brought into court and an auditor, September 21st 1868, reported</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">\u2018\u2018To Nancy_ElizaJDrake| daughters and legatees <em>r - \u2014 - - </em>To Sarah Ellen Drake To Mary Ann Drake J Ephraim Drake, deceased 0f f $300 01 &lt; 300 ( 300</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-14\">the remainder to other judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-15\">The report was confirmed by the Court of Common Pleas, and from the decree of confirmation Daniel Y.

It is the settled doctrine in this state that all possible titles, vested or contingent, in real estate, may be taken in execution and sold, provided there he a real interest in the defendant in the execution, legal or equitable: Rickert <em>v. </em>Madeira, 1 Rawle 329; Humphreys <em>v. </em>Humphreys, 1 Yeates 427; Hunt <em>v. </em>Lithgow, Id. 24; De Haas <em>v. </em>Bunn, 2 Barr 337. The fact, therefore, that Daniel Y. Drake\u2019s estate was not to take effect until his youngest sister became of age, and that the levy and sale were made a few months before that time, will not render' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>sale void. Under his father\u2019s will, Daniel having survived Charles, was clearly entitled to the estate when it fell in to him, both in possession and in remainder. It is immaterial whether his interest in the property was vested or contingent, it was liable to his debts, and by the. sale of it William Brown, the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, became entitled to it. It is also well settled, that a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale is not bound to show more than his deed, and the proceedings under which it was made, to recover the pos session from the defendant in the execution: Green <em>v. </em>Watrous, 17 S. &amp; R. 393, 398; Eisenhart <em>v. </em>Slaymaker, 14 Id. 153, 157; Little <em>v. </em>Delancey, 5 Binn. 270; Act of 16th June 1836,. \u00a7\u00a7 106, 109, Purd. 450, pi. 129-132; It is evident, therefore, that Daniel Y. Drake, who was in possession of the land at the time of the levy and sale, and also when the ejectment was brought, had no defence to that action. He must yield up the possession to Brown, the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The sum of nine hundred dollars, directed to be paid by Daniel and Charles Drake to their sisters Nancy, Sarah and Mary, was evidently intended by the testator to be charged upon the land devised to Daniel and Charles, or the survivor. They were to have the land <em>by </em>paying this sum, and this sum was the share set apart for the girls out of the land, whether all lived or some died. This being the case, the sisters are entitled to receive their legacies out of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale. Clearly Daniel V. Drake, the appellant, has no right to object to this. His title was extinguished by the sale, and the money necessarily must be applied to the encumbrances. If he had any objection to the sale of his interest in the land, it should have been made before, and not in the distribution of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
