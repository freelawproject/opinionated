Eckman, the sons of Jacob Eckman. Daniel brought these papers here and I drew a deed for him for a hundred acres, which he said he was going to give to Benjamin Eckman and Daniel Eckman, the sons of Jacob. He came here and signed it and acknowledged it. When it was all finished he told me he was going to leave that deed with his brother Jacob for safe-keeping, and then at his death he was to deliver it over to Benjamin and Daniel. Afterwards Jacob came here and said that Daniel had left the deed with him, and then Daniel Eckman, Sr., came along here and informed me that he had left the deed with his brother Jacob.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">Daniel B.

Benjamin and witness got the deed from their father and gave it with the will to Mr. Amwake, who asked them where they got the papers from; Benjamin said from their father; witness said the same thing: Mr. Amwake said the death of the wife made no difference. Mr. Amwake asked what they were going to do with the papers; both said they were going to return them to their father. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\">\u201cWithin a year after my father\u2019s death, Benjamin and I went to John Strohm\u2019s together to get deeds drawn to separate the undivided part of each property; that is, I was to convey to him my interest in the property we got from my father, and he to convey to me his interest in the property we got .from my uncle Daniel. We took the deeds along, but no wills. There were deeds drawn, hut not executed, because he would not comply with what I wanted, and I would not comply with what he wanted. Benjamin had in his possession, and took to Strohm\u2019s, the deed to which I have referred. Benjamin did not at that time tell me where he got uncle Daniel\u2019s deed, and I did not ask him. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-11\">\u201c It was at the instance of my uncle Daniel that we took those deeds to Strohm\u2019s. He wanted it fixed in his lifetime. We went to Strohm\u2019s, I think, in 1868. Before we went to Strohm\u2019s \u2014 but on the same day \u2014 uncle Daniel told me to have that deed, we ought to have that deed'from him to Ben and me recorded. When he spoke of having it fixed, he meant the deeds between Benja<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>min and me. He made no condition about tbe recording of tbe deed. He just said we should have that deed recorded. My father died two years before my uncle.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">Daniel Lefevre said: \u201c I was one of the appraisers of J acob\u2019s estate. Benjamin told me he didn\u2019t want his father\u2019s estate appraised at present. He wanted to wait until his uncle Daniel\u2019s death. The reason was they had the right of it, and he didn\u2019t want it appraised, as they, after his uncle\u2019s death, had the right of it; it was their property; both of them had agreed that after his death he was to have one place, and Daniel the other. He said they had the papers. His uncle and father had fixed it all. He said, he or we had the papers. He said his uncle had reserved a life estate in it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">Christopher Hess said: \u201cBenjamin and Daniel B. Eckman were not on good terms. I went to Benjamin to try to get them on agreeable terms to understand each other properly. Benjamin agreed that I should go to Daniel; said he was stubborn, and if he don\u2019t take care I\u2019ll have him cut short, or he will be cut short, in this other property. I said, \u2018Yes; in the property of your uncle Daniel in that deed your father held in his lifetime ? I suppose it is that you are alluding to.\u2019 \u2018 Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018 we have that deed.\u2019 He said he would like to have that home property; he always had lived upon it. I had brought them together, and Daniel consented that he should have it. I told Benjamin that his father in his lifetime had said to me that he had that deed which was delivered to him in his possession, and that it was all fixed. This was the deed from his uncle Daniel, conveying his property to his nephews. His father had said to me that it was delivered to him, and it was all right. Benjamin said, \u2018 Yes, we have that deed.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">Philip Miller said: * * * \u201c On my way to Daniel\u2019s I met Benjamin, and told him I was on the way to see. what could be done. He said I might tell Daniel that if he would sign off for me here, I\u2019ll sign off for him there \u2014 pointing towards his uncle Daniel\u2019s place. I then asked him \u2014 from what you say, I understand that your uncle Daniel has fixed his farm in the same way your father has his, \u2014 I having read previously his father\u2019s deed to him and Daniel for the home property. His answer was, \u2018 Yes, yes; the same way.\u2019 I asked him if he was sure of that. He answered, * Yes, I have it; it\u2019s here.\u2019 He said, \u2018 Uncle had left it to daddy, or give it to daddy, and since his death it is here.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">John Strohm said : \u201c I was employed by Benjamin and Daniel Eckman, sometime in the spring of 1868, to draw a deed. They came to my house together and told me they wished me to write two deeds of conveyance; one of which was to convey the undivided half of a plantation in Strasburg township which had been owned by their father from Daniel B. Eckman to Benjamin Eckman ; the other deed was to convey the undivided half of a tract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of land, also, in Strasburg township, which was held by their uncle Daniel Eckman, then from Benjamin Eckman to Daniel B. Eckman. I asked them what right they had to dispose of their uncle\u2019s property. They told me they had a deed for it, by which it was conveyed to them jointly. I then told them, in order to make the deeds which they wished, I must have the old titles. I should want the deed which they alleged they had from their uncle among others. I asked them whether they could get that deed. They told me they could. I then told them, if they would bring me the old titles I would make the deeds which they desired. They went away and in the course of a week returned to my house and brought the title papers, one of which was a deed executed by Daniel Eckman conveying his plantation on which he lived to Benjamin Eckman and Daniel B. Eckman. They came together again and I showed them the title papers that I had drawn, and they had some conversation and disagreed about something. They could not execute them, their wives were not along, and they separated. Benjamin insisted upon having the thing settled; but Daniel was not willing to agree to what Benjamin proposed. I am not positive whether they were there afterwards or not, but the last time they were there Benjamin said if it was not fixed that night, it would be fixed in another way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">For the defendant Benjamin Eekman, was examined and testified that there was no delivery of the deed, except in escrow, on the condition that they could make the arrangement by \u2018which Daniel B. Eckman was to convey to Benjamin his interest in the father\u2019s farm, and Benjamin to convey to Daniel his interest in the uncle\u2019s farm. He also contradicted the statements of Daniel B., Lefevre, Miller, Hess and Strohm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">The defendants submitted five points, which with answers of the court are found in the assignments of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">The court, after referring to the facts with some minuteness, said to the jury: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">\u201c Upon this question of delivery, as a point of fact, it is proper for the jury to consider the circumstances, that this deed was twice in the possession of these brothers, at distant intervals, and used by them for their own benefit and advantage. In the first instance, when they came to consult a lawyer as to its validity, and in the second, when they went to Mr. Strohm to have deeds drawn, one to the other, and there are considerations belonging to each of these incidents which may aid the jury in reaching a satisfactory conclusion. [With respect to the consultation with Mr. Amwake, unless they informed him or led him to believe that the deed had been delivered, he would have told them at once that it was good for nothing, no matter how correct in form. But Mr. Amwake pronounced the deed good. He therefore was assured that it had been delivered. Now suppose, as Benjamin has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>declared, that he obtained the deed from his uncle for this occasion, his uncle had said to him when he gave it to him, \u2018 I do not intend by placing this deed in your hands to deliver it, but only do so on condition that -you return it to me immediately after you have consulted the lawyer. You must, however, not tell him that I have not delivered it, but get his opinion whether it is a good deed.\u2019 This would have been a deception and fraud, and if the thing done were the same in effect, if the counsel were misled in regard to the fact of delivery and gave an opinion of the deed on their representation, which was not true, he was deceived as well as those who deceived him, and there was legal fraud somewhere in the transaction.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\"><em>\u201c </em>[So when between three and four years afterwards, the two brothers called upon Mr. Strohm to draw those deeds, he was led to believe this deed was good, that is, had been delivered, otherwise he would not have had the title he called for. Mr. Strohm knew, as every scrivener as well as every lawyer knows, that delivery is essential to the validity of a deed.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">\u201c Again, even if this deed was at all other times in the hands of Daniel Eckman, the grantor, his giving it on these two occasions to the grantees for their use and benefit, was a complete delivery, unless there was an explicit condition attached to the giving it to his nephews on the occasion, specifying that it was not to be regarded as a delivery, but was to be returned to him as if it had not passed out of his hands, and <em>that, </em>if alleged, should be clearly and distinctly proved, otherwise the inference is reasonable and just that the delivery was complete. If the jury believe from all the evidence that this deed was given by Daniel Eckman to his brother Jacob to keep for his nephews, as Daniel Fulton, Esq., represents, the delivery was thereby sufficient and complete.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">\u201c In reference to the truth of this fact, the jury moreover may well consider the basis of the original arrangement of the two elder brothers for the benefit of these sons of the one and nephew of the other. It was perfect equality. They were to be equal owners of the two farms \u2014 tenants in common. * * * If this arrangement o(f the two brothers Daniel and Jacob Eckman were binding as an agreement for the benefit of others, it surely could not be changed by one of these parties without the assent of the other. It could not be changed by Daniel Eckman, Sr. Further it could not be changed without the consent of the parties for whose benefit it was made, that is Benjamin Eckman and Daniel B. Eckman, not the consent of one but both. [If then it was proper and consistent with the arrangement that it should be delivered, it is ground of presumption that it was in fact delivered, and confirms the testimony on that point.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Should the jury be satisfied that, in point of fact, this deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>was at any time delivered by Daniel Eckman to the grantees or to Jacob Eckman for them, it became by such delivery a perfect and valid deed of conveyance, and no subsequent possession of it by Daniel Eckman, Sr., could impair its validity or effect. It passed the title as granted, subject to the reservation of the rents and profits, and fixed the rights of the parties from the moment of delivery. If the jury therefore believe this deed was delivered, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and their verdict should be in favor of Daniel B. Eckman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">The defendant took a writ of error and assigned errors as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">1.

The parts of the charge in brackets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-12\">7. The answer to the first point of <em>defendant; viz.: \u201c </em>Delivery of a deed is essential to its validity, and that is a question for the jury to determine. If, therefore, the jury believe that Daniel Eckman executed the instrument dated September 6th 1859, under which the plaintiff claims, with the intention of delivering it to Benjamin Eckman and Daniel B. Eckman when they were ready and willing to make certain arrangements in regard to the property described therein, which he desired them to make, and kept it in his possession until the arrangements could be carried out, and that those arrangements were not carried out on account of the refusal of the grantees therein named, or either of them, to comply with his wishes, and that the instrument continued in his possession until after his death, except when he gave it to the grantees for a special purpose, or for having the papers prepared to carry out his proposed arrangements, it never was delivered and conveyed no title to the plaintiff, and their verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-13\">Answer: \u201c The first sentence in this point is correct. There being no evidence of the intention here supposed of Daniel Eckman with respect to the time of delivery of the deed, or that he kept it in his possession with a view to the arrangements mentioned in this point, if the deed was at any time delivered in point of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>by Daniel Eckman his subsequent possession of it did not affect its validity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">8. The answer to the third point of the defendant; viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">\u201c If the instrument of September 6th 1859, is a deed, it is a deed of bargain and sale, and the payment of the consideration mentioned therein is necessary to transfer the use and render the instrument operative. The proof is, that the consideration-money was not paid. The instrument is therefore inoperative and the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">Answer: \u201c The deed is a good and valid deed if it were delivered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-9\">9. The answer to the fourth point of the defendant; viz. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-10\"><em>\u201c </em>The instrument in question contains a reservation of the rents, issues and profits to the grantor for his life, which, at his death, were to vest in the grantees. This reservation limits the fee to take effect <em>in futuro, </em>which, at common law, can be done only where the estate is <em>granted, </em>not <em>reserved. </em>The instrument, therefore, conveys no estate to the plaintiff and he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-11\">Answer : <em>\u201c </em>The instrument in question is good and valid if it was delivered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-12\">10. The answer to the fifth point of the defendant; viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-13\">\u201c The instrument in question is a testamentary instrument and is therefore revocable. It is revoked by the will of Daniel Eckman, the grantor, and by his subsequent deed, and is therefore inoperative and conveys no title to the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-14\">Answer : \u201c The instrument in question is a good deed of grant, bargain and sale, operative according to its terms, and, if delivered supersedes all subsequent instruments, deeds or wills of Daniel Eckman, Sr., contrived to defeat its operation or effect.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-15\"><em>I).

Since the passage of the Statute of Uses, courts have recognised the validity, force and effect of deeds of this character: Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Tranmer, 2 Wilson 75; Milburn <em>v. </em>Salkeld, Willes\u2019 Rep. 670; Fisher <em>v. </em>Strickler, 10 Barr 348; 3 Cruise\u2019s Dig. part 4, 186, &amp;c. As to the revocability of the deed: Greenfield\u2019s Estate, 2 Harris 489; Ritter\u2019s Appeal, 9 P. F. Smith 9.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"Atb9\">by</author>\n<author id=\"b468-8\">Sharswood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA7A\">The first three assignments of error are not according to Rule VIII., 6 Harris 578, and must therefore be dismissed. We may say, however, as matter of grace and not of. right, that the plaintiff in error suffers nothing by these errors not having been properly assigned. Benjamin Eckman claiming in this ejectment as the devisee of Daniel Eckman, who was the plaintiff in the equity suit, the record of that suit was clearly evidence against him as privy in estate; and this being so, the testimony of Daniel Fulton, taken in that proceeding, was also admissible. It is within, the letter and spirit of th\u00e9 Act of March 28th 1814, 6 Smith 208, which declares \u201c that any deposition taken or to be taken in any cause which, by the rules of law, may be read in evidence in the cause in which it is or may be taken, shall be allowed to be read in evidence in any subsequent cause wherein the same matter shall be in dispute between the same parties or persons, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns.\u201d The subject-matter of thaksuit was the title to this land, and the particular question involved the same as here, the delivery of the deeds \u2014 Daniel Eckman to Benjamin Eckman and Daniel B. Eckman, dated September 6th 1859; and Benjamin Eckman is the assignee in law of Daniel Eckman. We have had more difficulty as to the admissibility of the opinion of the court in that case. It was properly perhaps no part of the record. But it seems to fall within the decisions in Carmony <em>v. </em>Hoober, 5 Barr 305, and Coleman\u2019s Appeal, 12 P. F. Smith 252, that such an opinion may be resorted to as evidence that the decree or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>judgment was upon the merits and not upon any incidental or collateral question. No point was made below as to the effect of the decree \u2014 whether it was a decision upon the main question and conclusive \u2014 nor has such point been raised in this court. Had the plaintiffs in error wished to exclude the opinion so far as it respected the statement of facts, they should have requested the court to charge that though admitted and read in the cause for another purpose, it was no evidence of any fact, and in that point of view was.to he dismissed from their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The 4th, 5th and 6th points complain of the charge of the court and may be considered together. The learned judge below was of the opinion that the weight of the evidence was in favor of the delivery of the deed. This court thought so upon the same testimony in Eckman <em>v. </em>Eckman, 5 P. F. Smith 269, and we all agree in thinking so now. The opinion of the judge below was indeed very strongly expressed to the jury, but they were explicitly told at the same time that the question was for them to decide. We cannot say that there was any abuse of the discretionary power of the court to express their opinion upon the sufficiency of the evidence or that the jury were misled. In stating the evidence of Messrs. Amwake and Strohm, the learned judge may have been mistaken in attributing to them what was only a legitimate inference from their testimony. It was really immaterial what their opinions may have been on the question of the goodness of the deed: the important bearing of their testimony was the almost necessary, nay, inevitable inference that the two brothers had consulted them together without raising any objection to the deed on the score of its non-delivery. If there was a mistake committed as to their testimony it was evidently an inadvertent one, and had his attention been called to it at the close of the charge, the learned judge would have referred to his notes and either corrected the one or the other according to the fact. Upon a difference of opinion between the court and counsel I have frequently seen the witness himself recalled and asked to repeat what he had said. We do not think that the jury were misled by anything in these portions of the charge here assigned for error, and these assignments are therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The 7th error assigned is to the answer of the learned court to the first point of the defendant below. The judge instructed the jury that there was no evidence that it was the intention of Daniel Eckman at the time of the execution of the deed not to deliver it until the grantees should make certain arrangements between themselves in regard to the property. Nor was there any such evidence, unless afforded by what occurred subsequently to the death of Jacob Eckman, and Daniel\u2019s desire then that such arrangements should be made. Had these things followed close upon the execution of the deed they might have afforded some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>grounds for the inference, hut the date of the instrument is September 6th 1859, and Jacob Eckman died in 1862, three years after, leaving his elder brother Daniel, the grantor in the deed, to survive him. It was in the spring of 1863 that the two brothers, Benjamin and Daniel B., called upon Mr. Strohm to make amicable partition of the two farms, by mutual releases. It was then after the deeds of release were drawn, and were ready to be executed, that this unfortunate controversy between the two brothers arose by a disagreement about the profits, taxes and repairs of the farm derived from the will of their father, and then vested in them as tenants in common. We think it would not be a legiti'mate inference from this that old Daniel Eckman had originally intended that his nephews should make such an arrangement and not to deliver the deed unless they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The1 answers of the learned judge to the 3d and 4th points of the defendant below, which form the subject of the 8th and 9th assignments of error, were clearly right. It is one of the best established principles, for which no reference to authorities is necessary, that a deed shall always be so construed as to give it effect; <em>ut res magis valeat quarn per eat. </em>If it cannot be treated as a deed of bargain and sale because there was in fact no pecuniary consideration, yet if the consideration of blood did exist it shall be supported as a covenant to stand seised. <em>Quacunque via data, </em>therefore, this deed was good, and conceding that the reservation to the grantor of the rents and profits arising out of the I premises, was a life estate in the land itself, the remainder to the <em>\\ </em>grantees was not a freehold commencing <em>in futuro, </em>but a future <em>' </em>springing use, taking effect under the Statute of Uses. We may say here that in Pennsylvania a recorded deed will be construed as having the effect of a feoffment with livery of seisin or as a deed under the Statute of Uses, as will best accomplish the intention and design of the parties: Act of May 28th 1715, \u00a7 5, 1 Smith L. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The 10th assignment of error, which complains of the answer to the 5th point of the defendant below, raises the question whether the deed of September 6th 1859 is not a testamentary instrument: by reason of the reservation to the grantor of the rents and profits for life. It is contended that it falls within the principle of Turner <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 P. F. Smith 126. There was a provision in the deed in that case not to be found in this: \u201c this conveyance in no way to take effect until after the decease of the said John Scott, the grantor.\u201d Although in form a grant, these words were supposed to indicate that it was nothing but a declaration of what the grantor willed to be done after his death. But there is nothing of the kind in this instrument. ' It is a grant\u2014 and whether a bargain and sale or a covenant to stand seised, it enures to the use of the grantor for life, and after his death to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>use of his nephews, the grantees, in fee simple, and there being no power of revocation contained in the instrument it was irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
