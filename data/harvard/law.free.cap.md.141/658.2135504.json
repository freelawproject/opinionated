Lacking a water supply for its development, appellant entered into negotiations with appellee with a view to purchasing six acres of his land and two small parcels containing these wells, and on July 26th, 1920, the following option agreement was executed by the parties; after appellant\u2019s manager, Fletcher W. Moore, according to his testimony, told appellee: \u201cWo would require the water thoroughly tested, both as to quantity and quality if we took it because if we bought the land at all we would buy it exclusively for the reason he had a water supply there; that we didn\u2019t want the land at all\u201d; and appellee re]died \u201cthe water was fine and had had it tested a number of times and also made the remark that it. wasi considered as good as Chattolanee water\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">\u201cThis Agreement entered into on above date by and between the Realty Improvement Company, party of the first part, and Otto F. Unger, party of the second part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201cThat, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar paid by first party to second party, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, it is hereby mutually agreed that first party shall have the right to put men and machinery on second party\u2019s land to test certain wells, and if same prove satisfactory to first party, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>then first party will buy six acres of land in the Thirteenth District of Baltimore County, lying partly on Annapolis Road, south of English Consul Estate and north of the Brian Estate property, now known as Rosemont. Included in said sale shall be two separate pieces of ground, one approximately ten by twelve feet in size on which is erected a pump house and tank and the other ten by ten feet which contains a deep well six inches in diameter. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">\u201cThis proposed transfer shall also convey to first party the permanent right to maintain the water pipes now under ground and relay and repair same if necessary; the price to be paid second party for said six acres of land and the two smaller pieces containing wells and pumphouse, etc., shall be the sum of seven thousand dollars, payable two thousand, three hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-four cents down on the first party\u2019s approval of title with six per cent, interest on unpaid balance computed and payable half-yearly hereafter, secured by first mortgage on the property aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201cThe balance of principal is payable two thousand, three hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents one year after date of transfer and two thousand, three hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents two years after date of transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201cFirst and second parties are to mutually agree upon release clause to be placed on the individual lots plotted or to be plotted, which release price shall aggregate the sum of four thousand, seven hundred dollars; this sale to be subject to all the outstanding agreements to furnish water heretofore entered into by the party of the second part, and the party of the second part reserves the right and privilege to connect up with the water system or wells now constructed or to be constructed by the party of the first part and to have the use thereof for himself for the property still belonging to him at English Consul Estate and for any future purchasers of the said property at the same rates and terms extended to other customers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the said party of the first part; the party of the first part hereby agreeing to continue in operation the said water system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">\u201cProvided, however, that only four houses are to be supplied with water under this agreement and that the rate for same shall he $1.50 per month, payable half-yearly in advance. Service may be discontinued for non-payment of rates as specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201cTo all of which we, the parties of first and second parts, hereby agree and have this day and year first above written hereby set our hands and seals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201cThe Realty Imp. Oo.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201c(Seal) By Chas. H. Steffey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201cOtto P. Unger. (Seal)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">In pursuance of the above agreement appellant proceeded to have the water from the wells analyzed by the State Board of Health and by Penniman <em>,&amp; </em>Brown. There seems to have been considerable delay in getting reports on the quality of the water, and appellee, desiring to get married and needing money for his wedding trip, and expecting to be away for a considerable time, urged appellant to conclude the matter and execute a contract of sale so that he might have the use of the cash payment of $500. According to* appellant\u2019s testimony, appellee said he didn\u2019t understand why the settlement should be held up while waiting for an analysis of the water, as lie had a report from the State Board of Health showing that it was good drinking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Appellee denies that he made any representations as to the quality of the water prior to the signing of the option agreement, or that the question of water was discussed at the time of the execution of the contract of sale. He testified, \u201cthe only time that water came into the proposition from the time 1 had anything to do with the Moore Realty Company (agent of appellant) or Steffey (president of appellant corporation) was along about the middle or later than the middle of August, when 1 came into' Mr. Steffey\u2019s office and asked him whether be had received his report from Crook &amp; Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>yet; and lie put me off and put me off, and lie told me \u2018no\u2019 at that time.. He said, \u2018We have some reports here that show this water- bad,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I haven\u2019t anything- to do with that.\u2019 I said, \u20181 don\u2019t see where I have anything to do with the water analysis.\u2019 He had some reports from his friend Crook. He pulled out a file like, and I told him I didn\u2019t see where I had anything to do with that. I said, \u2018As far-as that goes, I have a little certificate which shows the water is fit to drink.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The contract of sale was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\u201cThis Agreement, made this 31st day of August, 1920, by and between Otto E. Unger, unmarried, party of the first part, and The Realty Improvement Company, a body corporate, party of the second part: \u201cWhereas, The parties of the first and second parts entered into a tentative agreement of sale of the hereinafter described property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u201cWhereas, The said The Realty Improvement Company has definitely decided and agreed to purchase the said property according to the terms and agreements set forth in this agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cNow, therefore, this agreement witnesseth, That the said party of the first part doth hereby bargain and sell unto the said party of the second part the following described property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cBeing all that lot of ground situate and lying and being in Baltimore County, Maryland, and particularly described as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">\u201cBeginning at the beginning of said whole parcel of ground conveyed by C.

This contract is entered into subject to the said Otto E. Unger arranging with the purchaser of property heretofore sold by him to enter into the water system of fRosemont\u2019 on the same terms and conditions as other property holders in \u2018Rosemont.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">\u201cAnd upon payment of the unpaid purchase money and the execution of the mortgage aforesaid the said Otto E.

Dyer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>vice-president, said vendee, and the corporate seal of said vendee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">\u201cOtto P. Unger. (Seal) \u201cPrank II. Dyer,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">(Seal) Vice-President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">\u201cTest:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">\u201cClara A. McKay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Prank M. Dyer, vice-president of appellant company, testified that at the time of signing the above contract he \u201cstipulated to Mr. Unger that I signed the contract with the understanding the well was pure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">It is strongly urged by appellee that appellant, having the right under its option to test the water, if it signed the contract of August 31st without such test, is estopped to rely upon any representations that may have been made by appellee as to the quality of the water, there being mo reservation as to this in the said written contract. <em>But, </em>if it were important to decide this question, we should be inclined to the view, assuming Dyer\u2019s testimony to he true as to the oral stipulation made at the time of signing said contract and that the matter was put through at that time for the convenience of appellee before a test could he made, the parties were practically in the same position at the time of executing the contract as if there had been no option. Rut it is not necessary to decide that question for two reasons, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">1. On the whole testimony, while the water appears to he polluted and perhaps to contain too much iron to be suitable for household purposes, the pollution seems to he due to surface drainage, and both conditions could he remedied at moderate cost, for which compensation could he provided in a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">2. There are controlling reasons why the relief prayed cannot he granted, apart from objections which have been urged to the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">It will therefore he unnecessary to discuss further the matter of the water, although the alleged had quality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>water was the only excuse given by appellant for repudiating its contract, in its president\u2019s letter to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">A number of other objections were urged in argument, only two of which need be considered for the purposes of this opinion, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">1. The contract sought to be enforced was incomplete at the date of filing the bill in this case and at the date of the decree/in that it provided for a clause to be inserted in the mortgage to be given by appellant for balance of purchase money, that part of the contract being as follows: \u201cThe parties of the first and second parts are to mutually agree upon a release clause in said mortgage to be placed on the individual lots plotted or to be plotted which release prices shall aggregate the sum of four thousand seven hundred dollars,\u201d this being in round numbers the amount to be secured by the mortgage:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">2. ' The title of the vendor at the date of the decree was not such that specific performance could be enforced against him, because:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">a. There were certain restrictions on the use of the property in favor of owners of adjoining lots previously sold by appellee, which had not been released at the date of filing the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">b. There were water rights in said previous purchasers which had not been released at the date of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">c. There were unreleased mortgage and judgment liens amounting to $7,300.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">We will consider the objections in inverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">Sub-section \u201ca,\u201d under objection 2, becomes comparatively unimportant, as these restrictions wer^ formally released by all the parties in interest before the date of the decree except the Over lea Bank, mortgage and judgment creditor, which filed in the case a certificate that it was ready and willing to release the property from the restrictions. As relief must be refused on other grounds it will not be necessary to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>what effect the absence of a deed of release front this lien creditor would have, if that were the only obstacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Sub-section \u201cb.\u201d All the parties interested in the water rights executed a deed which was clearly intended to he a release of whatever interest they had in the two wells. It is true the lot described is the six acre lot, which does not contain the wells, hut the recital preceding the description is as follows\u201cKnow all men by these presents: Whereas, we the undersigned, are all the users of water obtained from, a well or wells on the property, situated in Baltimore County, m the State of Maryland, thus described\u201d : and the recital following the description is as follows: \u201cWhereas Otto F. Unger, the present owner of said lot, parcel or tract of land, has agreed to sell the same, unto the Realty Improvement Company, a hody corporate, in fee simple, and has agreed to obtain a release of all water rights <em>m </em>the wells or waters in <em>or aboui </em>said lot, pai*cel or tract of land, and whereas, the obtention of the release of all rights of user of the water in, on or upon, over, under or across said land and premises has been made a condition precedent to the acceptance of title to said land by said The Realty Improvement Company, and whereas said The Realty Improvement Company has agreed that when they acquire title to said land and premises, they will grant unto all signers of this release (providing that all users or those legally entitled to the use of water now coming from said premises, duly execute this release) the right to use the water obtained therefrom, upon such terms and conditions as may he provided by the said The Realty Improvement Company, for the use thereof by residents or lot owners in the adjoining development of \u2018Rosemont,\u2019 now being developed by said The Realty Improvement Company; in evidence whereof, the said The Realty Improvement Company has executed these presents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Tn view of the clear meaning of the parties to this release We should hardly regard the clerical error as fatal, especially as counsel for appellant accepted the release without objection when it was tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Sub-section \u201cc.\u201d This is a more serious objection. There is nothing in the record to show that appellee was able to clear up these liens .except his bald answer, \u201cyes, I am,\u201d to the question of his counsel whether he was able, ready and willing to give to the defendant a proper conveyance of a good and unencumbered estate in fee in the property mentioned in the contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">It is true one of his counsel, Mr. Gontrum, wlm was also attorney and a director of the Overlea Bank, the mortgagee and'judgment creditor, testified that the bank was willing to release the property included in the contract of sale when \u201cthis transaction goes through,\u201d but that would not bind the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Besides, after this testimony by Mr. Gontrum, appellant filed a written certificate of the said bank signed, sealed and acknowledged, in, which \u201cThe Overlea Bank certified that it is ready and willing to release the property mentioned and described in the contract of sale filed in said proceedings from the operation and effect of its mortgage mentioned and described in the above entitled proceedings and also from the operation and effect of the judgments mentioned and described in the above entitled matter at the time of the execution of the deed by Otto F. Unger to The Realty Improvement Company upon the payment by Otto F. Unger of the sum of six thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Mr. Pomeroy in his work on <em>Specific Performance </em>(2d ed.), sec. 452, says: \u201cIf the land contracted to be sold turns out to be subject to charges, easements, rights of user or incumbrances, which extend to the whole estate, and cannot be compensated for, and removed by an application of the purchase money, the vendor is not entitled to enforce the contracts; but if the charge is a slight and immaterial one, and especially if it be an incumbrance by mortgage or judgment, which can be paid off and removed by means of the purchase money, the court may decree a specific performance making provision in the decree for removing the incumbrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>By reference to the contract of sale it will be obvious that the liens could not be taken care of by application of the purchase money to their payment, because the balance of the cash payment was only to be $1,833.34, and the balance of the purchase price was to be secured by mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">We think this objection is fatal to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Quite as serious is the objection herein numbered \u201c1,\u201d on the ground of incompleteness of the contract. The contract was dependent in a material matter upon a future agreement of the parties. Even at the date of the decree there had been no agreement reached as to the release clause to be inserted in the mortgage fixing the release prices for the individual lots plotted or to be plotted, and the trial court in its decree did not and could not undertake to supply the deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Weller, </em>141 Md. 10, we said, quoting from <em>Miller s Equity: </em>\u201cThat the contract sought to he specifically enforced must ho definite and certain in its terms, and free from all ambiguity, has been established by many cases. It is indeed said that the contract must he freo from all shade or color of ambiguity.\u201d In <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Newbold, </em>115 Md. 692, it was said: \u201cNo rule is better established than that which enumerates \u2018certainty in all its parts\u2019 as one of the essentials of every agreement to merit the interposition of a court of equity, and that \u2018if any of these essentials are wanting, courts of equity will not decree a specific performance.\u2019 \u201d And in <em>Texas Co. </em>v. <em>United States Asphalt Refining Co., </em>140 Md. 356: \u201cA court of equity will not undertake to specifically enforce an agreement, unless it is definite and certain in all its provisions.\u201d See also <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>92 Md. 432; <em>King </em>v. <em>Kaiser, </em>126 Md. 213; <em>Phoenix Pad Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>127 Md. 540; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thomas &amp; Thompson Co., </em>132 Md. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The decree appealed from will he reversed and the hill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\n<em>Decree reversed and hill dismissed, with costs to appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
