Goetz and Annie M. Goetz, his wife, filed a bill of complaint in the Oireuit Oourt of Baltimore City against John 'II. Kelly and Marie Kelly, his wife, to enjoin them from erecting or proceeding with the erection of a garage on their lot in Baltimore City within seventy-five feet from the front street line of said lot, and on the same day a preliminary injunction was granted and issued enjoining the defendants, their \u201cagents-, servants and employees\u201d as prayed in the bill. The endorsements on the writ of injunction returned by the sheriff, set out in the record, contain the affidavits of Oarl Martin Distler and Frederick H. Hennighausen that a copy of the writ was served by them on John H. Kelly and Marie Kelly, his- wife, on the same day it was issued, and the return of the sheriff stating that the injunction was again served on Kelly and his wife on the 14th of November, 1921. On the latter date the court below passed an order requiring Kelly and his wife and Harry Oolliso-n to- appear in said court on the 18th of November, 1921, and show cause why they should not he punished for contempt of court for disobeying: the injunction issued on the 11th of November, 1921, and on the 15th of November Kelly and his wife filed their \u201canswer\u201d setting up the following defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201c1. That the paper alleging to be a writ of injunction was served on them on November 11th, 1921, a legal holiday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201c2. That the said writ of injunction was not served .by a sheriff or deputy sheriff of Baltimore Oity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201c3. That the said writ of injunction was not served upon the independent contractor who was engaged in erecting the garage mentioned therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201c4. That the said <em>John </em>H. Kelly and wife had no control over the said contractor, and could not carry ' out the orders of this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">After a hearing oar the 18th of November, 1921, at which Kelly and his wife and Harry Gollison wer\u2019e present and testimoaiy was produced to show the violation of the injuno tioai, aaad also by the defendants, the court below passed an oi\u2019der iar which, after stating that the evidence showed that Kelly aaid his wife aaid Gollison. had wilfully violated the injunction, it imposed a fine of $200 on Kelly and his wife, arid a fine of $100 on Gollison, and committed them to the custody of \u201cthe warden of the jail of Baltimore City\u201d until the fines were paid. The defendants promptly paid the fines imposed, and then entered this appeal from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The first and important question to be determined is whether an appeal lies from such an order. The <em>comman </em>law rule was that a court of competent jurisdiction is the sole judge of contempts against its authority and dignity, and its judgment in such cases is final and conclusive, and not reviewable bjr any other tribunal, either on a writ of error or appeal, unless specially authorized by statute. <em>Rapalje on Contempts, </em>sec. 141; 7 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law,, </em>33-34; 9 <em>Cyc. </em>61-62; 13 <em>C. J., </em>pp, 97-98, par. 155; 6 <em>R. C. L., </em>p. 538-540, see. 51; <em>R. C. L., </em>Supp. 2, p. 151, sec. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">It is said in 13 O. J. 97: \u201cThe common-law rule has been changed, however*, in many jurisdictions by constitutional or statutory provisions authorfiziarg a review. Accordingly, in jurisdictions where, by statutory or constitutional provisions,</p>\n<p id=\"At5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>review of contempt orders may be had, authority is not wanting in support of the right of review in cases of civil or constructive contempt, especially in remedial proceedings for contempt where the punishment inflicted is in the nature of an indemnity to the party injured.\u201d It is said in 7 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, </em>pp. 28-29; \u201cContempts of courts are further classified as criminal and civil. The division between the two is not uniformly defined in all jurisdictions.\u201d This is illustrated by tbo several definitions, of civil and criminal contempts contained in tlie text and in the note on page 29. See also <em>Rapalje on Contempts, </em>sec. 21; 9 <em>Cyc. </em>p. 6; 6 <em>R. C. L. </em>490; and 13 <em>C. J. </em>6. In the ease of <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>W. B. Conkey Co., </em>194 U. S. 324, the Supreme Court cpiotos the following statement of Jcbgb Saxbobjv in <em>in re Nevitt, </em>54 C. C. A. 622: \u201cProceedings for contempts are of two classes, those prosecuted to preserve the power and vindicate the dignity of the courts and to punish the disobedeience of their orders, and those instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits, and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made to enforce the rights and administer the remedies to which the court lias found them to be entitled. The former are criminal and punitive in their nature, and the government, the courts and the people are interested in their prosecution. The latter are civil, remedial and coercive in their nature, and the parties chiefly in interest in their conduct and prosecution are the individuals whose private rights and remedies they were instituted 1o protect and enforce. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>48 N. J. Eq. 105, 108, 21 Atl. Rep. 182; <em>Hendryx </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>(C. C.), 19 Fed. Rep. 810; <em>Ex parte Culliford, </em>8 Barn. &amp; C. 220 ; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>9 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>C. 652; <em>People </em>v. <em>Court of Oyer and Terminer, </em>101 N. Y. 245, 247, 4 N. E. Rep. 259, 54 Am. Rep. 691; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>11 Nevada, 187, 190; <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>3 S. Dak. 509, 513, 54 N. W. Rep. 412, 44 Am. St. Rep. 809; <em>People </em>v. <em>McKane, </em>78 Hun. 154, 160, 28 N. Y. Supp. 981; 4 Bl. Comm. 285 ; 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 68. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>A criminal contempt involves no element of personal injury. It is directed' against the power and dignity of the court, and private parties have little if any interest in the proceeding\u2019s for it-s punishment. But if the contempt consists in the refusal of a party or a person to do&gt; an act which the court has ordered him to do for the benefit or the advantage of a. party to a suit or action pending before it, and he is committed until he complies with the order, the commitment is in the nature of an execution to enforce the judgment, of the court, and the party in whose favor that judgment was rendered is the real party in interest in the proceedings.\u201d In <em>Bessette's Case, </em>Bessette was not a party to the suit in which the injunction was granted, but, with knowledge of the restraining order, he violated the injunction and was fined $250 by the circuit court for contempt. Efom the judgment, and order imposing the fine he prayed an appeal to the circuit, court of appeals, and the question to he determined by the Supreme Court was whether the circuit, court of appeals could review an order of a district or circuit court in contempt proceedings. After quoting the above statement of Judge Saebokn, Mb.. Justice Bbewbb said: \u201cDoubtless the distinction referred to in this quotation is the cause of the difference in the rulings of various state courts as to the right of review.\u201d The Supreme Court held that,'as Bessette was not. a party to the suit, his case came more fully within the punitive than in the remedial class, and that as the Act of March 3, 1891, establishing circuit courts of appeals, gave those courts jurisdiction to review decisions of the district courts and the existing circuit courts in criminal cases, the circuit court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the judgment against Bessette, and in stating its conclusion said: \u201cConsidering only such eases of contempt as the present \u2014 that is, cases in which the proceedings are against one not a party to the suit, and cannot be regarded as interlocutory \u2014 we are of opinion that there is a right of review in the circuit court of appeals. Such a review must, according to the settled law of this, court, be by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>writ of error. On such a writ only matters of law aro considered. The decision of the trial tribuna], court or jury, deciding the facts, is conclusive as to them.\u201d In the case of <em>Matter of Christensen Engineering Co., </em>194 U. S. 458, the defendant in a suit for injunction, &amp;c., was adjudged guilty of contempt for disobeying a preliminary injunction and ordered to pay a fine of $1,000, one-half to the Enited States and the other half to the complainant. On a petition for a mandamus commanding' the circuit court of appeals to take jurisdiction of a writ of error by which the petitioner sought to have the action of the circuit court adjudging him guilty of contempt, reviewed, the Supreme Court held, quoting from the syllabus, \u201cWhere an order imposing a fine for a violation of an injunction is substantially one to reimburse the party injured by the disobedience, although called one in a contempt proceeding, it is to be regarded as merely an interlocutory order, and to be reviewed only on an appeal from the final decree. Where, however, the fine is payable to the Enited States and is clearly punitive, and in vindication of the authority of the court, it dominates the proceeding and is reviewahle by the circuit court of appeals on writ of error, <em>Bessette, </em>v. W. <em>B. Conkey Co., </em>194 U. S. 324, and the court should take jurisdiction.\u201d The distinction between civil and criminal contempts was again considered in <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Bucks Stove and Range Co., </em>221 U. S. 418, where Samuel Gompers and others were adjudged guilty of contempt for violating an injunction, and ordered to be confined in the Enited States jail of the District of Columbia for a certain term. Tin. &lt;Tfstice Lamar there said: \u201c'It is not the fact of punishment hut rather its character and purpose that often serve to distinguish between the two classes of eases. If it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and for the benefit of the complainant. But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court. It is true that punishment by imprisonment may be remedial, as well as punitive, and many civil contempt pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>eeedings have resulted not only in the imposition of a fine, payable to the complainant, hut also in committing the defendant to prison. But imprisonment for civil contempt- is ordered where the defendant has refused to do an affirmative act required by the provisions of an order which, either in form or substance, was mandatory in its character. Imprisonment in such cases is inflicted not as punishment, but is\u2019 intended to be remedial by coercing the defendant to do' what he had refused to do. The decree in such cases is that the defendant stand committed unless and until he perforins the affirmative act required by the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u201cFor example: If a defendant should refuse to pay alimony, or to surrender property ordered to be turned to a receiver, or to make a conveyance required by a decree for specific performance, he could be committed until he complied with the order. * * * The order for imprisonment in this class of cases, therefore, is not to vindicate the authority of the law, but is remedial and is intended to coerce the defendant to do the thing required by the order for the benefit of the complainant. If imprisoned, as aptly said in <em>In re Nevitt, </em>117 Fed. Rep. 451, \u2018he carried the keys of his prison in his own pocket.\u2019 lie can end the sentence and discharge himself at any moment by doing what he had previously refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, if the defendant does that which he has been commanded not to do, the disobedience is a thing accomplished. Imprisonment cannot undo or remedy what has been done nor afford any compensation for the pecuniary injury caused by the disobedience. Tf the sentence is limited to imprisonment for a definite period, the defendant is furnished no key, and he cannot shorten his term by promising not to repeat the offense. Such imprisonment operates, not as a remedy coercive in its nature, hut solely as punishment for the completed' act of disobedience. * * * In this case the alleged contempt did not consist in the defendant\u2019s, refusing to do an affirmative act required, but rather in doing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>which had been prohibited. The only possible remedial relief for such disobedience would have been to impose a fine for the use of the complainant, measured in some degree by the pecuniary injury caused by the act of disobedience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In that case the petition in the contempt proceeding contained a prayer for remedial relief, while the court, instead of granting the only remedial relief that could have been given in such a case, namely, a fine payable to the complainant, imposed the punitive sentence of imprisonment appropriate only in a proceeding for criminal contempt, and the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe result was as fundamentally erroneous as if in an action of \u2018A vs. B. for assault and battery\u2019 the judgment entered bad been that the defendant be confined in prison for twelve months.\u201d The Court held that the fact that the petition in the contempt proceeding contained a prayer for remedial relief was a \u201ccontrolling fact\u201d and decisive of the character of proceeding as one in equity for civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Again, in the ease of <em>Re Merchants\u2019 Stock Co., Petitioner, </em>223 U. S. 639, where the petitioners for a writ of mandamus had been adjudged guilty of contempt for violating an interlocutory injunction and ordered to pay certain fines, and the question was whether the order was open to review, the Supreme. Court said: \u201c'The answer turns upon the character of the order. If it was remedial, it was merely interlocutory and reviewable only upon appeal from the final decree, but if it was punitive, it was a final judgment, criminal in its nature, and reviewable upon a writ of error, without awaiting a final decree. Such an order is deemed remedial when its purpose is to indemnify the injured suitor or coercively to secure obedience to a mandate in liia behalf, and is deemed punitive when its purpose is to vindicate the authority of the court by punishing the act of disobedience as a public wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The same distinction between civil and criminal contempts is stated in <em>Staley </em>v. <em>South Jersey Realty Co., </em>83 N. J. Eq. 300, decided in 1914, where the court held that by the'Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>1909 the legislature of New Jersey had given the right of appeal in criminal contempts. Prior to that act, the courts of New Jersey held that an order passed merely to punish the party was not reviewable, the court in <em>Grand Lodge K. P. of New </em>Jersey v. <em>Jansen, </em>62 N. J. Eq. 737, saying: \u201cAs a mere punishment for contemptuous conduct, the order being within tiro jurisdiction of the court of chancery, is not appeal-able, but, so far as it is for the relief of the suitor, it is subject to appeal.\u201d In 7 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of </em>Law, 29, and 13 <em>C. J. </em>7, it is said: \u201cIf the contempt consists in doing a forbidden act, injurious to the opposite party, the contempt- is considered criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The precise question has not been considered or decided by this Court. It appears from the printed report of the early case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Stone et </em>al., 3 H. &amp; McH. 115, that the general court fined the chief justice and associate justice- of the Charles County court for contempt for refusing to obey a writ of certiorari, and that they prayed an appeal to the court of appeals, which the general court refused to- grant. In the syllabus, that case is treated as authority for the statement: \u201cAn appeal does not lie from an order imposing a fine for contempt of court.\u201d Tu the case of <em>Williamson v. Carnan, </em>1. G. &amp; J., 184, the chancellor, on a motion to- dissolve an injunction, ordered that the injunction he continued until final hearing; that the defendant remove obstructions placed on a certain road mentioned in the proceedings, and that he pay a fine of fifty dollars for not obeying the preliminary injunction in the case. Erom this order and other orders in the case, including the order directing the injunction to issue, the defendant appealed, and in overruling a motion to dismiss the appeal Cirra-v JnuGE Bfci-iaxax said: \u201cThe order of the Commissioners of Baltimore County, on the 13th of December, 1827, confirming the report of the commissioners appointed by the levy co-uxt of that county, and directing and authorizing the old road to he shut up, placed the premises over which it formerly run, under the control of the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to whom the land belonged, and gave him the same right of user of the land of that road, that he had of the rest of his estate. And we think that the subsequent, order of the court of chancery, does so materially affect the right and interests of the appellant, as to bring the case within the principle of <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>McKim, </em>heretofore decided by this Court, and form a lit subject of appeal.\u201d The order referred by the- the Court as affecting the material interests of the appellant and being a fit subject of appeal was evidently the order requiring him to remove the fence and other obstructions from the bed of the old road, which land, the Court held, had been restored to him !&gt;y the action of the County Commissioners confirming the report of the commissioners appointed l&gt;y the levy court, and the decision has no bearing upon the question we ar*e here considering. The ease of <em>ex parte Maulsby, </em>13 Md. 625, was a <em>habeas corpus </em>case, and the question of the right of appeal in cases of civil or criminal contempt was not involved. In the case of <em>Longley v. McGeoch, </em>115 Md. 182, the appeal was \u201cfrom a decree of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, making perpetual an injunction previously granted by that Court, and also adjudging both defendants to be guilty of conten\u00ed])! in violating the terms, of the preliminary injunction outstanding, and ordering that the defendant corporation forfeit and pay a fine of one hundred dollars as a penalty for having violated said injunction.\u201d Ko question was made as to the right to review that part of tile decree punishing the defendant for contempt, and Judge Reaboh, speaking for the Court, in affirming the decree, simply said in reference to it: \u201cWe must concur in the action of the Court in this respect also.\u201d In that case, as in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Carnan, supra, </em>the order imposing the punishment for contempt was a part of an order or decree from which there was a right of appeal, and the question whether an appeal lies from an order punishing a party for criminal contempt was not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Applying tlae distinction clearly and forcibly pointed out by the authorities and decisions referred to, and from -which we have quoted, it is clear that the record in this case presents a case of criminal contempt. The offense of which the appellants were adjudged guilty consisted in the doing of an act forbidden by the writ of injunction previously issued, and the sentence or punishment imposed was not remedial, but distinctly punitive. There is nothing in the contempt proceeding set out in the record indicating that the parties treated it as a proceeding in equity for civil contempt; there was no petition praying for remedial relief, the fines were not made payable to the parties injured by the disobedience, and the only purpose of the order imposing the fines was to vindicate the authority of tire court by punishing the act of disobedience. The contempt proceeding must therefore he regarded as independent of the equity ease in which the injunction was granted, and as a proceeding in law for criminal contempt. <em>Matter of Christensen Engineering Co., supra; Bessette </em>v. <em>W. B. Conkey Co., supra; Compers </em>v. <em>Bucks Stove and Range Co., supra. </em>See also <em>Binney\u2019s Case, </em>2 Bland, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">There is no statute in this State expressly providing for appeals in contempt eases, and under the common-law rule, the decision of the general court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stone, supra, </em>and the decisions in a number of other states <em>(People, ex rel. etc. </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>88 N. Y. 626; <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Mass. 443; <em>Grand Lodge, K. P. of New Jersey, </em>v.<em> Jansen et al., supra; Staley </em>v. <em>South Jersey Realty Co., supra), </em>the order appealed from is not subject to review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On the other hand, if we apply the view adopted by tbe Supreme Court of the United States that the question of the right of appeal in cases of criminal contempt must be determined by reference to tbe provisions of our statute providing for appeal in criminal cases, the result would be the same in this case. The section of the Code authorizing appeal in criminal cases is section 80 of article 5, which provides: \u201cThe parties to criminal proceedings shall he entitled to' hills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of exceptions in the same manner as in civil proceedings, and appeals from judgments in criminal casos may be taken in the same manner as in civil cases,\u201d etc. In the case of <em>Mitchell </em>v. State, 82 Md. 527, the Court held that no appeal lies under that section from a judgment or sentence of the court unless there is a bill of exceptions, and said: \u201cBy this act, when an appeal is taken in a criminal case, the proceedings are to be the same as in a civil ease. By the express provisions of the statute law, this Court in a case on the civil side of the docket is prevented from deciding any point or question which does not plainly appeal\u201d by the record to have been tried and decided in the court below. Code, art. 5, sec. 9. The point must be made, and in a ease requiring an exception, a bill of exceptions must be taken.\u201d There are no bills of exception in this case, and if the section of the Code referred to could be held to authorize appeals in cases of criminal contempt, the present appeal would have to be dismissed for the reasons stated in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, supra. </em>There can be no question of the power of the court helow to pass such an order. As said in <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>W. B. Conkey Co., supra, </em>\u201cThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts,\u201d and in <em>Ex parte Maulsby, supra, </em>Judge Bartol said: \u201cA contempt is an offense at common law; it-is not created by the Act of 1853 (Code, sec. 4, art. 26), nor is the jurisdiction to punish it conferred by that act alone. It is an offense against the court, as. an organ of public justice. The right of punishing for contempts by summary conviction is inherent in all courts of justice and legislative assemblies, and is essential for their protection, and existence. It is a branch of the common law, adopted and sanctioned by our State Constitution. <em>Yates\u2019 Case, </em>9 Johns, 417.\u201d But in addition to this inherent power, section 78 of article 16 of the Code provides: \u201cIf any person against whom an injunction has been issued shall violate the same after service thereof, or shall permit or connive at the violation thereof by any other person, the court, on notice of such violation, may issue an attachment for contempt against such person; and if on proof the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>is adjudged guilty of the contempt, he may be fined or imprisoned, or both, in the discretion of the court,\u201d and sections 79, 173 and 190 contain further provisions for the enforcement by courts of equity of their decrees and orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The fact that the writ of injunction was served on Kelly and his wife on a legal holiday did not render the contempt proceedings void <em>(Handy </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>85 Md. 547), and there is no force in the objections that the injunction was not served by the sheriff or depty sheriff of Baltimore City on the 11th of November, 1921, and that Collison was not a party to the injunction suit. The evidence shows, and the court below found that, with knowledge of the injunction, they wilfully violated it. <em>Beseette </em>v. <em>W. B. Conkey Co., supra, </em>14 R. C. L., p. 471, sec. 171; 22 <em>Cyc. </em>1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">If the order appealed from could' be reviewed by this Court, we should not hesitate to affirm it, but it follows from what has been said that the appeal must be dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
