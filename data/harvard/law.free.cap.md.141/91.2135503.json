The record reached this Court on October 15th, 1921. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>and Fred R. Owens, Esq., one of the counsel for the appellant, has filed an affidavit stating that the bill of exceptions was presented to the trial judge at Ohestertown about the 21st of September; that the judge signed the exceptions on the 24th of September, and mailed the bill of exceptions to him at Denton, and that he immediately remailed it to the clerk of the circuit court at Centreville on the 27th of September, 192\u00cd; that he had previously made satisfactory arrangements with the clerk for the payment of the cost of the record, and that it was not possible for the clerk, after receiving the bill of exceptions, to prepare the record and transmit it to this Court within the three months from the date of .the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">As the bills of exception were prepared by the appellant, signed by the trial judge, and filed within the time allowed by the order of the court below, and the appellant had arranged to pay the cost of preparing the record, it cannot be said that the delay in transmitting it to- this Court was due to the appellant or his counsel, and the motion to- dismiss the appeal must therefore be overruled. <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Little, </em>71 Md. 323; <em>Duvall </em>v. <em>Md.

Harrison, co-partners trading as \u201cHarrison\u2019s Nurseries, J. G. Harrison &amp; Sons,' Proprietors,\u201d were large growers and shippers of fruit trees-, fruit, vegetables, &amp;c., with an office at Berlin, in Worcester County, Maryland. The appellant, The Eastern Shore Brokerage and Commission Company, a Maryland corporation, was engaged at Preston, in Caroline County, Maryland, in selling canned goods for packers on commission, and in the summer of 1919 had a contract with Edgar R. Loweree, who was operating a earning factory at Willards, in Wicomico County, Maryland, under the name of the- Willards Canning Company, by which, in consideration of supplying the canning company with cans and other materials, the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>janf was to receive tlie entire pack of the canning company for sale for a commission of five per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">On August 12th or 18th, 1919, the canning company, through the son of Edgar R. Loweree, applied to the appellees for several \u201ctruck loads or more\u201d of peaches, and was. referred to G. L\u00edale Harrison, the treasurer and sales manager of the appellees. Mr. Harrison told him that, as the canning company was a new concern, he could not let him have the peaches unless the company deposited the money to pay for same or gave the appellees a satisfactory \u201cguarantee.\u201d Mr. Loweree said that the canning company \u201cwas closely affiliated with the Eastern Shore Brokerage and Commission Company at Preston,\u201d of which Mr. Walter M. Wright was president and James A. Colbert was sales manager, and Mr. Harrison replied that he had never heard of the brokerage company, hut did know \u201cWalter M. Wright personally,\u201d and that if he, Mr. Loweree, could make proper arrangements with the brokerage company the appellees \u201cwould try to do some business with Mm.\u201d The following day the appellees received a telephone call from the brokerage company at Preston and, when Mr. G. Hale Harrison answered the call, he was told that it was the brokerage company and that Mr. Colbert was speaking. In the telephone conversation that followed, Mr. Colbert, after learning from Mr. Harrison what the appellees had to sell, told him that the brokerage company was interested in the canning company, and in pnrchasdng \u201craw materials\u201d (fruit, &amp;c.) for the canning company; .that the brokerage company had the exclusive right to sell the pack of the canning company, and wanted to get fruit, &amp;c., for the canning company to pack so as to increase the sales of the brokerage company, and wanted the appellees to furnish fruit to the canning company. At the close of the telephone conversation, Mr. Harrison asked Mr. Colbert to have the brokerage company confirm his statements by letter, and accordingly, on the 14th of August, 1919, the appellees received the following letter from the brokerage company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u201cThe Eastern.

A. Colbert, Mgr. of Sales.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-17\">Relying upon this letter of the brokerage company, the appellees, from August 14th to October 3rd, 1919, sold the canning company peaches, apples- and pears to the value of $4,952.73, and mailed to the brokerage company, on the day of shipment or delivery, a copy of the bill of each sale of such fruit. On August 23rd and October 15th, 1919, the appellees received checks to the amount of $1,510 on account of the fruit sold the canning company, leaving\u2019 a balance due of $3,442.73. The fruit canned by the canning company was, by direction of the brokerage company, shipped by the canning company to the Terminal Warehouse in Baltimore^ and the receipts for same turned over to the brokerage company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and was still \u201cin storage\u201d in the warehouse at the time of the mal in the court below. After repeated demands, on the canning company and the brokerage company for payment of the balance due, this suit was instituted by the appellees against the brokerage company in the Circuit Court for Caroline County, and was subsequently removed to the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County for (rial. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The <em>narr. </em>contains the common counts in assumpsit and a special count on the contract contained in the letter of August 14tli, 1919, and the only pleas filed by the defendant were \u201cnever was indebted as alleged\u201d and \u201cnever promised as alleged.\u201d During the trial, which resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs, the defendant reserved twenty-eight exceptions, all of which are to rulings of the court on the evidence, except the twenty-eighth, which is to the granting of plaintiffs\u2019 second prayer, the rejection of the defendant\u2019s nine prayers, and the overruling of defendant\u2019s special exception to plaintiffs\u2019 second prayer. As the special exception is not in the record it will not be necessary to refer to it again.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Til their brief filed in this Court, counsel for the appellant say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cThe record contains twenty-eight bills of exception \u2014 twenty-seven being taken to rulings on the evidence, and one to rulings on the prayers. (Nevertheless, the main questions involved are few and simple. They may be classified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201c(1) The question of the construction of Colbert\u2019s letter, <em>i. a., </em>whether it was ever intended to create a legal guarantee without restriction, qualification or limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201c(2) The question whether the alleged guarantee, if it was given, was <em>ultra vires </em>of the defendant corporation, and, so, unenforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\u201c(3) The question whether Colbert acted within the scope of his authority, as agent of the defendant, in giving the alleged guarantee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u201c(4) The question whether evidence offered by tbe appellant bearing upon the scope of Colbert\u2019s authority ought not to have been received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201c(5) The question whether notice of sales to Willard\u2019s Canning Company mailed to defendant was sufficient, though never received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">1. Taking up these several questions in the order suggested by the appellant, we find no support in the letter itself, or in the circumstances under which it was written, to warrant the contention of the appellant that it was not intended as an \u201cabsolute guarantee beyond the 1,000 baskets\u201d of peaches mentioned in the first paragraph. The language of the second paragraph is equally as explicit. \u201cWe will see that you are paid for any goods you sell them\u201d is a clear, definite and unambiguous statement of the undertaking of the appellant in reference to \u201cany goods\u201d the appellees might sell the canning company. It is conceded by counsel for the appellant that the words quoted, if they stood alone, would \u201cbe sufficient to indicate an intention to assume the obligation of a general guarantor,\u201d and we think that when they are read in connection with the rest of the letter any possible doubt as to their meaning is removed. The first paragraph of the letter refers only to the 1,000 baskets of peaches, which Mr. Loweree\u2019s son had tried to purchase a day or two before, and if the appellant had intended to confine its obligation to those peaches there would have been no occasion to refer to other sales to the canning company. But what the appellant desired was to secure from the appellees the fruit needed by the canning company for its factory, and which the appellees had refused to furnish without a deposit to cover the price, or a satisfactory \u201cguarantee\u201d of payment, and it was to meet that requirement of the appellees that the second paragraph of the letter was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">2. The second question stated by counsel for the appellant is not presented by the record in this case. The special count in the <em>na/rr. </em>is upon the contract contained in the letter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>August 14th, 1919, which is set out in the declaration, and the only pleas filed by the defendant were, as we have said, \u201cnewer indebted as alleged\u201d and \u201cnever promised as alleged.\u201d It is said in 10 <em>Cyc. </em>1156, \u201cThe defense of <em>ultra, vires </em>is special and is not. available under a general denial, but must be specially pleaded and proved.\u201d This rule, to the extent of requiring the defense to be pleaded specially, was approved in <em>Conouringo Land Co. </em>v. <em>McGaw, </em>124 Md. 653, where Onikk Judge Boyd said: \u201cThe general rule seems, to be well estaidished that the defense of <em>ultra vires </em>must be pleaded specially,\u201d and many authorities in support of the rule are cited in <em>Hagerstown Brew. Co. </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>117 Md. 348, where this Court quotes from .10 <em>Cyc. </em>1155 the statement'of Judge Seymouk 1). Thompson* that, \u201cA general presumption of right-acting attends corporation*\u00bb, the effect of which is to placo the burden of proving that a. contract Annie or an act doin' by a corporation was <em>ultra vires </em>upon liim who alleges that fact as the foundation of his action or defense.\u201d While in the. case of <em>Hagerstown Brew. Co. </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>the Court was careful to say that it was not \u201cto bo understood as holding that, in every case, regardless of the nature of the contract or the character of the corporation, the act of the Corporation relied on will bo presumed to be within its corporate powers,\u201d in the case at bar, where the contract sued on avus made to promote the business of the appellant and for its benefit, and, where the defense of <em>ultra vires </em>was not pleaded specially, and the certificate of incorporation of the appellant was not offered in evidence, we cannot hold that the appellant had no power to make the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">3. In reference to the third question, it would seem only necessary to refer to tlie evidence produced by the plaintiffs., which show\u2019s that, while on the stationery of the appellant Mr. 'Colbert, atcis represented to be tlie \u201cmanager of sales\u201d and Mr. Walter M. Wright, the president of the appellant, the entire miaimgement and actual .conduct of the business of the appellant was. intrusted to Mr. Colbert, who received and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>answered all communications with the appellant; who conducted negotiations for the* purchase of materials and fruit for canning factories represented by the appellant, and who, in a number of other instances, entered into a similar contract on behalf of the appelant guaranteeing payment for such fruit and materials. \u25a0 This evidence also- shows that the contract in suit was made fon* the benefit of the appellant, and to promote -the business in which it was engagpd; that the appellant, in pursuance of its contract with the canning; company, received the output of the canning company\u2019s factory, or it pack, for the year 1919, whjch included the fruit purchased from \u25a0Hie .appellees, and which was \u00a9till in the possession of the appellant, or in the warehouse subject to- its order, at the time of the trial in the court below. In 14A <em>C. J. </em>359, it is said: \u201cUnless lii-s authority is specially restricted, the authority and power of a general or managing officer or agent are co-extensive with the powers: of the corporation itself, and he lias authority -to- do any act on its behalf which is usual and necessary in the ordinary course of the company\u2019s business, or which ho is held out to- the- public as having authority to do, and may exercise all the powers which the bo-ard of directors could exercise or authorize under the same circumstances in the general management o-f the corporation business.\u201d In the case of <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>101 Md. 442, the Court said: \u201cThe witness Owens * * * testified without contradiction that Lee the president and Kohler the secretary and treasurer were the active mlanagprs o-f the company and transacted all of its business that was not referred to the board o-f directors' who- mot but once a mo-nth. Those two gentlemen conducted on behalf of the Trust Company the entire transaction, with Turner touching his subscription for the stock o-f the-Insurance Qomp-any and the carrying of that stock for \u00a1him. After Turner had assigned his insurance stock to the Trust Company it caused that stock to be transferred to its own broker and afterwards to its treasurer and twice raised money on it for its own use, in one instance at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>with the authority of its board of directors. These facts especially when they were met with no explanation on the part of Lee or Kohler or the Trust Company were properly to he considered by the jury in determining whether in fact Lee and Kohler as officers of that company had authority to accept the 150 shares of insurance stock from Turner in satisfaction of his note and also whether their transactions in that connection were not subsequently adopted by the Trust Company.\u201d In the case of <em>Buchwald Transfer Co. </em>v. <em>Hurst, </em>111 Md. 577, Chief Judge Boyd said: \u201cDirectors may make themselves liable for such neglect, but courts should not be too ready to relieve corporations from the results of such neglect under such circumstances as we have in this ease, as innocent persons are likely to be made to suffer, if corporations can permit officers to exercise such control over their affairs as an individual does over his own, and then, if disaster comes, escape from liability by denying the authority of the officers to do the very thing they had been permitting them to do, or such things as would lead the public to believe they had the right to do,\u201d and in the more recent case of <em>Hagerstown Brew. Co. </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>where the suit was on two contracts of the brewing company, executed in its name by an agent acting as its president and general manager, endorsed on and guaranteeing the payment of two single bills of one Kurtz in favor of the plaintiff, the Court, after quoting with approval the statement, in 2 <em>Thompson on Corporations </em>(2nd Ed.), sec. 157G: \u201cThe governing- principle with reference to the general power of a manager is that where he has the actual charge and management of the business, by the appointment, or with the knowledge of the directors, the corporation will be bound by bis acts which are necessary or incident in the course of the business, without other evidence of actual authority,\u201d then said: \u201cThe contract. sued on' was executed in the name of the appellant by its president and general manager, and for the purpose of promoting the very business for which the company was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>corporated, and in which it was engaged. It was not made to assist Kurtz, or to advance any private interest of the agent of the company, but was executed in order to accomplish the end for which the company was organized, and the appellant received the benefit of it. The entire management and conduct of the business were apparently intrusted by the directors to the president and general manager of the company, and we think the contract in question, having for its only purpose and object the sale of the beer of the company, was dearly within his implied authority.\u201d So in the case now under consideration, the contract in question was made in the name of the appellant by one who was not only its \u201cmanager of sales,\u201d but the one to whom was intrusted the entire management and conduct of the business of the appellant. It was not made to assist the canning\u201d company, or to advance the private interest of Mr. Colbert, but only for the purpose of promoting the very business in which <em>the </em>appellant was engaged, and the appellant received and retained the benefit of it. There being no question in the case as to the power of the appellant to make the contract, we must hold upon the evidence referred to that it was clearly within the implied authority of the agent who executed it in the name of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">4. The evidence referred to in the fourth question stated in the appellant\u2019s brief is embraced in the nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh hills of exception. All of these bills of exception, except the twenty-second, twenty-third, twenty-fourth and twenty-sixth, embrace a number of rulings on tbe evidence, and under the well settled rule requiring each ruling on the evidence to he made the subject of a separate exception, they will not be considered. Ju<em>nkins </em>v. Sullivan, 110 Md. 589; <em>Ballo. &amp; Ohio R. Co. </em>v. Rueter, 114 Md. 687; <em>Hagerstown Brew. Co. </em>v. Gates, <em>supra. </em>The twenty-second exception is to tire refusal of the court to permit the witness to answer the following question: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>'Air. Jarrell, as a director and member of tlie executive committee, state, if you know, what authority, if any, Mr. Colbert bad to bind or make liable Tbe Eastern Shore Brokerage &amp; Commission Company as a guarantor or a surety for others.\u201d Tf this question was intended, as its form indicates, to elicit ihe opinion of tbe witness, it was clearly inadmissible, and if it was asked for the purpose of showing what authority was conferred on Mr. Colbert by the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the appellant, it was not less objectionable, because the certificate of incorporation or tlie by-laws themselves were tbe best evidence of what they contained, and because it is impossible for persons dealing with those who are given general management of the business of a corporation to know in what way their authority is limited by by-laws or private instructions. <em>Equitable Endow. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>71 Md. 430; <em>Hagerstown Brew. Co. </em>v. <em>Gates, suqmi. </em>Tbe twenty-third exception was to the refusal of the court to permit the same witness to state what the duties of a \u201csales manager of a brokerage house\u201d were. The question was objectionable because there was no evidence to show that the witness was qualified to answer the question, and because Mr. Colbert was not only \u201cmanager of sales\u201d but was also intrusted with tbe general management of tbe business of the appellant. The question asked Mr. Payne in the twenty-fourth exception was likewise objectionable because Mr. Colbert\u2019s duties and authority was not, as we have said, limited to the duty and authority of a \u201csales manager.\u201d The question objected to in the twenty-sixth exception was. answered by tbe witness, and the appellant got the benefit of his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">5. The fifth and only other question raised and discussed in appellant\u2019s brief, is whether the mailing of notices of sales to the canning company was a compliance with the contract, the defendant having offered evidence tending to show that the notices were not received by it. Tbe appellant ivelies upon tbe statement in 21 <em>Am. Eng. Ency. of Lato </em>(2nd Ed.), \u00d382, note 1: \u201cWhere the giving of notice is a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>tion precedent to </em>liability under a contract, the notice contemplated is actual, and this requirement is not met by merely mailing a statement of the fact to be communicated, where a receipt of the letter is denied by the party to he charged. In such a case it-must he shown that the notice was received.\u201d But we do not, think the letter from the appellant to the appellees can he construed as requiring actual notice of sales to the canning company, as \u201ca condition precedent to liability\u201d of tire appellant. The appellant had other means of knowing what fruit was being purchased by the canning company from the appellees, and if it had intended to make its obligation conditional <em>upon </em>actual notice from the appellees, it would have so stated in definite terms instead of saying, \u201cbut we would like you to keep us advised as to the quantity and the amounts so that we can keep' some check on what they are doing.\u201d There was no attempt to show, and it is not claimed, that the appellant suffered any loss in consequence of its failure to receive the notices mailed to it by the appellees, nor is there anything in the letter, or in the circumstances under which it Avas written, to indicate that any other or different method of notifying the appellant was contemplated by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">This disposes of all the questions raised by counsel for the appellant in their brief. The other exceptions to rulings of the court on the evidence and to its action on the prayers were not pressed in this Court, except to the extent that they were covered by the several questions we have already discussed and disposed of. We have carefully examined these exceptions, however, and do not find reversible error in any of them. Notwithstanding the evidence to which Ave have referred Avas uncontradicted, and, as we have said, brought the contract sued on within the implied authority of Air. Colbert, the defendant\u2019s first and second prayers sought to withdraw the case from the jury, while the others, except the ninth, asked the court to instruct the jury that the burden was on the plaintiffs to show that Air. Colbert, in writing the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>of August 14th, acted within the scope of his authority, or that his action in the matter was subsequently ratified by the defendant, and that unless they found that he was acting within the scope of his authority, or that his action was subsesequently ratified by the defendant, their verdict should be for the defendant. The first and second prayers were, therefore, clearly objectionable, and in view of the effect of the evidence we have mentioned, the others would have been mis*leading. Tbe defendant\u2019s ninth prayer was based upon the view that its obligation was confined to the one thousand baskets of peaelies mentioned in the first paragraph of the letter, and is disposed of by what we have said in discussing the first question raised by counsel for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Finding no reversible error in any of the rulings of the court below, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
