Dove, against the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Baltimore City, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore and the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company, under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, for damages to the equitable plaintiffs arising out of the death of the lmsband and father, caused, as they allege, by the negligence of the defendants in permitting a live electric wire \u201cto bo and remain suspended in a. dangerous condition exposed to contact with pedestrians\u201d upon one of the highways o-f Baltimore City, to wit: Pratt Street, near the northeast corner of Pratt and Schroeder Streets,, with which the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent came in contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The suit was dismissed as to tlie Chesapeake and Potomac \"Telephone Company, and at the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony the case was withdrawn from the jury as to both of the remaining defendants on demurrers to the evidence, the court instructing the jury, at the city\u2019s request, that there was no evidence under the pleading's legally sufficient to entitle plaintiffs to recover against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore; and, at the request of the Oonsolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company, that negligence on the jiart of the deceased directly caused tlio injury complained of, and the verdict must therefore lie for said company.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Plaintiffs conceded the prayer offered in behalf of the city, but excepted to the granting of the prayer in bolialf (4 the appellee, and from that ruling this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">ATo other exceptions were reserved, so the record <em>presents </em>but a single question, viz: Was the conduct of the deceased of such a reckless character that the Court must declare him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>to </em>have been guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law? Or were tbe circumstances such as to leave room for a difference of opinion among reasonable men as to whether be was justified in taking the risk he took ?</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Ao citation of authority is needed to support the proposition, recognized by decisions everywhere, that where the acts ' relied upon to constitute contributory negligence are such that reasonable minds may differ as <em>to </em>their quality, the question .should be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">On a Sunday afternoon Edwin H. Dove, while taking a walk with a friend, noticed that an electric wire of appellee had fallen from a pole line on Pratt Street near Schroeder Street. The wire had fallen in the form of a loop and extended for some distance in and over the gutter, with the ends caught mad entangled with the other ovea*haiaging wires, or in the branches of trees. The insulatiooi was off of part of the wire, and at one point, where it rested iia the gutter, it was sparkling and sputteriaig. A number of \"children were playing on tbe sidewalk in close proxiaaiitv to tbe wire and were poking at it with sticks. At the time Dove uaadei'took to paash or throw the wire into the street the spaikling seems to have ceased. Dove said, according to one of the witnesses, \u201cthem children might be in the way, you see it is not loaded, hut if that wire comes dowia, tangles up and falls on them it might hurt them.\u201d The podaat where the wire had been .sparkliaag was \u201cabout 10 feet or about 12 feet\u201d from where Dove shoved the wire off. \u201cThere were children right around the point where the wire was spluttering.\u201d Dove waved them back aaad undertook to push the wire away from thean iiato the street, and was instantly electrocuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Whatever may be thought about the danger involved in this act, it cannot be said that one coaald know iia advance that it would result iia the death of the man attempting it. Certainly he did not anticipate that result, as there is nothing to indicate that he contemplated suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>It did not follow, necessarily, that because the insulation was defective at the point where the sparkling had been observed, the wire was unprotected at the point where Dove stood, ten or twelve feet a.way. Tt was about five o\u2019clock in the evening and growing' dark. So that while- some of the witnesses noticed bad insulation in places one might easily have failed to observe it. Of course, under ordinary circumstances, and witb time for consideration, prudence would have dictated a careful examination of the wire before attempting' to handle it with naked hands. But the conditions existing there appeared to Dove to require immediate action-lie evidently was moved to do as he did by what be regarded as the necessity of the occasion, if the children were to be protected against a grave and impending danger to their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We think the question of contributory negligence should have been submitted to tlie jury, on the authority of the cases of <em>Maryland Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Marney, </em>88 Md. 482, and <em>American Express Co. </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>126 Md. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In the <em>Mamey f\u00edase, supra, </em>J ledge Pearce cites with approval <em>Tierce on Railroads, </em>328, where it is said: \u201cThe fact that the injured person did some act by which he incurred or increased danger, does not necessarily involve negligence which will prevent recovery, <em>where the danger ivas created by some wrongful act of the company. </em>The question is for the jury whether he acted from wrongheadedness, or as a prudent man would have done under the circumstances.'\u2019 Also from <em>Teach on Contributory Negligence, </em>sec. 42 : \u201cWhen one risks his life, or places himself in a position of great danger in an effort to save the life of another, or to- protect another who- is exposed to a sudden peril, or in danger of great bodily harm, such exposure and risk for such purpose is not negligence.\u201d Also the following cases: <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>L. I. R. Co., </em>43 N. Y. 502; <em>Pa. Co. </em>v. <em>Langenderf, </em>48 Ohio St. 316; <em>Gibney </em>v. <em>The State, </em>137 N. Y. 1; <em>Linnehan </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>126 Mass. 506; <em>Pa. Co. </em>v. <em>Roney, </em>89 Ind. 453; <em>Donahoe </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>83 Mo. 563: <em>Condiff </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>45 Kan. 269; <em>Coltrill </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>R. R. Co., </em>47 Wis. 634; <em>Peyton v. Ry. Co., </em>41 La. Ann. 862. See also a more recent case: <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>International Ry. Co., </em>232 N. Y. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In <em>American Express Co. </em>v. <em>Terry, supra,, </em>Judgk Bukick, in delivering the opinion of this Court, gave the rule in such cases and the reason on which it is based, quoting with approval from <em>Mobile &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Ridley, </em>114 Tenn. 727, and <em>Bracy </em>v. <em>North Western Improvement Co., </em>41 Mont. 338, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cThe well established rule is, as laid down in the reported cases., that a person who incurs danger and is injured or' killed in attempting to save human life is not guilty of contributory negligence, unless his conduct is such as to amount to rashness entailing almost certain injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cThe rule rests upon the principle that it is commendable to save life, and, though a person attempting to save it voluntarily exposes himself to danger, the law will not readily impute to him responsibility for an injury received while doing so. In such case the incurring of the danger is not <em>per se </em>negligence, and the question whether there, was contributory negligence is ordinarily to be answered by the jury upon proof of the circumstances surrounding the attempt to rescue \u2014 such as the alarm, excitement and confusion usually present, the uncertainty as to the means, to be employed, the promptness required, and the liability to err in the exercise of judgment as to the best course to pursue \u2014 and great latitude of judgment must be allowed to one who&gt; is impelled by the dictates of humanity to decide and act in the face of emergencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The cases cited by appellee are not in point, because in those cases no one appears to have been in immediate danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and. new trial avjarded, with co\u00e9ts to appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
