J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHX\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The Baltimore Trust Company and Clarence C. Pusey were, on the 14th of July, 1920, appointed receivers, by the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, of the Hess Steel Corporation. A petition was filed by Timothy A. Canty on the 17th of September, 1920, praying that the court pass an order declaring that he is entitled to preferred payment of the sum of $1,464.99 for work done by him, and commissions earned as a salesman of that corporation, within a period of three months prior to the appointment of receivers, or after said date, and authorizing and directing the receivers to make said payment out of the first money coming into their hands and available for such purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Hr. Canty was employed on November 15, 1919, on a salary of $3,600 per annum plus a commission, which at first was to be two per cent, on tool steel sales and, when other salesmen were engaged, the commission was to be graded downward until a minimum of one per cent, was readied. He was to devote his time to securing tool steel business, and for the first year or so a considerable percentage of his time was to he spent in the field. His traveling expenses were to be paid by the company witb the understanding that a nominal maximum would he allowed. His salary was paid monthly, $300 on the first of each month, his traveling expenses were paid weekly on submission of an expense account, and bis commissions on sales were to be paid monthly \u2014 on the first of the month following the actual receipt of the money hy the corporation, or, as he said, the commissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>became clue to him \u201con payment of the invoices by the customers.\u201d He stopped work for the company on July 23, 1920, that being the date he heard that receivers had been appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Schedule B, filed in the ease, shows Mr. Canty\u2019s claims to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">(1) Commissions on orders for goods delivered between April 14th and July 14th, 1920, and paid to the company between said dates ..........,................ $195.63</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">(2) Commissions on orders for goods delivered between those dates, and paid for to the receivers after July 14th, 1920... 52.87</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0z\">(3) Commissions on orders for goods delivered by the receivers after July 14th, 1920, and paid for to them after said date..............\".................. 910.78</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">The lower court passed a decree on the 20th of September, 1921, directing the receivers to pay what we have marked above (1) and (2), with interest from July 14th, 1920, as preferred claims under the provisions of article 47, section 15 of the Code, and also what we have marked (3), stating that \u201csaid payment to be charged by said receivers as a part of the expense incurred by them in and about- their operation and management of said Hess Steel Corporation under the order\u201d previously passed by the court in regard to the operation and management of the company as a going concern. The order of the court also directed the receivers to pay commissions on orders for goods which at the time of the hearing had not been accepted and filled by the receivers, but the court was informed that they would be \u2014 they to be allowed on such orders as the receivers accepted and filled, which were estimated in the order to be approximately $225.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">Charles O. Rowe, on December 22, 1920, filed a petition similar to the one of Canty, and the lower court, on September 20, 1921, passed a decree directing the receivers to pay to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(a) Commissions due said Rowe on orders for goods delivered by the Hess Company before April 14th, 1920, and paid for between that date and July 14th,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">1920............................... $99.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">(b) Commissions due Rowe on orders for goods delivered by the company between April 14th, 1920, and July 14th, 1920,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">and paid for between said dates........ 561.61</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">(c) Commissions due Rowe on orders for goods delivered by the company between those dates, and paid for after July 14th,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">1920.......................... 718.24</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">Those three were allowed as preferred claims under article 47, section 15, and interest was to be paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">(d) Commissions due said Rowe on orders</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">for goods delivered by the receivers and paid for to said receivers, said payments to he charged as a part of the expenses incurred by the receivers in and about their operation and management of said company under the order of court previously passed....................... 919.12</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">(e) Commissions on certain orders to the company which had not been accepted and filled by the receivers at the time of hearing, hut the court is informed that they contemplated filling said orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">(They were to he charged as part of expenses incurred by the receivers, and allowed when paid to the receivers) .... 3,017.97</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Rowe entered the employ of the Hess Company on October 1st, 1917, as a salesman to. secure orders for steel. His territory covered a part of the State of Pennsylvania, part of New Jersey and later all of Maryland. He received a salary of three thousand dollars a year, payable monthly, and his commissions began April 1st, 1918. He received no cornmis.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>sions until the company had been paid for the steel sold and shipped. The commissions were from one-half of one per cent, to five per cent., according to the kind of steel sold. We have thus stated the claims of the two, as most of the questions are applicable to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The first question we will determine is whether', under section 15 of article 47, commissions can be allowed as a preferred claim. That section provides that, in case of an assignment by any person or body corporate for the benefit of creditors, or an adjudication of insolvency, or the property or estate of sucia person or body corporate is takeaa possessioia of by a receiver uaader a decree of a court of equity,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cin the distribution of the property or estate of such person or body corporate, all the money due and owing from such person or body corporate for wages or salaries to clerks, servants, salesmen or employees contracted not more than there months anterior to the execution of such assignment, adjudication of insolvency, or appointment' of receiveaq shall first be.paid in full out of such property or estate, after payment of the proper and legitimate costs, expenses, taxes and commissions, and shall be preferred to all claims against the property and estate of such insolvent person or body corporate, except the lien claims of such persons as shall hold liens upon such prop-ea\u2019ty or estate, recorded at least three months prior to such assignment, adjudication or decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">That sectioaa of the 'Code is referred to as it now staiads, but by the Act of 1896, ch. 184, the word \u201csalesmen\u201d was added, being in other respects as it was in the Code of 1888. It will be observed that the statute was not changed as to the purpose for which the money was due and owing wheaa the word \u201csalesmen\u201d was inserted, but it continued, and is still \u201call the money due aaad owiiag from such person or body corporate for wages or salaries.\u201d It is contended that, if it had been intended to give a claim for commissions priority, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>would lmvc* boon so stated, but if it was only intended to give salesmen who are employed on salaries, without commissions the benefit of the law, is it. not as reasonable to suppose that flie Legislature would have so said ?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In 1 ho Bankruptcy Act of July 1st, 1898, sec. (&gt;4~b, this provision is made: \u201cWages due to workmen, clerks, traveling or eilv salesmen or servants, which have been earned within three' months before the commencing of the proceeding,\u201d etc., shall be preferred \u2014 the words \u201ctraveling or city salesmen\u201d having been inserted by amendment in 1900. In <em>Re New England Thread Co., </em>154 Fed. 742, the district judge said: \u201cA right, to priority being given to persons performing service's of a certain character, the priority depends upon tin* diameter of the service's, ratlu'r than upon the particular mode of payment. As it is a familiar fact that the compensation of traveling or city salesmen is often given in the form of a e'ommissiein upem the' amount of sales, the term 'wages,' upem a proper construction of the amemeleel act, is broad enough to include commissions for services as salesmen.\u201d In <em>Re New England Thread Co., </em>158 Fed. 788, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the First Circuit held that the party before' the court uarneel Barden was a traveling salesman, and the wages inelueled cennpensation for services rendered, for which he was a poemmission. In <em>Re Fink, </em>163 Fed. 135, if. was held, epmfing from the syllabus for convenience!, \u201cCommissions paid a traveling salesman for his sen-vices are 'wages\u2019 within the meaning erf the Bankruptcy Act, July 1, 1898, ch. 541, sec. 64-b (4), 30 Stat. 5(53, and a claim for such eemmiissiems earne'd within threw memths prior to flu* bankruptcy of the employer is entitled to priority thereunder.\u2019\u2019 hi 4 <em>Words and Phrases, </em>under the word \u201cwages\u201d the same rule is announced and the; above cases are referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In <em>Hamburger v. Corn, </em>157 Pa. 133, 27 Atl. 681, a statute was being eonstrued which provided \u201cthat the wages of\" any laborer or the salary of any person in public or private employuK-nt shall not be liable to attachment in the bands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the employer/\u2019 and it was said by Justice. McOollum: \u201cThe miner who is paid by the ton, \"the mechanic who- is paid by the piece, and the clerk or salesman who is paid by commissions on his sales are as much within its protection as if they were paid by the day, week, month or year. A wholesale merchant employs two persons to travel over the country, and obtain from the retail dealers orders for his goods. To one of them he pays a certain sum per month, and to the other he pays commissions on the amount of orders taken. These commissions are as clearly compensation of the employee for personal services in the interest and for the benefit of the employer as the monthly stipend is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Our predecessors in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Heaney, </em>14 Md. 558, in construing a statute which provided \u201cthat no attachment of the wages or hire of a laborer or other employee, in the hands of the employers, whether private individuals or bodies corporate, shall affect any salary or wages of the debtor which are not actually due at the date of the attachment,\u201d held that Quinlan, the debtor, was an employee and that the five per cent, compensation mentioned in the contract was \u201cwages or hire\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We are of the opinion that the fact that part or all of the claims of these claimants are for commissions does not place them in a worse position than they would have been if they had only received salaries. It certainty would be difficult to make a logical distinction between two cases, in one of which the claimant was to get a salary and in the other he was to be paid for the same kind of services by commissions, and hold that one would have the benefit of the statute and the other would not. We have not overlooked what was said in <em>Casualty Ins. Co. Case, </em>82 Md. 535, 567, and <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ebie, </em>85 Md. 181, 186, about <em>Moore\u2019s </em>Case, and we realize that the statute then being construed was a different one from the one now before us, but the Oourt in those two cases said nothing which prevents us from giving the meaning we do to the term \u201cwages,\u201d inasmuch as we now have in section 15 of article 17 the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201csalesmen\u201d as well as the other classes which were in it when those cases were determined. It is known by everybody that a large portion of salesmen are paid at least in part by commissions, and we would not be justified in holding that a salesman who only received a salary could have a priority under the statute, but one who received a salary plus commissions, or simply commissions for the same services, could' not have the priority. When the Legislature amended the law by including salesmen and did not add anything to the terms \u201cwages or salaries,\u201d it must have been because it was believed that those terms were sufficient to protect salesmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The further question for our consideration is whether the term \u201csalesmen\u201d can be properly applied to these two parties, within the meaning of the statute. There would seem to be no reason why it should not be for Air. Canty, as be was, we think, unquestionably a salesman within the meaning of the statute. So far as Mr. Rowe is concerned, while perhaps not so clear, we think he was also such a salesman. Mr. Quinn, assistant treasurer of the company, who was called as a witness by the receivers, testified that Air. Rowe\u2019s, duties were \u201cto solicit orders for steel of any kind that the company could manufacture\u201d; that \u201cthe salesmen did not adjust claims\u201d; that Mr. Rowe was a \u201cdistrict representative] \u2014 that means the representative of the company located in a specific district to solicit orders for the corporation.\u201d Rowe was not entitled to any commissions until the company had filled the orders he sent it and had been paid for them. Although ho might have been entitled to commissions on any sales made in his territory by another salesman, there is no evidence that there were any such, and if there had been, that would not have made any difference. As was said in <em>Re New England Thread Co., </em>154 Fed. 743: \u201cAlthough in a letter to the trade the petitioner was designated \u2018special representative/ and although he hired an office and displayed a sign with the words \u2018special representative/ he had no general authority, and was a representative merely in the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>goods.\u201d Row\u00a9 being a district representative did not mean more, he acted under the direction of his employer, the orders wore subject to approval by bis employer, the corporation fixed the lowest prices at which the steel could be sold, no commissions would he paid on sales below the prices fixed, and they could only be made upon direct authorization of the manager of the sales department. It is a very different case from <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Barr, </em>120 Md. 91, as it was shown in that case that Barr\u2019s \u201cservices required the exercise of business judgment and executive ability of a higher grade than that usually required of clerks, employees or salesmen,\u201d which was not so with Rowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Having concluded that the commissions received by these parties were included in the term \u201cwages\u201d and that they were salesmen within the meaning of that term, it remains to determine which of their claims are covered by the statute. The first, filing to l&gt;e determined in that connection is the moaning of \u201call of the money due and owing\u201d as used in the statute. In 19 <em>Corpus Juris, 81</em>8, it is said that the meaning of the word \u201cdue\u201d seems to be influenced largely by the connection in which it is used, and that no general rule can be safely stated from, the decisions of the courts. Hi the notes on pages 818 to 822, inclusive, of that volume, numerous oases arc cited, giving the interpretation of the courts, amongst others <em>Feeser </em>v. <em>Feeser, </em>93 Md. 716, where we, quoted 10 Amer. <em>&amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, </em>277, that \u201cthe word blue\u2019 lias a variety of meanings, depending on the connection in which it is used.\u201d The question in that case- was, whether the instrument- before the court was binding on the estate of a testator. We quoted from <em>Corer </em>v. <em>Stem., </em>67 Md. 449, where it. was said that \u201cthere must be terms employed to create a <em>debittim in present\u00ed, </em>though the <em>solrendum </em>may be <em>in futuro </em>and even after the death of the obligor. It would seem to be clear that the relation of debtor and creditor must be created and subsist in the lifetime of the parties to the instrument, though the time of payment may be deferred until after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the death of one of flu' parties.\" As shown in those and other eases in this State, unless tin- instrument created a <em>delrUiun in \u25a0prcnenli, </em>it was a mere testamentary paper and not binding as a debt on the (\u2018state of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In this ease it is shown, indeed testified to by the claimants, that the company owed them nothing until the goods were shipped and the money was actually collected. In other words, the relation of debtor and creditor did not exist until that time, and, if the company refused to ship the goods, the salesman had no claim whatever against the company, and in no (went had a claim until the money-was collected. It seems chair, therefore, that this statute only gave a preference to such claims as wen* actually binding as debts, contracted not more than three months anterior to the appointment of receivers. It must be remembeied that we are considering the question of preference under the statute, and not that of whether an indebtedness arose after the receivers wen appointed. There was no debt due for commissions on sales of goods not paid for by tin customers to the company before the receivers were appointed, and in dealing with a statute of this kind, involving tlie question of preferences, receipts of tin money by the receivers for goods sold by the company could not be made to relate back to the time they were sold, or (\u201cven shipped. This is not a ease where the company was indebted to a member nf one of the classes named in the statute for wages or-salary before the receivers were appointed, and payment of tlie indebtedness was simply postponed, covering a period during which receivers were appointed, and hence we need not determine whether under those circumstances a preference could be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">It results from our conclusions that only the commissions in what we have marked (1), on orders for goods delivered between April 14th and July 14th, 1920, ear \u2018be allowed under the statute to Mr. Canty as a preference, to wit $195.(PI, if that be the correct amount, which we are assuming it to he for the purpose of the opinion, and what we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>marked (a) and (1&gt;) in Mr. Rowe\u2019s claims, to wit: $99.10 on orders for goods delivered by the company before April 14th, 1920, and paid for between that date and July 14th, 3920, and $501.61 for goods delivered and paid for between those dates, assuming them, as we did above, to be correctly stated, for the purposes of this opinion. We allow (a) because the indebtedness of the company to- Rowe did accrue between those dates and did not accrue before, or after.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">There is in our judgment no foundation for the claims of either of them, as preferences, fox the commissions on amounts received by the receivers in and as a part of their management and operation of the business of the company, which was authorized by the court to be continued by the receivers as a going concern. That, we think, would be contrary to the spirit, not to say the letter of our statute and our practice in dealing with insolvent persons- and corporations. Nothing was done, in connection with those claims, by either of those claimants for the receivers. Their work was done for the company before the receivers were appointed, and the receivers simply received payments for the goods sent out by the company, or shipped the goods not sent by the company, and received the payments. It is not altogether clear in the record about the claims of Rowe for the itemsi marked above as (d) and (e). Whether those deliveries and payments were for orders sent to the receivers by Rowe, after July 15 th, 1920, when ho was in the employ of the receivers, is- what is not altogether clear. Quite a number of the orders are dated, in what is called Schedule (B), after the receivers were appointed, but, according to the testimony, he was not entitled to commissions on orders after he was employed by the receivers. Mr. Qtiinn testified that he was employed by the receivers at $800 a month and then explained his employment as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u201cMr. Rowe was on a salary and commission basis, and based on the total of both that he had gotten for a previous period, which T think was a year \u2014 he averaged considerably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>higher than that. When the receivers decided to employ him, ho wanted the same arrangements, and the receivers did not want to make any commission arrangement with any employee, so they compromised on that amount of money, which was somewhat less than lie averaged previously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">.Mr. Rowe said the same thing in substance, and a letter from the receivers dated August 3rd, 1920, to him was read by him when on the stand, which began: \u201cConfirming our several conversations and as a record of our agreement,\u201d and after referring to the nature of the duties, the letter continued: \u201cYour employment is by the month, beginning July 15, .1920, with salary at the rate of $800 per month and your traveling expenses. All subject to any further order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that may be issued in this receivership.\u201d He was not in the employ of the receivers after October 15th, 1920, and as we understand the record, it is conceded that his salary was paid, before the receivers were appointed, at $250 per month, and there is nothing in the petition or elsewhere alleging that he was not paid the salary by the receivers for the time he was employed by them. So we assume that the claim he is making for commissions were on orders given when the former arrangements with the company were still in force and not under his agreement with the receivers. How commissions on orders obtained after the receivership and filled by the receivers and the money paid to them could be allowed as a part of the management and operation of the business of the receivers does not appear, if he was paid a salary, which was estimated on the basis of his former salary plus the commission. Any compensation for work he did for the receivers was included in bis salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">What we have said above in reference to the amounts the respective parties are entitled to as preferences is subject to the further question whether the receivers have or will have in hand sufficient funds to pay them from properties or collections outside of what are contained in the mortgage to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Baltimore Trust Company, Trustee, which was recorded over three months prior to- the decree- appointing the receivers. Art. 47, sec. 15 expressly protects such a lien from the preferences allowed under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We have no doubt about the right of either of the three appellants to take the appeals under the circumstances of this case, and do not understand that to he seriously questioned, although referred to in appellants\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">It follows that the two decrees dated the 20th day of September, 1021, one dealing with the claims of Timothy A. Canty and the other with those of Charles O. Rowe, must be reversed in part and affirmed in part, but of course they can assert their claims not allowed as preferences as general creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"AXI\"><em>The Lira decrees of September 20 III, 1921, reversed in part and, affirmed in part, and case remanded for action of the lower court in accordance with this opinion </em>\u2014 the <em>appellees, Canty and Borne, and the receivers each. to pay one-third of the costs in this Court, the costs below to be paid by the receivers, as provided in the decrees of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
