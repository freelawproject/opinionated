Schmidt and Lorinna Jhincil Schmidt (collectively the Schmidts) appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and prejudgment interest. We agree with the trial court that Hawaii Revised Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(HRS) \u00a7 514A-94(b) (Supp. 1991) does not apply to the Schmidts\u2019 action against the defendants-appellees The Board of Directors of the Association of Apartment Owners of the Marco Polo Apartments and Marco Polo Management (collectively the Association). We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying an award of prejudgment interest. We thus affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On July 4, 1987, the Schmidts filed a verified complaint against the Association, alleging that the Association was <em>\u201cnegligently or through other breach of duty </em>legally responsible in some fashion for the events and happenings herein referred to, and [that the Association] proximately caused injury and damages thereby to the Plaintiffs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The complaint specifically claimed that \u201c[c]ommencing in 1978, and continuing continuously to date,\u201d the Schmidts had complained to the Association of \u201cwater leakage\u201d into their penthouse unit from the roof of the Marco Polo Apartments (the Marco Polo) and that the Association had failed to \u201ccorrect said water leakage.\u201d According to the complaint, the Association was responsible for the water leakage because the roof of the Marco Polo was \u201cunder the sole control and authority of\u2019 the Association, the roof being a \u201ccommon area\u201d of the Marco Polo; the complaint further urged that, pursuant to the declaration and by-laws of the Association, the Association had \u201ca duty and obligation to maintain, replace and/or restore the common areas, such as the roof.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Based on the damage allegedly caused to the Schmidts\u2019 penthouse unit, including damage to the walls, ceiling, furniture, fixtures, and personal property, the Schmidts\u2019 complaint claimed $60,000 in property damage, at least $290,000 in lost rent, at least $750,000 for damage to reputation and business, at least $2,000,000 for emotional distress, $2,000,000 in punitive damages, and treble damages pursuant to HRS \u00a7 480-2 (1985). The complaint, however, did not pray for any equitable, mandatory, or injunctive relief to force the Association to correct the alleged water leakage.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">At trial, the jury rendered a special verdict in favor of the Schmidts, finding the Association seventy percent and the Schmidts thirty percent legally responsible for the Schmidts\u2019 damages. In accordance with the jury\u2019s special verdict, the trial court awarded the Schmidts damages of $127,516.41, but denied their motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b), ruling that the statute \u201c[did] not apply to this action ....\u201d The trial court also denied the Schmidts\u2019 request for prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The Schmidts timely appealed from the order denying attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The Schmidts contend that the trial court erred in ruling that HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b) did not apply to their action because \u201cth[e] action involved a claim by a condominium owner which was substantiated against the ... [Association] to enforce a provision of the Declaration or By-Laws.\u201d The Association argues that the trial court was correct in its ruling because the Schmidts were not seeking to enforce any provision of the Association\u2019s declaration, bylaws, house rules, or HRS Chapter 514A, but rather were pursuing a simple tort action to recover damages resulting from the Association\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the Marco Polo\u2019s roof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The question of the types of actions to which HRS \u00a7 514A-94 applies is one of first impression in the Hawaii appellate courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b) provides in pertinent part that \u201call reasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees . . shall be awarded\u201d to an owner who substantiates any claim \u201cin any action against an association, any of its officers or directors, or its board of directors <em>to enforce </em>any provision of the declaration, bylaws, house rules, or this chapter----\u201d (Emphasis added.) The parties disagree as to the meaning of the term \u201cenforce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">This court has often stated that \u201c[t]he fundamental starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself. ... [W]here the statutory language is plain and unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Tax Appeal of Lower Mapunapuna Tenants Ass\u2019n, </em>73 Haw. 63, 68, 828 P.2d 263, 266 (1992) (quoting <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>71 Haw. 341, 345, 790 P.2d 910, 913 (1990). Where, as in the present case, the operative language (i.e., \u201cenforce\u201d) is undefined in a statute, we presume that the words in question \u201cwere used to express their meaning in common language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 828 P.2d at 265; <em>see also </em>HRS \u00a7 1-14 (1985). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) defines \u201cenforce,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>to mean \u201c[t]o put into execution, to cause to take effect; ... to compel obedience to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989) defines \u201cenforce,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>to mean \u201cto... compel obedi-. ence to;... to impose (a course of action) upon a person____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Thus, the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d application of HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b) is to an owner\u2019s substantiated claim against an association or its board to impose an <em>affirmative </em>course of action upon the association to put into execution \u2014 or to compel obedience to \u2014 any provision of its declaration, by-laws, house rules, or any enumerated provision of HRS chapter 514A.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u201c[Departure from the plain and unambiguous language of the statute cannot be justified without a clear showing that the legislature intended some other meaning would be given the language[,]\u201d <em>In re Tax Appeal of Lower Mapunapuna Tenants Ass\u2019n, </em>73 Haw. at 68, 828 P.2d at 266 (quoting <em>Espaniola v. Cawdrey Mars Joint Venture, </em>68 Haw. 171, 179, 707 P.2d 365, 370 (1985)), or that a \u201cliteral interpretation would produce absurd or unjust results that are clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute.\u201d <em>Kang v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>72 Haw. 251, 254, 815 P.2d 1020, 1021-22 (1991) (citations omitted). The legislative history of HRS \u00a7 514A-94 reveals no intent that \u201cenforce\u201d was to be given anything other than its \u201cplain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>obvious\u201d meaning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, we conclude that resort to the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d meaning of \u201cenforce\u201d would not produce \u201cabsurd or unjust results\u201d in the application of HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In this case, the Schmidts did not seek to enforce any <em>affirmative </em>action on the part of the Association to comply with any provision of the Association\u2019s declaration, by-laws, house rules, or HRS chapter 514A; rather, in their own words, they were \u201cseeking damages . . . [for the Association\u2019s] fail[ure] to comply with the By-Laws and Declaration.\u201d As in any common, \u201cgarden variety\u201d tort action, the Schmidts were seeking damages from the Association for the breach of a duty owed to them, i.e., the Association\u2019s <em>failure </em>to enforce its declaration and by-laws. In the absence of any prayer for equitable, mandatory, or injunctive relief to compel obedience to the Association\u2019s declaration, by-laws, house rules, or any enumerated provision of HRS chapter 514A, HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b) does not apply to the Schmidts\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the Schmidts\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Prejudgment interest, where appropriate, is awardable under HRS \u00a7 636-16 in the discretion of the court. <em>Leibert </em>v. <em>Finance Factors, Ltd., </em>71 Haw. 285, 293, 788 P.2d 833, 838 (1990). Generally, to constitute an abuse of discretion it must appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Akina, </em>73 Haw. 75, 78, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992); <em>Sapp v. Wong, </em>62 Haw. 34, 41, 609 P.2d 137, 142 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">HRS \u00a7 636-16 (1985) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In awarding interest in civil cases, the judge is authorized to designate the commencement date to conform with the circumstances of each case, provided that the earliest commencement date in cases arising in tort, may be the date when the injury first occurred and in cases arising by breach of contract, it may be the date when the breach first occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This court has recognized that the \u201cpurpose of the statute... [is] to allow the court to designate the commencement date of interest in order to correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long period of time for any reason, including litigation delays.\u201d <em>Leibert, </em>71 Haw. at 293, 788 P.2d at 838; <em>see also Wiegand v. Colbert, </em>68 Haw. 472, 478, 718 P.2d 1080, 1084 (1986) (\u201c[T]he legislative history shows [that] the purposes of the statute [HRS \u00a7 636-16] were to permit more equitable results and to more speedily resolve cases.\").<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Any delays in the present case in the rendering of a final judgment were due to actions on the part of the Schmidts and not the Association.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>in denying the Schmidts\u2019 request for prejudgment interest. <em>See Locricchio v. Legal Services Corp., </em>833 F.2d 1352, 1360 (9th Cir. 1987) (under Hawaii law, no abuse of discretion when trial court denied prejudgment interest to party whose dilatoriness accounted for much of the delay in rendering of judgment). <em>Cf. SGM Partners </em>v. <em>The Profit Co., </em>8 Haw. App. 86, 121, 793 P.2d 1189, 1211, <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>71 Haw. 506, 795 P.2d 853 (1990) (no abuse of discretion in award of prejudgment interest against the party that contributed to the delay in litigation proceedings).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AFgP\"><em>John Rapp </em>on the brief for plaintiffs-appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b547-9\"><em>Melvyn M.

While there is a Hawaii case that discusses HRS \u00a7 514A-94, it is an Intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Court of Appeals (ICA) opinion, and the ICA expressly stated therein that it was not \u201cpassing either upon the applicability of [HRS] \u00a7 514A-94 ... to the situation or the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded.\" <em>D\u2019Elia </em>v. <em>Association of Apartment Owners of Fairway </em>Manor, 2 Haw. App. 350, 351, 632 P.2d 298, 299 (1981). In <em>D\u2019Elia, </em>the circuit court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Association on Counts I and II of the D\u2019Elias\u2019 three-count complaint, and on Rule 54(b) certification the D\u2019Elias had filed an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 632 P.2d at 299. The Association then moved for and was granted an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to HRS \u00a7 514A-94 based on a dispute arising out of enforcement of a purported amendment to the Association\u2019s by-laws. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the ICA reversed the award of attorney\u2019s fees because the amendment to the by-laws attached to the Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment was an uncertified, unsworn document and had therefore improperly been considered by the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the ICA ruled that the circuit court had lacked jurisdiction to rule on the Association\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees because the Association\u2019s motion had been filed after the D\u2019Elias\u2019 had appealed Counts I and II; accordingly, the circuit court only retained jurisdiction over Count III. <em>Id. </em>at 351, 632 P.2d at 299. In dictum, the ICA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">However, we have a different reason for reversing the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Clearly, as a matter of law, no attorney\u2019s fees could be awarded upon Count III of the complaint which was all that was left after the Rule 54(b) order with respect to Counts I and II was entered. Count III was a simple count for damages to appellants\u2019 [D\u2019Elias\u2019] property by reason of activities of the appellee [Association] thereon. Since there is no agreement, statute, rule or precedent upon which attorney\u2019s fees with respect to such count can be awarded, it follows that the attorney\u2019s fees granted by the court below were necessarily limited to services rendered with respect to Counts I and II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1i\"><em>Id. </em>at 350-51, 632 P.2d at 299.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\"> The legislative history of HRS \u00a7 514A-94(b) sheds no light on what the legislature intended the term \u201cenforce\u201d to mean.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> The legislative history of HRS \u00a7 636-16 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">The purpose of this bill is to more clearly define the trial judge\u2019s discretion in awarding interest in civil cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">Your committee understands that at the present time interest is generally awarded commencing on the day the judgment is rendered.

Also, it is expected that party litigants will give serious regard to this discretion on the part of the trial judge so that those who may have had an unfair leverage by the arbitrariness of the prior rule will arrive at the realization that recalcitrance or unwarranted delays in cases which should be more speedily resolved will not enhance their position or assure them of a favorable reward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABj\">Sen.
