Steiner, trustee (Steiner) for the 1988-89 and 1989-90 tax years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City objects to the valuation of the Tax Appeal Court because: (1) the City believes that the court disregarded sales to Japanese buyers in determining fair market value, and (2) the court applied the Kahala Beach benchmark for a 20,000 sq. <em>ft.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>lot to only 14,000 sq. ft. of the Steiner property without adjusting the benchmark upward to reflect the decreased size. Steiner cross-appeals from the Tax Appeal Court\u2019s finding that 14,000 sq. ft. of the property is usable, claiming that only 11,000 sq. ft. of the 46,707 sq. ft. lot is usable.

And we have previously defined \u2018market value\u2019 as \u2018the value in money of any property for which that property would sell on the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>In re Amfac, Inc., </em>65 Haw. 499, 502, 654 P.2d 363, 366 (1982) (citations omitted). We review the valuation of the Steiner property in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The Department of Finance has established more specific guidelines for real property valuation in the <em>Procedure and Reference Manual of the Real Property Assessment Division, Department of Finance, City and County of Honolulu (Procedure and Reference Manual </em>or <em>Manual). </em>The <em>Manual </em>provides two basic methods of land valuation, the market data approach and the income approach (used for income generating properties). <em>Procedure and Reference Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7991.00 - 912.00. The market data approach is described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">[T]his method involves obtaining all available sales data, qualifying these as being transacted at \u2018arms-length\u2019 conditions or being \u2018bona fide\u2019 transactions, and comparing these recently sold properties to the one being appraised, making adjustments as necessary for comparisons. Unit prices demonstrated by actual sales, either adjusted or unadjusted, pro vide valid estimates of market value. Adjustments for dissimilarities in the market data approach to value are made by plus or minus of dollar amount or percentages, from the comparable parcels to the subject, benchmark or typical parcel in the neighborhood. The major factors which should be considered in the adjustments include the time of sale, terms of sale, location of compared parcels, differences in physical characteristics among them, and all other factors which might have been significant so as to influence the prices paid for the properties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"><em>Procedure and Reference Manual </em>\u00a7 911.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Section 941.31 of the <em>Manual </em>directs assessors to consider three general factors affecting the value of urban and suburban residential lands: location, neighborhood characteristics and site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>characteristics. Site characteristics include: (1) size and shape of lot; (2) topography and soil conditions; (3) landscaping; and (4) accessibility. Another section of the <em>Manual </em>notes that the \u201ctopography may be such that expensive excavations are required.\u201d <em>Procedure and Reference Manual </em>\u00a7 913.00. Under these circumstances the appraiser is instructed to note any adjustments for these conditions on the appraisal card as a percentage reduction in the value of the affected parcel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In assessing shoreline properties, the \u201cmost important factor of value\u201d is the quality of the shoreline itself. <em>Procedure and Reference Manual </em>\u00a7 941.34. Appraisers are advised to consider \u201cthe amount, kind, and quality of shoreline, the quality and condition of the surf and water, the view, and the accessibility to the shore, and including the hazards or detriments because of the natural wave action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">B. The City\u2019s Valuation</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The primary method used by the City tax appraiser to value the Steiner property was to establish (1) a \u201ctypical\u201d lot size and (2) a \u201cbenchmark\u201d value, in dollars per square foot, for the particular neighborhood or area. The benchmark value was calculated by reviewing the sales data for ocean-front property in the surrounding areas from the year before last (e.g. 1986 sales data for the 1988 tax year). If, as in the case of the Steiner property, a lot were larger than the typical lot, the excess area or \u201coverage\u201d would be valued per square foot at a percentage of benchmark value. If a lot were smaller than the typical lot, the benchmark would be adjusted upward to reflect the greater value per square foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">For the 1988 and 1989 tax years, the City assessed the property based on a typical lot size of 20,000 sq. ft. The assessor, Irene Nakamura, applied the Black Point benchmark to 20,000 sq. ft. and 50% of benchmark to the remaining 26,707 sq. ft. The benchmark value, based on comparable sales data, was $75 per sq. ft. for 1988 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>and $95 per sq. ft. for 1989 in the Black Point area. Based on this formula, she assessed the property as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">1988</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">100% x $75 x 20,000 sq. ft. $1,500,000</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">50% x $75 x 26,707 sq. ft. 1.001.513</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">$2,501,513</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">1989</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">100% x $95 x 20,000 sq. ft. $1,900,000</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">50% x $95 x 26,707 sq. ft. 1.268.583</p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">$3,168,583</p>\n<p id=\"b469-22\">For the 1988 benchmark, the City relied heavily on the 1986 sales of three Black Point properties which it considered comparable to the Steiner property. These properties were calculated to have land values of $83.66, $110.27 and $82.56 per sq. ft.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The City also considered sales of ocean-front properties in the Diamond Head and Kahala areas that ranged from $81.08 to $155.53 per sq. ft. From these sales data, the City determined that the benchmark should be $75 per sq. ft. for the Black Point area. Ms. Nakamura testified that the Black Point benchmark also reflected a discount for the topography in the Black Point area; she made no other adjustments to the valuation of the Steiner property based on its topography.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-23\">Similarly, the 1989 Black Point benchmark of $95 per sq. ft. was based on 1987 sales in the surrounding, areas, including the sale of one Black Point property.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-24\">The City used the same 50% (of benchmark) overage factor for all ocean-front lots which exceeded 20,000 sq. ft. in both the Black Point and Kahala Beach areas. No adjustment was made based on the topography or usability of the overage area. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>level (buildable) beach-front overage on Kahala Avenue was valued at only $10 per sq. ft. more than steep, boulder strewn (unbuildable) overage with no beach access such as on the Steiner parcel. Both the City and Steiner argued about whether there was evidence that certain lots were level and 100% usable and whether these lots were given a 25% overage adjustment in past years. However, a careful review of the record only reveals evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">(1) the Steiner property and the adjoining two parcels had large areas of rocky unusable land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(2) these three parcels were previously subject to a three part valuation, 100% of benchmark for 10,000 sq. ft., 50% for 1,000 to 1,780 sq. ft., and 25% for the remaining area (roughly 25,000 to 35,000 sq. ft.);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(3) three other ocean-front Black Point properties were previously subject to a two part valuation, 100% of benchmark for 10,000 sq. ft. and 50% for the balance \u2014 no evidence was presented as to the topography of these parcels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">(4) several Kahala Beach properties (thirteen) were subject to variable formulas in the past \u2014 some were assessed at 100% of benchmark for the first 10,000 sq. ft. with the balance at 50%, for others a three part valuation was used; however, the latter properties had been assessed at 100% of benchmark for 10,000 sq. ft. and 50% for an average of26,000 sq. ft. (range -10,000 to 40,000 sq. ft.) with relatively small remaining areas valued at 25% (average of 6,500 sq. ft., range - 1,800 to 14,000 sq. ft.);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(5) no specific evidence was presented as to the topography of the individual Kahala Beach properties, but the City assessor testified that (at least) some of them were level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>and had beach access \u2014 and, no distinction was made in valuing the overage of these lots as compared to those at Black Point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">A. Grounds for Steiner\u2019s Tax Court Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">ROH \u00a7 8-12.3 provides that a taxpayer\u2019s assessment will be lowered if the taxpayer can show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">(1) assessment of the property exceeds by more than 10 percent the market value of the property, or (2) lack of uniformity or inequality, brought about by illegality of the methods used or error in the application of the methods to the property involved, or... (4) illegality, on any ground arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States or the laws of the state or the ordinances of the city in addition to the ground of illegality of the methods used, mentioned in clause (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">ROH \u00a7 8-12.3 (1990). Steiner relied on all of these grounds in fashioning her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">B. The Tax Appeal Court\u2019s Valuation</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">The Tax Appeal Court found that the City\u2019s 1988 and 1989 assessments: (1) exceeded the market value of the property by more than ten percent; (2) showed a lack of uniformity and inequality brought about by errors in the application of the methods used to the property involved; and (3) violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. In addition to setting aside the City\u2019s valuation, the court calculated its own value for the property. The court applied the Kahala Beach benchmark value, rather than the Black Point benchmark, to 14,000 sq. ft. of the parcel and 25% of the Kahala Beach benchmark to the remaining 32,707 sq. ft., as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>1988</p>\n<p id=\"Au8\">100% x $95 x 14,000 sq. ft. $1,330,000</p>\n<p id=\"AMP\">25% x $95 x 32,707 sq. ft. \u2014 77.6,79!</p>\n<p id=\"Aib\">$2,106,791</p>\n<p id=\"AmM\">1989</p>\n<p id=\"AOM\">100% x $125 x 14,000 sq. ft. $1,750,000</p>\n<p id=\"AWo\">25% x $125 x 32,707 sq.ft. 1.022.094</p>\n<p id=\"Ajk\">$2,722,094</p>\n<p id=\"b472-21\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-22\">The Tax Appeal Court\u2019s valuation of the Steiner property requires us to review the three components which comprise the assessment. First, we must examine the benchmark value that was applied to the property. Second, we must consider the area of the property (in square feet) that was assessed at 100% of benchmark and the area that was assessed as overage. Third, we must decide whether the benchmark value was properly reduced and applied to the overage area of the Steiner parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-23\">A. The Benchmark</p>\n<p id=\"Ab7\">1. Comparable Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b472-24\">The Tax Appeal Court, as part of its valuation of the Steiner property, rejected the City\u2019s benchmark value for ocean-front Black Point properties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court substituted the Kahala Beach benchmark value. Although we presume that the court made this substitution in order to \u201carrive at a fair and realistic value\u201d as we directed in <em>Amfac, </em>we find no evidence supporting the application of the Kahala Beach figure to the subject Black Point property. <em>See In re Amfac, Inc., </em>65 Haw. 499, 502, 654 P.2d 363, 365 (1982). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>We have stated that \u201cthe tax appeal court... must base its conclusions upon evidence adduced and not upon what might have been adduced.\u201d <em>In re Tax Appeals, </em>41 Haw. 141, 149 (1955) (quoting <em>In re Taxes of Carter, </em>27 Haw. 826, 828 (1924)). Thus, we find that the substitution of the Kahala Beach benchmark for the Black Point benchmark was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In contrast, the City presented ample evidence to uphold the application of its Black Point benchmark to the Steiner property. The general method used by the City assessor in arriving at the benchmark comports with the market data approach required by ROH \u00a7 8-7.1(a) and described in the <em>Procedure and Reference Manual. </em>The assessor integrated the sales data for recently sold properties in the Black Point area into the benchmark. She also compared sales data from the Kahala Beach area, while recognizing that the Black Point benchmark should be lower because of the differences in the topographies of the two areas. Although the <em>Procedure and Reference Manual </em>is a department guideline, rather than a statute or ordinance, we find that compliance with the policies and procedures in the <em>Manual </em>is an indicia of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Tax valuation methods must be applied uniformly and equally, although not identically, to all taxpayers. <em>See, e.g., Addington </em>v. <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>119 Kan. 528, 382 P.2d 315, 319 (1963) (\u201cUniformity in taxing implies equality in the basis of assessment as well as in the rate of taxation.\u201d); <em>Kittery Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors, </em>219 A.2d 728, 734 (Me. 1966) (citations omitted) (\u201c[U]niformity and equality in a constitutional and statutory sense does not require mathematical exactitude in the assessment valuation of property for taxation.\u201d). When the assessors follow department guidelines, there is a much greater likelihood that the tax burden will be equally shared by all taxpayers. <em>See Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019n of Webster County, </em>488 U.S. 336, 345 (1989) (In finding an equal protection violation, the U.S. Supreme Court noted that the tax assessor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201cpractice seems to be contrary to that of the guide published by the West Virginia Tax Commission as an aid to local assessors in the assessment of real property.\u201d). Therefore, we hold that the City tax assessor\u2019s compliance with the policies and procedures set forth in the Finance Department\u2019s <em>Procedure and Reference Manual </em>is strong evidence that the City\u2019s method of mass valuation is being uniformly and fairly applied to all taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">2. Sales to Japanese Buyers</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Steiner argued in the tax court that sales to Japanese investors were not \u201ccomparable\u201d without adjustment, thus such sales should have been disregarded or discounted in calculating the benchmark value and the fair market value of Steiner\u2019s property. Steiner\u2019s experts opined that Japanese investors were paying more than fair market value because they had special influences, motivations and conditions and they were armed with \u201ctremendous financial wallop.\u201d The experts testified that, at the time of the alleged \u201cabove market\u201d sales, the dollar to yen ratio was high, Japan real estate prices were high, and low interest rates were available in Japan. Thus, they argued, Japanese buyers were paying much higher prices than were \u201ceconomically justified\u201d by any measure of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Although wealthy Japanese investors in Hawaii property may be a modem phenomenon, Steiner\u2019s theory is not. Bonbright\u2019s 1937 treatise on the appraisal of property discusses a similar theory that property should be valued at its \u201cintrinsic value\u201d or \u201cjustified price\u201d rather than its fair market value. J. Bonbright, 1 Valuation of Property 24 \u2014 29 (1937). Intrinsic value<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> differs from fair market value \u201cin that it represents, not what the property could presently be sold for, but what, in the appraiser\u2019s judgment, the property <em>would </em>sell for, were the market composed of (a) intelligent individuals who (b) were interested in buying and selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the property only by reference to its investment merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The intrinsic value theory mirrors Steiner\u2019s argument that sales to Japanese buyers are not economically justified, thus the court should adjust the sales data to reflect what would be a property\u2019s intrinsic value or justified price.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Bonbright states that one reason why courts have \u201cwisely hesitated\u201d to embrace the concept of intrinsic value is that \u201cit would be extremely difficult to estimate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28-29.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">If [tax assessors or tax courts] were compelled to find the intrinsic value ... for tax purposes, the administration of the law would become almost hopeless. Endless controversies would arise between taxpayers and assessors, many of which would be carried into the courts. Faulty as is market price as an index of value, it supplies a relatively objective and easily administered basis of valuation that no other method can supply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 29. We agree with this analysis and will not inject uncertainty into Hawaii\u2019s property tax assessments by subscribing to Steiner\u2019s theory. We further note that Steiner\u2019s theory invites a sale-by-sale analysis of the \u201cjustified price;\u201d we find this to be repugnant to the concept of \u201cusing appropriate systematic methods suitable for mass valuation.\u201d <em>See </em>ROH \u00a7 8-7.1(a). Thus, we reject Steiner\u2019s argument that sales to Japanese buyers do not reflect the fair market value of the properties sold to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In particular, we reject Steiner\u2019s argument that the 1987 sale of the parcel next to the Steiner property should be discounted because the buyer was a Japanese citizen and thus he paid more than fair market value. \u201cMarket value... is no more than the value in money of any property for which that property would sell on the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.\u201d <em>In re Puna Sugar Co., </em>56 Haw. 621, 624, 547 P.2d 2, 4 (1976). The property next door was listed on the open market for 95 days at $3,000,000 and sold for $2,750,000; and, there is no evidence suggesting other than an arms-length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Furthermore, although the buyer was Japanese, he has owned and lived in a Kahala beach condominium since 1979 and is the owner of a local business, the Pearl City Tavern. Even if we agreed with Steiner\u2019s \u201cabove-market\u201d theory, which we do not, nationality alone would be insufficient to establish that this transaction was tainted by the \u201cJapan factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Although the Tax Appeal Court made \u201cfindings of fact\u201d that recited Steiner\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony regarding the \u201cabove-market\u201d theory, the court did not incorporate this theory into its own valuation of the subject property. The court merely substituted the Kahala Beach benchmark and applied it to a smaller portion of the Steiner parcel. The Kahala Beach benchmark was also based in large part on sales to \u201cJapanese\u201d buyers. Thus, the Kahala Beach benchmark used by the court was equally influenced by the alleged \u201cabove-market\u201d sales and its use in no way indicates the court\u2019s adoption of Steiner\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The City argues that the Tax Appeal Court disregarded sales to Japanese buyers in determining benchmark and fair market values, while also arguing that the court failed to adjust the Kahala Beach benchmark upward when the court applied them to less than 20,000 sq. ft. of the property, We find it equally plausible that the court used the Kahala Beach figure in an attempt to adjust upward from the Black Point benchmark when it decided to apply the benchmark to less than 20,000 sq. ft. Since both the Kahala Beach and the Black Point benchmarks incorporated sales to Japanese as well as other buyers, we find the City\u2019s argument on this point to be misguided. However, as stated above, we agree with the City that the tax court erred by using the Kahala Beach benchmark in this case. Rather, we conclude that the court should have applied the Black Point benchmark as the City did in its assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">B. The Overage Area</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Steiner presented expert testimony from Jack Lipman, a licensed architect with over thirty years of experience, regarding the topography and usability of the land. Lipman testified that \u00e1 little less than 11,000 sq. ft. of the Steiner parcel is buildable, except at extremely excessive costs. He mentioned \u201cveiy rough and rugged and heavy rocks,\u201d inaccessibility for getting construction equipment in to do foundation work (pilings would be needed), the heavy winds and whip-lashing of water, and the Hawaiian trail across the property that cannot be built over.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The Tax Appeal Court found that 14,000 sq. ft. of the parcel were economically usable. The only (evidentiary) source of this information was the testimony of John Hulten, Sr., an appraiser called by Steiner. Mr. Hulten testified that he obtained the 14,000 sq. ft. figure, from an architect (Reese) who was not called as a witness in this case, to illustrate two appraisal approaches which he was advocating. Steiner\u2019s attorney stated that \u201cas far as the report to Mr. Reese\u2019s report [sic] [on the buildable area], your honor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>we\u2019re offering only to show what Mr. Hulten relied on but not to the truth of Mr. Reese\u2019s report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">As we have previously stated, an expert witness may not \u201cserve as a mere conduit for the hearsay opinion, the factual basis of which is not established through evidence, of another expert who does not testify when the expert who does testify lacks the requisite qualifications to render the opinion in his own right.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>53 Haw. 582, 589-90, 499 P.2d 663, 669 (1972) (citations omitted). In this case, no attempt was made to establish Hulten\u2019s qualifications to determine the usable area of the Steiner property and the factual basis for the 14,000 sq. ft. figure was not otherwise established through evidence presented by either party. We therefore conclude that the Tax Appeal Court erred in finding 14,000 sq. ft. of the Steiner property usable for improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The City attacks the 14,000 sq. ft. figure from another perspective. It argues, correctly, that a benchmark value is calculated for a \u201ctypical\u201d or benchmark lot size and, when a property is smaller than the typical lot, the benchmark value must be adjusted upward to reflect greater value per square foot. Steiner does not disagree with this analysis. In fact, Steiner\u2019s expert diagramed a hyperbolic curve of the formula for calculating the adjustment ratios to be applied to lots smaller than 20,000 sq. ft.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We agree that this analysis would be applicable to lots smaller than the benchmark lot. However, Steiner\u2019s property is actually much larger than the benchmark or typical lot. We will not create an anomaly whereby a single parcel is viewed as being both larger and smaller than the benchmark lot.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Steiner presented evidence that the usable area of the property was significantly less than 20,000 sq. ft. Nevertheless, the City\u2019s study showed that a typical lot size along the ocean-front in both the Black Point and Kahala Beach neighborhoods was 20,000 sq. ft. The City assessor testified that the non-utility of a portion of the benchmark area was factored into the calculation of the benchmark value. We find that application of the Black Point benchmark value to 20,000 sq. ft. is an \u201cappropriate systematic method\u201d for valuation of this portion of the Steiner property. <em>See </em>ROH \u00a7 8-7.1(a). We hold that the tax court erroneously rejected the City\u2019s valuation of the parcel using a formula which applied 100% of the Black Point benchmark value to 20,000 sq. ft. and a reduced benchmark to the overage area of 26,707 sq. ft.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">C. The Reduced Benchmark Value as Applied to Overage</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The Tax Appeal Court valuation applied 25% of the benchmark value to the Steiner overage area. We cannot conclude that there is \u201cgood and sufficient reason\u201d to overturn this decision. <em>See In re Puna Sugar Co., </em>56 Haw. 621, 623, 547 P.2d 2, 4 (1976). The court\u2019s conclusions of law indicate that the City failed to adequately adjust for dissimilarities between Kahala Beach overage and Black Point overage, including topography, shoreline access, utility and other factors affecting valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">While we found that the City\u2019s <em>benchmark </em>sufficiently incorporated these factors, we agree with the tax court that the overage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>calculation did not. Contrary to its eighteen year practice which was based on the characteristics of the overage area of the Steiner property, the City used the same overage formula for unbuildable, rock-strewn overage with no beach access as it did for level, usable Kahala Beach beach-front overage. The City failed to adjust its overage formula in contradiction of its own assessment guidelines. <em>See Procedure and Reference Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 911.00, 913.00,941.31 &amp; 941.34; <em>see also </em>Part III. A. 1., above. The court concluded that the City\u2019s assessment discriminated against the landowner by requiring payment of more than the land\u2019s allocable share of the total real property tax burden, thus violating equal protection. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution is violated when taxation \u201cin fact bears unequally on persons or property of the same class.\u201d <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019n of Webster County, </em>488 U.S. 336, 343 (1989) (citations omitted); <em>see also In re Swann, </em>7 Haw. App. 390, 401, 776 P.2d 395, 401-02 (1989). \u201c[T]he fairness of one\u2019s allocable share of the total property tax burden can only be meaningfully evaluated by comparison with the share of others similarly situated relative to their property holdings.\u201d 488 U.S. at 346. In this case, fairness requires the assessment of Steiner\u2019s overage at a lower percentage of benchmark than Kahala Beach overage, because each has significantly different characteristics affecting value. By failing to reduce the overage assessment, the City denied Steiner\u2019s right to equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In summary, we reverse in part, holding that the Tax Appeal Court erroneously set aside the City\u2019s application of the Black Point benchmark value to 20,000 sq. ft. of the Steiner property. We affirm in part, holding that the court correctly applied the 25% of benchmark to overage in lieu of the 50% of benchmark used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the City\u2019s formula.
