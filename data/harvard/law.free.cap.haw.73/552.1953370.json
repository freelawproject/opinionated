The trial court determined State Farm was not obligated to provide no-fault benefits to Fermahin because an exclusion in the policy precluded no-fault coverage for injuries sustained by an insured while occupying an uninsured vehicle owned by a co-insured. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b565-15\">On February 15, 1990, Fermahin, a passenger in a 1984 Toyota pickup truck owned and operated by Michael Heiser (Heiser), was injured when uninsured motorist Shannon Pelekai <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>(Pelekai) rear-ended Heiser\u2019s truck. At the time of the accident, Fermahin and Heiser<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were named insureds on a single automobile insurance policy issued by State Farm (the policy). However, the policy insured only Fermahin\u2019s 1987 Honda Accord LX. Heiser\u2019s truck had been insured by State Farm under a separate policy, but the policy had lapsed. At the time of the accident, Fermahin was unaware that Heiser\u2019s truck was uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">After Fermahin learned that neither Heiser nor Pelekai had no-fault insurance, she filed an application for no-fault benefits with State Farm, which was denied. State Farm subsequently initiated this declaratory judgment action to determine the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties under the policy. State Farm moved for summary judgment on the basis that it was not obligated to provide no-fault benefits to Fermahin because an exclusion in the policy precluded coverage when an insured was injured while occupying an uninsured vehicle owned by the insured or a co-insured (owned vehicle exclusion). Fermahin opposed State Farm\u2019s summary judgment motion contending 1) the no-fault policy\u2019s coverage provisions and the owned vehicle exclusion were mutually inconsistent and created an ambiguous and misleading document; 2) State Farm misconstrued the owned vehicle exclusion, which had no application to a named insured injured in a co-insured\u2019s vehicle; and 3) even if the owned vehicle exclusion operated to bar recovery in this case, the exclusion was void as a matter of public policy under Hawaii\u2019s No-Fault Law, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 431: IOC (1987 Spec. Pamphlet and 1991 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">At the summary judgment hearing, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">I think it\u2019s a clear and simple case. I think the exception applies. To me it\u2019s not contrary to the law and it\u2019s for this particular case. And otherwise you\u2019re going to run into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>situation where the insured has the benefit of insurance on unlimited number of cars by paying the premium on one. I don\u2019t think that was the intention and the clear wording of the exception which prevents] that from happening and rightfully so. And I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s contrary to state law. In this case that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do. So I\u2019m granting the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">An order granting summary judgment in favor of State Farm was issued and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">When this court reviews a summaiy judgment proceeding, it employs the same standard as the trial court. <em>Gossinger </em>v. <em>Association of Apartment Owners of The Regency Ala Wai, </em>73 Haw. 412, 417, 835 P.2d 627, 630 (1992); <em>Coll v. McCarthy, </em>72 Haw. 20, 24, 804 P.2d 881, 884 (1991). The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Sharples </em>v. <em>State, </em>71 Haw. 404, 405, 793 P.2d 175, 176 (1990). Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party clearly demonstrates that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Hawaii Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c); <em>Gossinger, </em>73 Haw. at 417, 835 P.2d at 630; <em>Coll, </em>72 Haw. at 24, 804 P.2d at 884-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">A. The Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The no-fault section of the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">We will pay the following benefits in accordance with the <em>No Fault Act </em>for <em>bodily injury </em>to an <em>insured, </em>caused by accident resulting from the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a <em>motor vehicle </em>as a vehicle[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>(Emphasis in original.) However, the owned vehicle exclusion states:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">THERE IS NO COVERAGE FOR <em>BODILY INJURY:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">1. TO <em>YOU </em>OR ANY <em>RELATIVE </em>WHILE <em>OCCUPYING A MOTOR VEHICLE OWNED BY YOU </em>WHICH IS NOT <em>YOUR CAR </em>OR A <em>NEWLY ACQUIRED CAR.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">(Emphasis in original.) The policy defines \u201cyou\u201d as \u201cthe named insured or named insureds shown on the declarations page.\u201d \u201cOccupying\u201d is defined as \u201cin, on, entering or alighting from.\u201d \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d is any vehicle required to be registered under HRS chapter 286. \u201cYour car\u201d means \u201cthe car or the vehicle described on the declarations page.\u201d \u201cOwned by\u201d is defined as a person who \u201c1. holds legal title to a motor vehicle; 2. has possession of a motor vehicle under a security agreement or lease with option to buy; or 3. has sold a motor vehicle, but the executed title has not yet been delivered to the buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">An insurance contract must be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions under the policy. HRS \u00a7 431:10-237 (1987 Spec. Pamphlet); <em>see also Smith </em>v. <em>New England Life Ins. Co., 72 </em>Haw. 531, 534, 827 P.2d 635, 636 (1992). Because insurance contracts are contracts of adhesion, they must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and all ambiguities are resolved against the insurer. <em>Sturla, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., 61 </em>Haw. 203, 209, 684 P.2d 960, 964 (1984). However, this mle does not automatically apply whenever an insured and insurer disagree over the interpretation of the policy provisions and an assertion of ambiguity arises. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, a complex provision and/or policy does not in itself create ambiguity. Ambiguity exists \u201c \u2018only when the contract taken as a whole, is reasonably subject to differing interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also Fortune v. Wong, </em>68 Haw. 1, 10-11, 702 P.2d 299, 306 (1985). \u201cA court must \u2018respect the plain terms of the policy and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>create ambiguity where none exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>72 Haw. at 537, 827 P.2d at 638 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">When the appropriate definitions are applied to the language of the owned vehicle exclusion, it clearly states that no-fault coverage is not provided for the named insured or insureds who sustain bodily injury while occupying a motor vehicle owned by the named insured or insureds which is not a vehicle described on the declaration page of the policy or a newly acquired vehicle. Despite the clear language of the exclusion and her admission that Heiser\u2019s vehicle does not qualify under the policy definitions as \u201cyour car\u201d or \u201ca newly acquired car,\u201d Fermahin contends that the exclusion operates to bar recovery of no-fault benefits by an insured <em>only </em>if such insured is injured in a car owned by <em>that </em>insured. Fermahin, however, fails to take into account and apply the definition of \u201cyou\u201d when construing the phrase \u201cmotor vehicle owned by you,\u201d which means any vehicle owned by either Fermahin or Heiser, the named insureds. The general definition section of the policy defining such words as \u201cyou\u201d states that these are \u201cdefined words which are used in several parts of the policy.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Fermahin\u2019s reading of the policy totally disregards Heiser\u2019s status as a named insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The facts before us are not disputed. Fermahin and Heiser were named insureds under the single policy at issue. The only vehicle declared under the policy was Fermahin\u2019s 1987 Honda Accord. Heiser was the sole owner of the Toyota pickup truck, which was uninsured. At the time of the accident, Fermahin occupied Heiser\u2019s uninsured vehicle. When applying these facts to the plain meaning of the owned vehicle exclusion, Fermahin is clearly precluded from recovering no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We therefore conclude that the owned vehicle exclusion unambiguously precludes Fermahin from receiving no-fault benefits. <em>See Hurtig </em>v. <em>Terminix Wood Treating &amp; Contracting Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>67 Haw. 480, 481, 692 P.2d 1153, 1154 (1984) (coverage exists unless a policy exclusion clearly provides otherwise).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">B. Public Policy Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We next address whether the owned vehicle exclusion, as a matter of law, violates public policy under Hawaii\u2019s No-Fault Law, HRS Chapter 431:10C.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Although Fermahin, in her opening and reply briefs submitted to this court, sought a broad ruling that all owned vehicle exclusions are violative of the Hawaii no-fault statute as a matter of public policy, counsel for Fermahin at oral argument narrowed the ruling initially sought from this court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">I am not trying to get this court to rule that owned vehicle exclusions are violative of public policy in every situation. Let\u2019s focus on the facts of this case. We have an insured who did not own this car and did not know that it was uninsured. That\u2019s our facts. Our facts are not that it was her owned car. Our facts are that it was Heiser\u2019s. Sol don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to ask for too broad of a policy ruling. All I want this court to observe is... the general purpose behind these statutes____(Citation to case omitted.) Fermahin is not just insured when she\u2019s in her car. She\u2019s insured when she\u2019s in any other car. I don\u2019t want to take the position that you should strike down all owned vehicle exclusions involving relatives. . . . That the 1970\u2019s case that we\u2019re asking you to extend, the <em>Kau </em>case,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] the <em>Kau </em>case involved an insured who was the owner of an uninsured vehicle. In other words, the more extreme circumstance. In other words, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Heiser in the <em>Kau </em>case. Still this court said it was violative of public policy. I don\u2019t want a ruling in no-fault as far as <em>Kau. </em>I just want this court to recognize that my client was insured, did not own a car that was uninsured, and did not know the car she was in, even though she knew he was on her policy, was uninsured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Fermahin\u2019s concession that not all owned vehicle exclusions are violative of public policy under Hawaii\u2019s no-fault law is consistent with our recent ruling in <em>Methven-Abreu </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>73 Haw. 385, 834 P.2d 279 (1992) [hereinafter <em>Abreu]. </em>In <em>Abreu, </em>we held that the exclusion contained in Abreu\u2019s husband\u2019s automobile policy, which precluded no-fault benefits to an insured family member who was injured while a passenger in <em>her own uninsured vehicle,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was consistent with the language and legislative intent of Hawaii\u2019s no-fault law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Although <em>Abreu </em>involved the predecessor no-fault statute, HRS Chapter 294,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the relevant sections of the statute in <em>Abreu </em>are virtually identical to those sections which are pertinent to this case. The Hawaii no-fault law provides that an insured injured in an automobile accident in Hawaii arising \u201cout of the operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle, has a right to no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>benefits.\u201d HRS \u00a7431:10C-303(a) (1987 Spec. Pamphlet).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, we noted in <em>Abreu </em>that \u201c[t]his right... is not absolute. An insurer\u2019s obligation to pay no-fault benefits under HRS \u00a7 294-4<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is qualified by HRS \u00a7 294-5(c), which provides in pertinent part that \u2018[n]o payment of no-fault benefits may be made to the occupants of a motor vehicle other than the insured motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abreu, </em>73 Haw. at 391-92, 834 P.2d at 283 (footnote in original). Likewise, HRS \u00a7 431:10C-305(d)(l) (1987 Spec. Pamplet) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">(d) The following persons are not eligible to receive payment of no-fault benefits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">(1) Occupants of a motor vehicle other than the insured motor vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">Provided, that this subsection does not preclude recovery in other capacities under a no-fault policy covering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>vehicle which the person did not occupy at the time of the accident.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In <em>Abreu, </em>we determined that the clear and unambiguous language of HRS \u00a7 294~5(c) (recodified under HRS \u00a7 431:10C-305(d)(l)) permitted the insurer to preclude no-fault benefits in accord with the insurance policy\u2019s exclusion. We explained that to hold otherwise would 1) render HRS \u00a7 294-5(c) \u201csuperfluous, void or insignificant,\u201d <em>Abreu, </em>73 Haw. at 393, 834 P.2d at 284; 2) \u201ccreate little incentive for multi-vehicle households to insure each of their vehicles if an insurance policy on one vehicle would provide no-fault benefits to them if they were injured while occupying any of their other uninsured vehiclesf,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 393, 834 P.2d at 284; and 3) \u201cfrustrate one of the legislature\u2019s original and continuing objectives, that is, to reduce motor vehicle insurance costs to the public,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 393-94, 834 P.2d at 284 (footnote omitted), because insurance companies would undoubtedly raise their premiums if faced with such broad and unidentified risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Fermahin\u2019s argument that the owned vehicle exclusion is violative of public policy as to her because she was insured under the policy and did not own Heiser\u2019s vehicle is without merit. HRS \u00a7 431:10C-305(d), like its predecessor, HRS \u00a7 294-5(c), operates as a vehicle exclusion. State Farm\u2019s use of the terms \u201cowned by you\u201d in the policy\u2019s owned vehicle exclusion means that, if Fermahin or Heiser were to receive bodily injury while occupying an uninsured motor vehicle <em>owned by either of them, </em>they would be precluded from recovering no-fault benefits. On the other hand, if Fermahin or Heiser were to sustain injuries while occupying a vehicle <em>owned by a stranger to the policy, </em>that is, a third party not insured under the policy, the exclusion would be inapplicable; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>under the terms of the policy, they would qualify for no-fault coverage, provided no other policy exclusions applied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By affording no-fault coverage to Fermahin for injuries she might sustain while occupying a stranger\u2019s uninsured vehicle, State Farm actually provided greater coverage than required by the Hawaii no-fault statute. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 431:10C-120(a) (1987 Spec. Pamphlet) (\u201c[n]o insurer shall issue or offer to issue any policy which the insurer represents is a no-fault policy unless such insurer meets the requirements of this article\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Fermahin also contends that her lack of knowledge that Heiser\u2019s vehicle was uninsured is a significant distinction which should allow coverage under the policy. Such a contention is untenable. We agree with the well-settled principle that \u201c[w]here two persons enter into a joint transaction for the benefit of both, notice of a fact to one of them is also notice to both so far as that transaction is concerned.\u201d 58 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Notice </em>\u00a7 4, at 573-74 (1989) (footnote omitted). Here, Fermahin and Heiser jointly contracted with State Farm for automobile insurance under a single policy and elected to declare only Fermahin\u2019s Honda Accord. We emphasize that Heiser was not a \u201cstranger\u201d to the policy; he was Fermahin\u2019s named co-insured. Consequently, Heiser\u2019s knowledge of the status of his uninsured vehicle is imputed to Fermahin. <em>See generally Kapahua v. Hawaiian Ins. and Guar. Co., </em>50 Haw. 644, 447 P.2d 669 (1968) (an insured is charged with knowledge of the expiration date of his or her auto insurance policy).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>fore, we hold that Fermahin\u2019s lack of actual knowledge that Heiser\u2019s vehicle was uninsured is immaterial to her right to recover no-fault benefits. We further hold that it was Fermahin\u2019s duty, for her own benefit, to ascertain the status of insurance coverage on her co-insured\u2019s vehicle, as if it were her own vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We adopt the trial judge\u2019s analysis that the application of the exclusion under the circumstances of this case is consistent with the public policy of Hawaii\u2019s no-fault law, that is, to prevent the insured from having \u201cthe benefit of insurance on [an] unlimited number of cars by paying the premium on one.\u201d Insurers are entitled to be fairly compensated for risks they contract to assume and \u201c \u2018have the same rights as individuals to limit their liability, and to impose whatever conditions they please on their obligation, provided they are not in contravention of statutory inhibitions or public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>66 Haw. 413, 423, 665 P.2d 648, 655 (1983) (quoting 6B J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4255, at 40 (Buckley 1979)) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Furthermore, we reject Fermahin\u2019s position that the proviso section of HRS \u00a7 431:10C-305(d)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201csquarely encompasses the accident victim in this case, whose 1987 Honda Accord LX Policy complied with the No-Fault Law and provided coverage for \u2018a vehicle which the person did not occupy at the time of the accident,\u2019 the 1987 Honda Accord LX.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) There is no dispute that Fermahin had a valid no-fault policy insuring her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Honda Accord at the time of the accident. However, we cannot accept her interpretation of the proviso. If Heiser had been a stranger to the policy in issue, instead of a named co-insured, there would be no question that Fermahin would be entitled to no-fault coverage in her \u201ccapacity\u201d as the sole insured under her no-fault policy. But under.the circumstances of this case, Fermahin is precluded from recovering no-fault benefits by the clear and unambiguous terms of th\u00e9 policy\u2019s owned vehicle exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Finally, in attempting to convince us that the exclusion at issue should be rendered void as against public policy, Fermahin analogizes the present case to our rejection of an owned vehicle exclusion in <em>Kau v. State Farm Mutual Automoble Insurance Co., </em>58 Haw. 49, 564 P.2d 443 (1977). <em>Kau </em>dealt with an exclusion in an uninsured motorist policy, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">[w]e determined that the owned vehicle exclusion [in <em>Kau\\ </em>denied the plaintiff full protection of the uninsured motorist statute. We also determined that \u201c[a] literal reading of the [uninsured motorist] statute leaves no room for the exclusion which \u00e1ppellant attempted to write into its policy!,]\u201d and concluded that the exclusion was void because it was repugnant to the [uninsured motorist] statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-8\"><em>Abreu, </em>73 Haw. at 396, 834 P.2d at 285 (citation omitted). However, we are dealing with the nor-fault statute in this case, HRS \u00a7 431:10C-305(d), which operates as a vehicle exclusion as did its predecessor, HRS \u00a7 294-5(c). <em>See Abreu, supra. </em>Therefore, under the circumstances of this particular case, we decline to extend <em>Kau.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the owned vehicle exclusion contained in the policy is valid because it is consistent with HRS \u00a7 431:10C-305(d) and the legislative intent of Hawaii\u2019s no-fault law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A78\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Peter Van Name Esser (Willard J.

Every no-fault and self-insurer shall provide no-fault benefits for accidental harm as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">(1) <em>Except as otherwise provided in section 294-S(c):</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">(A) In the case of injury arising out of a motor vehicle accident to any person, including the owner, operator, occupant, or user of the insured motor vehicle, or any pedestrian (including a bicyclist)... who sustains accidental harm as a result of the operation, maintenance, or use of the vehicle, the insurer shall pay, without regard to fault, to the person an amount equal to the no-fault benefits payable to the person as a result of the injury[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\"> This proviso section was added at the time Chapter 294 was repealed and recodified in HRS Chapter 431:IOC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b574-5\"> In accordance with this hypothetical, we perceive a true distinction between a co-insured and a stranger. A stranger\u2019s uninsured vehicle would not qualify as an \u201cowned vehicle\u201d under the policy, and thus the owned vehicle exclusion would not apply. Moreover, a stranger could not be a co-insured under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> In <em>Kapahua, </em>\u201c[t]he sole question... [was] whether an insurance company or its agent [was] negligent toward an insured when neither it nor its agent [gave] the insured notice of the expiration of her automobile insurance policy,\u201d <em>Kapahua, </em>50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Haw. at 644, 447 P.2d at 669, and failed to automatically renew it upon expiration. This court held that because an insured is charged with knowledge of the stated expiration date, neither the insurer nor its agent has a legal duty to give notice of such expiration or to automatically renew the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\"> The proviso section of HRS \u00a7 431:10C-305(d) states, \u201c[p]rovided, that this subsection does not preclude recovery in other capacities under a no-fault policy covering a vehicle which the person did not occupy at the time of the accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
