Defendant argues that his conduct did not cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the custodial interference statute, and therefore, the court abused its discretion by failing to dismiss the case as de minimus under HRS \u00a7 702-236(l)(b) (1985). In addition, defendant challenges the validity of the custodial interference statute, asserting that \u00a7 707-727(l)(a) is unconstitutionally vague. Finally, defendant maintains that the court erroneously construed the provision because it convicted him under the facts of this case. We do not reach defendant\u2019s last two arguments, finding that the case should have been dismissed under \u00a7 702-236(l)(b) of the de minimus statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Sue Kinghom (Sue) is a ward of the State who had run away from her group foster home on several occasions. She was on the run when she met defendant Ron Akina, Jr. on a rainy day at Swanzy Beach Park, near the home where defendant lived with his mother. Sue gave defendant a false name and told him she was nineteen years of age and pregnant. Defendant invited her to his home, and there, she was allowed to shower, and was fed. Sue stayed at the Akinas\u2019 for approximately two weeks, during which time defendant called Mr. and Mrs. Tuituku, her foster parents, informing them of Sue\u2019s whereabouts and giving them his name, address, and phone number. Sue returned to the Tuitukus\u2019 on Thanksgiving Day, 1990, after defendant requested that she return.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">On the same day that Sue left his home, defendant called the Tuitukus to inquire about Sue and was told she had run away about an hour after her return. Sue returned home after Mrs. Tuituku <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>gave defendant permission to assist in the search, and he found Sue at Ala Moana Park. Then, early the next morning, Sue appeared once more on defendant\u2019s doorstep. Defendant drove her back to the Tuitukus\u2019, where he talked with the Tuitukus for about 45 minutes. He was told by Mr. Tuituku that Sue was a runaway and that it was a criminal offense to help runaways. The Tuitukus also stated that they could not physically restrain Sue if she chose to run away again and that the choice to leave was hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Defendant attempted to convince Sue to stay with the Tuitukus, and was unsuccessful. He then agreed to let her stay at his home until Sunday of the next week. Defendant and Sue left the premises, whereupon Mr. Tuituku called the police, and defendant was apprehended and charged with second degree custodial interference under HRS \u00a7 707-727(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">At trial, defendant testified that he was just trying to help Sue. Mr. Tuituku agreed, testifying that he felt defendant was a nice person who was sincerely trying to help. Even the prosecuting attorney conceded that defendant\u2019s pattern of behavior showed that he wanted to help Sue. The court concluded that \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s main sin was being \u2014 or allowing himself to be taken advantage of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The court below rejected defendant\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 702-236( 1 )(b) shielded him from prosecution, reasoning that defendant\u2019s actions fell within the terms of \u00a7 707-727(l)(a) and that a conviction would comply with legislative intent. We agree that defendant\u2019s actions and their effect fell within \u00a7 707-727(1 )(a) and that defendant was not afforded protection under the exception in \u00a7 702-236(l)(b) for conduct that does not cause or threaten the \u201charm or evil sought to be prevented\u201d by law. However, we find that the court abused its discretion by failing to dismiss the case under the \u00a7 702-236(1)(b) exception for conduct causing harm \u201ctoo trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>HRS \u00a7 702-236 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">(1) The court may dismiss a prosecution if, having regard to the nature of the conduct alleged and the nature of the attendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant\u2019s conduct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">(b) Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense or did so only to an extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">A court\u2019s decision under this.statute is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Okuda, </em>71 Haw. 434, 448, 795 P.2d 1, 9 (1990). Generally, to constitute an abuse of discretion a court must have clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sacoco, </em>45 Haw. 288, 292, 367 P.2d 11, 13 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Defendant contends that he is protected from prosecution under \u00a7 702-236(1 )(b) because the legislative history of \u00a7 707-727(1)(a) shows that the statute was only intended to prevent child snatching, that is, interference of custody awarded upon divorce. We disagree. This court derives legislative intent primarily from the language of the statute and follows the general rule that in the absence of clear legislative intent to the. contrary, the plain meaning of the statute will be given effect. <em>State v. Briones, </em>71 Haw. 86, 92, 784 P.2d 860, 863 (1989). HRS \u00a7 707-727 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">(1) A person commits the offense of custodial interference in the second degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">(a) He knowingly takes or entices a person less than eighteen years old from his lawful custodian, knowing that he has no right to do so[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This section makes it a crime to knowingly interfere with lawful custody of a child below the age of eighteen and is clearly intended to protect the interests of the minor and that of the minor\u2019s lawful custodian in the parent-child relationship. Its express terms would apply equally well to custodial arrangements arising from divorce, or to arrangements like the present one, which result from placement of a State ward. We find no evidence of clear legislative intent either in the statute or legislative history to limit application of the statute to the divorce context. We also find that there may be situations outside of that context where application of this statute would protect a minor and her lawful custodian, and thus, further legislative intent. We conclude that \u00a7 707-727(l)(a) is not limited to custody arising from divorce and that defendant cannot, through definition of the offense, alone, take advantage of the exception in \u00a7 702-236(l)(b) for conduct that does not fall within the terms of the statute under which defendant was prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In addition, defendant would be unable to claim that his actions did not actually cause the harm or evil to be prevented, because by giving Sue transportation and a place to stay, his actions did interfere with the Tuitukus\u2019 custody of Sue, assisting, and to an extent, encouraging Sue to leave her home. We find, however, that his interference was too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction, and that defendant is provided a shield against prosecution in the \u00a7 702-236(1)(b) exception for conduct with de minimus effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">When defendant came on the scene, there was little he could do to worsen Sue\u2019s relationship with her custodial parents. Sue had already run away from the Tuitukus several times before, and the Tuitukus themselves admitted that they had no control over her. It is also clear from the record that there was little or no communication between Sue and her parents. Defendant\u2019s actions did not cause the rift between Sue and her parents, and it is unlikely that his actions altered the existing custodial relationship at all. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Indeed, it appears that defendant was not the active party in this case, and that it was Sue that took advantage of defendant.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0\"><em>Susan Arnett (Theodore Y.H. Chinn, </em>on the brief; <em>Glenn J. Kim, </em>Defender Intern, assisting on the brief), Deputy Public Defenders, for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b92-10\"><em>James M. Anderson, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Given the evidence before the court below, and the court\u2019s own admission that defendant\u2019s \u201cmain sin was being \u2014 or allowing himself to be taken advantage of,\u201d we conclude that the court\u2019s failure to apply \u00a7 702-236(l)(b) to relieve defendant from prosecution under \u00a7 707-727(1 )(a) was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed, and the charge against him is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
