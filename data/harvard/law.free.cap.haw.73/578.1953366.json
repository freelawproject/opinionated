Plaintiff-Appellant Pele Defense Fund (PDF) primarily argues that the exchange constitutes a breach of the trust created under \u00a7 5(f) of the Hawaii Admission Act and article XII, \u00a7 4 of the Hawaii Constitution. The \u00a7 5(f) claim is brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (section 1983 or \u00a7 1983). PDF also alleges that: the exchange violates article XII, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapters 171 and 195, and the constitutional right to due process; and that defendants-appellees Campbell, True Energy Geothermal Corp., True Geothermal Drilling Co., and Mid-Pacific Geothermal Inc.\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exclusion of PDF members from the exchanged lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>violates their rights under article XII, \u00a7 7. PDF\u2019s prayer for relief seeks a declaration that the exchange was a breach of trust and a violation of law and requests a return of the exchanged lands to ceded land status via a constructive trust or another land exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">These issues are presented to us on appeal from the Third Circuit Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and.Decision and Order Granting Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss or, Alternatively, for Partial Summary Judgment (Order Granting Summary Judgment). We affirm in part and reverse in part and remand on the limited question of whether Campbell , and True should be enjoined from disallowing PDF\u2019s native Hawaiian members access into undeveloped areas of Wao Kele \u2018O Puna for traditional subsistence, cultural, and religious purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Hawaii\u2019s ceded lands are lands which were classified as government or crown lands prior to the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. Upon annexation in 1898, the Republic of Hawaii ceded these lands to the United States. In 1959, when Hawaii was admitted into the Union, the ceded lands were transferred to the newly created state, subject to the trust provisions set forth in \u00a7 5(f) Of the Admission Act. Hawaii Admission Act, Pub. L. No. 86-3, 73 Stat. 4, 6 (1959). Section 5(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">The lands granted to the State of Hawaii by subsection (b) of this section... together with the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any such lands and the income therefrom, shall be held by said State as a public trust</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">[ 1 ] for the support of the public schools and other public educational institutions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">[2] for the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians, as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>[3] for the development of farm and home ownership on as widespread a basis as possible,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">[4] for the making of public improvements, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">[5] for the provision of lands for public use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">Such lands, proceeds, and income shall be managed and disposed of for one or more of the foregoing purposes in such manner as the constitution and laws of said State shall provide, and their use for any other object shall constitute a breach of trust for which suit may be brought by the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">73 Stat. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The public lands trust is also recognized in the Hawaii Constitution. Article XII, \u00a7 4 declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">The lands granted to the State of Hawaii by Section 5(b) of the Admission Act and pursuant to Article XVI, Section 7, of the State Constitution, excluding therefrom lands defined as \u201cavailable lands\u201d by Section 203 of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended, shall be held by the State as a public trust for native Hawaiians and the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Haw. Const, art. XII, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR), headed by an executive board known as the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR), is the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>charged with the administration of public lands, including those subject to the \u00a7 5(f) trust. HRS \u00a7 171-3 (Supp. 1991). HRS chapter 171 governs the management and disposition of public lands in general. HRS chapter 195 establishes that certain lands, endowed with \u201cunique natural resources,\u201d should be preserved \u201cin perpetuity\u201d in a statewide Natural Area Reserves System (NARS). HRS \u00a7 195-1 (1985). In 1987, chapter 195 was amended to allow alienation of NARS land for \u201canother public use upon a finding by the [DLNR] of an imperative and unavoidable public necessity.\u201d HRS \u00a7 195-10 (Supp. 1991). Within this legal framework, we review the contested land exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On December 23, 1985, the State and Campbell exchanged deeds, the State receiving Campbell\u2019s Kahauale'a land and Campbell receiving Puna lands including the Wao Kele \u2018O Puna NARS land, the Puna Forest Reserve and other state lands. The exchange followed a series of studies and hearings and the designation of a portion of the Kilauea Middle East Rift Zone (KMERZ), located primarily within Wao Kele \u2018O Puna, as a geothermal resource subzone. The designation of the geothermal resource subzone and the granting of a geothermal development permit were previously reviewed and upheld by this court on appeal from the BLNR\u2019s decisions. <em>See Dedman </em>v. <em>Board of Land &amp; Natural Resources, </em>69 Haw. 255, 740 P.2d 28 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1020 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In January 1986, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 171-50(c), the BLNR submitted the land exchange to both the senate and the house of representatives of the Hawaii Legislature for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>exchange became effective when the Legislature failed to disapprove it by April 23,1986, the last day of the 1986 legislative session. Nearly a year later, Executive Order No. 3103, designating Wao Kele \u2018O Puna as NARS land, was canceled by Executive Order No. 3359, and Wao Kele \u2018O Puna was transferred out of the NARS.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">PDF and Kaolelo Lambert John Ulaleo (Ulaleo) filed a lawsuit against the BLNR members in their official capacities, on April 25, 1988, in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. <em>See Ulaleo v. Paty, </em>902 F.2d 1395, 1397 (9th Cir. 1990). Ulaleo and PDF brought suit under \u00a7 1983, seeking to invalidate the exchange based on alleged violations of the \u00a7 5(f) trust provisions and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Id. </em>The federal complaint also alleged violations of state law and the state Constitution. <em>Id. </em>Upon defendants\u2019 motion, the district court dismissed all claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">During the pendency of the appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Ulaleo died; PDF continued the appeal as the sole plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 1397. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claims, holding that suit was barred by the eleventh amendment because PDF was, in fact, seeking retrospective relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1398-1400. PDF\u2019s pendent state law claims were also barred because, after the federal claims were dismissed, the justification for adjudicating them in federal court no longer existed. <em>Id. </em>at 1400. The court noted that, \u201c[t]he claims could be brought very appropriately in the state court, or given the nature of the dispute and the statutory language, before even the state legislature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">PDF filed the complaint in this action on March 10, 1989, while the federal suit was still pending. After Ulaleo\u2019s death in early 1990, Emily \u2018Iwalani Naeole (Naeole) moved to intervene as a plaintiff, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>24(a). Naeole claimed an interest, as a native Hawaiian and a resident of the ahupua'a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> adjacent to Wao Kele \u2018O Puna, in the subject matter of the action, such that disposition of the action would, as a practical matter, impair or impede her interest, and that no other party adequately represented that interest. The circuit court denied Naeole\u2019s motion, finding that her \u201cinterests are adequately represented by Plaintiff Pele Defense Fund which remains as an existing party.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On December 13,1990, several months after the Ninth Circuit decision was announced, PDF filed an amended complaint, adding Campbell and True as defendants and modifying its prayer for relief to eliminate the request to declare the exchange a nullity. We summarize PDF\u2019s claims for relief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">1. Breach of trust under (a) \u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act, in violation of \u00a7 1983, and (b) article XII, \u00a7 4 of the Hawaii Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">2. Violation of due process under (a) the fourteenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, contrary to \u00a7 1983, and (b) article I, \u00a7 5 of the Hawaii Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">3. Violation of the right to free association under the first amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, \u00a7 4 of the Hawaii Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">4. Violation of article XII, \u00a7 7 by (a) the relinquishment of state lands on which native Hawaiians customarily and traditionally exercised subsistence, cultural and religious practices and (b) the continued denial of access into Wao Kele \u2018O Puna to native Hawaiian PDF members who seek access for cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tomarily and traditionally exercised subsistence, cultural and religious practices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">5. Violation of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 171-26 and 171-50;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">6. Violation of HRS chapter 195; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">7. Based on the foregoing violations, Campbell and True hold the exchanged lands subject to a constructive trust for the beneficiaries of the public lands trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The defendants raised a multitude of defenses, the most salient of which form the basis for the Order Granting Summary Judgment, including: sovereign immunity, statute of limitations, lack of standing, no private right of action, <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel, failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted, and absence of indispensable parties. The circuit court concluded, in its forty-one page order, that there are \u201cno material issues of relevant fact\u201d between PDF and the defendants and dismissed the action in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">I. Section 1983 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">PDF argues that state officials who violate \u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act may be sued in their official capacities for declaratory and injunctive relief under \u00a7 1983. The circuit court dismissed PDF\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims on the basis of sovereign immunity, PDF\u2019s lack of standing, the statute of limitations, and the <em>res judicata </em>effect of <em>Ulaleo v. Paty, </em>902 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1990). We acknowledge that sovereign immunity would not bar a \u00a7 1983 action brought against state officials in their official capacities prospectively to enjoin an alleged violation of \u00a7 5(f), and we find that PDF has standing to pursue such a claim. However, we also conclude that, in this case, PDF\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims are barred by the statute of limitations and <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>A. Right to Sue</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has long recognized that a claim may be brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983 to enforce federal rights created by \u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Price </em>v. <em>Akaka, </em>928 F.2d 824 (9th Cir. 1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>112 S. Ct. 436 (1991), <em>superseding </em>915 F.2d 469 (9th Cir. 1990); <em>Ulaleo, </em>902 F.2d at 1397; <em>Price </em>v. <em>State, </em>764 F.2d 623 (9th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1055 (1986); <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Homes Comm\u2019n (Keaukaha II), </em>739 F.2d 1467 (9th Cir. 1984). The Ninth Circuit had previously ruled that the Admission Act itself did not create an implied right of action under which a party could enforce the duties and obligations created by the Act in federal court. <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Homes Comm\u2019n (Keaukaha I), </em>588 F.2d 1216 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 826 (1979). One of the bases for the court\u2019s ruling was that it saw \u201cno federal purpose to be served by reading a private cause of action into the Admission Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224. The court found the action to be \u201ca matter of state concern\u201d and held it would be \u201cmost appropriate for Hawaii\u2019s laws and judicial system to deal with it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will, in this case, clarify the role of Hawaii\u2019s courts in enforcing the terms of the public lands trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">B. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">PDF asserts that it has standing to challenge the disposition of \u00a7 5(f) lands because its members have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>as a result of actions taken by state officials. The Ninth Circuit agreed in <em>UUdeo, </em>finding that PDF had standing to sue to enforce the terms of the \u00a7 5(f) trust. 902 F.2d at 1397.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We hold that PDF has standing to bring its claims in Hawaii courts, consistent with this court\u2019s decisions lowering standing barriers in cases of public interest. <em>See, e.g., In re Banning, </em>73 Haw. 297, 313, 832 P.2d 724, 732-33 (1992); <em>Akau v. Olohana Corp., </em>65 Haw. 383, 652 P.2d 1130 (1982); <em>Life of the Land </em>v. <em>Land Use Comm\u2019n, </em>63 Haw. 166, 623 P.2d 431 (1981); <em>In re Application of Hawaiian Elec. Co., </em>56 Haw. 260, 535 P.2d 1102 (1975). Regardless of the standing theory, \u201cthe crucial inquiry ... is \u2018whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of... [the court\u2019s] jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court\u2019s remedial powers on his behalf.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends v. Anderson, </em>70 Haw. 276, 281, 768 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1989) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>omitted). This court has adopted a broad view of what constitutes a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in cases in which the rights of the public might otherwise be denied hearing in a judicial forum. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 768 P.2d at 1299; <em>see also </em>Akau, 65 Haw. at 387-88, 652 P.2d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In <em>Akau, </em>we held \u201cthat a member of the public has standing to sue to enforce the rights of the public generally, if he can show that he has suffered an injury in fact, and that the concerns of a multiplicity of suits are satisfied by any means, including a class action.\u201d 65 Haw. at 388-89, 652 P.2d at 1134 (cited in <em>Hawaii's Thousand Friends, </em>70 Haw. at 283, 768 P.2d at 1299). A plaintiff has suffered injury in fact when (1) he or she has suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s actions, and (3) a favorable decision would likely provide relief for plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>Akau, </em>65 Haw. at 389, 652 P.2d at 1134-35 (citations omitted); <em>see also Hawaii's Thousand Friends, </em>70 Haw. at 283, 768 P.2d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The State argues that our holding in <em>Hawaii's Thousand Friends </em>requires a finding that PDF has suffered no injury in fact. We disagree. In that case, we held that Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends (HTF) lacked standing to bring claims on behalf of its members who were allegedly misled by advertisements run by the defendants. 70 Haw. at 284, 768 P.2d at 1300. We found that the injury arising out of the misrepresentation was a personalized injury, not suffered by the group in general. <em>Id. </em>Each HTF member would have relied differently on the alleged misrepresentation and would have suffered different injuries, necessitating different remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 768 P.2d at 1300.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In this case, the alleged \u00a7 5(f) violations are \u201cgeneralized\u201d injuries for which relief granted to the organization would provide a remedy to any individual member. In other words, if a court were to grant PDF an injunction remedying the State\u2019s breach of its trust obligations, PDF members and other trust beneficiaries would benefit indistinguishably. Furthermore, applying the three-pronged \u201cinjury in fact\u201d test, we conclude that PDF has adequately alleged that: (1) its members are beneficiaries of the public trust who have been economically and/or aesthetically injured by a transfer of trust lands in contravention of trust terms; (2) its injuries are traceable to the alleged breach of trust; and (3) the requested relief would be likely to remedy the injuries by giving beneficial use of the exchanged land to trust beneficiaries. Thus, we conclude that PDF has alleged facts sufficient to show that it has suffered injury in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In addition to injury in fact, <em>Akau </em>requires a showing that \u201cthe concerns of a multiplicity of suits are satisfied\u201d by allowing a plaintiff to sue to enforce the rights of the public. <em>Akau, </em>65 Haw. at 388-89, 652 P.2d at 1134. Although this case is not a class action suit like <em>Akau, </em>a multiplicity of suits may be avoided by allowing PDF to sue to enforce the State\u2019s compliance with the \u00a7 5(f) trust provisions, because granting a remedy to PDF would also provide relief to its members and other trust beneficiaries. Additionally, unless members of the public and native Hawaiians, as beneficiaries of the trust, have standing, the State would be free to dispose of the trust res without the citizens of the State having any recourse. <em>See Kapiolani Park Preservation Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>69 Haw. 569, 572, 751 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1988) (The court held that Kapiolani Park Preservation Society, a non-profit corporation whose members included neighbors and users of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>park, had standing to bring breach of trust claims under the circumstances of that case; we stated that \u201cthe citizens of this State would be left without protection, or a remedy, unless we hold, as we do, that members of the public, as beneficiaries of the trust, have standing to bring the matter to the attention of the court.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">C. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">PDF disputes the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that this suit was not timely under the statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 1983 actions. The critical inquiry, i.e., which Hawaii statute applies to \u00a7 1983 actions, is a matter of first impression.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We hold that the two-year statute of limitations set forth in HRS \u00a7 657-7 governs \u00a7 1983 actions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> rather than the six-year statute of limitations set forth in HRS \u00a7 657-1 (4).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Federal law dictates the characterization of claims brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 268 (1985). How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ever, the applicable statute of limitations is a matter of state law. <em>Id. </em>at 269. In <em>Wilson, </em>the United States Supreme Court decided that a single, most appropriate statute of limitations for all \u00a7 1983 claims should be selected in each state. <em>Id. </em>at 275. This conclusion was based on the \u201cfederal interests in uniformity, certainty, and minimization of unnecessary litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that \u201c\u00a7 1983 claims are best characterized as personal injury actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235 (1989), the Court reaffirmed that \u201ca State\u2019s personal injury statute of limitations should be applied to all \u00a7 1983 claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240-41 (citing <em>Wilson, </em>471 U.S. at 280). The Court again explained that it had, in <em>Wilson, </em>departed from its earlier mlings which had urged courts to pick the \u201cmost analogous\u201d and \u201cmost appropriate\u201d statute of limitations for the particular \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>Id. </em>at 239. The Court noted that the \u201cmost analogous\u201d method \u201cbred confusion and inconsistency ... and generated time-consuming litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\"><em>Owens </em>also resolved the question of which statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 1983 claims where a state has more than one statute of limitations for personal injury actions. <em>Id. </em>at 236. The Court held that the \u201cresidual or general personal injury statute of limitations applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, PDF argues that Hawaii\u2019s \u201cresidual\u201d statute of limitations in HRS \u00a7 657-1(4) applies, rather than the residual <em>personal injury </em>statute of limitations appearing in HRS \u00a7 657-7. However, <em>Owens </em>and two subsequent Ninth Circuit cases counsel us to reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">When discussing the \u201cresidual or general\u201d personal injury statute of limitations, the <em>Owens </em>Court was comparing general <em>personal injury </em>provisions with provisions that govern specific <em>personal injury </em>claims, such as statutes that cover particular intentional torts. <em>See, e.g., </em>HRS \u00a7 657-4 (1985) (governing libel and slander); HRS \u00a7 657-7.3 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1991) (governing medical torts); <em>see also Owens, </em>488 U.S. at 241, 243-48. The Ninth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>further clarified that when a state has a general personal injury statute of limitations, an even broader \u201ccatchall\u201d statute of limitations like HRS \u00a7 657-1 need not be considered. <em>See Del Percio v. Thornsley, </em>877 F.2d 785, 786 (9th Cir. 1989) (California\u2019s general personal injury statute applies to \u00a7 1983 actions, rather than its \u201ccatchall\u201d statute of limitations); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Seevers, </em>869 F.2d 425, 426 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 860 (1989) (Nevada\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 1983 actions and thus the residual statute of limitations need not be considered).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In Hawaii, HRS \u00a7 657-7 is the <em>\u201cgeneral\u201dpersonal injury </em>statute of limitations. This statute applies to \u201c[a]ctions for the recovery of compensation for damage or <em>injury to persons </em>or property\u201d and is distinguished from specific personal injury statutes like HRS \u00a7\u00a7 657^4 and 657-7.3. We agree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Owens </em>and conclude that the United States Supreme Court intended that a state\u2019s \u201ccatchall\u201d provision would apply only if there were no general personal injury statute. <em>See, </em>e.g., Del Percio, 877 F.2d at 786.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the two-year limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>tions period set forth in HRS \u00a7 657-7 applies to PDF\u2019s claims under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The statute of limitation runs from the date that PDF\u2019s cause of action accrued \u2014 that is, when PDF discovered or should have discovered the breach of trust, the injury to its members, and the connection between the breach and the injury. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 657-7; <em>cf. Yamaguchi </em>v. <em>The Queen\u2019s Medical </em>Center, 65 Haw. 84, 90, 648 P.2d 689, 693-94 (1982). Here, the alleged breach of trust arose out of the subject land exchange. The State and Campbell exchanged deeds on December 23,1985, but the exchange did not become effective until the legislature failed to disapprove it by April 23, 1986. PDF fails to challenge the lower court\u2019s finding that PDF officers and members knew of the land exchange by November 1985. Thus, PDF knew of the exchange on or before its effective date and the cause of action accrued on, and the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>limitations ran from, April 23, 1986.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Complaint, filed on March 10, 1989, was untimely with respect to all claims under \u00a7 1983. Alternative grounds for the dismissal of these claims also merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">D. <em>Res Judicata </em>effect of <em>Ulaleo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Ulaleo </em>v. <em>Paty, </em>902 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1990), and the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bar relitigation of PDF\u2019s\u00a7 1983claims. To explicate this holding, we first review the basic tenets of <em>res judicata. </em>This court has consistently recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">The judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is a bar to a new action in any court between the same parties or their privies concerning the same subject matter, and precludes the relitigation, not only of the issues which were actually litigated in the first action, but also of all grounds of claim and defense which might have been properly litigated in the first action but were not litigated or decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\"><em>Morneau </em>v. <em>Stark Enters., Ltd., </em>56 Haw. 420, 422-23, 539 P.2d 472, 474-75 (1975) (quoting <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Crockett, </em>51 Haw. 45, 55, 451 P.2d 814, 822 (1969) (quoting <em>In re Bishop Estate, </em>36 Haw. 403, 416 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">In <em>Morneau, </em>we also commented on the implications of the doctrine of collateral estoppel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">Collateral estoppel is an aspect of <em>res judicata </em>which precludes the relitigation of a fact or issue which was previously determined in a prior suit on a different claim between the same parties or their privies.. .. Collateral estoppel also precludes relitigation of facts or issues pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>viously determined when it is raised defensively by one not a party in a prior suit against one who was a party in that suit and who himself raised and litigated the fact or issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">56 Haw. at 423, 539 P.2d at 475 (citations omitted). These principles are tempered only by the prerequisite that a plaintiff have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the relevant issues. <em>See Morneau, </em>56 Haw. at 421-22, 539 P.2d at 474; <em>see also Allen </em>v. <em>McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 95 (1980) (noting a long recognized exception that \u201ccollateral estoppel cannot apply when the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted did not have a \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 to litigate that issue in the earlier case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">There is no question that PDF brought an official capacity suit in federal court against the defendant BLNR members on nearly identical \u00a7 1983 claims, although in the present case PDF no longer asks the court to void the land exchange. PDF suggests that, because the Ninth Circuit did not reach the merits of the breach of trust claims in <em>Ulaleo, </em>there is no preclusive effect in this case. However, in dismissing that suit on eleventh amendment grounds, the court held that PDF sought retrospective relief against the State for the breach of the public lands trust. <em>Ulaleo, </em>902 F.2d at 1398-1400. The finding that PDF sought retrospective relief is binding in this action. The significance of this binding effect is elucidated in our discussion of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity in Parts II. B. and II. C. of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Ninth Circuit ruling presents us with another facet of <em>res judicata. </em>That is, PDF may not escape the preclusive effect of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling by advancing a different remedial theory. \u201cThe rule against splitting a cause of action is an aspect of <em>res judicata </em>and precludes the splitting of a single cause of action or an entire claim either as to the theory of recovery or the specific relief demanded.\u201d <em>Bolte v. Aits, Inc., </em>60 Haw. 58, 60, 587 P.2d 810, 812 (1978) (citations omitted). Therefore, we hold that PDF is barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>from asserting its breach of \u00a7 5(f) trust and fourteenth amendment claims brought under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">II. Other Breach of Trust Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In addition to its \u00a7 1983 claims, PDF asserts breach of trust claims under Hawaii law. PDF correctly argues that the State of Hawaii has acknowledged its fiduciary duties and obligations as trustee of the public lands trust in article XII, \u00a7 4 of the Hawaii Constitution. Article XVI, \u00a7 7 of the constitution mandates that the \u00a7 5(f) trust provisions \u201cshall be complied with by appropriate legislation.\u201d The decision of this court will not render these provisions meaningless and will not leave the people of Hawaii without the means to hold their government to these promises. Therefore, we hold that PDF has a right to bring suit under the Hawaii Constitution to prospectively enjoin the State from violating the terms of the ceded lands trust. We further hold that PDF is not seeking to prospectively enjoin a constitutional violation in this case, but would have us turn back the clock and examine actions already taken by the State. The doctrine of sovereign immunity deters judges from this course in state as well as federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">A. Right to Sue Under the Hawaii Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The State argues that, because the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Admission Act creates no private implied right of action, there can be no private right of action to enforce the terms of the \u00a7 5(f) trust under Hawaii law. <em>See Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d 1216 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 826 (1979). We disagree. We have held, in a variety of contexts, that this court is not precluded from finding that the Hawaii Constitution affords greater protection than required by similar federal constitutional or statutory provisions. <em>See, e.g., State </em>v. <em>Kam, 69 </em>Haw. 483, 748 P.2d 372 (1988); <em>Hawaii Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>68 Haw. 55, 704 P.2d 888 (1985); <em>State v. Tanaka, </em>67 Haw. 658, 701 P.2d 1274 (1985); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>67 Haw. 126, 681 P.2d 553 (1984), <em>appeal after remand, 69 </em>Haw. 72, 734 P.2d 156 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>First, we review the grounds for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling in <em>Keaukaha I. </em>In reaching its conclusion that the Admission Act does not imply a private cause of action, the court analyzed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Rail Passenger Service Act which permits suits by the United States Attorney General, or in some cases, railroad employees. <em>Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d at 1220-21 (citing, <em>inter alia, National Railroad Passenger Corp. </em>v. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Railroad Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453 (1974)). The Supreme Court held that because the Rail Act creates . only a public cause of action and a narrow private cause of action, the legislature intended these to provide the exclusive remedies. <em>Id. </em>This presumption of an exclusive remedy, known as the <em>expressio unius </em>principle, yields to both legislative intent and the effectuation of the purposes of a statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1221 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Ninth Circuit also applied the four factors articulated in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66 (1975), to the Admission Act. The first element, that plaintiff is a \u201cmember of the \u2018class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,\u2019 \u201d was met. <em>Id. </em>at 1223. The second element, an indication of explicit or implicit legislative intent, was found to be lacking \u2014 the court applied the <em>expressio unius </em>presumption<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and noted the \u201cunusual\u201d use of a state\u2019s admission act to create a right to sue. <em>Id. </em>at 1223. The third element, consistency with the underlying statutory scheme, was thought to be a \u201cclose question,\u201d but was found not to support a private cause of action because the court saw \u201cno federal purpose to be served by reading a private cause of action into the Admission Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>1224. The fourth element, whether the cause of action is one \u201ctraditionally relegated to the States, in an area basically the concern of the States,\u201d was \u201ceasily\u201d concluded to militate against implying a private right to sue. <em>Id. </em>at 1222, 1224. As we noted earlier, the court found that action to be \u201ca matter of state concern\u201d and held it to be \u201cmost appropriate for Hawaii\u2019s laws and judicial system to deal with it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">..We are of the view that, while these reasons were compelling in the context of the enforceability of a federal statute, they do not support a similar finding with respect to the enforcement of article XII, \u00a7 4 of the Hawaii Constitution. <em>Cf. Huihui v. Shimoda, </em>64 Haw. 527, 531, 644 P.2d 968, 971 (1982) (\u201c[I]t is our obligation to-, interpret and enforce the state constitution as the highest court of this sovereign state \u2018not in total disregard of federal interpretations ..., but with reference to the wisdom of adopting these interpretations for our state.\u2019 \u201d). Article XII, \u00a7 4 was added to the Hawaii Constitution to expressly recognize the trust purposes and trust beneficiaries of the \u00a7 5(f) trust, clarifying that the State\u2019s trust obligations extend beyond the Hawaiian Homes Land Trust. <em>See </em>Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 59, Constitutional Convention of 1978, 2-3. And, despite the Ninth Circuit\u2019s findings that no purpose would be served by allowing private enforcement of the ceded land trust in federal court, we find that protecting the res of the public lands trust, thereby enforcing the mandates of our constitution, is appropriate in our state courts. This consideration undermines the argument that access to an enforcement remedy for breach of trust should be held exclusively by the United States Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We are also guided by our earlier decisions concerning lands held in public trust. In <em>Kapiolani Park Preservation Society </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>69 Haw. 569, 751 P.2d 1022 (1988), we held that members of the public, as trust beneficiaries, could sue to prevent the trustee, a government agency, from disposing of trust lands through leases or deeds in contravention of the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>a charitable trust.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>Kapiolani Park, </em>the court found that: (1) a government agency (the City) was the trustee of a public charitable trust; (2) the trustee did not file periodic accountings; (3) the trustee would not seek instructions of the court as to its duties; (4) a genuine controversy existed as to the trustee\u2019s power to enter into the lease transaction; and (5) the attorney general, as <em>parens patriae, </em>chose to support the City\u2019s actions, abandoning the defense of the possible rights of the public. <em>Id. </em>at 572,751 P.2d at 1025. Under those Circumstances, we held that unless members of the public could bring the matter to the attention of the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201cthe citizens of this State would be left without protection, or a remedy... [and] the City, with the concurrence of the attorney general, would be free to dispose, by lease or deed, of all, or part of, the trust comprising Kapiolani Park, as it chose, without the citizens of the City and State having any recourse to the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Although the case before us involves the ceded lands trust, rather than a charitable trust, the parallels are unmistakable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Here, we have a situation where the agency charged with the administration of a trust held for the benefit of native Hawaiians and members of the public has purportedly disposed of trust assets in violation of trust provisions and, if we were to adopt the position of the State, no one in the State of Hawaii would have the right to bring the matter before Hawaii\u2019s courts. As we said in <em>Kapiolani </em>Park, \u201c[s]uch a result is contrary to all principles of equity and shocking to the conscience of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 751 P.2d at 1025. Leaving aside for the moment the question of whether we can now review the State\u2019s consummated acts, we are of the firm conviction that our courts must be available to the citizens of Hawaii to avert such a purported breach of public trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">We find that the actions of state officials, acting in their official capacities, should not be invulnerable to constitutional scrutiny. Article XII, \u00a7 4 imposes a fiduciary duty on Hawaii\u2019s officials to hold ceded lands in accordance with the \u00a7 5(f) trust provisions, and the citizens of the state must have a means to mandate compliance. This is not to say, however, that article XII, \u00a7 4 creates a waiver of sovereign immunity such that money damages are available. <em>See Figueroa v. State, </em>61 Haw. 369, 604 P.2d 1198 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>(1979) (although a constitutional provision establishes enforceable rights or duties, it does not necessarily create a waiver of sovereign immunity). Nevertheless, as discussed in the following section, sovereign immunity may not always provide a defense for state officials when their actions are attacked as being unconstitutional. <em>See, e.g., W.H. Greenwell, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Department of Land and Natural Resources, </em>50 Haw. 207, 209, 436 P.2d 527, 528 (1968). Thus, we hold that PDF, whose members are beneficiaries of the trust, may bring suit for the limited purpose of enjoining state officials\u2019 breach of trust by disposal of trust assets in violation of the Hawaii constitutional and statutory provisions governing the public lands trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">B. Sovereign Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">PDF argues that sovereign immunity is not a bar to suit for injunctive relief when state officials acting in their official capacities act <em>ultra vires </em>of state and federal law. While we agree with this legal proposition, we disagree with PDF\u2019s further argument that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rulings on the strictures of the eleventh amendment are not relevant to our own principles of sovereign immunity. On the contrary, the eleventh amendment is the federal constitutional embracement of the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it makes the doctrine applicable to the federal courts. <em>See, e.g., Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 67 (1989) (citations omitted) (In discussing whether Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>intended to abrogate eleventh amendment immunities in \u00a7 1983 actions, the Court stated that \u201cmembers of the 42d Congress were familiar with common-law principles... [and t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity was a familiar doctrine at common law.\u201d); <em>Green v. Mansour, </em>474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985) (citations omitted) (\u201cThe Eleventh Amendment confirms that \u2018fundamental principle of sovereign immunity limits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III.\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In <em>W.H. Greenwell, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Department of Land and Natural Resources, </em>50 Haw. 207, 436 P.2d 527 (1968), we discussed Hawaii\u2019s sovereign immunity doctrine in a suit to enjoin DLNR\u2019s planned release of axis deer on the Big Island, allegedly in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the state and federal constitutions. The court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">It is the unquestioned rule that the State cannot be sued without its consent or waiver of its immunity in matters \u201cinvolving the enforcement of contracts, treasury liability for tort, and the adjudication of interest [sic] in property which has come unsullied by tort into the bosom of government.\u201d ... [However,] sovereign immunity may not be invoked as a defense by state officials who comprise an executive department of government when their action is attacked as being unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 208-09, 436 P.2d at 528 (citations omitted). Nor will sovereign immunity bar suits to enjoin state officials from violating state statutes. <em>See, e.g., Natatorium Preservation Committee v. Edelstein, </em>55 Haw. 55, 515 P.2d 621 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Subsequent decisions have further illustrated that the sovereign State is immune from suit for money damages, except where there has been a \u201cclear relinquishment\u201d of immunity and the State has consented to be sued. <em>See Washington v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos., </em>68 Haw. 192, 198, 708 P.2d 129, 134 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1169 (1986) (Acknowledging its earlier ruling in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Greenwell, </em>the court held that sovereign immunity was a bar to plaintiff\u2019s action because it \u201cdoes not involve an action seeking only to enjoin state officials from acting unconstitutionally.\u201d (Citations omitted)); <em>Big Island Small Ranchers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>State, </em>60 Haw. 228, 236, 588 P.2d 430, 436 (1978) (Plaintiffs\u2019 chapter 480 damages claims were held to be barred by sovereign immunity, because \u201cthe legislature has not made Chapter 480 explicitly applicable to the State, and since none of the allegations in the complaint claim that the State has consented to be sued upon this chapter, appellants can claim no relief under this theory.\u201d <em>Makanui </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>6 Haw. App. 397, 405-07, 721 P.2d 165, 171-72 (1986) (The ICA held that Hawaii had not waived its sovereign immunity from \u00a7 1983 damages liability, and those claims against the state and state officials in their official capacities were therefore barred.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>HRS chs. 661, 662, 673 and 674 (waiving the State\u2019s sovereign immunity in certain cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">This court has not previously tested the scope of the exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine recognized in <em>Greenwell. </em>We must do so in this case because, on its face, PDF\u2019s complaint requests only injunctive and declaratory relief, and not damages, against state officials acting in their official capacities. The <em>Green-well </em>exception has its genesis in <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(1908), which first held that the eleventh amendment does not bar a suit to enjoin as unconstitutional a state official\u2019s actions. <em>See Greenwell, </em>50 Haw. at 209, 436 P.2d at 528. <em>Young </em>has been the subject of many subsequent decisions to which we turn for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The rule in <em>Young, </em>which we adopt, makes an important distinction between prospective and retrospective relief.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> If the relief sought against a state official is prospective in nature, then the relief may be allowed regardless of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. <em>See, e.g., Papasan v. Allain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 278 (1986); <em>Green v. Mansour, </em>474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985). This is true \u201ceven though accompanied by a substantial ancillary effect on the state treasury.\u201d <em>Papasan, </em>478 U.S. at 278 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, relief that is \u201ctantamount to an award of damages for a past viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tion of... law, even though styled as something else,\u201d is barred by sovereign immunity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">As the Ninth Circuit observed in <em>Ulaleo, </em>\u201c[s]imply asking for injunctive relief and not damages <em>does not </em>clear the path for suit. The Supreme Court has recognized that the difference between retrospective and prospective relief \u2018will not in many instances be that between day and night.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ulaleo, 902 </em>F.2d at 1399 (quoting <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 667 (1974)). In the case before us, PDF has styled its prayer for relief as one for declaratory and injunctive relief, yet the question remains whether the effect on the state treasury would be \u201cancillary\u201d or would amount to virtual compensation for the past misconduct of state officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The claims for restoration of the Puna lands, via a constructive trust, are comparable to the claims that the U.S. Supreme Court held to be retrospective in <em>Papasan, </em>in which the plaintiffs argued that the sale of certain school trust lands in the 1850\u2019s, and the unwise investment of the proceeds, had violated the trust obligation to hold those lands for the benefit of the area\u2019s schoolchildren. 478 U.S. at 274. Plaintiffs sought: (1) a declaration that the state legislation implementing the land sales was void and unenforceable; (2) establishment of a fund to be held in trust for plaintiffs\u2019 benefit; or, alternatively, (3) other lands of the same value to be made available to the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 274-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The plaintiffs in <em>Papasan </em>argued that they only sought a prospective, injunctive remedy by requiring the state officials to provide appropriate trust income. <em>Id. </em>at 279. The Court held that \u201ccontinuing payment of the income from the lost corpus is essentially equivalent in economic terms to a one-time restoration of the lost corpus\u201d and no different than a monetary award, thus violative of the eleventh amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>In the instant case, PDF\u2019s request that the trust status of the exchanged lands be restored by means of a constructive trust is \u201cessentially equivalent\u201d to a nullification of the exchange and the return of the exchanged lands to the trust res. The effect on the state treasury would be direct and unavoidable, rather than ancillary, because imposing a constructive trust on lands now held by Campbell would require the State to compensate Campbell for its property. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. V; Haw. Const, art. I, \u00a7 20. We therefore hold that PDF\u2019s requested relief is, in effect, a request for compensation for the past actions of the BLNR members. All of PDF\u2019s claims against the defendant state officials which are based on the alleged illeg\u00e1lity of the subject land exchange, on either constitutional or statutory grounds, are barred by the State\u2019s sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">C. Collateral Estoppel Effect of <em>Ulaleo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In addition to our own conclusion that PDF seeks retrospective relief which is barred by sovereign immunity, we are bound by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s adjudication in <em>Ulaleo, </em>in which the Ninth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">The Complaint is that sometime in the past, the BLNR undertook an action, the land exchange, which allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>injured the plaintiffs by violating the trust of which the plaintiffs are beneficiaries. . . . The immediate relief plaintiffs seek would require the state to purchase the lands from its present holder by way of cash or other land. We hold that to grant the requested relief would be a retrospective remedy .... If the tmst duty was violated, it happened when the BLNR executed the exchange.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><em>Ulaleo, </em>902 F.2d at 1399-1400. Thus; the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction has previously determined the retrospective nature of PDF\u2019s \u201cillegal land exchange\u201d claims, and the state courts are precluded from relitigating this issue in the context of PDF\u2019s state law claims. <em>See, e.g., Morneau </em>v. <em>Stark Enters., </em>56 Haw. at 423, 539 P.2d at 475 (collateral estoppel precludes the relitigation of an issue which was decided in a prior suit on a different claim). PDF had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to argue that it was in fact seeking prospective relief, and reframing its prayer for relief does not entitle it to reargue claims based on the allegedly illegal land exchange. <em>See Bolte v. Aits, Inc., </em>60 Haw. 58, 587 P.2d 810 (1978); <em>see also Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90 (1980) (holding that a federal court cannot relitigate an issue already decided in state court when the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue in the earlier case).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In light of our rulings that PDF\u2019s breach of trust claims are barred by sovereign immunity and the preclusive effect of <em>Ulaleo, </em>we need not reach the question of whether this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dedman v. BLNR, </em>69 Haw. 255, 740 P.2d 28 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>485 U.S. 1020 (1988), also bars relitigation of claims arising out of the land exchange.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">D. Indispensable Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Campbell and True argue that the State is an indispensable party to any claim arising out of the land exchange. We agree. First, as alleged by the defendants, PDF has failed to appeal from the lower court\u2019s conclusion of law ruling that the State is an indispensable party to the breach of trust claims against Campbell and True. Issues not properly raised on appeal will be deemed to be waived. <em>Mahiai </em>v. <em>Suwa, </em>69 Haw. 349, 354, 742 P.2d 359, 364 (1987); <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>6 Haw. App. 505, 513-14, 729 P.2d 388, 395, <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>69 Haw. 8, 731 P.2d 149 (1986). Additionally, we find that there is no adequate remedy available for the alleged breaches of trust absent the trustee-State\u2019s participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">III. <em>Kalipi </em>Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">PDF argues that article XII, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution was violated in two ways: (1) by the <em>relinquishment of state lands </em>on which native Hawaiians customarily and traditionally exercised subsistence, cultural and religious practices; and (2) by the continued <em>denial of access </em>into Wao Kele \u2018O Puna to native Hawaiian PDF members who seek access for customarily and traditionally exercised subsistence, cultural and religious practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The former claim, which arises out of the land exchange between the State and Campbell, is barred by the State\u2019s sovereign immunity. <em>See </em>Part II. B., <em>supra. </em>Regardless of its constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>or statutory basis, any claim seeking to restore trust beneficiaries to the position they occupied prior to the exchange is retrospective in nature and cannot be brought against the State.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The latter claim, however, is independent of the land exchange and merits further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">PDF argues that it has standing to bring suit on behalf of its native Hawaiian members under article XII, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution. We agree for many of the same reasons that we held that PDF could bring breach of trust claims on behalf of its members. <em>See </em>Part I. B., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">It is undisputed that the rights of native Hawaiians are a matter of great public concern in Hawaii. This court has repeatedly demonstrated its fundamental policy that Hawaii\u2019s state courts should provide a forum for cases raising issues of broad public interest,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and that the judicially imposed standing barriers should be lowered when the \u201cneeds of justice\u201d would be best served by allowing a plaintiff to bring claims before the court. <em>Life of the Land v. The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>Land Use Comm'n, </em>63 Haw. 166, 176, 623 P.2d 431, 441 (1981) (\u201cOur touchstone remains \u2018the needs of justice.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Akau v. Olohana Corp., </em>65 Haw. 383, 652 P.2d 1130 (1982); <em>In re Application of Hawaiian Elec. Co., </em>56 Haw. 260, 535 P.2d 1102 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">As discussed earlier in this opinion, the needs of justice can be served only by recognizing plaintiffs that have a sufficient personal stake in the outcome of the litigation. This is measured by the three-part \u201cinjury in fact\u201d test set out in <em>Akau, </em>and followed in <em>Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends. Akau, </em>65 Haw. at 389, 652 P.2d at 1134-35 (citations omitted); <em>Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends, </em>70 Haw. at 283, 768 P.2d at 1299. Applying this test to PDF\u2019s article XII, \u00a7 7 claim, we find that PDF has adequately alleged that: (1) its members include native Hawaiians who are being injured by their exclusion from the undeveloped areas of the land now held by Campbell and True;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (2) the injuries are traceable to the alleged violation of their <em>\u201cKalipi </em>rights;\u201d and (3) injunctive relief is likely to remedy the injuries by requiring defendants to allow native Hawaiians access to undeveloped areas of the exchanged lands.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that PDF, a non-profit corporation whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>stated purpose is to perpetuate Hawaiian religion and culture, has standing to assert a violation of article XII, \u00a7 7 on behalf of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">B. Extension of <em>Kalipi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">PDF challenges the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of its claim that PDF\u2019s native Hawaiian members were entitled under Article XII, \u00a7 7 to enter Wao Kele \u2018O Puna and the Puna Forest Reserve to exercise traditional and customary rights. The basis of PDF\u2019s claim is that Wao Kele \u2018O Puna historically served as a common gathering area which could be utilized by tenants who resided in ahupua\u2019a abutting Wao Kele \u2018O Puna. Accordingly, PDF argues that its members should not need to establish that they are \u201clawful occupants\u201d of Wao Kele \u2018O Puna, although they must establish that they are tenants of ahupua\u2019a abutting Wao Kele \u2018O Puna and have traditionally used Wao Kele \u2018O Puna for gathering and other native Hawaiian practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">To determine the efficacy of this claim, we first review article XII, \u00a7 7 and the landmark opinion written by Chief Justice Richardson in <em>Kalipi </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Trust Co., </em>66 Haw. 1, 656 P.2d 745 (1982). <em>Kalipi </em>defined the rudiments of native Hawaiian rights protected by article XII, \u00a7 7, commonly known as <em>\u201cKalipi </em>rights.\u201d We now further explicate the scope of these rights under the Hawaii Constitution. Article XII, \u00a7 7 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">The State reaffirms and shall protect all rights, customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural and religious purposes and possessed by ahupua\u2019a tenants who are descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778, subject to the right of the State to regulate such rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Haw. Const, art. XII, \u00a7 7 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We first addressed this constitutional provision in <em>Kalipi, </em>66 Haw. 1, 656 P.2d 745 (1982). Kalipi sought to exercise traditional gathering rights in the Molokai ahupua'a of Ohia in which he owned a houselot. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 656 P.2d at 747.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Kalipi did not reside on the property, although he lived in the nearby Keawenui ahupua\u2018a. <em>Id. </em>Kalipi turned to three sources to support his claimed rights: (1) HRS \u00a7 7-1;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (2) HRS \u00a7 l-l;<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and (3) the \u201ckuleana\u201d reservation in the title to the lands in question. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 656 P.2d at 747. The court looked to article XII, \u00a7 7 for its \u201cobligation to preserve and enforce such traditional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, 656 P.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">We held that HRS \u00a7 7-1 contains two types of rights: \u201cgathering rights which are specifically limited and enumerated, and rights to access and water which are framed in general terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>at 5, 656 P.2d at 748. With respect to these rights, we stated that \u201clawful occupants of an ahupuaa may, for the puiposes of practicing native Hawaiian customs and traditions, enter undeveloped lands within the ahupuaa to gather those items enumerated in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 656 P.2d at 749. The \u201cundeveloped lands\u201d limitation was imposed by the court to balance the concept of land ownership with that of native rights. <em>Id. </em>Because Kalipi asserted his rights based on ownership of land and not residence in the ahupua\u2018a, we held that he was not entitled to exercise native gathering rights in Ohia. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 656 P.2d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We further held that HRS \u00a7 1-1\u2019s \u201cHawaiian usage\u201d clause may establish certain customary Hawaiian rights beyond those found in HRS \u00a7 7-1. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 656 P.2d at 750. Thus, we \u201cbelieve that the retention of a Hawaiian tradition should in each case be determined by balancing the respective interests and harm once it is established that the application of the custom has continued in a particular area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10,656 P.2d at 751. Noting testimony that \u201cthere have continued in certain ahupuaa a range of practices associated with the ancient way of life which required the utilization of the undeveloped property of others and which were not found in \u00a7 7-1,\u201d we held that HRS \u00a7 1-1 insures the continuance of these enduring practices \u201cfor so long as no actual harm is done thereby.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">With respect to Kalipi we held that, regardless of the source of his asserted rights, he was not entitled to exercise them because he did not live in the ahupua'a in which he sought to assert his claimed rights. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 656 P.2d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Like Kalipi, PDF members assert native Hawaiian rights based on article XII, \u00a7 7 and HRS \u00a7 1-1 in an ahupua\u2018a other than the ones in which they reside. Unlike Kalipi, PDF members claim these rights based on the traditional access and gathering patterns of native Hawaiians in the Puna region. Because Kalipi based his claims entirely on land ownership, rather than on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>practiced customs of Hawaiians on Molokai, the issue facing us is somewhat different from the issue in <em>Kalipi. </em>In <em>Kalipi, </em>we foresaw that \u201c[t]he precise nature and scope of the rights retained by \u00a7 1-1 would, of course, depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.\u201d 66 Haw. at 12, 656 P.2d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Thus, we upheld the rights of native Hawaiians to enter undeveloped lands owned by others to practice continuously exercised access and gathering rights necessary for subsistence, cultural or religious purposes so long as no actual harm was done by the practice. As found by the <em>Kalipi </em>court, and reported by the Constitutional Convention committee that drafted article XII, \u00a7 7, these rights are associated with residency within a particular ahupua'a. <em>See </em>Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 57, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of1978, </em>637.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The Committee on Hawaiian Affairs added what is now article XII, \u00a7 7 to reaffirm customarily and traditionally exercised rights of native Hawaiians, while giving the State the power to regulate these rights. <em>Id. </em>at 639. Although these rights were primarily associated with tenancy within a particular ahupua\u2018a, the committee report explicitly states that the new section \u201creaffirms <em>all </em>rights customarily and traditionally held by ancient Hawaiians.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640 (emphasis added). The committee contemplated that some traditional rights might extend beyond the ahupua\u2018a; \u201c[f]or instance, it was customary for a Hawaiian to use trails outside the ahupua\u2018a in which he lived to get to another part of the Island.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The committee intended this provision to protect the broadest possible spectrum of native rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Your Committee also decided that it was important to eliminate specific categories of rights so that the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>or legislature would not be constrained in their actions. <em>Your Committee did not intend to remove or eliminate </em>any statutorily recognized rights or <em>any rights of native Hawaiians from consideration under this section, but rather your Committee intended to provide a provision in the Constitution to encompass all rights of native Hawaiians, such as access and gathering. Your Committee did not intend to have the section narrowly construed or ignored by the Court. </em>Your Committee is aware of the courts\u2019 unwillingness and inability to define native rights, but in reaffirming these rights in the Constitution, your Committee feels that badly needed judicial guidance is provided and enforcement by the courts of these rights is guaranteed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 640 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">If, as argued by PDF,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the customary and traditional rights associated with tenancy in an ahupua'a extended beyond the boundaries of the ahupua\u2019a, then article XII, \u00a7 7 protects those rights as well. The drafters of the constitutional amendment emphasized that <em>all </em>such rights were reaffirmed and that they did not intend for the provision to be narrowly construed. We therefore hold that native Hawaiian rights protected by article XII, \u00a7 7 may extend beyond the ahupua'a in which a native Hawaiian resides where such rights have been customarily and traditionally exercised in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">PDF has presented evidence supporting the contention that the access and gathering patterns of tenants in Puna do not appear to have conformed to the usual notion that tenants exercised such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>rights only within the boundaries of a given ahupua\u2018a. Affidavits suggest that Puna region ahupua'a tenants accessed all portions of the Puna Forest Reserve for hunting and gathering, and were not limited to just the narrow corridor of their ahupua\u2018a. The practice of accessing the area as a common area for gathering and hunting by tenants of the Puna district may have commenced from the time of the Great Mahele and Kuleana Acts. One affiant testified that early trails accessed the Puna Forest Reserve from many ahupua\u2018a, the lava tube extending into the Puna Forest Reserve extends across several ahupua\u2018a and has entry points in more than one ahupua'a, and this area was associated with Pele and her family,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and not with any particular ahupua\u2018a.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Based on the evidence before the trial court, we find that there are genuine issues of material fact with respect to PDF\u2019s claim under article XII, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If it can be shown that Wao Kele \u2018O Puna was a traditional gathering area utilized by the tenants of the abutting ahupua'a, and that the other requirements of <em>Kalipi </em>are met in this case, then PDF members such as Ms. Naeole may have a right to enter the undeveloped areas of the exchanged lands to exercise their traditional practices. At a full trial on the merits, PDF will have an opportunity to develop the facts and present evidence to support its claim. Therefore, the summary judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">IY. Waiver of the Right to Free Association</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">PDF does not raise as error the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that PDF\u2019s right to free association under the first amendments of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>U.S. and Hawaii Constitutions has not been violated. We have previously held that an appellant waives or abandons any challenge to matters not raised on appeal. <em>Mahiai v. Suwa, </em>69 Haw. 349, 354, 742 P.2d 359, 364 (1987); <em>Meyer v.
