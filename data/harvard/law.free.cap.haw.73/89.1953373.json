Minor raises two points on appeal: 1) whether a butterfly knife is prohibited as a type of switchblade knife under HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 52; and 2) whether HRS \u00a7 134-52 is unconstitutionally vague as applied to butterfly knives. Based on the language and legislative history of \u00a7 134 \u2014 52, we conclude that a butterfly knife is not a switchblade knife, and therefore reverse the order of the family court. Consequently, we do not reach Minor\u2019s second contention of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">On August 11, 1989, a butterfly knife was found in Minor\u2019s possession. He was subsequently charged with possession of a switchblade knife in violation of HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Prior to trial, Minor entered an oral motion to dismiss the charge, contending that butterfly knives are not switchblade knives because they do not fall within the definition of switchblade knives set forth in \u00a7 134 \u2014 52. Minor argued that butterfly knives do not \u201copen[] automatically by [force] of inertia, gravity, or both.\u201d HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 52(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In response, the State called Officer Wayne Cambra to demonstrate the operation of a butterfly knife. Following the demonstration and argument, the family court concluded that the butterfly knife comes within the scope of HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 52 because it does open \u201cat least\u201d by gravity. Subsequently, Minor\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied. Based on the court\u2019s finding that he was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>possession of a butterfly knife, Minor was adjudicated as a law violator under HRS \u00a7571-11(1). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether a butterfly knife is a \u201cswitchblade knife\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 52. That section provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">Switchblade knives; prohibitions; penalty, (a) Whoever knowingly . . . possesses . . . any switchblade knife, being any knife having a blade <em>which opens automatically </em>(1) by hand pressure applied to a button or other device in the handle of the knife, or (2) <em>by operation of inertia, gravity, or both, </em>shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Minor contends that since the butterfly knife does not open \u201cautomatically by operation of inertia, gravity, or both,\u201d the statute is inapplicable. The State argues \u201cto open \u2018automatically,\u2019 does not preclude the use of some hand or wrist action in conjunction with inertia, or gravity, or both to open a butterflyknife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Our examination of the butterfly knife in issue reveals that the knife has a split metal handle which encases a single-edged blade when in a closed position. The knife may be locked in the closed position by using a metal safety clasp at the base of the handle. The clasp keeps the halves of the handle together. In order to open the knife, the clasp must be unlocked; then, both halves are folded away from each other until they meet, exposing the blade. By holding both halves of the handle firmly together, the blade is then in a secured position to be used. The metal clasp, which locks the handle in a closed position, may also be used to lock the handle in the open position.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>At trial, a police officer demonstrated the speed with which the butterfly knife could be put into operation. In describing the demonstration for the record, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Your Honor, for the record, the knife can be clasped in one hand with the safety hooked on the bottom. Even if the safety is hooked, it can be released with one hand \u2014 with the small finger of the hand, held \u2014 turned around \u2014 one \u2014 one side of the blade held, turned around, flipped over and <em>automatically caught with the other hand, </em>exposing the blade in just a few seconds. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In our examination, we manipulated the knife and determined that the blade can be positioned for use with one hand or, as the officer demonstrated, with two hands. We agree that either method of operation can be performed in a few seconds. However, we disagree with the accuracy of the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of <em>\u201cautomatically </em>caught with the other hand.\u201d In context, such a maneuver is clearly manual and not \u201cautomatic.\u201d Some practice is required in order to develop the requisite skill to position the blade for use in a matter of seconds, whether using one or both hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">There are no Hawaii cases that address the issue in this case and review of the legislative history of HRS \u00a7 134-52 does not expressly indicate whether the intent of the legislature was to include butterfly knives under the statute. However, the history of the statute does reveal that the statute is based on the Federal Switch Blade Knife Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1241. We note that the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cswitchblade knife\u201d is identical to HRS \u00a7 134-52.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We agree with the State that \u201cthe language [of the legislative history] suggests that the Hawaii legislature intended the same result as the federal statute.\u201d State\u2019s Answering Brief at 13. The State cites language from the federal legislative history which indicates that Congress intended to prohibit not only switchblade knives but \u201cother concealed-blade knives which open by operation of inertia or gravity or both,\u201d which like switchblades are \u201cquick-opening knives [used] for criminal purposes[.]\u201d State\u2019s Answering Brief at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The district court in <em>Taylor </em>v. McManus, 661 F. Supp. 11 (E.D. Tenn. 1986), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>848 F.2d 715 (6th Cir. 1988), was faced with the identical issue as in this case. There, Taylor, an importer of \u201cBalisong\u201d or butterfly knives, brought action requesting the court to declare that such knives, which had been seized by Customs Service officers, were not switchblades within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1241(b). Looking to the legislative history of the federal switchblade act for guidance, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">In examining the congressional record, it seems obvious that congress intended to prohibit knives which opened automatically, ready for use. Rep. Kelly, for example, described the switchblade \u201cas a weapon (which) springs out at the slightest touch and is ready for instant violence.\u201d <em>Switchblade Knives: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, </em>House of R\u00e9p., 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 13, 29 (1958). She also noted that the prohibited gravity knife opens and \u201canchors in place automatically. Every bit as fast as the switchblade, it has proved to be as effective a killer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Similarly, Rep. Delaney described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>prohibited gravity knives as \u201cknives (which) open <em>and lock </em>automatically at a quick flick of the wrist.\u201d 104 CONG.Rec., 85th Cong., 2nd [sic] Sess. 12398 (June 26, 1958) (emphasis supplied). Apparently, then, Congress was not concerned with whether the knife\u2019s blade would <em>merely be exposed by gravity. </em>Instead, <em>they intended \u201copen\u201d to mean \u201cready for use\u201d, </em>[emphasis added] as exhibited in Rep. Kelly\u2019s testimony that the switchblade opened \u201cready for instant violence\u201d and her and Rep. Delaney\u2019s comments that the gravity knife opened <em>and locked </em>automatically [emphasis in original]. While the Court does not intend to read into the Statute a requirement that the blades \u201clock\u201d automatically, it does seem apparent that Congress intended \u201copen\u201d to mean \u201cready for use\u201d. Obviously a knife that has not locked into an open position is not ready for use. Since the Balisong knives cannot be used until the second handle is manually folded back and clasped, the Court finds that they do not open automatically by force of gravity or inertia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">661 F. Supp. at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The district court in <em>Taylor </em>found that butterfly knives were not prohibited switchblades under the federal definition of switchblade knife. The court found that \u201cthe knives do not operate automatically since they require at least two manual operations even after the blade is exposed: (1) grasping and folding the second handle and (2) fastening the clasp which locks the handles together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">We acknowledge that the holding of the district court was reversed by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but we note that the reversal was based on a standard of review of the Customs Service\u2019s decision in its interpretation of a statute and its regulation. The court of appeals stated that \u201cthe construction of [a] statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>deference----If the agency\u2019s construction is a reasonable one, the court should give deference to it.\u201d 848 F.2d at 718. The court of appeals explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">[w]hile it may be reasonable to interpret the legislative history and the language of the statute [as] not to include these Balisong knives in question because they require some additional hand movements to be ready to use, we cannot set aside the Customs Service\u2019s <em>equally rational </em>interpretation of the statute and its regulations issued thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 720 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Furthermore, the knife in <em>Taylor </em>was a double-bladed knife, and therefore different than the single-bladed knife at issue in this case. The <em>Taylor </em>court did not determine that the butterfly knives were per se illegal under the Federal Switch Blade statute. On the contrary, since \u201c[t]he government indicated that had the knives been \u2018designed with a single-edge blade and were primarily used for utilitarian purposes\u2019 rather than .\u2018double-edge stiletto-style blades\u2019 [that] they would have been admitted[J\u201d the court permitted the importer to modify the knives from double-edge to single-edge blades to comply with the Customs Service\u2019s regulations. <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the <em>Taylor </em>holding, the butterfly knife in the present case would have passed both the Customs Service\u2019s and the court\u2019s scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Moreover, we note that the District Court for the District of Oregon held that butterfly knives were not prohibited under the Federal Switch Blade Act, stating: \u201cAlthough a person with the requisite skill can rapidly open a Balisong knife with one hand, the knives do not have blades which open automatically by operation of inertia, gravity, or both.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>661 F. Supp. at 13 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>1,044 Balisong Knives, </em>Civ. No. 70-110 (D.C. Oregon 1970)).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AsE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Tim T. Tate (Theodore Y. H. Chinn </em>on the brief), Deputy Public Defenders, for Juvenile-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b108-7\"><em>Alexa D. M. Fujise, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for Appellee State of Hawaii.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AWE\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We find that the user of the butterfly knife in this case is required to use more than just a \u201cflick of the wrist\u201d to make it operational. Thus, we conclude that it is not a knife \u201cwhich [blade] opens automatically ... by operation of inertia, gravity, or both[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 134-52. Accordingly, the order of the family court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-14\"> HRS \u00a7571-11(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-15\">Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>(1) Concerning any person who is alleged to have committed an act prior to achieving eighteen years of age which would constitute a violation or attempted violation of any federal, state, or local law or municipal ordinance.
