The court revoked appellant\u2019s probation on account of his dangerousness after appellant failed to comply with a term of probation requiring he maintain residential treatment with the Hawaii Addiction Center (HAC) until clinically discharged. Appellant argues that under our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nakamura, 59 </em>Haw. 378, 581 P.2d 759 (1978), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 706-625(c) (Supp. 1991) requires willful or intentional failure to comply with a term of probation before revocation can take place. He therefore asserts that the court could not revoke his probation because the State stipulated that his expulsion from HAC was not caused by any willful or intentional acts on his part. Appellant also maintains that in making the decision to revoke, the court should not have considered his prior arrest for Abuse of Family and Household Member where that arrest had already formed the basis of an earlier resentencing decision. Finally, appellant objects to the State\u2019s failure to provide notice that there were grounds for revocation in addition to his failure to maintain residence at HAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We find that the circuit court had the discretion to consider appellant\u2019s dangerousness, as well as his arrest for Abuse of Household Member in determining whether appellant\u2019s failure to comply with a condition of probation was inexcusable within the meaning of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 706-625(c). However, we remand the case for rehearing with the requirement that, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 706-625(b) (1985), appellant be afforded proper notice of the grounds for revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">On December 21, 1988, appellant was indicted and charged with sexually assaulting a friend\u2019s 10-year-old daughter. He was found guilty and sentenced to 15 consecutive weekends of incarceration and five years probation. Among the conditions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>appellant\u2019s probation were that he remain arrest and drug-free, and that he submit to treatment in a residential or outpatient mental health program until clinically discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In May of 1990 appellant was arrested for the offense of Abuse of Household Member in violation of HRS \u00a7 709-906, and in June 1990, was convicted of Driving Under the Influence in violation of HRS \u00a7 291-4. The State subsequently filed a motion to revoke probation. At the hearing, appellant notified the court that he had been accepted by the Hawaii Addiction Center, a residential drug and alcohol treatment program. The court did not revoke his probation; instead, he was resentenced to a new term of probation under the same conditions as his previous sentence, with the additional condition that he maintain residential treatment in HAC until clinically discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">When the HAC discovered his sexual offense conviction appellant was terminated from the program. The State filed a second motion for revocation, alleging as the sole basis, that appellant had failed to maintain treatment at HAC until clinically discharged. At the hearing the State stipulated that appellant had not been terminated from the program through any willful or intentional actions of his own. The court heard testimony that appellant was dangerous because he was very likely to repeat his sexual offense and that the only appropriate treatment was through the Department of Corrections and required a year of incarceration. The State also introduced evidence that there had been a family court termination of appellant\u2019s parental rights. In addition, the court on its own motion considered appellant\u2019s arrest for Abuse of Household Member that had served as a basis for the prior revocation of appellant\u2019s probation. The circuit court, based on appellant\u2019s dangerousness to the community, found that appellant had inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial term of probation. The court revoked appellant\u2019s probation and resentenced him to concurrent terms of. five and ten years of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Appellant urges that under our decision in <em>Nakamura, </em>a court may revoke probation under HRS \u00a7 706-625(c) for inexcusable failure to comply with the terms of probation only where the failure is caused by the defendant\u2019s intentional or willful actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Appellant reads our decision in <em>Nakamura </em>too narrowly. The defendant in <em>Nakamura </em>was unable to comply with the requirement that he enroll in Habilitat when the program rejected his application because he had visited his mother for a few hours after his release from jail contrary to a directive that he proceed directly to the program. In that case, we reversed the revocation, finding that in light of Habilitat\u2019s arbitrary rejection of defendant\u2019s application there was \u201ca serious question as to whether the defendant <em>inexcusably </em>failed to comply\u201d with the terms of his probation. <em>Nakamura, </em>59 Haw. at 381, 581 P.2d at 762 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s reading of the case, the willfulness of th\u00e9 defendant in <em>Nakamura </em>was only one of the factors we considered in determining whether his failure to enroll in Habilitat was inexcusable within the terms of HRS \u00a7 706-628(1). In arriving at our decision we also looked to evidence showing that, aside from the failure to enroll in Habilitat, defendant\u2019s conduct was exem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>plary and \u201centirely consistent with the rehabilitative objectives of probation.\u201d Moreover, we considered a counselor\u2019s opinion that defendant had reevaluated his direction in life, another counselor\u2019s recommendation that probation continue, and the opinion of defendant\u2019s probation officer that the defendant could function satisfactorily in the community without participating in Habilitat. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 581 P.2d at 762. Thus, in addition to defendant\u2019s willfulness, <em>Nakamura </em>also considered the rehabilitative and protective objectives of probation relevant to determine whether defen2 dant\u2019s failure to enroll in Habilitat was inexcusable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We believe <em>Nakamura </em>is entirely consistent with legislative intent in enacting HRS \u00a7 706-625. The section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">(a) The court. . . may revoke probation, reduce or enlarge the conditions of a sentence of probation, pursuant to the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the conditions and the provisions of section 706-627.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">(c) The court shall revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the order or has been convicted of a felony. The court may revoke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>suspension of sentence or probation if the defendant'has been convicted of another crime other than a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">It is not clear from the language of this section to what extent, if any, the legislature intended to restrict a court\u2019s decision to revoke probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">In interpreting statutes the primary duty of this court is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent. The fundamental starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. <em>State </em>v. <em>Briones, </em>71 Haw. 86, 92, 784 P.2d 860, 863 (1989). HRS \u00a7 1-16 (1985) provides that \u201c[l]aws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the probation provisions of chapter 706 may be clearly discerned when the statutes themselves are examined. HRS \u00a7 706-625 requires that a court deciding whether to impose probation shall consider the sentencing objectives set forth by the legislature under \u00a7 706-606 (Supp. 1991). These objectives include protection of the public, provision of just punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is further evident that the legislature considers probation a privilege which must not be awarded under circumstances where there is an undue risk of harm to the community, where the rehabilitative objectives of probation will not be met, or where punitive and deterrent objectives outweigh rehabilitative concerns. For example, the authority to grant probation is termed the \u201c[authority to withhold [a] sentence of imprisonment;\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a court may not award probation to defendants convicted of the more serious felony offenses;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a majority of the factors which a court must consider in deciding whether to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>probation, are relevant to determine whether the defendant will be amenable to rehabilitation or likely to repeat his crime;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the mandatory conditions of probation enable the State to closely monitor the activities of the defendant and include the condition that the defendant shall not commit another crime during the term of probation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Appellant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 706-625 would not fully address the legislature\u2019s concerns in enacting the probation statutes. A defendant\u2019s willfulness is an indicator of culpability, and would be relevant solely on whether a court adequately considered the legislature\u2019s punitive and deterrent objectives. Appellant\u2019s construction would frustrate the legislature\u2019s protective and rehabilitative purposes by making it impossible for the court to revoke probation where there exist no appropriate rehabilitative programs in the community or where the defendant poses an unreasonable threat of harm to the community, so long as the defendant has not intentionally violated any of the terms of probation. Such a limitation would further frustrate the objectives of the legislature by providing a strong disincentive for courts to exercise their discretion to withhold sentences of incarceration and grant probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Therefore, we hold that under HRS \u00a7 706-625(c) and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Nakamura </em>the circuit court was not limited to an assessment of appellant\u2019s culpability and could properly consider evidence of appellant\u2019s dangerousness, including his prior arrest for Abuse of Household Member, in determining whether failure to continue residential treatment in HAC was inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Appellant also argues that he had no notice that the court would be considering grounds for revocation other than his failure to maintain residence at HAC.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A35\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Jocelyn Abanes (Emmanuel G.

That on or about August 3, 1990, the Defendant was terminated from the Hawaii Addiction Center, before clinically discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Under <em>Nakamura, </em>the mere fact of appellant\u2019s discharge from HAC, with nothing else, would be an inadequate basis upon which to revoke his probation. HRS \u00a7 706-625(b) required that appellant be informed of the grounds for revocation in addition to the mere fact of his discharge from the drug treatment program that supported the State\u2019s motion for revocation. Thus, we vacate the order revoking appellant\u2019s probation and remand the case for rehearing upon the State\u2019s providing proper notice under HRS \u00a7 706-625(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> In <em>Nakamura </em>we construed HRS \u00a7 706-628(1) (Spec. Supp. 1975) which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">(1) At any time before the discharge of the defendant or the termination of the period of probation or suspension of sentence, the court, if satisfied that the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the order or if he has been convicted of another crime, may revoke the suspension or probation and sentence or resentence the defendant, as provided in subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">HRS \u00a7 706-628 was repealed in 1985 by legislation that combined the section with others to form \u00a7 706-625. <em>See </em>Hse.
