We answer this question in the negative and hold that the issue of whether a \u201cgeneral damages only\u201d settlement duplicates TDI benefits paid to an insured\u2019s employee is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">As a result of a June 15, 1989 car accident, Ricardo D. Esperanza, Jr. (Esperanza) received $4,641.13 in TDI benefits from Pacific Insurance Company, Ltd. (Pacific), the TDI insurer for Esperanza\u2019s employer. Pacific gave notice of its subrogation and lien rights for TDI benefits, on December 21, 1989, to Esperanza and the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, Island Insurance Co. (Island). On June 19, 1990, the tortfeasor and Island settled with Esperanza, for general damages only ($52,500), without suit being filed. The Release of All Claims executed by Esperanza and his wife states, \u201c[t]his is for general damages release non-duplicative of no-fault, medical and loss of wages.\u201d The Complaint alleges that, based upon HRS \u00a7 392-46, Pacific is entitled to recover the full amount of the temporary disability benefits that it paid to Esperanza.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Pacific and Esperanza filed motions for summary judgment on February 22, 1991 and February 25, 1991, respectively. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Without a hearing, the district court entered a Ruling on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment which (1) granted Pacific\u2019s motion, (2) denied Esperanza\u2019s motion, and (3) ordered that judgment be entered for Pacific against Esperanza in the amount of $4,641.13, plus costs. The basis for the court\u2019s ruling was, in relevant part:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">This Court finds this case analogous to the facts of <em>PETERS </em>v. WEATHERWAX, 69 Haw. 21, 731 P.2d 157 (1987). As Justice Nakamura found in <em>PETERS, </em>this Court finds that it would constitute unjust enrichment to allow Defendant Esperanza to use the Release which is attached as Exhibit E to Plaintiff\u2019s MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT and as Exhibit A to Defendant\u2019s MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT to defeat the lien in favor of Plaintiff imposed upon Defendant by Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 392-46. To prevent such unjust enrichment, this Court finds that it is appropriate to restitution [sic] to Plaintiff of the amount of the TDI payments made to Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">On May 13, 1991, the court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law echoing its earlier ruling and a judgment awarding Pacific $4,691.13 (including costs of $50). Esperanza timely appeals from the judgment entered in favor of Pacific upon the district court\u2019s ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">On appeal from an award of summary judgment, we apply the same standard as in the trial court\u2019s determination of the summary judgment motion. <em>Cuba </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>71 Haw. 627, 631, 801 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>P.2d 1208, 1211 (1990) (citing <em>First Hawaiian Bank v. Weeks, </em>70 Haw. 392, 396, 772 P.2d 1187, 1190 (1989)). To affirm the judgment for Pacific, we must find that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that Pacific is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Esperanza argues that Pacific\u2019s subrogation and lien rights pursuant to HRS \u00a7 392-46 apply only to the extent that the settlement includes payment for wage loss. The language of the statute supports this position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Subrogation rights against third parties. If any individual who has received benefits under this chapter is entitled to recover damages from a third person who is responsible for the sickness or accident causing the disability, ... the insurer . . . providing disability benefits shall be subrogated to, and have a lien upon, the rights of the individual against the third party <em>to the extent that the damages include wage loss </em>during the period of disability for which temporary disability benefits were received in the amount of such benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">HRS \u00a7 392-46 (1985) (emphasis added). In interpreting HRS \u00a7 392-46, we must give effect to the intent of the legislature. <em>See, e.g., Kaiser Hawaii Kai Dev. Co. v. City &amp; County, </em>70 Haw. 480, 483, <em>777 </em>P.2d 244, 246 (1989). The legislative history does not contain any discussion of the subrogation and lien rights. However, HRS \u00a7 392-2 indicates that the \u201c[TDI] chapter shall be liberally construed in light of the stated reasons for its enactment and its declared purpose.\u201d HRS \u00a7 392-2 (1985). The stated purpose of the TDI statute is to \u201cfill the existing gaps in protection\u201d and assure that working people who are disabled off the job will get \u201creasonable compensation for wage loss\u201d when they are not otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>protected from such loss. <em>Id. </em>In light of this purpose, we interpret HRS \u00a7 392-^16 to provide subrogation and lien rights only when an insured receives duplicate payments for wage loss. To hold otherwise would merely create a different \u201cgap\u201d in compensation which would negate the intention of the legislature. Thus, we conclude that the statute gives Pacific only the right to recover settlement monies paid to Esperanza for lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Pacific argues that it gave notice of its lien to Esperanza in compliance with HRS \u00a7 663-10<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Esperanza should not be permitted to evade the lien by labelling the release \u201cfor general damages only.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court apparently agreed with Pacific and determined that, in accordance with <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Weatherwax, </em>69 Haw. 21, 731 P.2d 157 (1987), Esperanza would be unjustly enriched (as a matter of law) if he did not reimburse Pacific the full amount of TDI benefits paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Although the lower court found this case analogous to the facts of <em>Peters, </em>review of that case reveals an important difference. After Peters was injured in an auto accident, he received medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>assistance from the Department of Social Services and Housing (DSSH). <em>Peters, </em>69 Haw. at 23, 731 P.2d at 159. A lawsuit followed and, after the circuit court denied the State\u2019s motion to intervene,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a $255,000 \u201cgeneral damages only\u201d settlement was reached between Peters and the tortfeasor. <em>Id. </em>at 23-25, 731 P.2d at 159-60. Only after the settlement and release documents were signed did the court belatedly grant the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration and allow the intervenor\u2019s complaint to be filed. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 731 P.2d at 160. Ultimately, the circuit court held the State had no claim for special damages against the defendantstortfeasors. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 731 P.2d at 160-61. The State was not seeking recovery from Peters himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On appeal, this court held that the right to recover medical expenses from the tortfeasor was not Peters\u2019 to waive. 69 Haw. at 28-29, 731 P.2d at 162.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the unjust enrichment that the <em>Peters </em>court referred to was that of the defendants, not Peters. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 731 P.2d at 162. The court explained, \u201cdefendants may have discharged their tort liability for less than what was just in the circumstances at the expense of the State; and it would then be unjust for them to retain the benefit of the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>assumption of the obligation to pay the accident victim\u2019s medical bills.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The obvious difference between this case and <em>Peters </em>is that here the benefit provider is seeking recovery from the accident victim, not the tortfeasor who may have been unjustly enriched at the provider\u2019s expense. The district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Peters </em>to find that Esperanza was unjustly enriched, as a matter of law, is unwarranted. However, the facts and issues in another Hawaii Supreme Court decision are more analogous to those presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">In <em>First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>67 Haw. 165, 681 P.2d 569 (1984), we rejected the Intermediate Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the subrogation provision of the no-fault statute, HRS \u00a7 294-7,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> imposes a burden on the insured to show that he or she settled and released his or her tort claim in good faith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After Jackson and his wife sued the tortfeasor for $ 110,000 in general damages and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial, the Jacksons and the tortfeasor executed a $25,000 \u201cgeneral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>damages only\u201d settlement agreement and release. 67 Haw. at 166, 681 P.2d at 570. Jackson\u2019s insurer, First Insurance, sued him for reimbursement of one-half of the no-fault benefits paid. Id. Jackson argued that the release was conclusive and binding; the trial court agreed and entered summary judgment for Jackson. <em>Id. </em>at 167, 681 P.2d at 570. This court reversed, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">The issue in the case is whether the settlement duplicated no-fault benefits already paid to appellee. This is an issue of fact. Since the terms of the release are not conclusive and binding as a matter of law, they are only evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">... On remand, <em>the insurer </em>must prove factually that the settlement duplicated, in whole or in part, the no-fault benefits it had already paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Although this case stems from a different statutory provision, the facts and issues are quite similar.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We reject both (1) Esperanza\u2019s argument that the release is unambiguous and conclusive evidence that the settlement did not compensate him for wage loss and (2) Pacific\u2019s argument that the settlement duplicated the TDI benefits paid to Esperanza, as a matter of law. In light of our decision in <em>Jackson, </em>we hold that Pacific must prove factually (1) that the settlement duplicated the TDI benefits paid for lost wages and (2) the extent of the duplication.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b423-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Erlinda Dominguez, Thomas J. Kaster, </em>and <em>Thomas E. Walsh </em>for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b423-8\"><em>Colleen K. Hirai </em>and <em>Diane W. Wong </em>of Libkuman, Ventura, Ayabe, Chong &amp; Nishimoto for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"A2u\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">We, therefore, remand the case with directions that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact on the issue of Pacific\u2019s HRS \u00a7 392-46 lien rights against Esperanza. Pacific can only recover from Esperanza the amount, if any, that Island paid him for lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the May 13,1991 judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\"> The court also ruled that even had Esperanza prevailed upon his motion for summary judgment, HRS \u00a7 431:10-242 would not allow the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in this case since this is not a situation where the insurance company is contesting its liability under the insurance policy. However, this issue is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\"> \u00a7 663-10 Collateral Sources; protection for liens and rights of subrogation. In <em>any civil action in </em>tort, the court, before any judgment or stipulation to dismiss the action is approved, shall determine the validity of any claim of a lien against the amount of the judgment or settlement by any person who files timely notice of the claim to the court or to the parties in the action .... As used in this section, lien means a lien arising out of a claim for payments made or indemnified from collateral sources for costs and expenses arising out of the injury which is the subject of the <em>civil action in tort.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">HRS \u00a7 663-10 (Supp. 1991) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Although not central to this appeal, we note that HRS \u00a7 663-10 only triggers action by a court, prior to judgment or dismissal, in a civil action in tort. In this case, Esperanza settled with the tortfeasor and her insurer without filing a lawsuit and thus, HRS \u00a7 663-10 is not necessarily implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-12\"> Pacific notes that the $52,500 settlement amount was within Island's policy limits of $300,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> The State wanted to intervene as a party plaintiff to establish a HRS \u00a7 346-37 lien. HRS \u00a7 346-37 (1985) supplies the means by which DSSH may recover medical assistance benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">If the department has provided medical assistance... to a person who was injured... under circumstances creating a tort or other liability against some third person, the department shall have a right to recover from the third person an amount not to exceed the amount of medical assistance ... furnished ____The department shall as to this right be subrogated to any right or claim that a claimant... has against such third person for special damages to the extent of the amount of medical assistance ... furnished ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\"> \u201cAlthough, as between debtor and creditor, the debt may be extinguished, yet, as between the person who has paid the debt and the other parties, the debt is kept alive by the doctrine of subrogation____\u201d Peters, 69 Haw. at 29, 731 P.2d at 162 (quoting H.

Another part of the ICA opinion declaring that \u201cthe insurer has no right to pursue the tortfeasor for any portion of the no-fault benefits paid\u201d was expressly overruled in <em>Grain Dealers Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Insurance Co., </em>70 Haw. 211, 768 P.2d 226 (1989).

However, the issues on appeal concerned only the no-fault insurer\u2019s claims against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer and that case provides little guidance on the question of Esperanza\u2019s liability to Pacific.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
