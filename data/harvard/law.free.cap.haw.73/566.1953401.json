While we disagree with the circuit court\u2019s grounds for ruling in favor of Brooks, we conclude for other reasons that the circuit court correctly entered judgment in her favor. Therefore, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">Minn and Brooks were married on December 27,1970. There were no children by the marriage. Subsequently, on December 22, 1980, they executed a property settlement agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(PSA) entitled \u201cAgreement Incident to and in Contemplation of Divorce.\u201d The PSA recited that the \u201cwish and desire\u201d of the parties was \u201cto effect a final and complete settlement of [the parties\u2019] respective property rights, interest, claims and obligations arising out of their marital relationship\u201d and that the PSA would only have \u201cforce or effect\u201d if approved by \u201csuch court... of competent jurisdiction as shall hereafter hear any petition seeking the dissolution of [their] marriage ....\u201d Regarding the division of marital property, the PSA provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[Minn], shall pay to [Brooks] in settlement of [Brooks\u2019] marital claims the sum of Sixty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($60,000.00) in accordance with the terms of a promissory note [the Note] attached hereto as Exhibit A.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The PSA was approved by the family court and incorporated into a final divorce decree entered on February 9, 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Minn\u2019s obligation to make installment payments to Brooks, pursuant to the terms of the Note, commenced upon entry of the decree. Minn failed to make any installment payments to Brooks, and on September 28, 1989, Brooks filed a complaint in circuit court against Minn, seeking collection of the amounts due her under the PSA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 12, 1990, Brooks moved for summary judgment on her complaint, and by order entered October 5,1990, the circuit court partially denied the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 27, 1990, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Brooks filed an amended complaint in which she deleted Count I of the original complaint and added a claim for breach of contract pursuant to the Note executed by Minn on January 1,1981. In substance, the new count set forth a claim for relief in contract based on the Note independent of the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">On August 20, 1991, following a bench trial conducted on May 17, 1991, the trial court, applying the six-year limitations period contained in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 657-1(1) (1985), issued findings of fact (FOFs) and conclusions of law (COLs) upon which it based its judgment that Brooks \u201cis entitled to recover on the unpaid principal balance [of the Note] as of October 1, 1983 ... to the date paid, together with interest at the rate set forth in the promissory note of twelve percent (12%) per year,\u201d plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Minn timely appealed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On appeal, Minn challenges COL No. 1, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">[T]he Court concludes it has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this action. This is a civil action for default on the payment of amounts due under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>terms of a promissory note and is within the jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 603-21.5. The Family Court decree and agreement did not require defendant to execute the promissory note. The decree and agreement required that defendant pay the plaintiff $60,000 in accordance with the terms of the promissory note. By executing the promissory note separate and ..apart from the agreement, defendant entered into a contract with plaintiff, which contract this court has jurisdiction to enforce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Minn contends that COL No. 1 is defective because the family court\u2019s incorporation of the PSA into the divorce decree merged the PSA into the divorce decree and, therefore, the Note, which was itself incorporated into the PSA by reference, is not enforceable as a contract, but only as part of the divorce decree. Minn further argues that: (1) the family court, pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 571-14 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1991) and 580-1 (1985), has exclusive jurisdiction over all divorce proceedings;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) HRS \u00a7 571-8.5(3) and (6) (1985) provide that the family court can \u201c[mjake and issue all orders and writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their original jurisdiction\u201d and can \u201c[e]nforce decrees and judgments ...;\u201d and (3) therefore the family court had exclusive jurisdiction to enforce collection on the Note, and the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We agree with Minn that the incorporation of the PSA into the divorce decree merged the PSA into the final divorce decree; therefore, the Note no longer has any independent existence and is not enforceable as a contract, but only as an element of the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>court\u2019s final judgment. <em>In Jendrusch </em>v. <em>Jendrusch, </em>1 Haw. App. 605, 609, 623 P.2d 893, 896 (1981), the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) stated on analogous facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">In our view, the first issue we must decide is whether the PSA merged into the decree. We must decide whether we are dealing with a contract or a judgment. On this issue we apply the rule stated in 24 Am Jur 2d <em>Divorce and Separation </em>\u00a7 908 (1966).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Where the language of the agreement shows an intent to make it part of the decree, and the agreement is actually incorporated into the decree, the provisions of the agreement are superseded by and merged into the decree____ [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">[T]he PSA lost its independent existence and merged into the decree. Thus we are not concerned with interpreting a contract; we are concerned with interpreting a judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-11\"><em>See also Wellman </em>v. <em>Wellman, </em>7 Haw. App. 266, 270-71, 752 P.2d 1079, 1082 (1988); <em>Joaquin </em>v. <em>Joaquin, </em>5 Haw. App. 435, 438, 698 P.2d 298, <em>301, cert. denied, </em>67 Haw. 685, 744 P.2d 781 (1985). The Note was incorporated into the PSA by reference and was executed by the parties \u201cin settlement of [Brooks\u2019] marital claims,\u201d i.e., as part of the property settlement approved by the family court. Furthermore, because the PSA expressly provided that, unless it was approved by the family court, it would \u201chave no further force or effect,\u201d the divorce decree gave the Note its legal \u201clife.\u201d Accordingly, the Note cannot be enforced as a separate contract, but only as a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">While it is correct that the Note was incorporated, via the PSA, into the divorce decree, we disagree with Minn\u2019s contention that only the family court had jurisdiction to enforce the Note as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>decree-judgment. In <em>Contra Costa County ex rel. Tuazon </em>v. <em>Caro, </em>8 Haw. App. 341, 352-53, 802 P.2d 1212, 1217-18, <em>aff'd, </em>72 Haw. 1, 802 P.2d 1202 (1990), decided four months before Brooks filed her amended complaint, the ICA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">A court-ordered child support payment becomes an enforceable decree when the payment becomes due. A due but unpaid court-ordered child support payment (decree arrearage) is enforceable in family court. . . . <em>Where the family court authorizes payment of a decree arrearage on a deferred payment basis and payment is not made, the deferred payment arrearage then becomes a decree-judgment debt enforceable in both family and civil court. </em>Where the family court declines to authorize payment of a decree arrearage on a deferred payment basis, the arrearage then becomes a decree-judgment debt enforceable in both family court and civil court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>The decree-judgment creditor may take a decree-judgment to civil court and have the civil court enforce it in the same manner as the civil court enforces judgments entered by civil courts.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">(Emphasis added.) (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">While the <em>Caro </em>rule was framed in the context of enforcing court-ordered child support payments, we see no meaningful distinction between such payments and court-ordered property settlement payments. If anything, the family court has a more substantial interest in enforcing child support payments because of the family court\u2019s \u201cinherent authority to protect and provide for the welfare of children\u201d of divorced parents. <em>See Blackshear v. Blackshear, </em>52 Haw. 480, 482, 478 P.2d 852, 854 (1971). We therefore adopt the <em>Caro </em>rule and hold that Brooks, as a decree-judgment creditor, can enforce collection of family court-ordered installment property settlement payments (i.e., deferred payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>arrearages) either through the circuit (i.e., civil) court or the family court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">We emphasize that by allowing Brooks, as a decree-judgment creditor, to enforce collection in circuit court of installment property settlement payments that are neither child-support payments nor alimony, we do not usurp the family court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over matters that are subject to modification by post-divorce decree. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 580-47 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1991 ).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this case, the parties had no children and, in accordance with the express terms of the PSA, the divorce decree awarded no alimony to either Brooks or Minn. The parties did not reserve to the family court any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>post-decree jurisdiction to modify the PSA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the family court reserved no such jurisdiction in its decree, and the time for appeal-. ing the decree has long since passed. Therefore, no grounds existed for the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by the family court over the subject matter of Brooks\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Inasmuch as Brooks can seek enforcement of the Note as a decree-judgment in circuit or family court, the circuit court correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction over this case. However, because the circuit court erred in ruling that the Note could be enforced as a discrete contract independent of the final divorce decree, the circuit court applied the wrong statute of limitations (SOL), namely HRS \u00a7 657-1 (1985).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The SOL that applies to actions seeking enforcement of domestic judgments and decrees is HRS \u00a7 657-5 (1985),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provides for a ten-year limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>period, as opposed to the six-year limitations period set forth in HRS \u00a7 657-1. Because the circuit court applied a six-year statute of limitations, it erroneously calculated the interest on the Note to which Brooks was entitled based on a commencement date of October 1,1983 (i.e., six years prior to the filing of Brooks\u2019 initial circuit court complaint), rather than February 9,1981 (i.e., the date of the family court\u2019s final divorce decree).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The applicability of HRS \u00a7 657-5 to this case renders moot Minn\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The family court\u2019s final divorce decree was filed on February 9, 1981, and accordingly, Brooks had until February 9, 1991 to toll the governing SOL by filing an enforcement action in either family or circuit court. She filed her original complaint on September 28, 1989 and her amended complaint on November 27, 1990; thus, the SOL was tolled under either complaint. Therefore, Brooks is entitled to recover the entire principal balance of $60,000.00 plus interest as provided in the Note from the date the divorce decree was entered on February 9, 1981 until the circuit court entered judgment in favor of Brooks on August 20, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Although the circuit court determined for the wrong reason that it had subject matter jurisdiction over Brooks\u2019 claim, we must affirm the judgment if it is correct on any other legal ground. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>e.g., Shea </em>v. <em>City and County of Honolulu, </em>67 Haw. 499, 507, 692 P.2d 1158, 1165 (1985); <em>Agsalud </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>66 Haw. 425, 430, 664 P.2d 734, 738 (1983). Accordingly, we affirm that part of the circuit court\u2019s judgment ruling Minn liable to Brooks pursuant to the Note. However, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s calculation of Brooks\u2019 damages and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaG\"><em>Andrew V.

During oral argument, Brook\u2019s counsel explained that, because the second promissory note was executed independent of the divorce decree, he brought suit in circuit court for the \u201cconvenience\u201d of consolidating the two claims into one action, rather than suing for collection on one note in circuit court and suing for collection on the other note in family court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b581-13\"> The circuit court entered summary judgment in Brooks\u2019 favor as to Count II, but denied her motion as to Count I.

The order denying summary judgment as to Count I, however, was interlocutory in nature and non-appealable absent an express direction for entry of a final judgment. <em>See </em>Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 54(b) (1991). Accordingly, the denial of summary judgment as to Count I did not become ripe for appeal until the trial court\u2019s entry of final judgment on August 20, 1991. Brooks\u2019 timely appeal from that final judgment is now before us. Because the entry of summary judgment as to Count I of Brooks\u2019 original complaint would have obviated the need for the present appeal, and further because the circuit court\u2019s erroneous denial of the motion precipitated the filing of Brooks\u2019 amended complaint, we treat the circuit court\u2019s disposition as plain error. <em>See </em>Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 28(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> HRS \u00a7 571-14(3) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction...
