Hoffheimer; (2) carrying a deadly weapon concealed upon his person; (3) carrying a deadly weapon openly with intent to injure; (4) assaulting Eugene Brocious; and (5) assaulting Leroy F. Knowles. He was sentenced to 15 years on the burglary conviction and sentences were imposed on the other convictions to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">We discussed the admissibility of identification evidence and the procedure to be followed when it is challenged in <em>Smith and Samuels v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 59, cert. denied, Court of Appeals of Maryland, 24 June 1969. We summarized the rules in <em>Miller v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 344 and again in <em>Jones v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 420. We have applied them in many cases reviewed by us. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>seems that the lower court here did not fully appreciate the proper application of the principles enunciated with regard to the admissibility of evidence of identification and it is certain that it did not follow the procedure set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Mrs. Florence S. Hoffheimer testified that her ground floor apartment in the Penn-Brooke Terrace complex had been broken \u2014 a bedroom window screen was removed and the window and lock were broken \u2014 on 17 August 1969 between approximately 6:00 and 9:30 P.M. Kobert Eugene Brocious, who lived in the apartment directly above her, while walking his dog about 9:10 P.M. near the premises, saw a blond haired man dressed in a yellow shirt and white sneakers walk by. He was asked if he saw that man in court. Appellant objected, the objection was summarily overruled and defense counsel requested a bench conference. At the bench defense counsel said that an in-court identification of appellant would be tainted because of an illegal extrajudicial photographic viewing procedure. The court said: \u201cHe [the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] didn\u2019t ask him that. He asked him whether he could identify that person wearing a yellow shirt, white sneakers, with blond hair.\u201d The State did not think the witness had been shown photographs; defense counsel thought he had been shown a photograph. With that question then unresolved, the court said: \u201cWe feel the question as propounded is a fair one and we await anxiously the answer of the witness. Your motion or your objection will be overruled.\u201d Before the jury, over further objection, the witness made a positive in-court identification of appellant as the person he had seen. Brocious took his dog back to his apartment and looking over his balcony saw a screen from the Hoffheimer apartment lying on the ground. He went to a neighbor\u2019s apartment and told him to go to the front door of the Hoffheimer apartment. \u201c* * * I\u2019ll go around and try to chase him out or get him out.\u201d He went to the broken window, saw \u201cshadows moving\u201d inside and hollered, \u201cCome on out.\u201d The person inside turned toward the win<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>dow and Brocious saw his face plainly. The man then ran out the front door. He was asked if he saw the person in court. Defense counsel objected, the objection was summarily overruled and the State asked to approach the bench. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Shepherd, it seems to me that the very simple question you might ask this witness is whether or not he identified this defendant as the man he saw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">MR. SHEPHERD (Assistant State\u2019s Attorney) : I realize that. It is just that I am trying to protect the record, and I think that we have reached that point that Mr. Miller alluded to here. I think he is entitled to at least this one witness out of the hearing of the jury. Now, he made the objection and he\u2019s building the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">THE COURT: I am not concerned about building the record. If this man can clearly identify \u2014this is not an in-court identification nor is it a police station identification. This is an actual identification; is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">MR. SHEPHERD: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">THE COURT: And if this witness can testify \u2014we haven\u2019t had his answer yet \u2014 if he can testify that he clearly identified this man, I think he has a right to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Before the jury, over further express objection summarily overruled, the witness made a positive in-court identification of appellant as the person he saw in the apartment. When the person fled the apartment, Brocious ran to the front of the building. \u201cI just about cut him off outside.\u201d Asked who he had just about cut off, he said, over objection which was overruled, \u201cMr. McGilton,\u201d but then he qualified that identification: \u201cI saw Mr. McGilton, but not to recognize looks but by clothes as the man ran. * * * He had a yellow shirt, white sneakers and blond hair. I can\u2019t recall the pants now.\u201d The fleeing man \u201clike to run over Mr. Knowles because Mr. Knowles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>was coming in from walking his dog and he just missed Mr. Knowles when he run by him.\u201d Brocious went to his apartment accompanied by Knowles. They looked over the balcony. Brocious said: \u201cHe\u2019s down there again because I can see his tennis shoes, his white feet.\u201d Appellant \u201c* * * come out from under the balcony and stuck his gun up around and pointed the gun * * * right directly at me.\u201d Appellant told Brocious that he was a security guard at the development, but Brocious knew this \u201cwas a lie because we don\u2019t have no security guards.\u201d Soon after the police arrived. On cross-examination the witness said he had seen appellant about half a dozen times. He had never seen him before 17 August but he saw him after that night at the police station and at a preliminary hearing. When he saw him in the apartment the lighting conditions \u201cwas very good. He was standing in a lit hallway.\u201d His wife had seen appellant entering the Hoffheimer apartment through the bedroom window.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThat is how I knew he was in there.\u201d At the police station he was shown one photograph of appellant by police. On redirect examination Brocious said he was present when appellant was captured by the police. He was asked: \u201cAre you basing your identification here today on the photograph that you saw or the six or approximately six times you saw the defendant on the 17th of August?\u201d He replied: \u201cI am judging on the six times 1 saw him in August when I chased him.\u201d The court pressed the point, asking: \u201cThe identification here, Mr. Brocious, today is based upon your identification of the defendant at the time he was in the apartment owned by Mrs. Hoffheimer; is that correct?\u201d The witness said it was. The court continued: \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t need the picture to help or the photograph to help you identify him?\u201d The witness answered: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Allen Reed substantiated Brocious\u2019 testimony in substance. He saw a man leave Hoffheimer\u2019s apartment with a pistol in hand. Reed went back to his apartment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>called the police. Over objection summarily overruled he made a positive in-court identification of appellant as the man he saw. He asserted on cross-examination that he was not shown photographs by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Leroy Knowles testified that he was walking his dog about 9:00 P.M. on 17 August when a man \u201ccome busting out\u201d of the Hoffheimer apartment and passed by him. He got a good look at the man. Over objection made and summarily overruled he made a positive in-court identification of appellant as the man. He went to Broeious\u2019 apartment. \u201c* * * [W]e were out on the balcony and I was looking down to see where he had got into this apartment, and at that time when we looked over, something in the shape of a weapon, a pistol, was pointing up. So we moved back.\u201d He saw \u201ca portion of [defendant\u2019s] head and his hand.\u201d On cross-examination he could not remember whether the police showed him a photograph of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Private Harold W. Ruslander of the Prince George\u2019s County police responded to a call to go to the apartment about 9:25 P.M. on 17 August. He was met by Knowles, Broeious and Reed and conversed with them. \u201cAs a result of the conversation I broadcast a lookout for a suspect that had broken into an apartment in that building.\u201d Shortly after he received a call that a man answering the description given \u201cwas seen running from the direction of the apartment towards Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d He went toward Pennsylvania Avenue. \u201cIn the distance I saw a white male with blond hair at that time wearing a T-shirt, black trousers, and you could see a yellow shirt dangling from the back of his trousers. And I was approximately 75 yards away and another cruiser * * * also arrived on the scene. At that time we stopped the suspect that we had. It was appellant. He was apprehended about 200 yards from the apartment. On cross-examination Ruslander said that a Detective Vitek later showed a photograph of appellant to Broeious, Knowles and Reed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Officer M. Magone of the Prince George\u2019s County po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>lice received a lookout for \u201ca white male wearing dark trousers, a gold or yellow type banlon shirt, and possibly armed.\u201d He spotted appellant walking eastbound on Pennsylvania Avenue and arrested him. A Uniwork Model 22, Type G, tear gas pistol was found in his right rear pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In presenting his case, appellant recalled Ruslander to the stand to testify on his behalf. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cBy Mr. Miller (defense counsel) :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">Q. Private Ruslander, Officer Magone testified that you were the officer in charge of this case. Would you please advise the Court as to what methods of identification were used at the Seat Pleasant Police Station on the night of August 17,1969 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">MR. SHEPHERD (Assistant State\u2019s Attorney) : Objection. It has already been covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">THE COURT: Objection sustained. He has already testified that they called the fingerprint man and they didn\u2019t use that. They didn\u2019t photograph the defendant to his knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">MR. MILLER: But \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">THE COURT: He was asked whether or not there was a line-up and he hadn\u2019t any knowledge of a line-up. You haven\u2019t covered that but you have covered the rest of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">By Mr. Miller:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-13\">Q. Was there a line-up conducted on the night of the 17th of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-14\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-15\">Q. Was more than one picture shown to the three witnesses, Knowles \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-16\">MR. SHEPHERD: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-17\">THE COURT: The objection will be sustained. He already answered he didn\u2019t know anything about any photos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>MR. MILLER: He testified that he was present when photos were shown. This is Private Ruslander.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">MR. SHEPHERD: He has already testified to it. That\u2019s the important part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">MR. MILLER: This is the defendant\u2019s part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">THE COURT: We recall his testimony that he doesn\u2019t recall any photographs being taken or shown. Now you may ask him once again and we will get done with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">By Mr. Miller:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">Q. Do you recall any photographs being shown ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">A. Yes, sir, photographs were shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">Q. And who showed them \u2014 who was it that was shown the photos ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">A. They were shown to the three witnesses, Mr. Brocious, Mr. Knowles and Mr. Reed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">Q. And who showed the photograph ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">A. Detective Vitek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">Q. How many photographs were shown to these three people ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-16\">A. As far as \u2014 at the time I was there, only the one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-17\">Q. And who was that a picture of ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-18\">A. It was a picture of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-19\">At the close of all the evidence in argument on motions for judgment of acquittal defense counsel again attempted to point out that the in-court identifications were based on a tainted pre-trial identification. He urged: \u201cThe police officer has testified that all three of these gentlemen were shown only one photograph. They were shown one photograph of the defendant at the police station. Your Honor well knows that this is highly improper police tactics.\u201d The court said: \u201cWell, there have been no photographs introduced in evidence and the witnesses clearly testified that they identified the defendant not from any photographs whatsoever but from the mere fact that they actually visibly saw the defendant at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>scene of the crime. So, this is a positive identification and not a photographic or an out-of-court or in-court identification as sometimes is. They relied solely upon the fact that they visibly saw the defendant inside the apartment of the victim here on August 17th. And if that is your reason, we further deny your motion in that respect.\u201d Defense counsel asked if the court would refer to the case of <em>State v. Robert Miller, Jr.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court Said it was familiar with it. \u201cThe facts are somewhat different in this case. In this case these witnesses positively identified this defendant, and we think it is not a tainted matter.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We clearly stated the procedure to be followed when identification evidence is challenged in <em>Smith and Samuels v. State, supra, </em>at 67-70. We set out a synthesis of it in <em>Jones v. State, supra, </em>at 423-424:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201cWhen identification evidence is challenged, the burden is on the accused to show <em>prima facie </em>that the extrajudicial procedure was illegal. If he meets this burden the State must show by clear and convincing evidence that it was legal. There is no obligation on the State in introducing a judicial identification to produce any evidence as to an extrajudicial identification except as it may deem advisable to overcome a <em>prima facie </em>showing by the accused that the extrajudicial identification procedure was illegal. The question of the legality of the extrajudicial identification procedure is solely for the trial court as is the question whether an illegal extrajudicial procedure tainted a judicial identification. But when the judicial identification is ruled admissible, despite the illegality of an extrajudicial identification, the accused may nevertheless cross-examine the State\u2019s judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>identifying witness at the trial of the general issue and introduce evidence with regard to the illegal extrajudicial procedure as part of his case. Such evidence so elicited goes to the weight of the judicial identification and the credibility of the identifying witness, properly matters for the trier of fact.\u201d See also <em>Miller v. State, supra, </em>at 346-348.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We discussed the effect of non-compliance with the procedural requirements in <em>Perkins v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 527. We found that a defendant is entitled as a matter of absolute right under <em>Smith and Samuels </em>to an evidentiary hearing out of the presence of the jury and a determination by the trial judge of the question raised by objection to evidence of identification \u2014 that is whether under the circumstances the extrajudicial viewing of the photograph constituted an illegal pretrial confrontation tainting the prospective in-court identifications because violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. We held that to deny the defendant this absolute right constituted clear error, not only because it precluded him from an opportunity to show that the pretrial photographic viewing procedure was illegal, but also because it in effect constituted a ruling, based on an insufficient evidentiary foundation, that the in-court identifications were not tainted and would, without more, be admitted in evidence before the jury. <em>Perkins </em>is dispositive of the instant case. We hold that the lower court committed error requiring reversal of the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In <em>Perkins </em>we observed that we could not sanctify the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights by subscribing to the State\u2019s arguments that it did not really matter because defendant produced no evidence that the photographic viewing was illegal and hence did not carry his burden of showing, <em>prima facie, </em>the illegality of the pretrial confrontation ; or that even if the photographic viewing procedure was illegal, nevertheless the State adduced evidence at the trial showing that the in-court identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tions were based upon an independent source; or that the extrajudicial photographic identification was in fact legal. We felt that none of those arguments overcame the stark fact that the court wholly precluded the defendant from undertaking to make the requisite preliminary <em>prima facie </em>showing that the pretrial photographic viewing procedure violated due process of law and so tainted the prospective in-court identifications as to render them inadmissible in evidence. Here the error is compounded because the evidence that was adduced by appellant on cross-examination of Officer Ruslander indicated that the pretrial photographic viewing procedure was illegal. It was that the police showed only one photograph, that of appellant, to each of the three identifying witnesses; this would seem to be, at the least <em>prima facie, </em>impermissibly suggestive. And we note that while it may well be that the evidence adduced was sufficient to show that the identification by Brocious had an independent source, it does not appear to meet the test of such sufficiency as to Reed and Knowles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But in any event, in the circumstances of the conduct of the trial, it is not whether the identifications may have had an independent source. Had the requisite procedures been followed, the appellant would have had the option of placing before the jury or not that there had been a pretrial viewing of photographs and the circumstances surrounding it. As the trial here was conducted, appellant was denied any choice as to whether or not evidence going to the question of the independent source of the in-court identification was to be placed before the jury. On the contrary, the State had the full benefit of the inquiry on the matter being in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In holding that the failure to abide by the requisite procedure here constituted reversible error we are not placing form over substance. The procedure enunciated in <em>Smith and Samuels </em>is designed to preserve constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tional rights of a defendant. The failure to follow it may, and here did, deny appellant those rights. We are unable to conclude that the error here was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chcupman v. California, </em>386 U. S. 18. Appellant is entitled to a new trial and we grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">There is no need to reach the other questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed; case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">.
