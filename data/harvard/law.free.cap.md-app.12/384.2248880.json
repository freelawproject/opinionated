The petitions alleged that they \u201cdid assault and beat Barbara Lee Currens, age 12, with a stick.\u201d They entered a general denial and both boys on November 4, 1970 were adjudged to be delinquent and were committed to the Maryland Training School.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The boys\u2019 parents had been served on October 24, 1970 with a petition charging that each of the children was a delinquent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both boys executed, in court, a \u201cWaiver of Consent and Election Not to Contest\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their father, Richard Arnold, consented, in writing, to his children\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">On appeal, a twofold attack is made: (1) the Appellants were denied the right to counsel because a waiver had been signed by the father who alleged he had been told \u201cthat the proceedings would not result in the commitment of the Appellants,\u201d and (2) that the commitment was contrary to the express purposes of Article 26, Section 70, of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The testimony established that on October 5, 1970, David Arnold (David), age 13, and Brian Nicholus Arnold (Nicky), age 11, were playing at the Bay City Community Beach in Queen Anne\u2019s County. Barbara Lee Currens, age 12, in company with other children, was also at the beach. Barbara testified, \u201cSee, we were over on the Community Beach playing, and then we saw this rope on the tree hanging down and we were swinging on it. It was my turn so there was a boy in front and there was a boy on the side. The boy in front of me said a couple of bad words, and get off the rope. I said, \u2018no.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The boy on the side of me hit me so I jumped down. * * * I jumped down and grabbed his hand and told him to drop the stick. So, he did, and his brother came and hit me on the back. While the other was walking I got hold of the other who hit me on the back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">She then related that she had been struck \u201caround five times\u201d; that the Appellants had taken turns hitting her. Miss Currens stated she struck the boys with her fist. She identified both boys as her assailants. She said she lost no time from school as a result of the assault. Her total medical expenses were $6.00 and consisted of treatment by a physician for a cut on the back and a tetanus shot. Her clothing was not damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Jane Austin, a witness, told substantially the same version of the incident, except for the fact that, \u201cDavid said it was their swing and we better get off or else they were going to hit her over the back with a stick. So, he picked up the stick and hit Barbara with it, so, she got down and grabbed his hand so he stopped.\u201d Jane then stated that while Barbara was fighting with David that Nicky picked up the stick and hit Barbara. The witness informed the court that she told everybody [the other children present] \u201cLet\u2019s help.\u201d She looked for a stick but by the time she located one David and Nicky were running home. Jane and Barbara proceeded to locate Barbara\u2019s mother, and with her drove to the Arnold home. In response to the knock the boys opened the door. Mrs. Currens asked to talk to Mrs. Arnold, but was informed she was not at home. When Mrs. Currens invited the brothers to come outside of the house and to look at her daughter\u2019s back in order that she might show them what they had done, Nicky said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut your damn mouth.\u201d He then shut the door. Mrs. Currens, Barbara and Jane went to the police station and lodged their complaint against the Arnold boys. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Arnold ever contacted Mrs. Currens relative to the assault, and there is no evidence that they knew about the incident until they were notified by the probation department.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Mr. Arnold denied any knowledge of the incident and explained that his wife was not at home on October 5, 1970, the day of the offense, because she was at a doctor\u2019s office. Neither boy testified.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court asked for the report of the probation officer, which was apparently received into evidence, and the probation officer informed the court that Mr. John Walker, the principal of the Stevensville Middle School, wanted to say something. Mr. Walker testified as to the Appellants\u2019 absences from school; that David \u201cwas doing well for his ability and was cooperative in class\u201d but that \u201cNicky is not doing as well academically as we feel he could do\u201d; that he was concerned with the fact that Nicky had caused disruptive behavior in class, was ejected from an assembly for similar behavior and that he had had a number of fights with students. Nicky had only been in that school since September, 1970. Mr. Walker stated that Nicky had used other students to do things for him such as going off the campus grounds for cokes and that he had spoken to Nicky about the matter. The following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Nicky is supposed to be one of the worst discipline problems in the school.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Nicky is a problem. I have never \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s the way he is classified in this report.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Is that my report, sir? I haven\u2019t rated him as to who is worst, but Nicky has been a discipline prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>lem and taken a great deal of my time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: All the Court wants to say at this point to you, Mr. Walker, is that the first time such conduct as appears to have been present in this case manifests itself to you in your capacity get in touch with Mr. Horwath. They only have to misbehave once as far as the Court is concerned. We\u2019re not going to put up with it; we will back you up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Then Mr. Walker continued his testimony and told the court that Nicky sometimes wore a hat to class which he removed when told and later put it back on; that he had trouble getting Nicky to keep his shirt-tail in and that if Nicky\u2019s behavior did not improve he would have to suspend him. He said that the parents had not attended P.T.A. meetings, or the school \u201copen house\u201d. Mr. Arnold, in a combination of testimony and cross-examination again denied he knew of the incident, or any disruptive behavior caused by the boys in the school. In fact, Mr. Arnold said, \u201cLike I said, I never knew anything about it until now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The Appellants, in support of their first contention, inform us that the father, Mr. Richard Arnold, alleges that he had been told by the probation officer that \u201cthe proceedings would probably not result in commitment.\u201d Then they argue that if the waiver executed by the brothers, and consented to by their father, was in any way procured in reliance upon this alleged misstatement, such a waiver would not be intelligently made, and, consequently, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">At the time of the commencement of the hearing, the juvenile judge asked Mr. Arnold whether or not he wished an attorney. His answer was \u201cno.\u201d The probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>officer stated that he had been assured that they [the Arnolds] would want counsel if the matter went to court. Mr. Arnold said, \u201cWe did at the time.\u201d The court asked that the waivers be signed, saying, \u201cHave Mr. Arnold execute the waivers. Go over it with him and have him execute those waivers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We have carefully reviewed the record in this proceeding and fail to find any testimony, argument or inference to support the Appellants\u2019 position, and, in fact, the Appellants fail to direct our attention to anything in their own support except an inference which they believe may be drawn from the fact that the father asked at the conclusion of the hearing if there was \u201ca chance of appeal on their part until I can get an attorney. I didn\u2019t realize it was going to be this serious.\u201d The belated realization of the seriousness, and the desire to employ counsel, does not lead us to conclude that the Appellants\u2019 father was in any way misled by the probation department. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the waiver was not voluntarily and knowingly signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We shall now consider the second argument presented by the' Appellants; that is, that the trial court committed the Appellants contrary to the express purpose of Article 26, Section 70, of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>In Re Hamill, </em>10 Md. App. 586, 590 (1970), contains a comprehensive discussion of the Maryland juvenile law. Chief Judge Murphy in that case said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201cThe law of this State governing juvenile causes and delinquent children was substantially revised by Chapter 432 of the Acts of 1969. The purposes of the Acts were plainly outlined in part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">\u2018(1) To provide for the care, protection and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(2) To remove from children committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior, and to substitute therefor a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the protection of the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">(3) To place a child in a wholesome family environment whenever possible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">(4) To separate a child from his parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interest of public safety.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cBy so providing, it is clear that the Legislature intended no departure in philosophy from that underlying previous juvenile court enactments in Maryland, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals, <em>viz., </em>that juvenile proceedings are of a special nature designed to meet the problems peculiar to the adolescent <em>(In Re Fletcher, </em>251 Md. 520) ; that the proceedings of a juvenile court are not criminal in nature and its dispositions are not punishment for crime <em>(In the Matter of Cromwell, </em>232 Md. 409) ; that the juvenile law has as its underlying concept the protection of the juvenile, so that judges, in making dispositions in juvenile cases, think not in terms of guilt, but of the child\u2019s need for protection or rehabilitation <em>(In Re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517) ; that the juvenile act does not contemplate the punishment of children where they are found to be delinquent, but rather an attempt to correct and rehabilitate them in \u2018a wholesome family environment whenever possible,\u2019 although rehabilitation may have to be sought in some instances in an institution <em>(Moquin v. State, </em>216 Md. 524).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201cUnder Section 70-1 (y) of the present juvenile law, the disposition hearing held following an adjudication of delinquency is \u2018to determine (1) whether the child is in need of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>vision, treatment, or rehabilitation; and if so (2) the nature of the supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u2019 Under Section 70-19, the juvenile judge is enjoined to \u2018make disposition as most suited to the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child.\u2019 These principles must be applied in light of the purposes of the juvenile law, as set forth in Section 70 (heretofore outlined), <em>viz., </em>that the juvenile court is to make disposition so as to provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of the child; by a program of treatment, training and rehabilitation \u2018consistent with the protection of the public interest.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201cAgainst such a legislative and judicial background, it is altogether clear that the <em>mere </em>fact of delinquency, without more, ordinarily does not justify the taking of the child from his parents and his commitment to a State training school. Because the Legislature has indicated its preference that a delinquent child be placed in the care, custody, and control of individuals rather than an institution whenever consistent with the purposes underlying the juvenile law, a commitment to a training school in a case where the parents would seem able and willing to undertake the rehabilitation of the delinquent child would be improper. See <em>Cantu v. State, </em>207 S.W.2d 901 (Tex.) ; <em>In re Walter, </em>172 N.W.2d 603 (N.D.) ; <em>Berry v. Superior Court, </em>245 P. 409 (Wash.) ; 47 Am.Jur.2d <em>Juveniles </em>and <em>Delinquent and Dependent Children, </em>Section 30; Annotations, 45 A.L.R. 1533 and 85 A.L.R. 1099. Of course, where the evidence at the disposition hearing shows that the parents, no matter how well motivated or intentioned, are incapable, unwilling, or unable to control or rehabilitate their delinquent child, a commitment to the training school may be necessary for the \u2018wel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>fare [of the delinquent] or in the interest of public safety.\u2019 (Section 70 (4))</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Appellants point to <em>Hamill </em>and Maryland Rule 913. They argue that the juvenile judge did not comply with Rule 913, nor is there a showing that he considered \u201cwelfare of the children\u201d or \u201cpublic safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">At the conclusion of the testimony in this case the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u201cAll right, stand up boys. Now, the Court is not at all pleased with what has been presented here this morning as to your conduct. Nor are we satisfied with the apparent indifference of the parents to their conduct. The fact that you say you don\u2019t know anything about what they have been doing is certainly an indication that you haven\u2019t been paying attention to what these children have been doing. The fact that your wife is not here this morning, although she may have a job, the Court thinks she should be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u201cNow, we\u2019re not going to put up with such conduct as this in any community in this county. Certainly we\u2019re not going to permit these children, although they\u2019re young, to behave as they have been, from what Mr. Walker said and what these reports show. And, certainly the fact that you don\u2019t know anything about this certainly shows indifference on your part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\"><em>\u201cNow, boys you\u2019re both going to be sent to the Maryland Training School for an indefinite period. </em>I hate to do it with boys your size and age because it\u2019s rough over there, but you deserve it when you go around beating people the way you have, and misbehaving the way you have in school.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">\u201cMR. CLARK: <em>Have you made a finding?\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>The finding is delinquent in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>both cases. </em>You will also pay the costs of this proceeding, whatever that might be. You will also pay the lady for the medical bill. * * (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The Rules for Juvenile Causes, (Chapter 900) Maryland Rules of Procedure, provide that there shall be an adjudicatory hearing and at the conclusion thereof \u201cthe court shall announce and dictate to the stenographer or reporter or prepare and file with the clerk a brief statement of the grounds upon which it bases its determination.\u201d Rule 912 d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">After the \u201cadjudicatory hearing\u201d there shall be a \u201cdisposition hearing.\u201d Rule 913; <em>In Re Hamill, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The proceedings in this case do not comply with the Maryland Rules of Procedure, and as Mr. Justice Fortas, <em>In the Matter of Gault, </em>387 U. S. 1, said, quoting Foster, <em>Social Work, the Law, and Social Action, in Social Casework, </em>(July, 1964), page 286, \u201cProcedure is to law what \u2018scientific method\u2019 is to science.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">In the recent case of <em>Isen v. Phoenix Assurance Co., </em>259 Md. 564, 570 (1970), the Court of Appeals, speaking through Judge McWilliams, said of the Maryland Rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201c* * * they are not guides to the practice of law but precise rubrics \u2018established to promote the orderly and efficient administration of justice and [that they] are to be read and followed.\u2019 <em>Brown v. Fraley, </em>222 Md. 480, 483 (I960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Here the adjudicatory hearing (Rule 912) and disposition hearing (Rule 913) are interwoven. The Appellants were actually ordered committed to the Maryland Training School before they were adjudged \u201cdelinquent\u201d. The hearing before the juvenile judge was violative of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The probation report submitted to the juvenile court stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cIn summation, I feel after reviewing school reports, considering the present incident where two brothers beat a girl their own age with sticks because she refused to vacate a swing for them, the extensive records of fights and antisocial behavior in the school and community, the lack of motivation on the part of the parents to accept help when offered and the continued protection by the parents even when the problem is obvious, that Brien, regarding his age and development, cannot be entirely responsible for his delinquency. I feel it is an outgrowth of continued parent protection, lack of supervision and blame of others for his action. \u201cRECOMMENDATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">It is respectfully recommended to the court that if Brien (Nicky) is found delinquent, he be placed on probation, under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Services. I would also respectfully recommend that the court make the parents abundantly aware that custody can and quite possibly will be changed in any future appearance by the family in Juvenile Court. If the parents refuse the counseling by the school and the Department of Juvenile Services, I feel foster placement with full support ordered by the family the only alternative to probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The summation and report as to David is identical except for the proper noun of \u201cDavid\u201d in place of \u201cBrian\u201d (Nicky) where the same may appear. The trial judge ignored the recommendation and in doing so, we think failed to give proper effect to Sections 70 and 70-1 of Article 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">By the enactment of Chapter 432, Acts of 1969, the General Assembly created a wholly new category en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>titled \u201cChild in Need of Supervision.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This new classification contains most of the acts defined as \u201cdelinquency\u201d under former Section 52 of Article 26.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On the bare record before us there is no showing that the legislative design was weighed or considered by the juvenile judge, nor does the record disclose to us how the children\u2019s \u201cwelfare\u201d or \u201cthe interests of public safety\u201d (Article 26, Section 70 (4)) would be best served by commitment to the Maryland Training School.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Incarceration of these youthful Appellants in an institution is fraught with grave consequences for they will be uprooted from their family, friends and classmates, and exposed to association with delinquents who have committed serious felonies including rape, manslaughter and armed robbery, <em>inter alia, </em>and is not in keeping with the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">We are not unmindful that, \u201cdisposition in a juvenile case is committed to the sound discretion of the juvenile judge, to be disturbed on appeal only upon a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>such discretion has been abused.\u201d <em>Hamill, </em>supra. We find an abuse of discretion by the juvenile judge in failing to consider \u201ca program of treatment, training and rehabilitation consistent with the protection of public interest\u201d (Article 26, Section 70, supra) and we remand the case without either affirming or reversing for further consideration by the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As we said in <em>Hamill, </em>supra, \u201cIn the course of such reconsideration, it may be proper for the judge to review the minor Appellants\u2019 conduct since the original hearing and to consider the legislative purposes as stated in Article 26, Section 70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\n<em>Case remanded without affirming or reversing for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the County Commissioners of Queen Anne\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\">.
