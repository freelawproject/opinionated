Stafford, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Howard L. Cardin, State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, Charles Hennick </em>and <em>Gary Meliclc, Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-5\">Powers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AH6L\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Church-going is considered by most people to yield beneficial results. Charles R. Holtman undoubtedly takes the opposite view. On October 17-18, 1968 he went to three churches in Baltimore, with the result that in a bench trial before Judge David Ross in the Criminal Court of Baltimore in April, 1970, he was convicted on one count each of three separate criminal indictments. From those convictions and the sentences imposed in each case he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>Berkley Baptist Church</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">At about 1:30 P.M. on October 17, 1968 Helen Gibson, who was employed in the office of the Berkley Baptist Church was winding up her work preparatory to leaving when appellant appeared at the door, carrying a long stick, and said \u201cI want your money.\u201d He told her he was an escaped murderer and if she behaved she would be all right. He ordered her to lie on the floor, and asked for her pocketbook. She told him where it was, and he took her money, approximately $3.00, from it and put it back. He went upstairs, and she escaped and notified the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">On these facts indictment 5197 charged Holtman with robbery, assault with intent to rob, assault, larceny, and receiving stolen goods. He was convicted of robbery. He contends that the evidence did not justify the conviction because (a) the victim was not put in fear and (b) the money was not taken from her person. That the victim\u2019s compliance with appellant\u2019s order to lie down and his demand for her pocketbook resulted from fear of violence is too obvious to require discussion. In <em>Williams v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 683, 256 A. 2d 776, we said at page 685, quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ing from Clark and Marshall, <em>Crimes, </em>(6th ed.) \u00a7 12.09, that robbery is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201cthe felonious taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, from his person or in his. presence, by violence, or by putting him in fear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The pocketbook was \u201cin her presence\u201d, and the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\n<em>Hillsdale Methodist Church</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Charles Tracey, custodian of the Hillsdale Methodist Church, testified that he left the church at about four o\u2019clock on October 17, 1968. The doors were locked and the premises were secure. He returned about 6:30 and opened a door. Some children ran in and promptly returned, saying that there was a burglar upstairs. Tracey went up and saw a big hole in the door of the minister\u2019s study. Appellant appeared at the hole, then came through it, where Tracey confronted him. After some conversation, during which appellant said he was looking for money, Tracey told him not to go away, but while Tracey was making a telephone call, appellant disappeared. The police arrived shortly thereafter. The desk drawers in the study had been pulled out. Tracey testified that a basement window had been broken, and that appellant said he came in through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">On these facts indictment 5199 charged appellant with daytime housebreaking, rogue and vagabond, storehouse breaking ($100 and upwards) and storehouse breaking (less than $100). At the close of the State\u2019s evidence the judge granted a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the two storehouse breaking counts. Appellant was convicted of daytime housebreaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">We held in <em>Sizemore v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 682, 272 A. 2d 824, at page 689:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">\u201cOne who breaks a church-in the day or night with intent to commit murder or felony therein, or with intent to steal goods of the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>$100 or more is guilty of the storehouse breaking proscribed by Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 32. * * * But a person who breaks a church is not guilty of the statutory burglary proscribed by Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 30 (a) or the crime proscribed by \u00a7 30 (b) because a necessary element of those offenses is that it be a dwelling house that be broken and a church is not a dwelling house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In <em>Sizemore, </em>decided January 8, 1971, Judge Orth for this Court discussed the \u201cquaint turn\u201d by which Lord Coke referred to a church as the mansion-house of God, and pointed out that breaking into a church was burglary at common law, not on the ground that a church was the dwelling house of God, but as a separate kind of burglary not involving a dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The motion for judgment of acquittal as to this indictment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\n<em>St. William of York Roman Catholic Church</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Officer Larry Sachs testified that at about 12:50 A.M. on October 18, 1968 he \u201creceived a call for prowler\u201d, and went to the rear of St. William of York Church. He found appellant \u201ccoming out of a window\u201d of the church. Appellant was intoxicated and the officer had to help him out because \u201che was stuck in the window\u201d. A search disclosed nothing; they had no conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">On these facts indictment 5198 charged appellant in four counts: common law burglary, rogue and vagabond, storehouse breaking ($100 and upwards) and storehouse breaking (less than $100). At the beginning of the trial the State announced that it would \u201cabandon the first count and press the second count\u201d. At the close of the State\u2019s case the judge granted a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the third and fourth counts. Appellant was convicted on the second count of being a rogue and vagabond.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The Maryland rogue and vagabond statute (Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 490) was discussed and interpreted in <em>Crossland v. State, </em>252 Md. 70, 249 A. 2d 153, in the light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u201cunusual circumstances\u201d there presented. Crossland had been observed by a police officer walking out the front door of a house carrying a record player and a radio. After some inquiry at the house the officer pursued Cross-land and arrested him. A four count indictment resulted. At his trial a verdict was directed as to three of the counts because of a technical failure of proof, and he was convicted of being a rogue and vagabond. The Court of Appeals said, at pages 73 and 74:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">\u201cThe language of Section 490 indicates that it is an essential element of the statutory crime that the accused have the intent to <em>commit </em>a crime. * * * [The] language indicates that it is the contemplated commission of the specified crimes which is referred to in the statute. * * * We believe that the normal usage of this language implies the mental processes preliminary to the actual doing of or <em>completion </em>(emphasis added) of a particular act. * * * the beneficial and useful purpose of this important statutory provision * * * is to give the enforcement officers a tool to apprehend and suppress more aggravated criminal conduct <em>prior </em>to its actual commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u00ab* * * The taking of the chattels by Cross-land and their asportation were clearly established by the evidence. In other words, the substantive crime had in fact been committed by Crossland and under these unusual circumstances, the necessary intent \u2018to enter\u2019 or \u2018to steal\u2019 no longer existed; the substantive crime was a <em>fait accompli.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Since the holding in <em>Crossland </em>we have been called upon in a number of cases to delineate the boundaries of its applicability. The cases were fully reviewed in <em>Downes v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 443, 274 A. 2d 663. In <em>Downes </em>the breaking was shown, and it was held proper to infer that the intent to steal, not consummated, still existed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>situation in <em>Knight v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 282, 254 A. 2d 379, was similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It seems clear that when any part of the substantive crime remains incomplete, from the practical as well as the legal standpoint <em>(Matthews v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 712, 715, 261 A. 2d 804) the intent to complete it which may be inferred from the circumstances is sufficient to support a conviction under the rogue and vagabond statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The evidence showing that appellant was found on the premises of the church, and that the substantive crime was not completed, supports an inference that he still entertained an intent to steal goods and chattels in the church. His motion for judgment of acquittal on the rogue and vagabond count of indictment 5198 was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed as to indictments 5197 and 5198. Judgment reversed as to indictment 5199.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
