His contentions on appeal to this court are:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">1. He was convicted solely on the testimony of an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">2. The errors of the trial judge denied him a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">3. That the evidence was insufficient to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">4. Violation of Rule No. 753 (sequestration of witnesses) and denial of a motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-19\">5. The court\u2019s refusal to allow the Appellant to testify out of the presence of the jury concerning a search of his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-20\">The facts of the case are that on September 5, 1968, at approximately 7:00 p.m., the Harlem Liquors, a pack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>age goods store in Baltimore City, was robbed at gun point and Robert Branch, a 70 year old man was shot to death by the robber. The owner of the liquor store, Philip R. Weiner, testified that \u201ca man entered the store, ran up to my clerk, put a gun in his face and said, \u2018This is a stickup\u2019 and two shots were heard.\u201d The gunman took one or two shots at Weiner but fortunately missed. Weiner obtained a revolver from behind the counter, fired one time, and struck the felon on the right side in the region of his arm and shoulder. \u201cHe put up his hand and turned around and ran toward the door and I fired two, three shots more. By that time he fell flat on his face in the store and stretched out as if he were dead.\u201d Weiner then went to assist Robert Branch and while he was doing that the holdup man fled. He described the holdup man as a black man, wearing sunglasses. The sunglasses and revolver used by the robber, and which had been dropped at the time he was shot by Weiner, were recovered. At the trial Weiner was unable to identify the Appellant. Mr. Branch died four hours later as a result of a gunshot wound through the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Baskerville, an employee of Weiner, was in the store at the time and he too was unable to identify the gunman. He fled when the shooting started.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The State produced Robert Lee Robinson, an admitted accomplice in the crime, who testified that he met Pinkney the night of the crime in a house belonging to Joe Moore, and that the three of them, Pinkney, Moore and Robinson drove to West Baltimore, and that he (Robinson) and Moore went into the liquor store in order to \u201ccase the place.\u201d While he was in there Pinkney came in and said, \u201cThis is a stickup.\u201d Robinson stated he \u201cdidn\u2019t have no idea no stickup was coming\u201d and that neither he nor Moore were armed. He and Moore \u201ctook cover in the store. Next, I heard two shots fired. Then I heard several more shots fired.\u201d He identified Pinkney as the man who fired the first shots and said they were fired toward the counter at the man who was \u201cwaiting on me.\u201d While Weiner was bending over to help Branch, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the victim, Robinson returned to the front of the store and found Pinkney lying on the floor. He then ran. Robinson later went back to Moore\u2019s house. Moore was already there, as was Pinkney. Also present was James Ashe.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Ashe testified that he was a student at the University of Maryland School of Nursing and had been prior to that time employed at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore City as a licensed practical nurse. He stated that on the evening of September 5, 1968, around 8:00 p.m., he received a phone call from a friend he had known for 20 years, asking him if he would see \u201ca friend.\u201d At about 9 o\u2019clock he received a second phone call from the same person, repeating the request. Subsequently, a third phone call was received in which he was told that the person he was to see \u201chad been playing around with a gun and he was shot.\u201d Ashe states he advised the caller to take the injured person to the nearest hospital. In response to a fourth call, the person later identified to be the Appellant, was taken to Ashe\u2019s home. Ashe identified the Appellant in open court and testified that the Appellant was wounded in the right upper arm in the area of the bicep and in the upper part of his right hip below the belt. He advised that Pinkney be removed to the hospital, which advice was refused. Appellant was then removed from Ashe\u2019s home. Later that night, somewhere between 10:30 and 11:00 Ashe received another telephone call and suggested certain medication. In response to this call, he went to a house on South Paca Street where he treated Appellant. He described the wounds, after qualification, as \u201cgunshot wounds.\u201d In addition to Appellant, there were two other persons there, one of whom he had known all his life and identified as Robert Lee Robinson, the accomplice. Robinson was brought into the courtroom for the specific purpose of having Ashe identify him, which he readily did.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The police had ascertained Ashe\u2019s identity as a result of their investigation and he gave them a statement. He also admitted he was paid for his services to Pinkney.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Appellant\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial at this stage on the ground that the sequestration rule was violated, and his motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Thereafter, the State produced Sgt. George Christian, a detective of the Baltimore City Police Department, Homicide Squad, of 12 years experience as a police officer and 4 years in homicide. He testified that he had seen 400 to 500 gunshot wounds during his experience with the homicide squad.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">At 4:50 a.m. on May 1, 1969, armed with a warrant for Appellant\u2019s apprehension, he went to the apartment of Mattie Brown, Appellant\u2019s girl friend, on Springdale Avenue in Baltimore, and was admitted into the apartment by Miss Brown, who directed him to the bedroom where he observed Pinkney lying in bed. Christian testified that the Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights were read in toto to Appellant and that no statement was obtained. At the time of the making of the arrest, the Sergeant stated that he observed that Pinkney was limping and he asked him to pull down his shorts; whereupon he observed a bullet hole \u201cin his right buttocks.\u201d According to Christian, Pinkney stated, \u201cThat was foreign matter and let it go at that.\u201d Christian testified, \u201cIt appeared to be healing \u2014have healed up.\u201d Objection was made by the defense as to any testimony of Sergeant Christian relative to his search of Pinkney at the time of the arrest, but the objection was overruled after some discourse, upon which we will comment more fully later on herein, and the Sergeant was allowed to testify. Christian denied under cross-examination that he had yanked or pulled down Pinkney\u2019s underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Appellant testified in his own behalf and admitted that the wound in his buttocks and arm were gunshot wounds. He denied any participation in the robbery - murder and stated that he had received the gunshot wounds as a result of selling fake packages of dope to an irate purchaser who shot him. Appellant acknowledged that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>had been treated by Ashe and did not testify concerning his search by Sergeant Christian at the time of the arrest other than to say that the gunshot wounds in his body were the same ones that Sergeant Christian had observed. He did not know the name of the person to whom he sold the \u201cdummy\u201d bags of drugs, and admitted that he had used heroin. He said that he was shot about an hour and a half after he had made the \u201csale\u201d at Portland and Emory Streets in South Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We cannot agree with the Appellant that he was convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of Robinson, the admitted accomplice. Only slight corroboration is necessary to sustain the conviction provided it \u201ctends either to identify the accused with the perpetrators of the crime, or to show his participation in the crime itself.\u201d <em>Christopher and Klimp v. </em>State, 9 Md. App. 277 (1970), <em>Spies v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 160 (1969), <em>Boone v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 11 (1968), <em>Burley v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 469, 472 (1968). The testimony of the accomplice was that the Appellant was the gunman who shot and killed Mr. Branch on September 5, 1968 during the course of the holdup. The owner of the store, Weiner, established that he had shot the gunman in the upper right shoulder region and fired two or three more shots, knocking the bandit to the floor. Ashe treated Appellant for gunshot wounds of the buttocks and right bicep area on the same night as the holdup shooting and after having been called by telephone within minutes after the actual occurrence. We think the testimony is legally sufficient to carry the case to the jury on the question of Pinkney's guilt of murder and robbery and satisfies the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Pinkney asserts that \u201cthe totality of the evidence produced before the jury in Salisbury could not have been sufficient to convict him.\u201d He points to the fact that neither Weiner nor Baskerville could identify him as the gunman. He contends the only evidence linking him to the crime were the wounds in Ms body and that he explained them fully to the jury. His argument overlooks the testimony established in the State\u2019s case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>selects as its basis only the inability of Weiner and Baskerville to identify Appellant. The jury did not choose, as does Pinkney, to ignore Robinson and Ashe whose testimony, if believed, was legally sufficient to sustain the conviction. <em>Burley v. State, Spies v. State, Boone v. State, Christopher and Klimp v. State, </em>all <em>supra. </em>The jury was not required to believe the Appellant or his alibi. <em>Rasnick v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 564, 568 (1969), <em>Cleveland v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 204, 209 (1969), <em>Tillery v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 142, 148 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Appellant next argues that although he had moved to exclude all witnesses from the courtroom until called to testify, that Robinson, who had completed his testimony, was returned to the courtroom while Ashe was testifying in order for Ashe to identify Robinson. The dialogue pertaining to the identification as disclosed by the transcript is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cQ. Have you seen a fellow known as Rainbow Robinson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> since you have been in Salisbury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">Q. And where did you see him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">A. In the \u2014 to the library of the court house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">MR. NEAL: Is Mr. Robinson back there in the witness room ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">THE SHERIFF: You want him in ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">MR. NEAL: Yes. I would like him brought into the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-14\">MR. NEAL: Walk over here. Stand at the point of the table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">BY MR. NEAL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-16\">Q. Do you recognize this man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-17\">MR. CANNIZZARO: Objection, your Honor, sequestered witness. I object to any question be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ing asked while one of the witnesses is in the courtroom. He is sequestered witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">THE COURT: I do think \u2014 if he wants to ask the witness if he can recognize him, I think he can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">MR. NEAL: I\u2019d like to say I am not going to ask Mr. Ashe about any facts of this case in the presence of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">THE COURT: Proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">MR. NEAL: I just want to know whether or not he knows him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">BY MR. NEAL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">Q. Have you ever seen this man before ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">Q. Do you know him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-13\">A. Yes, very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\">Q. What\u2019s his name ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-15\">A. His name is Rainbow Robinson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-16\">MR. NEAL: You may go back to the room. I would like the record to show Mr. Robinson is no longer in the courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">The rule governing the exclusion of witnesses from the court is Rule 753, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-18\">\u201cThe court may upon its own motion and shall, upon the request of a party, order that the witnesses be excluded from the courtroom until called upon to testify. * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-19\">The purpose of Rule 753 is to prevent a witness from being taught, schooled or prompted by the testimony of another and to prevent prejudice. <em>Burton v. State Roads Commission, </em>251 Md. 403, 247 A. 2d 718 (1968), <em>Watts v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 454, 240 A. 2d 317 (1968), <em>Scott v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>6 Md. App. 200, 251 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>A. 2d 17 (1969), <em>Hurley v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 348, 251 A. 2d 241 (1969), <em>Hill v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 65, 262 A. 2d 573 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">When the request for exclusion of witnesses is made, it is mandatory that the trial court comply with the request. See <em>Bulluck v. State, </em>219 Md. 67, 148 A. 2d 433 (1959), <em>Jones v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 616, 622, 244 A. 2d 459 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">A similar situation to the instant, case developed in <em>Gunn v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 379, 383, 243 A. 2d 15 (1968). In that case the witnesses had been sequestered and a prosecuting witness who had completed her testimony was brought into the courtroom for the purpose of having the doctor who was then testifying identify her as the individual he had examined the night of the rape. We held that notwithstanding the prosecuting witnesses hearing the doctor testify as to his qualification, his examination of the prosecuting witness on the night of the crime and his assumption that she was the young lady he examined, that the error was harmless in view of the fact that the prosecuting witness had completed her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Here, Robinson had completed his testimony and did not hear any questions put to Ashe. The motion for a mistrial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">We turn now to the Appellant\u2019s second and fifth questions which are so closely related that we shall treat them as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">During the testimony of Sgt. Christian, he related to the court that at the time he arrested Appellant on a warrant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pinkney was clothed in shorts and tee shirt. He says he informed Pinkney of his rights under <em>Miranda. </em>He then said that he observed that Mr. Pinkney was limping and that, \u201cAs my investigation revealed certain facts relative to Mr. Pinkney, I asked Mr. Pink<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ney if he would drop his underclothes and let me take a look and he agreed. He dropped his underclothes and I observed what appeared to be a bullet hole in his right buttocks, right side. I questioned Mr. Pinkney relative to this. He stated \u2018that was foreign matter and let it go at that.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The above testimony was taken out of the presence of the jury. Defense counsel requested permission to put the Appellant on the stand on the <em>sole </em>question of the voluntariness of the search of his person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After some colloquy between the court and counsel, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will let you go ahead with testimony under the circumstances before the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">MR. CANNIZZARO: Before the jury? Couldn\u2019t you permit me to put the defendant on the stand to deny, accepting everything the Sergeant said as true without \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">THE COURT: I assume the defendant would deny it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">MR. CANNIZZARO: Assume denial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">THE COURT: I am accepting the Sergeant\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">MR. CANNIZZARO: Keep the jury here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">THE COURT: Sure. Put your man on for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">MR. NEAL: In making this, you\u2019re assuming that the defendant is telling the truth, that he is denying that it was with permission ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">THE COURT: Assuming it was a denial by the defendant of all the Sergeant said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>MR. NEAL: That he is telling the truth is a jury question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">THE COURT: I believe a right to go to the jury, incident to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Whereupon, the jury was recalled and the testimony of Sgt. Christian as to the arrest and search was received into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Appellant likens the court\u2019s refusal to take testimony concerning the search of his person to the admission of a confession, and constituting a violation of the Appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Maryland has long held it elementary that the arresting officer may conduct a search of the person apprehended. <em>Farrow v. State, </em>233 Md. 526 (1963). In <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56 (1950), the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201cWhat is a reasonable search is not to be determined by any fixed formula. The Constitution does not define what are \u2018unreasonable\u2019 searches and, regrettably, in our discipline we have no ready litmus-paper test. The recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches must find resolution in the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">This court has held in <em>Scott v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 505 (1969) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">\u201cThe police have the right to conduct a contemporaneous search of the arrestee\u2019s person for weapons, fruits or instrumentalities of the crime or, \u2018mere evidence,\u2019 incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">See also <em>Terry v. State of Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1 (1968), <em>Gross v. State, </em>235 Md. 429, 440 (1964), and <em>Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v. Hayden, </em>387 U. S. 294 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">The Supreme Court said in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>331 U. S. 145 (1947) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>\u201cThis court has also pointed out that it is only unreasonable searches and seizures which come within the constitutional interdict. The test of reasonableness cannot be stated in rigid and absolute terms. \u2018Each case is to be decided on its own facts and circumstances.\u2019 <em>Go-Bart Importing Company v. U. S., </em>282 U. S. 344, 357, 75 L. Ed. 374, 382, 51 S. Ct. 153 (1931).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">The Fourth Amendment has never been held to require that every valid search and seizure be effected under the authority of a search warrant. Search and seizure incident to a lawful arrest is a practice of ancient origin and has long been an integral part of the law-enforcement procedures of the United States and of the individual states.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The knowledge possessed by the arresting officer that Pinkney had been shot in the buttocks, Pinkney\u2019s apparent limp, and the possibility that Appellant could mutilate the wound or scar so as to preclude its later identification as a gunshot wound, or the possibility that the lapse of time between the Appellant\u2019s apprehension and actual trial would be such that the wound would heal to the extent that it would be unrecognizable as a gunshot wound, we think justified the <em>sight seizure </em>of the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Since we hold that the search of Pinkney at the time of his arrest was lawful and that none of his constitutional rights were violated thereby, we cannot find that the trial judge\u2019s declination to hear Pinkney\u2019s denial of permission to search his person was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As it develops, the trial judge was correct in not hearing from the Appellant out of the presence of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>on the question of the \u201csearch,\u201d but for the wrong reason. The better practice for the trial judge to have followed would have been to adhere to Rule 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\u2022 The Appellant was not denied a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">. <em>Miranda v.
