Landreth later added a claim for derivative liability against Raymond P. Fabricius, P.C. (Fabricius) alleging that, as a former partner of PLF, Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for any judgment entered against PLF for professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation. Fabricius moved to dismiss certain counts of Landreth's second amended complaint as untimely under section 2-619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 2/619 (West 2012) ). The trial court denied Fabricius's motion. Thereafter, the trial court granted Landreth's motion for a summary determination that Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for PLF's debts under 735 ILCS 5/2-1005(d) (West 2012) and, upon Landreth's motion, entered a default judgment against PLF. Landreth subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment as to Fabricius's liability to Landreth, which the trial court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 More than one year later, Fabricius moved for summary judgment as to liability, arguing that Landreth's claims against Fabricius were untimely under section 214.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) ( 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(c) (West\n   2012) (which governs claims of attorney malpractice) or under the judicially-created \"reasonable time\" exception to section 215 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/13-205 (West 2012) ). Landreth moved to strike Fabricius's motion on the ground that Fabricius had waived such affirmative defenses or, in the alternative, that these defenses belonged to PLF, and PLF had waived them. The trial court granted Landreth's motion to strike Fabricius's motion, holding that Fabricius's motion was untimely and that the arguments asserted in Fabricius's motion had been waived. The trial court subsequently entered a final judgment against Fabricius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 In this appeal, Fabricius argues that the trial court erred by: (1) denying Fabricius's motion to dismiss Landreth's claims against Fabricius on statute of limitations grounds; (2) summarily determining that Fabricius is jointly and severally liable for the professional negligence and negligent misrepresentations of PLF; and (3) granting Landreth's motion for summary judgment against Fabricius as to liability. Fabricius also argues that the trial court abused its discretion by striking Fabricius's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On August 5, 2003, Landreth and the City of Ottawa (the City) executed a consulting agreement wherein the City engaged Landreth to provide real estate consulting, marketing, and development services. The agreement was drafted by Keith Leigh (Leigh), an attorney who Landreth alleged was with PLF. The agreement stated that the parties had \"jointly utilized the law firm of [PLF] with respect to this Agreement.\" The agreement provided that it was binding on both parties and that it did not violate any presently-existing provision of law. Both parties performed under the agreement for approximately two years. Thereafter, the City stopped paying Landreth commissions and refused to pay him certain development fees he had earned pursuant to the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 In February 2007, Landreth sued the City for breaching the consulting agreement. On or about April 4, 2007, the City moved to dismiss Landreth's suit, arguing for the first time that the agreement was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because there was no prior appropriation for the agreement, as required by the Municipal Code. On February 28, 2008, a court order was entered dismissing Landreth's breach of contract claim on the ground that the agreement violated certain requirements of the Municipal Code and was therefore void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 In January and February, 2009, Landreth filed two lawsuits in the circuit court of LaSalle County which gave rise to the instant appeal. On January 27, 2009, Landreth filed a tort lawsuit (Case No. 09-L-13) against various defendants, including the City, Leigh, and Pool, Leigh, &amp; Kopko, P.C., which Landreth alleged was formerly known as \"Pool &amp; Leigh, P.C.\" The complaint asserted claims of fraud against all the defendants, negligence against the City, and negligent misrepresentation against Leigh and Pool &amp; Leigh, P.C. In February 2009, Landreth filed a legal malpractice lawsuit (Case No. 09-L-27) against Leigh and Pool, Leigh, &amp; Kopko, P.C., which Landreth alleged was formerly known as \"Pool &amp; Leigh, P.C.\" In that lawsuit, Landreth alleged \"on information and belief\" that, prior to February 1, 2006, Pool &amp; Leigh, P.C. \"was associated with\n   Raymond P. Fabricius, P.C.\" and \"did business under the name Pool, Leigh, and Fabricius.\" The complaint alleged fraud against all the defendants, negligence against the City,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and negligent misrepresentation against Leigh and Pool &amp; Leigh, P.C. Fabricius was not named as a defendant in either the tort lawsuit or the legal malpractice lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 Upon Landreth's request, the trial court consolidated Landreth's tort and legal malpractice lawsuits on November 10, 2011. That same day, Landreth filed a second amended complaint which combined all of his prior claims. In the second amended complaint, Landreth named Fabricius as a defendant for the first time. He asserted claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment against the City and the attorney defendants. He further asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, professional negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and \"owner and successor liability\" against the attorney defendants. The second amended complaint did not allege that Fabricius ever personally represented Landreth. Nor did it allege any specific fraudulent or negligent statements, concealments, or misrepresentations made by Fabricius, nor any specific acts of professional negligence committed by Fabricius. Landreth's claims against Fabricius were entirely derivative;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Landreth claimed that Fabricius was liable solely because of Fabricius's status as a member or partner of PLF, which, Landreth alleged, was either a partnership or an unincorporated association organized for pecuniary profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 On March 23, 2012, Fabricius moved to dismiss several counts of Landreth's second amended complaint pursuant to section 2-619 of the Code (735 ILCS 2/619 (West 2012) ) on the ground that the claims pled against Fabricius were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Fabricius's motion did not identify any specific statute of limitations, and Fabricius did not file a memorandum of law in support of its motion or identify any legal authorities supporting the application of any particular statute of limitations. The trial court initially ruled that Landreth's claims against Fabricius were time-barred under the six-year statute of repose governing claims of attorney malpractice ( 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(c) (West 2012) ) and granted Fabricius's motion to dismiss with prejudice. However, after Landreth moved for reconsideration, the trial court reversed its prior ruling and held that Landreth's claims against Fabricius were timely because: (1) Fabricius's claims were governed either by the five-year limitations period prescribed by 735 ILCS 5/13-205 (West 2012) (the \"catch-all\" statute of limitations that applies to \"all civil actions not otherwise provided for\") or the five-year limitations period prescribed by 735 ILCS 5/13-215 (West 2012) (which applies where there has been fraudulent concealment of a cause of action by the defendant); and (2) Landreth's claims against Fabricius accrued (and the limitations period began to run) fewer than five years before Landreth asserted them. Accordingly, the trial court denied Fabricius's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 In August of 2012, Landreth sought and obtained leave to file a third amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The third amended complaint\n   repeated the allegations contained in the second amended complaint regarding Fabricius's derivative liability for PLF's debts. It did not change any claims from the second amended complaint other than Landreth's claims against the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 On September 14, 2012, the trial court entered an order dismissing with prejudice Landreth's claims against defendants Anita L. Kopko and Pool, Leigh, &amp; Kopko, P.C. and entering a consent judgment in favor of Landreth and against defendant Leigh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 On October 5, 2012, the defendant filed his Answer to Landreth's third amended complaint. Fabricius's Answer did not assert any affirmative defenses. However, during a status conference approximately 10 months after Fabricius filed his Answer, the trial court granted Fabricius leave to file an affirmative defense \"to preserve for appeal\" the issue of whether the limitations provisions prescribed by section 214.3 of the Code were applicable to Landreth's derivative liability claims against Fabricius. The court noted that it was allowing this only for purposes of appeal since it had already ruled on the issue of the applicable statute of limitations. Pursuant to the trial court's order, Fabricius subsequently filed an affirmative defense stating that: (1) section 214.3 provides that actions against an attorney arising out of an act or omission in the performance of professional services must be commenced within two years from the time the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of the injury for which damages are sought, and, in all events not more than six years after the date of which the act or omission occurred; and (2) because the acts or omissions on which Landreth's allegations against Fabricius are premised occurred in 2003, some or all of Landreth's causes of action against Fabricius are \"barred by the statute of limitations prescribed by 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3.\" Fabricius did not identify in its affirmative defense when Landreth \"knew or reasonably should have known of the injury for which damages are sought.\" Nor did Fabricius argue that Landreth had such knowledge more than two year before he filed suit against Fabricius. Because Fabricius's affirmative defense focused only on when the defendants' allegedly negligent acts or omissions occurred (as opposed to when Landreth discovered his injury), Fabricius's affirmative defense appeared to be based entirely on section 214.3(c)'s six-year statute of repose (which Fabricius erroneously referred to as a \"statute of limitations.\") Moreover, Fabricius's affirmative defense did not assert that section 215 of the Code, which tolls statutes of limitation and repose in cases involving fraudulent concealment by the defendant, should not apply to Landreth's claims against Fabricius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 After the parties had conducted discovery for several months, Landreth moved for a summary determination that Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for PLF's debts, including the alleged professional negligence and negligent misrepresentations of PLF. Landreth argued that there was no genuine dispute of material fact that PLF was either an unincorporated association organized for pecuniary profit, of which Fabricius was a member, or a \"partnership by estoppel\" pursuant to section 308 of the Uniform Partnership Act ( 805 ILCS 206/308 (West 2012) ), of which Fabricius was a purported partner. Attached to Landreth's motion for summary determination were the affidavits\n   of Landreth and attorney Drew Peel. In Landreth's affidavit, Landreth attested to various documents and communications he received identifying PLF as a law firm, including the consulting agreement. Landreth swore that, from at least June 2003 through November 2011, he believed that \"[PLF] was a law firm, that [PLF] was some sort of law firm partnership, that Keith Leigh was a partner in the [PLF] law firm, and that an attorney with the last name of Fabricius also was a partner in the [PLF] law firm.\" Landreth also averred that, in entering into and performing the agreement, he reasonably relied to his detriment on the representation that PLF was a law firm jointly representing him and the City in connection with the preparation of the consulting agreement, which was represented and warranted to be valid and enforceable and not in violation of applicable law. Peel's affidavit identified several pleadings and other documents filed by PLF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 Landreth also submitted various documents in support of his motion, including: (1) reported decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court (Third District) from January 1998 through June 2008 identifying Fabricius as an attorney with the law firm of PLF; (2) written appearances and other documents filed with state and federal courts identifying Fabricius as an attorney and/or partner with the law firm of PLF; (3) draft easements and draft property agreements provided to Landreth in connection with his work for the City identifying PLF as the preparer of the easements and the law firm to which notices of the property agreements should be sent; (4) admissions by Fabricius that he shared office space, a copy machine, a fax machine, a telephone system and utilities, and other unspecified expenses with P &amp; L from July 1995 until February 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 15 Landreth also moved for a default judgment against PLF as to Landreth's professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims. Landreth provided notice and copies of this motion to attorneys for defendants Leigh, Anita Kopko, and Fabricius. The trial court invited Fabricius to file a written opposition to Landreth's motion for default judgment. Fabricius did not file a response or a written objection to Landreth's motion. Nor did Fabricius arrange for counsel to appear on behalf of PLF to oppose the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 16 On October 4, 2013, Fabricius filed its response to Landreth's motion for summary determination. Attached to the response was the affidavit of Raymond Fabricius attesting that: (1) he is the president and sole shareholder of Fabricius; (2) from July 1995 to February 6, 2006, Fabricius and Pool &amp; Leigh, P.C. shared office space and some expenses, but did not share profits, income, or clients, including the City; (3) Fabricius never met with Landreth or the City concerning the matters raised in Landreth's lawsuit, nor did he participate in performing or consulting as to the legal services purportedly provided by Leigh relative to the matter complained of in Landreth's lawsuit. Fabricius's written response to Landreth's motion for summary determination made no mention of Landreth's motion for default judgment against PLF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 On November 22, 2013, the trial court conducted a hearing on Landreth's motions. During the hearing, the trial court again invited Fabricius to be heard on Landreth's default judgment motion against PLF. Counsel for Landreth responded that he \"did not think [he had] a legal basis to object to the actual entry of default.\" However, \"given the potential legal ramifications\" to Fabricius, counsel asked that the court require proof of the\n   allegations against PLF as well as proof of the allegations against Fabricius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 18 The trial court granted Landreth's motion for summary determination and ruled that Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for PLF's debts. In so ruling, the trial court found that there was no genuine dispute of material fact that PLF was either an unincorporated association organized for pecuniary profit, of which Fabricius was a member, or a \"partnership by estoppel\" under section 308 of the Uniform Partnership Act, of which Fabricius was a purported partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 19 The trial court also granted Landreth's motion for default judgment against PLF. Based on the record evidence, including a consent judgment previously entered pursuant to a settlement wherein defendant Leigh admitted his personal liability for professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation, the trial court exercised its discretion to grant the default judgment without requiring a prove-up of Landreth's negligence allegations against PLF. On December 23, 2013, the trial court entered a default judgment of liability in favor of Landreth and against PLF. Fabricius never moved to vacate the default judgment. Nor did it engage counsel to move to vacate the default judgment on PLF's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 20 On January 8, 2014, Landreth moved for summary judgment as to Fabricius's liability to Landreth. Landreth's motion asserted that, because the trial court had entered a default judgment against PLF and had ruled that Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for PLF's debts, Landreth was entitled to summary judgment in his favor and against Fabricius as to liability. In response, Fabricius argued that it was not bound by the default judgment entered against PLF. After conducting a hearing, the trial court granted Landreth's motion for summary judgment and ruled that Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for the judgment against PLF. In so ruling, the trial court noted that Fabricius \"certainly had the opportunity\" to present personal defenses contesting that it was jointly and severally liable for PLF's debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 21 More than one year later, Fabricius moved for summary judgment as to liability, arguing that Landreth's claims against Fabricius were untimely under section 214.3 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(c) (West 2012) ) or under the judicially-created \"reasonable time\" exception to section 215 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/13-215 (West 2012) ). Landreth moved to strike Fabricius's motion on the ground that Fabricius had waived such affirmative defenses or, in the alternative, that those defenses belonged to PLF, and PLF had waived them. The trial court granted Landreth's motion to strike Fabricius's motion, holding that Fabricius's motion was untimely and that the arguments asserted in the motion had been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 22 Landreth filed a motion for summary judgment as to damages, which the trial court granted in part. After the parties resolved their remaining disputes as to damages by agreement, the trial court entered a final judgment against Fabricius in the amount of $951,719.57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 23 This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 24 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 25 On appeal, Fabricius argues that the trial court erred by: (1) denying Fabricius's motion to dismiss Landreth's claims against Fabricius on statute of limitations grounds; (2) summarily determining that Fabricius is jointly and severally liable for the professional negligence and negligent misrepresentations of PLF; and (3) granting Landreth's motion for summary judgment against Fabricius as to liability. Fabricius\n   also argues that the trial court abused its discretion by striking Fabricius's motion for summary judgment. We address these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 26 1. Fabricius's Motion to Dismiss\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 27 Fabricius argues that the trial court erred in denying its section 2-619 motion to dismiss Landreth's claims as untimely under the applicable statute of limitations. A motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2-619 admits the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint (as well as all well-pled facts and reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them), but asserts an affirmative defense or other matter that avoids or defeats the plaintiffs' claim.\n   <em>\n    DeLuna v.

On appeal, Fabricius argues that Landreth's claims were untimely under section 214.3, which prescribes a two-year limitations period for claims filed against an attorney \"arising out of the attorney's actions or omissions in the provision of professional legal services\" (735 ILCS 5/13214.3(b)(i) (West 2012) ) and a six year statute of repose for such claims (735 ILCS 5/13214.3(c) (West 2012) ). Fabricius argues that Landreth's claims against Fabricius are predicated on the alleged legal malpractice of PLF. Claims for attorney malpractice accrue (and the two-year limitations provision under section 214.3(b) begins to run) when the plaintiff knows or should know facts that would cause him to believe that his injury was wrongfully caused by the attorney's negligence.\n   <em>\n    Romano v. Morrisroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1281464\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/326/26/#p28\">\n    326 Ill.

Fabricius maintains that Landreth should have known that he was injured by PLF's professional negligence no later than April 4, 2007, when the City moved to dismiss Landreth's breach of contract suit on the ground that the consulting agreement drafted by Leigh was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because it did not comply with certain provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code. Thus, Fabricius maintains, section 214.3(b) required Landreth to file his lawsuit against Fabricius no later than April 4, 2009. Because Landreth did not name Fabricius as a defendant until he filed his second amended complaint on November 10, 2011, Fabricius contends that Landreth's claims against him were untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 29 In the alternative, Fabricius argues that the six-year statute of repose prescribed by section 214.3(c) bars Landreth's claims. The statute of repose begins to run on the last date on which the defendant attorney performed the allegedly negligent representation, irrespective of when the injury occurs or is discovered by the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Carlen v.

Although Fabricius filed an affirmative defense that referenced 214.3 ten months after filing its Answer, that affirmative defense focused entirely on section 214.3's six-year statute of repose. Specifically, Fabricius's affirmative defense asserted that that some or all of Landreth's claims were barred by section 214.3 because the acts or omissions upon which those claims were premised \"occurred in 2003.\" Although the affirmative defense mentioned section 214.3(b)'s two-year limitations period in passing, it did not plead facts suggesting when Landreth knew or should have known facts that would cause him to believe that his injury was wrongfully caused by his attorneys' negligence. Nor did it plead facts suggesting that Landreth had such actual or constructive knowledge more than two years before he filed suit against Fabricius. Illinois is a fact pleading jurisdiction, and \"[t]he facts constituting any affirmative defense * * * must be plainly set forth in the answer or reply.\" 735 ILCS 5/2-613(d) (West 2012).

Section 214.3 applies only to claims filed against an attorney \"arising out of the attorney's actions or omissions in the provision of professional legal services.\" Landreth's claims against Fabricius do not arise out of Fabricius's provision of legal services to Landreth. Landreth's second amended complaint does not allege that Fabricius ever personally represented Landreth or performed any legal services for him. Rather, Landreth seeks to hold Fabricius liable only derivatively based upon Fabricius's status as a partner or member of PLF. Accordingly, section 214.3 does not apply to Landreth's claims against Fabricius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 32 In any event, even if section 214.3's statutes of limitation and repose applied to Landreth's derivative claims against Fabricius, those claims would still have been timely under the circumstances presented in this case.

The trial court granted Landreth's motion and reversed its prior ruling that Landreth's claims were untimely. Fabricius does not argue on appeal that Landreth has failed to adequately allege fraudulent concealment by Fabricius or any other defendant. Accordingly, the trial court's ruling on that issue stands. Pursuant to section 215, Landreth would have had to file suit within five years after he discovered that he had a cause of action. 735 ILCS 5/13-215 (West 2012). Fabricius argued that Landreth discovered his cause of action against PLF and Fabricius no later than April 4, 2007, when the City moved to dismiss Landreth's breach of contract suit against it on the ground that its agreement with Landreth was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   for failure to include a prior appropriation as required by the Municipal Code. Landreth contends that he did not know he had a cause of action against PLF or any attorney defendants until February 28, 2008, when the trial court dismissed Landreth's breach of contract action against the City on the ground that the agreement violated the Municipal Code. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Fabricius' is correct (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Landreth discovered his cause of action on April 4, 2007), Landreth would have had to file his complaint within 5 years from that date (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by April 4, 2012). 735 ILCS 5/13-215 (West 2012). As noted above, Landreth filed his second amended complaint naming PLF and Fabricius as defendants on November 10, 2011. Accordingly, even if section 214.3 applied to Landreth's claims against Fabricius, those claims would have been timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 33 Fabricius argues that section 215 does not render Landreth's claims timely in this case due to a judicially-constructed \"reasonable time\" rule.

Applying this reasoning, Fabricius argues that section 215 should not apply in this case because Landreth knew or should have known that he had a cause of action by April 4, 2007, which was more than two years prior to the expiration of section 214.3's six-year statute of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 34 However, Fabricius has forfeited any reliance on the so-called \"reasonable time rule\" by failing to raise it before the trial court, either as an affirmative defense or as argument in support of Fabricius's motion to dismiss (or in opposition to Landreth's motions for reconsideration).\n   <em>\n    Village of Roselle v.

Landreth presented unrebutted evidence in the form of court filings and other public documents which showed that, from June 1998 through February 2006, Fabricius had repeatedly and publicly represented that PLF was a law firm and that Fabricius was an attorney practicing with the PLF law firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was also undisputed that PLF used stationary bearing the legend \"Law Offices, POOL, LEIGH &amp; FABRICIUS,\" and used letterhead listing those attorney names and stating that PLF was \"An Association Including Professional Corporations.\" In addition, Landreth signed an agreement that identified PLF as counsel for Landreth and the City. (The agreement was filed for public inspection before being executed by the City.) Moreover, Landreth's testified that he reasonably believed that he was represented by PLF in the drafting of the agreement, that an attorney with the last name of\n   Fabricius was a partner in the [PLF] law firm at the time PLF drafted the agreement, and that Landreth reasonably relied to his detriment on the representation that PLF was a law firm jointly representing him and the City in connection with the preparation of the consulting agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 45 This evidence was sufficient to establish that PLF was a partnership by estoppel and that Fabricius was a partner in that partnership.

Fabricius also challenges Landreth's claim that Landreth relied upon the representation of partnership. However, Landreth's unrebutted, sworn statement that he believed that he was being represented by PLF in connection with the agreement and that he believed that an attorney with the last name of Fabricius was a member of that law firm is enough to satisfy the reliance element. Fabricius cites no authority to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 47 Fabricius did not rebut the evidence of a partnership by estoppel presented by Landreth. Nor did Fabricius suggest that it ever disclaimed such a partnership during the relevant time period.

Landreth's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Fabricius's Liability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 49 After the trial court granted Landreth's motion for summary determination, Landreth moved for summary judgment as to Fabricius's liability. In its motion, Landreth asserted that, because the trial court had entered a default judgment against PLF and had ruled that Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for PLF's professional negligence, Landreth was entitled to summary judgment against Fabricius as to liability. After conducting a hearing, the trial court granted Landreth's motion and ruled that Fabricius was jointly and severally liable for the judgment against PLF. In so ruling, the trial court noted that Fabricius \"certainly had the opportunity\" to present personal defenses contesting that it was jointly and severally liable for PLF's debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 50 As it did before the trial court, Fabricius argues on appeal that it is not bound by the default judgment entered against PLF and not liable for PLF's acts of professional negligence or negligent misrepresentations. In support of this argument, Fabricius cites\n   <em>\n    Chamblin v.

However, neither of the cases cited by Fabricius involves a default judgment entered against a partnership or association. A judgment against a partnership binds the individual members or partners of the partnership regardless of whether they participate as parties to the litigation.

The trial court repeatedly invited Fabricius to oppose the entry of a default judgment against PLF. Nevertheless, despite the evident effect that such a judgment would have against Fabricius, Fabricius did not assume PLF's defense, engage counsel for PLF, or oppose the entry of default judgment against PLF. Nor did Fabricius move to vacate the default judgment subsequently entered against PLF. Under these circumstances, Fabricius forfeited any defense to liability that PLF may have interposed, and Fabricius cannot reasonably contend that it is not bound by the default judgment entered against PLF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 52 4. The Striking of Fabricius's Motion for Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 53 Fabricius further argues that the trial court abused its discretion by striking its motion for summary judgment. Fabricius's motion argued that Landreth's claims were time-barred under section 214.3 and that the \"reasonable time rule\" precluded tolling of section 214.3(c)'s statute of repose due to fraudulent concealment. The trial court granted Landreth's motion to strike Fabricius's motion, reasoning,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the court had already determined that Fabricius had waived any arguments under section 214.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 54 A trial court has the inherent authority to control its docket, which includes the discretion to strike tardy pleadings.
