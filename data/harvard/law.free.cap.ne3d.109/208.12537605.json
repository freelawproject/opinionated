Collins, pro se, appeals from a judgment of the Cleveland Municipal Court, convicting him of operating a vehicle under the influence (\"OVI\") in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), OVI and refusing a chemical test with a prior conviction within 20 years in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), and driving under OVI suspension in violation of R.C. 4510.14. After a thorough review of the record and applicable law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Procedural History and Substantive Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 24, 2014, Collins was charged with OVI, OVI in connection with a refusal to submit to testing and having a prior conviction within 20 years, driving while under OVI suspension, and driving outside of marked lanes. Collins entered not guilty pleas to all of the charges and proceeded pro se on the matter. He filed a motion to suppress and a supplemental motion to suppress. The court held a hearing in which it heard testimony from Ohio State Trooper Hiram Morales and Collins, on his own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Trooper Morales has been employed with the Ohio State Highway Patrol for 11 years, performing traffic enforcement and OVI apprehension. He has received training concerning detection and apprehension of impaired drivers and is familiar with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrative (\"NHTSA\") manual and its standards. Trooper Morales has received training in the administration of field sobriety tests in accordance with the NHTSA standards, and he has conducted over 100 OVI stops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Trooper Morales testified that he was working at 1:11 a.m. on September 24, 2014, when he observed a vehicle drive outside of the marked lanes of I-90 approximately four times. He stopped the vehicle, approached the driver, and requested the driver's license and vehicle registration. When he ran a computer check of the driver's license, he learned that the driver, Carl Collins, was under an administrative license suspension (\"ALS\") for an OVI refusal on August 29, 2014. Trooper Morales asked Collins to exit the\n   vehicle, and he inquired of Collins's suspension. When Collins exited the vehicle, the trooper observed Collins chewing gum and asked Collins to spit it out. When Collins spit out the gum, Trooper Morales smelled alcohol on Collins's breath. The trooper asked Collins if he had been drinking, and Collins replied that he had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At this point, Trooper Morales asked Collins to perform certain field sobriety tests. He testified that Collins consented to taking the tests. The trooper first conducted the horizontal gaze nystagmus (\"HGN\") test. Trooper Morales testified concerning the NHTSA standard for this test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   First we ask the individual/suspect if there's any issue with their eyesight. Any eye condition or head trauma we should be aware of or the medical issues that the person has. Then we use a stimulus or a pen is placed slightly above eye level between 12 and 15 inches from the center of the individual's face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   We advised Mr. Collins that he has to follow the tip of the pen with his eyes only. He's not to move his head during the test. The pen is going to be moving from one side to the other at a slow pace. With each clue, there's a specific amount of time that we have to move the pen from one side on the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trooper testified that he administered the test in accordance with the NHTSA standards, allowing Collins to remove his eyeglasses. The trooper further testified regarding the clues of impairment from this test and explained what they meant and what he observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Witness: We are looking for smooth pursuit, in maximum deviation and onset prior to 45 degree[s] as well as vertical nystagmus. The defendant showed clues of lack of smooth pursuit, maximum nystagmus, and that's four clues out of a possible six clues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Prosecutor: Okay. And how many clues need to be observed in order to indicate impairment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Witness: Four.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Prosecutor: Okay. And you stated he had lack of smooth pursuit. What does that mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Witness: Basically, when you [are] looking for smooth pursuit, best way to explain it is * * * [i]f you move your eyes from one side to the other, it should be a smooth movement from one side [to] the other. The defendant's case, you can see jerking of the eye as they were going from one side to the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Prosecutor: What does that indicate to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Witness: The presence of alcohol in his system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Prosecutor: In which eye or eyes did you obtain lack of smooth pursuit? Witness: On both. Right and left.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Prosecutor: You stated nystagmus with maximum. How would you describe what that means?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Witness: Again we are looking for involuntary jerking of the eyes. In a normal individual, you move your stimulus all the way to the side as far as eyes can go, allow the eyes to set and then you hold it there for four seconds, no more than 30 seconds and you [are] looking for again, involuntary jerking of the eyes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Prosecutor: And in which eye or eyes did you observe that in Mr. Collins?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Witness: Both eyes, left and right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trooper then conducted the walk-and-turn (\"WAT\") test. Trooper Morales testified concerning the NHTSA standard for this test. The trooper explained that an officer asks the suspect if he has any medical issues with his back or lower\n   extremities that may prevent them from walking a straight line. He then instructs an individual as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   I tell the defendant not to start the test until the instructions are completed. Proceed to either use a straight line on the pavement or have the defendant imagine a straight line on the pavement. I usually allow the individual to use the front license plate of my patrol car as reference point for a straight line.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   My first set of instructions, I'll ask the defendant when told to do so they have to place their left foot on the line, right foot in front of it touching heel to toe. Hands down to their side and to hold that position for the very next set of instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Once the defendant is in the requested position, I'll demonstrate the fact that they have to take nine steps. First step from the initial position would be step number one. Because of distance restraints, I usually take three steps just to explain/demonstrate the test, but I make an emphasis to the defendant that they have to take nine steps heel to toe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   First step would be step number one. Once they reach their nin[th] step, the front foot, whichever it is, stays planted, the back foot comes around, take the few choppy steps, basically pivoting on just the front foot. Once they turn around, again, first step would be step number one. They take nine more steps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Basically nine steps forward, turn around, as they were instructed, and walk back taking nine steps heel to toe. Before the test begins, I tell them to look down at their toes, count out loud every step, don't stop until that person [has] completed the test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Then I'll ask them if they have any questions for me or if there's something within the test that they didn't understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Trooper Morales testified that he considered Collins's age as a factor in taking the test, but NHTSA standards did not prohibit someone of his age (70 years old at the time) from performing the test. He asked Collins if he had any physical limitations that would prevent him from being able to take the test. The trooper testified that Collins advised the trooper that he \"had some issues with his right leg.\" The trooper stated that he was going to give Collins a demonstration and Collins could then decide whether he could perform the test. According to the trooper, Collins \"said he was going to give it a try.\" The trooper then asked Collins to perform the WAT test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Trooper Morales testified that he administered the WAT test after Collins indicated that he understood the trooper's instructions. The trooper observed three of a possible eight clues of impairment with Collins's performance-starting before instructions are complete, failing to touch heel-to-toe, and turning incorrectly. The number of clues indicative of impairment is two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Trooper Morales then administered the one-legged stand (\"OLS\") test. Once again, Collins emphasized his knee issue and, once again, the trooper told Collins that it was his choice as to whether to perform the test. The trooper also testified regarding the NHTSA standards for administration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Again we ask the defendant, we already know if they have any issues with their back or knees based on the WAT test so again, I'll reiterate, that I'll give the explanation for the test and the defendant will let me know if they can do the test or not based upon their condition. I'll ask the defendant to put feet [his] together. Hand[s] to the side again. They're not going to start the test until told to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   When told to do so, they're going to raise whichever foot they prefer. It's their choice on the foot they're going to use. They're going to raise that foot approximately six inches from the ground. Toes are going to be pointed out. They're * * * looking down on their toes. Hands down to their side. When they're in an established position, they're going to start counting the following manner. One thousand, a thousand two, a thousand three, and so on so forth. That test is going to last 30 seconds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In the meantime, if they drop their foot during those 30 seconds, they're told to bring their same foot back up and continue counting where they left off. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trooper observed two clues of impairment-swaying while counting, and dropping his foot, to the point where Collins \"basically almost fell.\" Two clues in this test are indicative of impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Finally, the trooper testified that Collins refused to take the portable breath test, and Collins was placed under arrest. According to Trooper Morales, Collins was under the influence of alcohol and not able to drive a motor vehicle. Trooper Morales engaged his dashboard camera to record the events of the evening, and the camera recorded the events without sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Following the suppression hearing, and after viewing the trooper's dashboard camera, the court denied Collins's motion to suppress and scheduled the matter for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 14} A jury trial commenced on March 9, 2017, following numerous continuances, delays, and Collins's interlocutory appeal of the trial court's denials of Collins's motion to suppress and motion to dismiss. At trial, Trooper Morales testified on behalf of the city, and Collins proceeded pro se and testified on his own behalf. The state introduced into evidence video footage from Trooper Morales's dashboard camera, which was played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Trooper Morales testified for the jury that he observed Collins's vehicle drive over the marked lanes of I-90 approximately four times, by \"at least a tire's width,\" at almost 1:30 a.m. on September 24, 2014. The trooper initiated a traffic stop and ran Collins's driver's license through the Law Enforcement Automated Data System (\"LEADS\"), which showed that Collins was under an administrative license suspension for a \"refusal\" from a previous OVI stop in August 2014. When the trooper approached Collins, he observed Collins chewing gum. He asked him to spit the gum out, and when he did, the trooper smelled alcohol on Collins's breath. The trooper testified that Collins denied having been drinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Trooper Morales then testified that he administered three field sobriety tests: HGN, WAT, and OLS. He testified at length regarding the NHTSA standards for administration of the tests and how he administered the tests on Collins in accordance with these standards. The trooper testified that Collins agreed to perform the tests, despite advising the trooper that he had issues concerning his knee. Trooper Morales stated that he took into consideration Collins's age in administering the test, but the NHTSA standards do not prohibit an individual over 65 years of age from performing the physical field sobriety tests, such as the WAT and the OLS tests. Trooper Morales testified that Collins demonstrated four clues of impairment during the HGN test, three clues of impairment during the WAT test, and two clues of impairment during the OLS test. In each test, the number of clues met or exceeded the number of clues indicative of impairment. Trooper Morales stated that Collins refused the portable breath test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On cross-examination, Trooper Morales testified that he did not recall Collins advising him that he had eye surgery a couple of months before the arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On his own behalf, Collins testified that he was returning from work on the morning in question and he had not been drinking. He stated that he believed the highway lanes were 12 feet apart when in reality they were only 10 feet wide. Collins indicated that he may have driven over the marked lanes because he assumed, incorrectly, that he had more room for his large car to travel within the lanes. Collins also testified that he told Trooper Morales that he had a \"bad eye.\" He conceded that he believed he could perform the HGN test. Collins explained his knee problem and an injury to his \"semicircular canals,\" which determine balance. Collins also testified that he was not drinking that morning because he is allergic to alcohol. Finally, Collins admitted on cross-examination that he was convicted of an OVI offense in 2002 and that he was under an ALS suspension for an OVI refusal at the time of the stop in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The jury found Collins guilty of OVI in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), OVI and refusing a chemical test with a prior conviction within 20 years in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), and driving under OVI suspension in violation of R.C. 4510.14. The minor misdemeanor charge of a marked lanes violation was subsequently dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Collins now appeals his conviction, assigning the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   I. The arresting officer had no valid reason for stopping the Defendant and initiating testing to determine whether or not the Defendant had consumed alcohol or was under the influence of an intoxicant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   II. The arresting officer misstated comments and answers given by the Defendant and proceeded to ask the Defendant if he would perform a list of test[s] to [e]nsure that he was capable of continuing to drive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   III. The arresting officer obtained the acquiescence of the Defendant to participating in the field sobriety test by telling the Defendant that he had to ascertain, through the tests, that the Defendant was capable of continuing to drive his vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   IV. [The] court denied the Defendant's Motion to Suppress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   V. The court denied the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss even though the court proceedings prior to trial had continued far beyond the ninety (90) days required by law even though this Defendant had not signed or made any other indication that he was waiving his right to a speedy trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Law and Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In his pro se appeal, Collins essentially claims that the police unlawfully detained and arrested him, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, and the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based upon speedy trial grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In his first assignment of error, Collins argues that the police officer \"had no valid reason\" to stop him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as Article I, Section 14, of the Ohio Constitution, prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures lacking probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Hts. v.

When the trooper approached Collins, he observed Collins chewing gum. He asked him to spit the gum out, and when he did, the trooper smelled alcohol on Collins's breath. Collins denied having been drinking.

He properly instructed Collins regarding the process, and he demonstrated the test for Collins. The trooper testified that he observed three out of a possible eight clues of impairment during this test-beginning before instructed, not touching heel-to-toe, and incorrectly turning. Trooper Morales testified that two clues are indicative of impairment. The trooper stated that he took into consideration Collins's age (70 years old at the time of the incident) in the performance of the WAT test; however, there is no NHTSA prohibition on administering\n   this test on someone of Collins's age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Concerning the OLS test, the NHTSA manual requires\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   the officer to instruct subjects to begin the test with their feet together and keep their arms at their side for the entire test. The officer must also tell the suspects that they must raise one leg, either leg, six inches from the ground and maintain that position while counting out loud for thirty seconds. NHTSA standards provide that the counting should be done in the following manner: \"one thousand and one, one thousand and two, until told to stop.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Dedejczyk\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49, quoting\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 49} We find once again that Trooper Morales substantially complied with NHTSA standards in administering the OLS test. He testified that Collins indicated he had difficulty with his right leg, but the trooper gave Collins the option of not performing the test and Collins chose to proceed with the test. Trooper Morales observed two of the six possible clues of impairment-swaying while counting and dropping a foot. Two clues are indicative of impairment. The trooper stated, and the video depicts, that Collins \"basically almost fell at one point in time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Based upon the uncontradicted testimony of Trooper Morales, we find that the trial court relied upon competent, credible evidence in determining that the trooper's administration of the field sobriety tests substantially complied with the NTHSA standards. Collins's fourth assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 51} In his final assignment of error, Collins contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss based upon speedy trial violations. He argues that speedy trial time was violated due to motions made by the prosecutor, delays in receiving discovery, and other extensions such as the prosecutor's or arresting officer's unavailability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 52} R.C. 2945.71(B)(2) provides that a defendant charged on a first-degree misdemeanor must be brought to trial within 90 days after arrest or service of summons.

He was arraigned on September 29, 2014, at which time a judge was assigned and a pretrial scheduled for October 9, 2014. At this point, the speedy trial time was 15 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 59} During the October pretrial, Collins was not represented and he was informed of his right to counsel. He filed a demand for discovery, and the pretrial was continued at Collins's request until November 5, 2014. At the continued pretrial, Collins waived his right to counsel. The record indicates that discovery was ongoing and Collins requested a continuance until November 26, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Collins contends that the trooper \"kept forgetting\" to bring to court the requested video demanded during discovery and this failure caused \"several delays.\" We note, however, that there is no evidence in the record that the trooper caused any delays; rather, the court's docket indicates that the pretrials were continued at the defendant's request. Moreover, even if the trooper did, in fact, fail to turn over the video at some point during these pretrial proceedings, we cannot find this delay unreasonable, nor do we find it counted toward Collins's speedy trial time. The discovery demand was made on October 9, which tolls the speedy trial time for a reasonable response time of 30 days, and on November 12, 2014, Collins filed a motion to suppress, which also tolls the speedy trial time. The period of time between Collins's discovery demand and his motion to suppress was 34 days. Under the circumstances, we find Collins's speedy trial time was tolled during this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 61} On November 26, 2014, Collins filed a supplemental motion to suppress, which further tolled the speedy trial time. The city filed its timely opposition to Collins's motions to suppress and a response to Collins's discovery demand on December 3, 2014. The trial court held a hearing on Collins's motion on December 17, 2014,\n   which was within 30 days of the filing of the motion and therefore presumptively reasonable. The court denied Collins's motion to suppress on January 7, 2015, which was also a reasonable time. All of this time was therefore tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 62} On January 15, 2015, Collins filed his motion to dismiss for speedy trial violations pursuant to R.C. 2945.71. The period of time between the court's ruling on Collins's motion to suppress and Collins's filing of the motion to dismiss was 8 days, thereby providing a total of 23 days on the speedy trial clock. His motion to dismiss tolls the time period yet again, until the motion is ruled upon. There is no record in this case, however, of the court ruling on this motion. As such, it is deemed denied.\n   <em>\n    State v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

In strictly construing any ambiguity in the record in favor of Collins, we charge an additional 4 days to the city-from February 15, when the last tolling period ended, to February 19, when Collins requested a continuance that commenced a new tolling event. The speedy trial time up to this point was 27 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 64} On March 25, 2015, the prosecutor filed a motion to continue the jury trial scheduled for April 2, 2015. The prosecutor stated that it was the city's first continuance requested of the jury trial, noting that the trial was scheduled in his absence while he was on bereavement leave, and he was unavailable on that April date due to a conflict. The court continued the trial until April 30, 2015. Finding the record demonstrates the need for a continuance and the request is reasonable, we find the prosecutor's motion is a tolling event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 65} We note, that even if we were to find the prosecutor's request unreasonable, thus charging the additional 28-day period to the state, Collins's speedy trial time would have amounted to 55 days at this point, which is within the statutory speedy trial time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 66} On April 30, the trial was continued once again, this time at Collins's request, and the court rescheduled the trial for May 28, 2015. On this May date, Collins signed a waiver of speedy trial, consenting to a continuance of the matter beyond the statutory period. At this point, based on our calculations, and considering the numerous tolling events, only 27 days of speedy trial time had elapsed, which is well below the 90 days for a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Collins's right to a speedy trial was therefore not violated. Accordingly, Collins's fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   MARY J. BOYLE, J., and SEAN C.
