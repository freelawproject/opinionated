L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in the county court, seeking review of a Superior Court judge's order denying his motion to withdraw a guilty plea and to enforce a plea agreement. The single justice essentially denied the petition, and Sena appeals.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-8\">\n     Sena has filed a memorandum and appendix pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">\n      434 Mass. 1301\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2001), although he is not challenging an interlocutory ruling of the trial court. Even though the rule does not apply in this situation, it is evident on the record before us that review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is not warranted because an adequate alternative remedy is available: specifically, an appeal to the Appeals Court from the Superior Court's denial of the request to withdraw the guilty plea. Indeed, Sena filed a notice of appeal from the judge's order, and his appeal has been docketed in the Appeals Court. \"This court's extraordinary power of general superintendence under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is not a shortcut for the normal process of ... appeal.\"\n     <em>\n      Padmanabhan\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Yout\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451954,12451955\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/1012/\">\n      477 Mass. 1012\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 1013,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20N.E.3d%201114\">\n      75 N.E.3d 1114\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2017).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     A judgment shall enter in the county court denying the petition under G.
