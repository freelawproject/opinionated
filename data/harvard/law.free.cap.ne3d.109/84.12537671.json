GALLAGHER, A.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (the \"BWC\") appeals from a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas awarding plaintiff-appellee the city of Cleveland (the \"city\") over $4.5 million in restitution on the city's claim that it was unlawfully charged excessive workers' compensation insurance premiums in order to subsidize overly generous premium discounts given to public employers who participated in the BWC's group-rating program. The city's unjust enrichment claim was patterned after a similar claim raised by private employers in\n   <em>\n    San Allen v. Buehrer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2071\">\n    2014-Ohio-2071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20N.E.3d%20739\">\n    11 N.E.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The BWC asserts that this case is \"materially different\" from\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   . It contends that \"threshold legal issues\" regarding the court's subject matter jurisdiction, the city's alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies and several other affirmative defenses \"independently demand dismissal\" of the city's lawsuit and that the equities in this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   , do not entitle the city to restitution. The BWC argues that the trial court erred in denying its motions to dismiss and for summary judgment and in granting, in part, the city's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability. The BWC further contends that the trial court erred in precluding the BWC from raising its affirmative defenses at trial and that the trial court's restitution award is against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The BWC's Rating System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The State Insurance Fund\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The city, a municipal corporation, is a public employer taxing district (\"PEC\") governed by Ohio's workers' compensation laws. The administrator of the BWC, with the approval of its board of directors, sets the premiums employers pay into the state insurance fund for workers' compensation coverage each year. Pursuant to R.C. 4123.38, the city is required to \"contribute to the public insurance fund the amount of money determined by the administrator of workers' compensation.\" The state insurance fund is comprised of two separate funds administered by the BWC, i.e., a \"public fund\" consisting of the net premiums (after adjustments and dividends) contributed by public employers, and a \"private fund,\" consisting of the net premiums (after adjustments and dividends) contributed by private employers. R.C. 4123.01(B), (H), (J) ; 4123.30. R.C. 4123.30 requires that each fund be \"collected, distributed, and its solvency maintained without regard to or reliance upon the other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The BWC is designed to operate on a \"revenue-neutral\" basis. This means that the BWC seeks to collect from employers participating in Ohio's workers' compensation insurance program only the amount of premiums necessary to cover the BWC's projected claims costs and administrative expenses and to maintain a reasonable surplus in the state insurance fund. Each year the BWC separately estimates for each employer segment, i.e., private employers and public employers, the costs of claims and expenses expected to be incurred for that segment. Once the BWC determines the total premiums it needs to collect, the BWC then allocates that sum amongst the employers participating in the workers' compensation system. Under Ohio's workers' compensation system, employers are classified into one or more manual classes based on the type of work in which their employees are engaged and the degree of hazard of the employer's operations. After the BWC determines its total premium needs for the policy year for an employer segment, it distributes the premiums across the manual classes for that segment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} There are approximately 3,800 PECs in Ohio. PECs are assigned to one or more of 14 different manual classes based on the type of entity, e.g., city, county or township. The policy year for PECs participating in Ohio's workers' compensation program begins on January 1 and ends on December 31 each calendar year. A PEC can change the plan in which it participates from one policy year to the next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Base Rating and Experience Rating\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Employers are either base rated or experience rated under Ohio's workers' compensation system. Base rated employers-employers that are too small to be rated on their own loss and payroll history-are charged workers' compensation premiums according to the base rates of the manual class or classes to which they are assigned, i.e., based on the projected average costs of claims expected to be filed against all employers in the manual class for the policy year for which rates are being set. For a base-rated employer, no adjustment is made for the employer's actual historical loss experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Employers that are not base rated are experience rated. Under experience rating, an employer's past claims experience, adjusted by a credibility factor based on the statistical reliability of the employer's\n   experience, is used to determine the employer's premium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   With experience rating, an \"experience modification factor\" is applied that raises or lowers the premium from the base rate. Experience-rated employers are either credit-rated or debit-rated depending on their claims history. An employer whose loss experience is lower than average, compared with other employers in the same class, will receive a credit and pay a rate lower than the base rate. An employer whose loss experience is higher than average, compared with other employers in the same class, will receive a debit and may pay a premium higher than the base rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The BWC determines base rates on an annual basis for each manual class by projecting the future costs of the combined loss experience of all employers in the manual class based on historical data and applying certain other factors, including a factor for catastrophic losses, a rate level factor (to reflect the overall statewide rate level), a factor to fund the operations of the division of safety and hygiene and an off-balance factor. The off-balance factor adjusts the base rate for the impact that experience rating (including group rating and the discounts given to group-rated employers under the group-rating program, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ) has on the overall expected collection of premiums.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before comprehensive rate reforms were implemented in 2010, the off-balance factor varied from manual class to manual class for PEC employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Annual assessments are added to the base rate or the experience-modified base rate, as applicable, to cover administrative costs of the BWC and Industrial Commission and to fund certain relief funds for disabled workers (the \"assessments\"). The assessments are calculated as a percentage of premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A base-rated employer's \"pure premium\" is calculated by multiplying the employer's payroll in each manual class by the base rate for each manual class. An experience-rated employer's \"pure premium\" is calculated by multiplying the employer's payroll in each manual class by the experience-modified rate for each manual class. The employer's \"blended premium\" is calculated by adding the assessments and subtracting any discounts earned by the employer for participating in the BWC's discount programs. The total of the premiums assessed for each manual class to which the employer is assigned, plus assessments, less any rebates or discounts the employer receives based on its participation in various programs offered by the BWC, is the employer's total workers' compensation premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Retrospective Rating\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During the time period at issue, the BWC offered a retrospective-rating plan for individual employers. A \"step closer to self insurance,\" retrospective rating allows employers to assume more of the risk themselves in exchange for lower upfront\n   premiums. A retrospectively rated employer pays a reduced portion of the premium it would have otherwise paid had it chosen not to participate in the retrospective-rating plan. In exchange, the employer assumes financial responsibility for the actual paid claim costs incurred for the next ten years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   up to individual and overall claim limits that the employer selects. Premiums are determined on an annual basis. A retrospectively rated employer pays an annual \"minimum pure premium\" equal to the employer's experience-modified pure premium multiplied by a \"minimum premium percentage\" determined by the claim limits selected by the employer, e.g., payroll times base rate times experience modifier times minimum premium percentage. The minimum premium percentage is based on the BWC's estimates of the cost of insurance risks transferred to the BWC (i.e., the risk associated with the claim limits selected by the employer) and other administrative expenses and charges; a lower percentage is applied for employers that assume a greater share of the risk and a higher percentage is applied for employers who assume less risk. The minimum premium percentages are periodically adjusted by the BWC. The annual assessments paid by an employer are the same regardless of whether the employer participates in experience rating or retrospective rating. An employer's \"minimum retrospective blended premium\" is equal to the minimum retrospective pure premium plus the assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The BWC's Group-rating Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In 1989, the General Assembly amended R.C. Chapter 4123 to require the BWC to develop and implement a plan \"that groups for rating purposes, employers, and pools the risk of the employers within the group.\" Am.Sub.H.B. No. 222.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In response to this mandate, the BWC began offering group-rating plans to employers. The BWC established a group-rating plan for private employers in the policy year beginning July 1, 1991 and for public employers in the policy year beginning January 1, 1992.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-61 - 4123-17-68. Initially, the BWC implemented only a prospective group-rating plan. The BWC did not offer a retrospective group-rating plan until 2009 for private employers and 2010 for public employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Before group rating, employers could qualify for experience rating only on an individual basis. Group experience rating allowed employers to group together their claims history and receive experience-related premium discounts similar to larger employers. Group rating thus enabled employers with good safety records, but who were statistically too small to be individually experience rated and who would otherwise be base rated or experience rated with minimal credibility, to group together with other employers to qualify for experience rating. By combining the experience of all of the members of the group, totaling it up, and treating the group as a single employer for rating purposes, the group could qualify for premium discounts based on their combined claims experience. These discounts were, at times, quite significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Because the BWC operates on a revenue-neutral basis, the loss in premiums resulting from the discounts provided to employers under the BWC's group-rating program had to be redistributed. In\n   other words, the premium obligations for nongroup-rated employers needed to be increased in order to offset the substantial discounts provided to employers participating in the group-rating program. As Christopher Carlson, the BWC's chief actuarial officer and Elizabeth Bravender, the BWC's director of actuarial operations, explained, this was achieved by increasing the off-balance factor used in calculating the base rates for the manual classes. In short, the BWC determines a target amount of total premiums to be collected for each manual class, calculates how much experience rating (including group rating) moves the total away from the target and then uses the off-balance factor to return the total premiums to be collected back to the target.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Increasing the off-balance factor increased the base rate for all employers. Therefore, employers who were not part of a group (and did not receive the significant discounts off base rates that group members received), in effect, paid \"extra premiums\" to make up for the discounts granted to group-rated employers under the BWC's group-rating program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Problems with the BWC's Group-Rating Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The group rating program was flawed from the start. Bravender testified that even before the BWC's prospective group rating program went into effect concerns were raised by the BWC's actuarial consultants regarding the program's susceptibility to manipulation by group sponsors and the potential for premium inequity between group-rated and nongroup-rated employers as a result of the generous premium discounts provided to group-rated employers under the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Equity concerns continued to be raised once the group rating program was underway. From 1990 through 2009, the BWC commissioned ten independent actuarial studies to evaluate the BWC's group rating plans. Each of these studies concluded that, as a result of the large discounts given to group-rated employers, the BWC's group rating program was creating substantial premium inequity between group-rated and nongroup-rated employers, i.e., group-rated employers were not paying enough premiums to cover the risk they presented, and nongroup-rated employers were paying too much in premiums, subsidizing the discounts given to the group-rated employers. Each of these studies also recommended that changes be made to the group rating program to correct this inequity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} According to Bravender, the early studies commissioned by the BWC focused on the effect of group rating on private employers and did not specifically address whether premium inequity existed between group-rated and nongroup-rated PECs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2004, the BWC's actuarial section in conjunction with actuarial consultant Mercer Oliver Wyman conducted an analysis of the group rating program with respect to both private employers and PECs. According to an August 2004 report, \"[t]he results of the study indicate that the merit rating methodology allows for too great of credits to employers and that the non-group rated employers are subsidizing the group rated employers[.]\" The report stated that \"[t]he off-balance factor that results from the introduction of the group rating program indicates that the base rates have had to be increased\n   * * * over the normal rate increases in order to obtain the desired level of overall premiums given the large credits that were calculated for the groups.\" The report further indicated that the total nongroup PEC employer \"premium subsidy\" for rating years 1992-2001 (the time period referenced in the report) was $69,722,959.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 20} A 2006 study by Pinnacle Actuarial Resources, Inc. (\"Pinnacle\") and a 2009 study by Deloitte Consulting L.L.P. (\"Deloitte\") also specifically analyzed the equity of the group rating program as applied to PECs. In a December 2006 report, Pinnacle concluded that the credits that were being issued to both private and public group-rated employers exceeded the credits they should have received based on their losses: \"Similar to the private employers, the public employer-taxing district experience shows that the group rated policies with the lower experience modification factors have better manual loss ratios than the other insured but the impact of the experience rating plan is generally too generous resulting in a situation where the losses are double the premium collected to cover them.\" Carlson, who authored the Pinnacle report,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that the problems with the group-rating program as applied to PECs were not as \"widespread\" or \"as large in magnitude\" as they were with private employers, but that each of the conclusions reached in the report \"would apply to publics as they did to privates,\" including that the size of the credits being given to PECs who participated in group rating were larger than would have been indicated by their loss experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Bravender offered similar testimony. She acknowledged that the problem of nongroup-rated employers subsidizing excessive discounts to group-rated employers existed both with respect to private employers and PECs, but that the problem was \"less severe\" on the PEC side. John Pedrick, the BWC's chief actuarial officer from July 2007 until June 2011, testified that, during the time period at issue, nongroup-rated PECs were subsidizing over-sized discounts given to group-rated public employers through an increased off-balance factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In its 2009 report, Deloitte concluded that \"[t]he current pricing structure\" under the BWC's rating system \"has created substantial inequity in the premiums paid by different employers,\" that the \"primary driver of this inequity is the [BWC's] current approach to group rating\" and that the \"performance results of the group rating program indicate a substantial lack of actuarial soundness with respect to equitable rating.\" Deloitte concluded, with respect to the premiums paid by private employers, that \"[t]he results of this analysis indicate a material inequity from group rating and therefore group rated employers on an overall basis receive substantially more premium credit than is merited by their experience.\" With respect to premiums paid by PECs, Deloitte indicated: \"In general, similar conclusions reached for [private employers] hold for PEC policies. However, the results are not as strong as there is a significantly lower policy count in PEC. * * * [I]nequity similar to [private employer] policies is indicated due to the use of the charged [experience-modification rating] for group rated policies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Bravender and Pedrick expressly acknowledged the \"inequities\" of the BWC's group-rating program as related to PECs-albeit to a lesser extent than private employers-and testified that rate reforms initiated for PECs in 2010 remedied\n   those inequities by lowering the off-balance factor and standardizing it across the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The City's Participation in the Workers' Compensation System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 24} During the time period at issue, the city's employees fell within two manual classes-9431 (\"cities\") and 9439 (\"public employer emergency service organization\"). Most of its employees were in the 9431 class. Eduardo Romero, the city's risk manager, testified that the city evaluated its workers' compensation insurance options and each year selected a plan that it believed represented the best value for the city. Through the 2002 policy year, the city was experience-rated. Beginning in 2003, the city switched to an individual retrospective-rating plan. Romero testified that the city decided to switch to a retrospective-rating plan because experience rating was a \"Cadillac policy for [w]orkers' [c]ompensation,\" the city felt it could have greater autonomy over claims management by shifting to a retrospective-rating plan and the retrospective-rating plan provided cash flow advantages by reducing the city's \"upfront obligation.\" The city was never group rated under the BWC's group-rating program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Through 2002, when the city was experience rated, it paid a pure experience-rated premium to the BWC. Beginning in 2003, when it was retrospectively rated, the city paid a minimum premium, i.e., an agreed percentage of what would have otherwise been its pure experience-rated premium, plus assessments and separately paid actual losses incurred for employee claims up to the agreed limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Rate Reforms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The BWC's 2010 Group-Rating Rate Reforms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} With the policy year beginning July 1, 2009, the BWC began making significant changes to its rating system to set more equitable premium rates for group-rated and nongroup-rated private employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 27} A key element of the BWC's reforms involved the calculation of the off-balance factor. As then-BWC administrator Marsha Ryan explained when testifying before the Ohio Senate Insurance Commerce and Labor Committee in October 2009:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The signature achievement of this plan is that the connection between discounts for group-rated employers and base rates for non-group rated employers has been severed. This means that non-group employers' premiums are not inflated to cover premium shortages caused by the group-experience rating program. By setting the base rates for all employers independent of the pricing actions in group experience rating, BWC eliminated any chance of non-group employers bearing additional costs created by group-rated employers * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Instead of calculating separate off-balance factors for each manual class as it had in the past, the BWC applied a uniform off-balance factor in setting rates for all manual classes. The BWC made other changes to its rating program as well, including reducing the maximum credibility to 77 percent and applying a group \"break-even factor,\" which had the effect of decreasing the premium discounts received by group-rated employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} These changes took effect beginning in 2010 for PECs (the \"2010 rate reforms\"). During an August 2009 BWC actuarial committee meeting, Pedrick explained that \"[t]he goal\" of the rate reforms as applied to PECs was \"to achieve rate equity by setting the rate structure to\n   reach the relative rate levels of 1.10 for non-group and 0.70 for group and eliminate the impact of group discounts on base rates by establishing a uniform off-balance factor for all PEC manual classes at 1.01.\" In 2010, the uniform off-balance factor for PECs was set at 1.01; however, it was subject to change each year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2. 2016 Changes to the BWC's Retrospective-Rating Plans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Unrelated to the group-rating program, in January 2016, the BWC also made certain changes to its retrospective-rating plans, including increasing the minimum premium factors and adopting a loss conversion factor, a multiplier, to be applied to retrospective payments. In 2012, the BWC retained Deloitte to analyze its individual retrospective-rating plans, including the minimum premium percentages. In a September 2013 report, Deloitte recommended an \"overall minimum premium increase\" of 29% for private employers and 23.5% for PECs participating in the BWC's individual retrospective-rating plans due to \"the apparent lack of provisions for certain costs in the current minimum premium percentages.\" According to the Deloitte report, \"there was no information or rationale as to why the current minimum percentages do not appear to have appropriate loadings for these costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Carlson indicated that the BWC revised its retrospective-rating factors \"on a periodic basis,\" \"hopefully, every five years,\" but that the minimum premium factors had been last studied in 2006. Carlson testified that the Deloitte report revealed that the BWC \"didn't effectively design\" its retrospective-rating plans and had been undercharging employers who participated in its individual retrospective-rating plans for the risk they transferred to the BWC. He indicated that the \"major reason\" for this was because the BWC had failed to include the cost of its health partnership program in either the minimum premiums or the collections on individual paid losses. He stated that the BWC had also failed to include a provision for loss development past 120 months, i.e., to reflect the fact that, after the end of the ten-year period when the BWC collects reserves from the employer, the reserves would continue to escalate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The City's Complaint Against the BWC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 32} On June 28, 2013, the city filed suit against the BWC. The city amended its complaint in December 2013. Asserting \"a claim in equity for unjust enrichment\" against the BWC, the city alleged that \"[f]or many years,\" the BWC had charged the city and other nongroup-rated PECs \"excessive and inequitable workers' compensation premiums\" to fund overly generous discounts given to group-rated PECs under its group-rating plan, knowingly undercharging group-rated PECs and knowingly overcharging nongroup-rated PECs for their respective risk. The city claimed the BWC's group-rating plan violated former R.C. 4123.29, 4123.34 and 4123.39 and that the BWC had been unjustly enriched by its wrongful collection and retention of excessive premiums from the city.

The BWC argued that the common pleas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the city's lawsuit because, despite its characterization of its claim as equitable, the city was actually seeking \"the legal remedy of money damages\" which \"falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.\" The BWC also argued that former R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34(C) did not apply to the premiums charged the city because they were not among \"the specific statutes governing the BWC's rate-making for contributions made by public employers\" and that the only statutory provision governing rate-making for public employers that the city alleged had been violated- R.C. 4123.39 -did not apply because the city did not challenge the BWC's manual classification of public employers. The BWC further argued that the city's unjust enrichment claim was barred, in whole or in part, by the applicable statute of limitations and because the city had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies under R.C. 4123.291. The city opposed the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The trial court also held that the city had \"properly alleged a violation of R.C. 4123.39\" and rejected the BWC's arguments that the city's unjust enrichment claim was time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On June 26, 2014, the BWC filed its answer.

Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 38} In September 2016, the city and the BWC filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The BWC argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because (1) the city's unjust enrichment claim was barred by the voluntary payment doctrine; (2) the city's unjust enrichment claim was time-barred, in whole or in part, by the two-year limitations period set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-17, the five-year limitations period set forth in R.C. 126.301 or the six-year limitations period set forth in R.C. 2305.07 ; (3) the city's unjust enrichment claim was barred by laches and (4) the premiums paid by the city \"were not excessive considering the totality of the circumstances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The city argued that the BWC was collaterally estopped from challenging \"key factual and legal findings\" relevant to its claim based on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    San Allen, supra.\n   </em>\n   The city argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because there were \"no material issues of disputed fact\" that the BWC's rating system as applied to the city violated former R.C. 4123.29(A)(4)(c), 4123.34(C) and 4123.39, that the city had been overcharged premiums under the same group-rating program found to be illegal in\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   and that the BWC had been unjustly enriched by the \"millions of dollars\" it had overcharged the city \"to cover excessive\n   discounts granted to group-rated PECs.\" The city also asserted that, based on the undisputed facts, it was entitled to restitution of $4,524,392 in premium overcharges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The Parties' Actuarial Experts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The City's Expert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The city retained actuarial consultant Allan Schwartz (\"Schwartz\"), who was also the plaintiffs' expert in\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   , to support its unjust enrichment claim. Schwartz opined that the city had been overcharged for its workers' compensation premiums under the BWC's rating system based on (1) actuarial reports that concluded that nongroup-rated employers as a whole had been overcharged as a result of the BWC's group-rating program and (2) testimony by BWC representatives, including Bravener, Pedrick and Carlson, that excessive discounts and subsidies had been given to group-rated PEC employers funded by nongroup-rated PEC employers. He further opined that the amounts the BWC charged the city were \"legally inequitable\" and, therefore, \"actuarially inequitable,\" based on the BWC's use of an illegal and inequitable group-rating program as found in\n   <em>\n    San Allen.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Schwartz claimed that from 1997 to 2009, the BWC overcharged the city $4,524,392 for its workers' compensation premiums by using an inflated off-balance factor. For each of the years at issue, Schwartz calculated a rate adjustment factor by comparing the off-balance factor the BWC had actually used when calculating the city's premiums to a \"corrected\" off-balance factor of 1.01-the uniform off-balance factor the BWC applied to all PEC manual classes beginning in policy year 2010 when attempting to eliminate the impact of group discounts on the base rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then subtracted the rate adjustment factor (as a percentage) from 100 to determine the percentage overcharge. He multiplied the premiums paid by the city (less\n   the amount of any rebates or dividends received) by the percentage overcharge to determine the dollar value of the premium overcharges for each of the years at issue. For the years in which the city participated in retrospective rating, the amount of the \"retro billings,\" i.e., the actual claims costs, was not included in the premium overcharge calculations because it was not impacted by the base rate and, therefore, was not affected by the inflated off-balance factor. However, administrative assessments, which were set as a percentage of premium, were included in the calculation of the premium overcharges for the years for which data was available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on Schwartz's calculations, the annual percentage overcharges during the period 1997 to 2009 ranged from 0.15% in 2009 to 12.22% in 2003. Schwartz testified that his methodology represented a \"reasonable,\" \"actuarially sound basis\" for determining the amount by which the BWC overcharged the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The BWC's Expert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The BWC retained actuarial consultant Gary Josephson to (1) evaluate Schwartz's opinions and calculations and (2) determine the impact of group rating on the premiums the city would have paid had the changes to the group-rating program that were implemented in 2010 been in place during the policy years at issue. Josephson claimed that because the off-balance factor is used to offset the aggregate impact of experience rating and because experience rating values change from year to year, Schwartz's use of a single off-balance factor of 1.01 for all years was \"actuarially inappropriate.\" Josephson also criticized Schwartz's failure to take into account the implementation of a group break-even factor and reduction of maximum credibility. He claimed that these factors should be considered in calculating the impact of the rate reforms because a change in credibility or a decrease in the discounts given to group-rated employers could change the experience rating calculations which, in turn, could affect the off-balance factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Josephson offered an \"alternative calculation.\" Under his alternative calculation, Josephson estimated that the city would have paid approximately $2.7 million in lower premiums had the 2010 rate reforms been in effect from 1997 to 2009. The primary difference between his calculation and Schwartz's calculation involved the off-balance factor used in the calculation. Whereas Schwartz used 1.01-the uniform off-balance factor adopted by the BWC in 2010-in calculating premium overcharges for all years, Josephson recalculated a new, alternative uniform off-balance factor for each year. Josephson also incorporated the breakeven factor and credibility limits added in 2010 in his calculation. Josephson testified that he took the BWC's premium, payroll and loss data, replaced the credibility factors that had been used, applied the credibility limit implemented in 2010, added in the group break-even factor, recalculated the groups' experience rating factor and then recalculated \"what the off-balance was as a result of that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Josephson claimed that Schwartz's analysis did not support the conclusion that the city had been \"overcharged\" for its workers' compensation premiums. Josephson opined that the $2.7 million premium impact he calculated, i.e., a 2.2% reduction in premiums from the approximately $120 million in premiums\n   the city actually paid, was \"well within the range of normal variability that exists in the ratemaking process\" and that, therefore, \"group rating did not materially impact Cleveland's premiums.\" He further opined that the BWC should not be required to return any premium payments to the city because it is \"not practical\" to go back and repay or recollect premiums for changes that are made in the rating process. He indicated that just \"[b]ecause the methodology is changed or different assumptions are used does not mean the insuring entity should adjust historical premiums paid by policyholders\" and that \"[i]nsuring entities typically do not adjust prior years' premiums for changes in the ratemaking methodology.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Josephson also disputed the suggestion that the city had been \"overcharged\" for its workers' compensation premiums because the city had been charged less than it should have been charged for its minimum premiums during the years in which it was retrospectively rated. Josephson testified that had the 2016 changes to the minimum premiums been in effect in 2003-2009, the difference in the city's minimum premiums would have likely been greater than the impact of the 2010 rate reforms for that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    7. The Trial Court's Ruling on Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 46} On December 22, 2016, the trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment in part and denied it in part. It granted the city's motion as to liability on its unjust enrichment claim concluding that, after the city met its initial burden under Civ.R. 56, the BWC \"failed to raise genuine issues of material fact with evidence satisfying the requirements of Civ. R. 56(E) on the issue of liability, as was its burden.\" However, the trial court determined that there were \"questions of material fact * * * as to the amount of restitution owed to Plaintiff.\" It held that the case would proceed to a bench trial \"to determine the amount of restitution due to Plaintiff.\" The trial court denied the BWC's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Trial on Restitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In January 2017, the trial court held a bench trial on the amount of restitution due the city. The city presented testimony from Bravender, Carlson, Pedrick and Schwartz\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and argued that it should be awarded $4,524,392 in restitution for the premium overcharges it paid to fund discounts given to group-rated PECs under the BWC's group-rating program. The BWC argued, based primarily on testimony from Josephson, that the city was not entitled to any restitution on its unjust enrichment claim because there was no credible evidence that the city had been \"impacted to [its] detriment\" by group rating. The BWC contended that Schwartz's methodology and calculations were deficient and unreliable, that Josephson's methodology and calculations were credible and reliable and that the equities favored the BWC because the minimum premiums the city paid during the years it was retrospectively rated were insufficient\n   to cover the risk it transferred to the BWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 48} At the conclusion of the city's case-in-chief, the BWC moved to dismiss the case pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(2). The BWC argued that the city had failed to prove that it was entitled to restitution because Schwartz's methodology was not actuarially reliable. The trial court denied the motion. At the conclusion of the BWC's case, the BWC renewed its motion to dismiss arguing that, considering the weight of the testimony of both experts, the relief sought by the city was not supported by the evidence in the record. Once again, the court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 49} On February 27, 2016, the trial court issued its decision, awarding the city $4,524,392 in restitution plus post-judgment interest at the statutory rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The BWC appealed, raising the following five assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Assignment of Error No. I: The trial court erred in denying the motion of Defendant-Appellant Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (the \"Bureau\") to dismiss the First Amended Complaint of Plaintiff-Appellee City of Cleveland (\"Plaintiff\" or Cleveland\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Assignment of Error No. II: The trial court erred in denying the Bureau's motion for summary judgment and in granting in part Cleveland's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Assignment of Error No. III: The trial court erred in granting Cleveland's motion in limine regarding the Bureau's affirmative defenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Assignment of Error No. IV: The trial court erred in denying the Bureau's motion to dismiss during the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Assignment of Error No. V: The trial court erred in awarding Cleveland more than $4.5 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The BWC claims that the city was required to comply with the administrative review process set forth in R.C. 4123.291 and Adm.Code 4123-14-06 for challenges to \"risk premium matters\" before seeking relief in the court of common pleas and that because the city did not \"protest\" their premium rates through the administrative process, they are not entitled to judicial relief. The BWC further argues that exhaustion of administrative remedies is a condition precedent to the granting of equitable relief and that because the city did not plead, in its amended complaint, that it exhausted any administrative remedies, the city failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

The city is not seeking an \"adjustment\" to its premiums due to any \"error\" relating to or affecting its payroll reports. The premium overcharges for which the city seeks restitution in this case were the result of an alleged deliberate policy decision by the BWC to charge excessive premiums to nongroup-rated PECs in order to subsidize unlawful discounts given to group-rated PECs under its group-rating program. As such, the two-year limitation on premium adjustments set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-17(C) does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The BWC cites no authority beyond R.C. 126.301 for this proposition. By its terms, however, R.C. 126.301 applies only to actions against the state or a state agency \"for failure to make any distribution or other payment.\" This case does not involve the BWC's \"failure to make any distribution or other payment\" due the city. Rather, the city seeks the return of specific funds wrongfully collected by the state under its unlawful group-rating program. Accordingly, R.C. 126.301 does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Alternatively, the BWC argues that the city's claim is \"an action * * * upon a liability created by statute\" governed by the six-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 82} The city's claim in this case is a claim for unjust enrichment.

The court ultimately held that the statute of limitations on the bank's unjust enrichment claim did not accrue until June 2012 when the bank filed its foreclosure action because that was when the homeowner first asserted his claim\n   that the bank could not foreclose on his interest in the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   {\u00b6 89} In each of these cases, where one party conferred benefits on another, with the other's knowledge, over a period of time, the courts did not regard each benefit conferred as giving rise to a separate cause of action with a separate statute of limitations. Rather, the courts looked at the entire period of time over which the party conferred benefits as giving rise to a single claim for unjust enrichment, subject to a single statute of limitations that accrued when the last benefit was conferred that unjustly enriched the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Accordingly, we conclude that the city's cause of action for unjust enrichment did not accrue until the city made its last premium \"overpayment,\" i.e., its last premium payment for policy year 2009, which was the last point in time the BWC allegedly unjustly received a benefit from the city. We believe that such a rule is more consistent with the equitable nature of an unjust enrichment claim than the \"payment-by-payment\" approach to the statute of limitations advocated for by the BWC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because, the city's 2013 complaint was within the six-year limitations period applicable to unjust enrichment claims, the trial court did not err in concluding that the city's claim was not time-barred, in whole or in part, under R.C. 126.301 or 2307.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

We do not decide whether the other requirements of the voluntary payment doctrine have been met because, based on a thorough review of the record, we find no evidence that the city made any of the premium payments at issue with full knowledge of the relevant facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 93} The BWC's claim that the city \"knowingly paid any allegedly 'excess premiums' \" is based on the testimony of Eduardo Romero, the city's risk manager. Romero began working for the city in 2002. Prior to working for the city, Romero worked for the BWC. Romero testified that when he worked for the BWC he became aware of \"BWC studies, actuarial studies\" that showed that nongroup-rated employers were subsidizing group-rated employers who were receiving a \"humongous discount\" and that this was \"internal knowledge within the [BWC].\" He testified that he \"first became aware of the possibility that these rate differences were creating problems for nongroup-rated employers\" in the late 1990s. He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Q. And do you recall precisely how you became aware?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   A. I became aware in the '90s from internal discussions that I overheard other people talking about. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Q. * * * Did you understand at the time what the cause of these alleged subsidies was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   A. My understanding was that [the] BWC, in reaction to these formulation of groups, employer groups, in order to get superior discounts to their premiums, were being offset, they were encouraging the formulations of these groups in order to lower the actual costs of Workers' Compensation for a select group of people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   {\u00b6 94} He further testified that the \"humongous discounts and subsidies\" became public knowledge in the early 2000s and that he \"remember[ed] reading about it in the media\" at that time. Romero testified that he had no \"firsthand knowledge\" of the impact that group rating had on the city or the basis for the assertion that nongroup-rated employers were subsidizing group-rated employers. He further testified that he had no \"specific discussions\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   with anyone about these alleged subsidies while he worked at the BWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 95} Even assuming the knowledge Romero acquired while he was an employee of the BWC could be properly imputed to the city, the BWC presented no evidence that Romero knew that the problems that were being reported in the early 2000s related to nongroup-rated PEC employers like the city. Bravender and Carlson testified that the early studies commissioned by the BWC focused on the effect of group rating on private employers and that it was not until 2004, when the BWC's actuarial section, in conjunction with Mercer Oliver Wyman, analyzed the effect of the group-rating program on private employers and PECs, or 2006, when Pinnacle issued its study, that any actuarial study specifically addressed whether premium inequity existed between group-rated and nongroup-rated public employers under the BWC's group-rating plan. The BWC did not offer any evidence in its opposition to the city's summary judgment motion or its own motion for summary judgment that the results of these later studies were available to Romero or the city at time the city made any of the premium payments at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the trial court did not err in rejecting the BWC's voluntary payment defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Evidence on the Issue of Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Statutory Requirements and Premium Overcharges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 96} The BWC argues that even if the trial court did not err in rejecting its affirmative defenses, it still erred in granting summary judgment to the city on the issue of liability because the city failed to show that there were no genuine issues of material fact that the BWC overcharged the city for its workers' compensation premiums and violated its statutory duties under R.C. 4123.29, 4123.34 or 4123.39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   {\u00b6 97} R.C. 4123.39 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   The administrator of workers' compensation shall determine the amount of money to be contributed under section 4123.38 of the Revised Code by the state itself and each county and each taxing district within each county. In fixing the amount of contribution to be made by the county, for such county and for the taxing districts therein, the administrator shall classify counties and other taxing districts into such groups as will equitably determine the contributions in accordance with the relative degree of hazard, and also merit rate such individual counties, taxing districts, or groups of taxing districts in accordance with their individual accident experience so as ultimately to provide for each taxing subdivision contributing an amount sufficient to meet its individual obligations and to maintain a solvent public insurance fund. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b6 98} Former R.C. 4123.29(A)(4)(c) and 4123.34(C) further require the BWC to \"consider an employer group as a single employing entity for purposes of retrospective rating\" and to \"develop fixed and equitable rules controlling the rating system, which rules shall conserve to each\n   risk the basic principles of workers' compensation insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   {\u00b6 99} As detailed above, the city presented evidence of numerous actuarial studies and testimony by BWC representatives establishing that under the BWC's group-rating program, group-rated employers received excessive, unwarranted discounts off their workers' compensations premiums and that nongroup-rated employers, including PECs like the city, were charged higher premiums to make up for and subsidize those discounts. The evidence showed that during the time period at issue, the BWC used an inflated off-balance factor in calculating workers' compensation premiums for both private and PEC employers, resulting in higher premiums for all nongroup-rated employers, including the city. The city further showed that the BWC's use of an inflated off-balance factor adversely impacted the city's premiums both when it was experience rated (from 1997 to 2002) and when it was retrospectively rated (from 2003 to 2009) because the minium premium it paid as a retrospectively rated employer was a percentage of the experience-rated premium it would have otherwise paid if it were not retrospectively rated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   {\u00b6 100} The city presented evidence that the BWC's group-rating program, as it impacted nongroup-rated PECs, was inequitable and violated Ohio law. In\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   , this court held that the BWC's group-rating program violated former R.C. 4123.29(A)(4)(c) because the BWC's group-rating plans were prospective group-rating plans and that statute by its terms, authorized only \"retrospective\" group-rating plans. The\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   court also held that, as applied to private employers, the group-rating program was inequitable and unlawful under R.C. 4123.34(C) and that the BWC was unjustly enriched by the premium overcharges it received from class members who were nongroup rated throughout the class period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   {\u00b6 101} Bravender, Carlson and Pedrick testified that the same inequities in the group-rating program at issue in\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   with respect to nongroup-rated private employers also existed with respect to nongroup-rated PEC employers like the city-i.e., the difference between the inequities from the group-rating program as applied to private and PEC employers was a matter of degree, not of kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   {\u00b6 102} The city's evidence supports the conclusion that, as applied to nongroup-rated PECs like the city, the BWC's group-rating plan violated R.C. 4123.34(C) and 4123.39 as well as former R.C. 4123.29(A)(4)(c). The BWC's group-rating program violated the mandate under R.C. 4123.34(C) that the BWC \"develop fixed and equitable rules controlling the rating system, which rules shall conserve to each risk the basic principles of workers' compensation insurance\" and did not result in an \"equitabl[e] determin[ation] [of] contributions in accordance with the relative degree of hazard\" and \"merit rat[ing] * * * in accordance with * * * individual accident experience\" as required under R.C. 4123.39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   {\u00b6 103} The BWC asserts that it \"presented a host of evidence\" on summary judgment that \"disputed whether Cleveland was overcharged\" and \"rebutted whether the Bureau violated various provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and * * * was unjustly enriched\"; however, the record reflects otherwise. The BWC did not present any evidence on summary judgment challenging the actuarial studies and testimony from Bravender, Carlson and Pedrick regarding the inequities in the group-rating program as applied to both private employers and PECs. Further, the BWC did not dispute that it used an inflated off-balance factor in order to fund excessive\n   discounts given to group-rated employers under its group-rating program, resulting in higher premiums for nongroup-rated employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   {\u00b6 104} Although the BWC offered deposition testimony from its expert, Josephson, in opposing the city's motion for summary judgment, that testimony did not demonstrate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact on the issue of liability. Josephson estimated that the city paid $2.7 million in higher premiums from 1997 to 2009 as a result of the BWC's group-rating program. Josephson testified that he was not asked to evaluate whether the city was \"overcharged\" for its workers' compensation premiums during the time period at issue and, therefore, did not formulate an opinion on that issue. He did not consider whether the city's premiums during this time period were \"fair\" given the impact of group rating and had no opinion as to whether the rating system violated Ohio law as applied to nongroup-rated PEC employers.

If the only evidence in the record was that the BWC had charged the city 2.2% to 4% in higher premiums than it arguably should have charged the city due to the \"general variability of rate-making,\" perhaps it would be that the equities would not require restitution of the overcharges. However, that is not this case. In determining whether to award equitable relief and, if so, the amount of restitution to be awarded, the trial court was required to consider the \"totality of the circumstances.\" This is not a case in which employers were overcharged for their premiums due to a difference of opinion in actuarial assumptions or because the loss experience turned out to be better or worse than expected-elements within the \"general variability of rate-making.\" In this case, the \"totality of the circumstances\" included undisputed evidence that the BWC knowingly overcharged nongroup-rated PEC employers, including the city, for their workers' compensation premiums in order to fund excessive premium discounts for group-rated employers. Undisputed evidence further established that the BWC continued to operate its inequitable rating system long after its actuarial consultants warned the BWC that the group-rating program was creating substantial premium inequity between group-rated and nongroup-rated employers. The trial court properly considered the \"totality of the circumstances\" in concluding that the BWC had been unjustly enriched and granting summary judgment in favor of the city on the issue of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   {\u00b6 109} The parties' factual disputes regarding the \"calculation of the alleged premium overcharges,\" including the BWC's challenges to Schwartz's assumptions and methodology and its claim that the minimum premiums the city paid during 2003-2009 did not fully compensate the BWC for the risk the city transferred to the BWC under its retrospective-rating plan, did not preclude summary judgment as to liability. Those factual disputes involved the extent to which the city was entitled to equitable restitution on its unjust enrichment claim-as to which the trial court denied summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   {\u00b6 110} The record reflects that the city met its burden on summary judgment on the issue of liability. The city showed that there was no genuine issue of material fact that it conferred benefits on the BWC in the form of excessive premium payments and that the BWC had knowledge of the benefits conferred. If nongroup-rated employers had not paid the excessive premiums they were charged, the BWC would have experienced a shortfall in the total premiums collected due to the large discounts\n   it gave group-rated employers under its group-rating plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   {\u00b6 111} The city also showed that there was no genuine issue of material fact that these benefits were conferred under circumstances in which it would be unjust to allow the BWC to retain them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   {\u00b6 112} Once the city met its burden, the burden shifted to the BWC.

The BWC then filed written offers of proof setting forth anticipated testimony from Romero and other evidence it would have presented at trial related to five affirmative defenses: (1) the voluntary payment doctrine, (2) Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-17(C), (3) the statute of limitations, (4) laches and (5) \"equitable discretion when examining the totality of the circumstances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   {\u00b6 116} We review a trial court's ruling on a motion in limine for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen &amp; Co. v.

In its fourth assignment of error, the BWC contends that the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss the city's claim under Civ.R. 41(B)(2) was against\n   the manifest weight of the evidence because Schwartz's testimony was not based on \"actuarially sound assumptions.\" In its fifth assignment of error the BWC contends that the trial court's restitution award should be reversed as against the manifest weight of the evidence because (1) the premium overcharges were not material and did not \"fall outside the general variability of rate-making so as to require the BWC to pay restitution,\" (2) the BWC's rate-making process is prospective and adjustments due to changes in the ratemaking process are applied to future premiums, not as refunds related to prior periods, (3) Schwartz failed to use actuarially sound principles in calculating the amount of the premium overcharges and (4) the trial court's restitution award does not account for the fact that, during the years the city was retrospectively rated, the minimum premiums the city paid did not fully compensate the BWC for the risk it transferred to the BWC. None of these arguments is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   {\u00b6 119} Weight of the evidence concerns \"the inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The BWC did not object to or move to exclude any of his testimony as unreliable under Evid.R. 702(C). Indeed, the BWC specifically stated, when arguing its Civ.R. 41(B)(2) motion, that it was not seeking to strike Schwartz's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   {\u00b6 122} The methodology Schwartz applied in this case was similar to the approach he used when calculating the restitution due the plaintiff class in\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   . In that case, this court held that the BWC's arguments regarding the claimed deficiencies in Schwartz's opinions and calculations did not preclude the trial court from relying on that testimony in determining the amount of restitution to be awarded.\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2071\">\n    2014-Ohio-2071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20N.E.3d%20739\">\n    11 N.E.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 143-145. We reach the same conclusion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   {\u00b6 123} At trial, Schwartz and Josephson offered two competing methodologies for determining the amount of restitution, if any, to be awarded the city on its unjust enrichment claim. Each expert's opinions\n   and calculations (and alleged deficiencies in those opinions and calculations) were explored at length by the parties on direct and cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   {\u00b6 124} As detailed above, the BWC criticized Schwartz's approach because Schwartz used a single off-balance factor of 1.01 for all years and failed to take into account the BWC's implementation of the group break-even factor and reduction of the maximum credibility when calculating the impact of group rating on the city's premiums. Schwartz testified that he selected a single value of 1.01-the off-balance factor used by the BWC in 2010-for all years when calculating premium overcharges because 2010 was the year closest to the historical period at issue and \"actuaries often rely on the data closest to what you're trying to estimate.\" He testified that if he had used the uniform off-balance factor used by the BWC in 2011 or 2012 (or an average of the uniform off-balance factors used in 2010 to 2012), the amount of the overcharge would have been higher. He testified that the average of the uniform off-balance factors for all six years after rate reform was put into effect (i.e., from 2010 to 2015) was 1.018, supporting his opinion that 1.01 is \"a pretty good actuarial value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   {\u00b6 125} Schwartz testified that he did not include a \"break-even factor\" or a credibility limit of 77 percent in his calculations because the break-even factor and limit on maximum credibility were meant to increase the premiums paid by group employers and were not intended to impact the premiums paid by nongroup-rated employers \"in any material way.\" He claimed that because neither a break-even factor nor a credibility limit of 77 percent was used at any point during 1997-2009, such elements would not have an effect on the experience modifiers used during that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   {\u00b6 126} The city, in turn, criticized Josephson's inclusion of a group break-even factor and a 77 percent limit on credibility in his calculations of the impact of group rating on the city's premiums because they did not exist prior to 2010. The city also criticized the assumptions Josephson used in calculating his recalculated off-balance factors. The city pointed out that the average of Josephson's recalculated off-balance factors for 1997 to 2009 was 1.023, higher than both the uniform off-balance factor the BWC adopted in 2010 and the 1.018 average of the uniform off-balance factors the BWC had adopted for the six years since 2010. The city also pointed out that Josephson's recalculated off-balance factors exceeded the 1.01 off-balance factor for 9 of the 13 years for which he calculated an off-balance factor. Further, due to missing data, Josephson used a different method to recalculate the uniform off-balance factors for years 1997 to 2002 than he did for 2003 to 2009. To recalculate off-balance factors for 1997 to 2003, Josephson used an average of data from 2006 and 2009 to create a single \"selected factor\" that was used to recalculate off-balance factors for 1997 to 2002. If Josephson had used an average of the data from all of the years for which data was available (2003 to 2009) when calculating the off-balances for 1997 to 2002, the recalculated off-balance factors would have been lower and the premium impact for those years would have been higher than what Josephson calculated. Josephson testified that his assumptions were actuarially sound and that he used the data from 2006 and 2009 to recalculate off-balance factors for 1997 to 2002 because he believed they would be \"a better measure\" for the years he was trying to project than data from other years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   {\u00b6 127} As the foregoing demonstrates, Schwartz and Josephson disagreed both as to the assumptions and methodology to be\n   used in calculating the effect of group rating on the city's premiums. Nevertheless, each expert was deemed to be qualified to opine upon the actuarial issues in this case. Each party presented a case for why its expert's approach was the better approach. The trial court was in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, including their proposed calculation of the restitution amount.\n   <em>\n    Kalain v.

The court held that because it was \"the group-rated employers (including, for the years in which they were group rated, class members who participated in the BWC's group rating plan) who truly benefitted under the BWC's group rating plan,\" i.e., \"receiving a windfall in the form of substantially reduced premiums subsidized by nongroup-rated employers,\" \"[c]onsideration of the 'totality of the circumstances' and 'sum of the equities' \" required the trial court to account for those subsidy benefits when determining the amount of restitution to be awarded to the plaintiff class.\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135-136. In\n   <em>\n    San Allen\n   </em>\n   , unlike in this case, certain of the plaintiffs had directly benefitted from the very unlawful group-rating system from which they sought equitable restitution. The court held that those benefits had to accounted for when determining the amount of restitution to be awarded the plaintiff class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   {\u00b6 130} This case is different. As Carlson testified, the \"shortcomings\" in the BWC's retrospective-rating plan \"had nothing to do with group rating.\" The fact that, for a period of time, the BWC did a poor job of estimating costs under its retrospective-rating plan and, in hindsight, allegedly charged the city lower minimum premiums than it should have been charged was a factor the trial court could have considered in determining an appropriate restitution award. However, on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court, when considering the \"totality of the circumstances\" and equities in this case, was required to account for those alleged \"undercharges\" when determining the amount of restitution to award the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   {\u00b6 131} After reviewing the entire record, we find that the trial court's $4,524,392 restitution award was supported by substantial competent, credible evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. This is not a case in which the trial court's judgment created \"such a manifest miscarriage of justice\" that it must be reversed. Accordingly, the BWC's fourth and fifth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   {\u00b6 132} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   SEAN C.
