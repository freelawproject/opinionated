As part of his job duties, Bragg would visit the Canton GFS store once or twice a week to pick up supplies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On November 27, 2013, Bragg slipped and fell as he entered the Canton GFS store to pick up supplies for Honeybaked Ham. Bragg's fall occurred in the entrance way to the store where the grocery carts are kept. He fell after only taking a few steps inside the store. As a result of Bragg's fall, he suffered injuries to his shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Braggs originally filed their complaint seeking damages based on premises liability and loss of consortium against Defendant-Appellee GFS Marketplace, LLC, on November 24, 2015. Pursuant to the trial court's scheduling order, the discovery cutoff was July 15, 2016. The matter went to mediation on or around June 9, 2016, but it did not settle. GFS filed a motion for summary judgment on August 5, 2016. In support of its motion, GFS utilized the deposition of Gerald Bragg and a copy of the store security video, which recorded Bragg's fall. The Braggs dismissed their complaint without prejudice on August 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Braggs re-filed their complaint on August 16, 2017, alleging the same causes of action against GFS. Pursuant to the trial court's scheduling order, the discovery cutoff was set for May 18, 2018 and dispositive motions were due June 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} GFS filed a motion for summary judgment on October 31, 2017. It argued it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Braggs' premises liability claim. In support of its motion, GFS utilized Gerald Bragg's deposition and a copy of the store security video, which recorded Bragg's fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 31, 2017, the Braggs filed a motion for extension of time pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F). In their motion, they requested an enlargement of time from November 13, 2017 to June 1, 2018 in which to file their response to the motion for summary judgment. The Braggs argued they needed more time to conduct discovery. In support of their motion, they attached their counsel's affidavit that stated, \"[i]n order to fully respond to the allegations set forth in the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant, it is necessary to obtain additional discovery in this matter, including, but not limited to, receiving answers to Plaintiffs' written discovery that will be provided to Defendant and conducting depositions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} GFS filed a response to the Braggs' motion for extension. It argued an extension of six months to conduct discovery was unnecessary because the present matter was a re-filing; discovery was completed in the Braggs' original action. GFS contended the Braggs failed to establish sufficient reasons why a Civ.R. 56(F) extension was necessary to respond to its motion for summary judgment. In the alternative to a six-month extension, GFS stated it would not object if the trial court granted a one to two month extension to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On November 21, 2017, the trial court denied the Braggs' motion for extension. It found the Braggs failed to establish sufficient grounds as to why they could not present adequate facts to oppose the motion for summary judgment. The trial court found the Braggs failed address in their motion that the present case was a re-filed action. The trial court did establish a new briefing schedule. The Braggs' response was due on December 4, 2017; GFS's reply was due on December 11, 2017; and the non-oral hearing was scheduled for December 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Braggs filed a motion to incorporate discovery from the original action into the re-filed action. The trial court granted the motion on December 5, 2017. The Braggs also filed their response to the\n   motion for summary judgment on December 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On December 28, 2017, the trial court granted GFS's motion for summary judgment. It found as a matter of law that GFS was entitled to summary judgment on the Braggs' claim for premises liability. The trial court determined the deposition testimony filed pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C) showed Gerald Bragg could not identify what caused him to slip and he admitted he may have slipped on water and/or snow tracked into the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It is from this judgment the Braggs now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Braggs raise two Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"I.

Co., supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Here, a review of the record shows that the Braggs filed their original complaint on November 24, 2015, alleging premises liability and loss of consortium based on Gerald Braggs' fall at GFS on November 27, 2013. The trial court issued a scheduling order setting the discovery cutoff for July 15, 2016 and established a briefing schedule for summary judgment motions. (Judgment Entry of Assigned Dates, Case No. 2015CV02470, Dec. 15, 2015). The pretrial order set the final pretrial conference for August 23, 2016 and a trial date for September 12, 2016. The matter proceeded to mediation but did not settle. The Braggs served interrogatories and document requests to GFS, to which GFS responded. GFS's response included its incident report for the November 27, 2013 accident. After the close of discovery, GFS filed a motion for summary judgment supported by the deposition of Gerald Bragg. The Braggs' response to the motion for summary judgment was due on August 19, 2016. On August 19, 2016, the Braggs dismissed their complaint without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The Braggs re-filed their complaint on August 16, 2017, alleging the same causes of action against GFS. The trial court issued a scheduling order setting the discovery cutoff for May 18, 2018 and dispositive motions due on June 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} GFS filed its motion for summary judgment on October 31, 2017. The arguments asserted by GFS in its motion for summary judgment were the same argued in the prior case. The Braggs requested a continuance pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) to conduct additional discovery, claiming more time was needed to receive answers to the Braggs' written discovery and conduct depositions. GFS filed a memorandum in opposition, arguing the Braggs conducted discovery in the previous action, including submitting written discovery requests to GFS, to which GFS responded. GFS conducted the deposition of Gerald Bragg and it was used to support its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The trial court denied the Braggs' motion for continuance pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F). The trial court noted the Braggs argued they required additional discovery \"without any mention of the previously filed action that was pending for nine months, wherein discovery was conducted, a mediation was conducted, and a motion for summary judgment, containing the exact same arguments as asserted in the instant case, was pending with the Plaintiffs dismissed the action instead of responding to the motion for summary judgment.\" (Judgment Entry, Nov. 21, 2017). Based on this record, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in denying the Braggs' motion for continuance to conduct additional discovery in order to respond to GFS's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In\n   <em>\n    TPI Asset Mgt., L.L.C. v. Baxter\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Knox No. 2011CA000007,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-5584\">\n    2011-Ohio-5584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205143308\">\n    2011 WL 5143308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we analyzed\n   a similar factual situation where a defendant requested additional time to conduct discovery in a re-filed action. In the original action, the matter proceeded through discovery and the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. The plaintiff dismissed its complaint without prejudice on the eve of trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff re-filed the complaint, alleging the same causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Discovery was exchanged between the parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff re-filed its motion for summary judgment and the defendant requested a continuance pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) to conduct additional discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. He attached an affidavit stating he desired to take the deposition of counsel for plaintiff and an employee of the plaintiff, and submit written interrogatories, but did not have time to do so because of counsel's workload.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff responded to the motion, arguing the defendant had ample time to conduct discovery because the case was a re-filing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court did not rule on the Civ.R. 56(F) motion, but granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On appeal, we affirmed the trial court's implicit denial of the defendant's Civ.R. 56(F) motion. We found the trial court did not abuse its discretion to deny the motion because the defendant failed to meet his burden to establish he needed to conduct additional discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The record in that case showed the matter was pending in the trial court for almost a year and was dismissed right before trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The case was re-filed within three months and the summary judgment was identical to the original motion for summary judgment, supported by the same Civ.R. 56 evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record in\n   <em>\n    TPI\n   </em>\n   did not indicate that the defendant could not adequately respond to the summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Similar to\n   <em>\n    TPI\n   </em>\n   , we find the record in the present case does not support the Braggs' assertion they could not adequately respond to the summary judgment motion. Our ruling today is not that in all re-filed cases, a continuance to conduct discovery pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) is never warranted. Rather, it is the burden of the party opposing summary judgment to submit affidavits with sufficient reasons stating why she or he cannot present by affidavit facts sufficient to justify its opposition. The party must state a factual basis and the reasons why it cannot present facts essential to its opposition of the motion. In this case, the trial court determined the Braggs failed to meet their burden and we find the record supports the trial court's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Braggs' first Assignment of Error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
