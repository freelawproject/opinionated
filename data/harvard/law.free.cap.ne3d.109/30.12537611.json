Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In 1994, Appellees moved into a 100-year-old home in Pomeroy, Ohio. The home has three bedrooms and one and one-half baths. There is a covered deck in the backyard, which Appellees later converted into additional living space (\"the addition\"). Next to Appellees' home is the Meigs County Historical Society &amp; Museum. It consists of two buildings, the newer of which is commonly referred to as \"the museum annex.\" Appellees' home and the historical society sit at the foot of a steep wooded hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Between October 24, 2011 and November 23, 2011, the hill behind Appellees' home slid twice, causing severe damage to their property. Appellees claim that the slides were caused by a leaking water pipe that the Village negligently failed to repair. In October 2013, Appellees filed a complaint against Appellants, Hylant Administrative Services, LLC, The Ohio Plan, Inc., and Laurie O'Malley, individually and as an employee of Hylant Administrative Services, LLC, and The Ohio Plan, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging (1) negligence against the Village and its employees; (2) spoliation; (3) bad faith denial of their insurance claim; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) conspiracy; and (6) deprivation of constitutional rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They also petitioned for a writ of mandamus directing the Village to commence appropriation proceedings to address the taking of their property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In their complaint, Appellees alleged that the water department's employees negligently failed to discover and fix a leaking water pipe at the top of the hill behind the museum annex between October 20, 2011 and October 24, 2011, despite the fact that their employees had information that would place an ordinary water\n   department worker on notice that there was a leak. Specifically, they alleged that the employees negligently failed to find and repair a broken valve on the water pipe leading up the hill prior to the first hill slide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellees further alleged that when the employees were trying to locate and fix the water leak, they negligently broke the water pipe with a backhoe. The broken water line allegedly caused large amounts of water and mud to flow toward Appellees' home, eventually causing damaging mudslides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Finally, Appellees alleged that despite warnings from engineers and others that the hill must be repaired and stabilized immediately, the Village failed to take any action after the first hill slide which caused the hill to further deteriorate and slide a second time on November 23, 2011. Appellees also alleged that the Village failed to take necessary measures to remedy the hill after the second slide thereby causing additional damage to their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Between December 2013 and November 2014, Appellees filed two amended complaints, clarifying the nature of some of their claims and adding Ruth Spaun, in her individual capacity, and former Pomeroy Mayor Mary McAngus as defendants. Both defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them, arguing that the statute of limitations had expired. The trial court agreed; and the claims against them were dismissed. Ohio Plan, Inc., Ohio Risk Management, Inc., Hylant Administrative Services, LLC, and O'Malley were also dismissed from the suit after they successfully moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In August 2016, Appellants moved for summary judgment. As relevant here, they argued that the Village was immune from Appellees' negligence claims because their claims related to a governmental function, as opposed to a proprietary one. Specifically, they argued that Appellees' allegations related to flood control measures, as opposed to the establishment, maintenance, and operation of a municipal corporation water supply system. They further argued that even if Appellees' allegations related to the establishment, maintenance, and operation of a municipal corporation water supply system and therefore subjected the Village to liability, immunity was restored because the Village's handling of the slides involved discretionary decisions under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and 2744.03(A)(5). Finally, they argued that Spaun was immune from individual liability because his acts or omissions were neither manifestly outside the scope of his employment or official responsibilities nor done with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, as required under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In October 2016, Appellees filed a memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, arguing that their claims related to a propriety function, as opposed to a governmental function. Specifically, they argued that their allegations related to the establishment, maintenance, and operation of a municipal corporation water supply system, as opposed to flood control measures. They further argued that the Village's immunity was not restored under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and 2744.03(A)(5) because the Village's handling of the situation did not involve discretionary decisions under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and 2744.03(A)(5). Finally, they argued Spaun was liable in his individual capacity because his actions were done in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, as required under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On February 16, 2017, the trial court denied Appellants' motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Village\n   was not immune from Appellees' negligence claims because their allegations concerned the alleged negligent performance of a proprietary function and did not involve the exercise of discretion, as contemplated by R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and R.C. 2744.03(A)(5). It did not address whether Spaun was entitled to individual immunity under R.C. 2944.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Bill investigated and discovered water coming out of the ground, at the top of the hill and on the side of the hill near the museum annex. Rilla's son notified the Water Department of the issue; but no one investigated. The issue persisted the following day; and after notifying the water department again, two workers, one of whom was Spaun, responded to the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 30} According to Bill, he tried to get the workers to investigate the water leak but was told that \"the leaking water line was [his] responsibility, not that of the Village.\" Deposition of Bill Smith, p. 2.

He initially thought it was an animal; but upon inspection, he saw water, mud, and leaves sliding down the hill toward the museum annex. When workers arrived on scene, they began searching for the leak. Shortly thereafter, David overheard workers admit that they had accidently broken the water line with their backhoe. After\n   that, David observed the water, mud, and debris changed course and begin flowing toward his house. Eventually, the debris-which included a large tree root-piled up against the rear of Appellees' home, causing severe damage. John Musser, the former Mayor of Pomeroy, investigated the incident and \"learned that a Village pipeline in fact had been leaking on October 21, 2015 when Mr. Smith showed Village water department worker Shannon Spaun the place where water had been coming out of the ground and also told him about the lack of water pressure in the Smith residence.\" Affidavit of John Musser, p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 32} David stated that the following day, Paul Hellman, the Village Administrator, and Mitch Altier, an engineer, came to the site to discuss how to stabilize the hill. The engineer suggested possible ways to stabilize the hill and prevent further damage. For example, he suggested that the Village cut down trees, but leave the stumps, to minimize any damage. Within the next day or so, a tree service, paid for by the Village, came and cut down the top of one tree that was up against David's home. But based on the engineer's suggestions, Appellees paid the company to remove additional trees. Despite these measures, the hill slid again on November 23, 2011, causing further damage to Appellees' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Because Appellees' allegations concern the alleged negligent performance of a proprietary function and their evidence demonstrates a logical nexus between the Village and its proprietary function of maintaining and operating a municipal corporation water supply system and the resulting loss to Appellees' property, we conclude that the exception to immunity set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(2) applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   2.
