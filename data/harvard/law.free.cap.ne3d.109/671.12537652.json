Roubanes, appeals a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, that granted plaintiff-appellee, Barbara A. Roubanes Luke, relief under Civ.R. 60(B). Luke cross appeals from the same judgment. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Roubanes and Luke married in 1998 and had two children. On June 21, 2008, Luke filed a complaint for divorce. In an agreed order entered September 30, 2008, Luke assented to the requirement that she pay Roubanes $1,000 per month in temporary child support during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 25, 2009, the trial court issued a scheduling order. The trial court required the parties to respond to all discovery requests by April 24, 2009, and it set August 10, 2009 as the trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Luke served her first set of interrogatories and requests for the production of documents on April 27, 2009-three days after the deadline for responding to such discovery. Luke served a second set of interrogatories on June 5, 2009. When Roubanes only turned over two documents in response to Luke's discovery requests, Luke did not move to compel. Rather, on July 30, 2009, Luke filed a motion in limine requesting that the trial court prohibit Roubanes from offering any undisclosed documentary evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The record contains no ruling on Luke's motion in limine, likely because Roubanes and Luke agreed to resolve all disputed issues in a summary trial. In such a trial, each party informally presents evidence to a judge. No transcript of the proceedings is made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} According to Roubanes and Luke, during their summary trial, they presented the trial judge with information regarding their assets and debts. Using the information the parties provided, the trial judge recorded in a \"Domestic Trial Summary Form\" the parties' assets and debts, along with a value for each. (Pl.'s Ex. 24, Roubanes Dep.) The trial judge then proposed a division of the marital property, to which both Roubanes and Luke agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In a judgment dated August 27, 2009, the trial court granted the parties a divorce, divided their marital property in the manner agreed to at the summary trial, and approved the shared parenting plan to which the parties agreed. The shared parenting plan required Luke to\n   pay to Roubanes child support in the amount of $930.70 per month, plus a processing charge and cash medical support (in the absence of private health insurance coverage for the children). The parties arrived at that amount of child support after setting Roubanes' annual income at $40,000 and Luke's annual income at $75,520. The trial court increased the amount of child support due by $554 \"per month for 28 months, to pay past [temporary child support] arrearages and equalize [the] property settlement.\" (Aug. 27, 2009 Deviation Findings of Fact.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Luke did not pay the child support due, and a post-divorce arrearage began to accumulate. Roubanes filed motions for contempt when Luke failed to pay child support, fees owed to the guardian ad litem, and attorney fees awarded to him. Roubanes prevailed on a number of these motions. Luke eventually requested that the trial court modify the amount of child support due. The trial court granted Luke's motion and decreased the amount of her monthly child support obligation. This post-divorce litigation resulted in two appeals to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roubanes v. Roubanes\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

Luke also requested that that trial court relieve her of all child support obligations, whether imposed pre-divorce or post-divorce, and all orders requiring her to pay Roubanes' attorney fees. Luke asserted such relief was necessary because Roubanes had deliberately withheld from her and the trial court financial information relevant to the determination of his income and the division of the marital property. According to Luke, her motion was timely because she based it on Civ.R. 60(B)(5), and such motions need only be filed within a reasonable time after a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In opposing Luke's motion for Civ.R. 60(B) relief, Roubanes denied withholding financial information from Luke or the trial court. Additionally, Roubanes argued that Luke's motion was untimely. Given the character of Luke's allegations, Roubanes contended that Civ.R. 60(B)(3), not Civ.R. 60(B)(5), applied to her motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Luke did not file her motion within one year of the August 27, 2009 judgment, Roubanes maintained that she missed the one-year deadline for seeking relief under Civ.R. 60(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court held a hearing on Luke's Civ.R. 60(B) motion. Both Luke and Roubanes testified and presented documentary evidence at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In a judgment issued October 14, 2016, the trial court granted Luke's motion in part and denied it in part. First, the trial court examined affidavits that Roubanes had submitted to the court in 2008 and 2009. In the 2008 affidavit, Roubanes stated that his annual income was $6,000. In the 2009 affidavit, Roubanes stated that his annual income had risen to $7,200. The trial court compared Roubanes' representations to Luke's affidavit testimony, presented in support of her Civ.R. 60(B) motion, that Roubanes had deposited into his U.S. Bank and Chase Bank accounts $74,559.54 in 2008 and $103,243.58 in 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court found it mathematically impossible for an individual with such low annual income to amass the funds necessary to deposit such large sums. Thus, the trial court concluded that Roubanes had misrepresented his 2008 and 2009 annual incomes in his affidavit testimony. Additionally, the trial court decided that Roubanes had falsely testified regarding his 2008 income because he had claimed $4,500 in net monthly receipts in his 2008 budget and his budgeted expenses for 2008 far outstripped his reported income. Based upon its analysis of the evidence, the trial court determined that Roubanes had committed fraud upon the court, which justified granting Luke relief under Civ.R. 60(B)(5). The trial court also concluded that Luke's Civ.R. 60(B)(5) motion was timely because she filed it within a month of discovering the amounts Roubanes had deposited into his U.S. Bank and Chase Bank accounts in 2008 and 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The trial court then turned to fashioning relief for Luke. According to the trial court, Roubanes' misrepresentations regarding his income caused the court to issue inequitable child support orders and erroneously rule in Roubanes' favor when he moved for contempt based on non-payment of child support. Thus, the trial court concluded that Roubanes' fraud on the court warranted granting Luke relief from all child support orders and ordering Roubanes to reimburse Luke for the attorney fees awarded to Roubanes in connection with the findings of contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court next considered Luke's allegations that Roubanes had failed to disclose certain marital assets and misrepresented the value of other marital assets. The trial court concluded that these allegations, if true, only amounted to the type of fraud contemplated by Civ.R. 60(B)(3). The trial court denied Luke relief from the property distribution because she failed to file her motion within one year of the August 27, 2009 judgment, as required for motions filed under Civ.R. 60(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Both Roubanes and Luke appealed the October 14, 2016 judgment. However, neither party has asserted any assignments of error. Pursuant to App.R. 16(A)(3), an appellant's brief must contain \"[a] statement of the assignments of error presented for review, with reference to the place in the record where each error is reflected.\" Assignments of error are particularly important because appellate courts determine each appeal \"on its merits on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs under App.R. 16.\" App.R. 12(A)(1)(b). Consequently, without assignments of error, an appellate court has nothing to review.\n   <em>\n    Pack v. Hilock Auto Sales\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

We will follow that path in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 18} For Roubanes, we draw assignments of error from the section headings in his appellant's brief. Thus, Roubanes assigns as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred when it found that Appellant committed \"fraud upon the court\" and granted Cross-Appellant's Motion for Relief pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [2.] The trial court erred and abused its discretion when it found Cross-Appellant's Motion for 60(B) [sic] was filed in a timely manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [3.] Trial court abused its discretion when they [sic] found that any and all child support orders naming Cross-Appellant as the obligor were released and any attorney fees awarded to Appellant were to be reimbursed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [4.] The trial court's failure to recuse itself from this matter prior to holding a hearing on Cross-Appellant's Motion for 60(B) [sic] Relief, or prior to issuing a decision, was an abuse of discretion and violation of the Judicial Cannons [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Emphasis deleted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} For Luke, we extract an assignment of error from the statement of issues contained in the cross-appellant's brief. Thus, Luke assigns as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [T]he trial court abused its discretion by failing to find that Defendant/Appellant's misrepresentation of the property value in West Virginia as $800 at the time of the divorce also constituted fraud upon the court and was therefore timely raised by Plaintiff/Cross-Appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis deleted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} By Roubanes' first assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in finding that he committed fraud upon the court and granting Luke relief under Civ.R. 60(B)(5). We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B), a court may relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(B);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (4) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (5) any other reason justifying relief from the judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5). To prevail on a Civ.R. 60(B) motion, a party must demonstrate that: (1) it has a meritorious claim or defense to present if the court grants it relief; (2) it is entitled to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5); and (3) it filed the motion within a reasonable time and, when relying on a ground for relief set forth in Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (2), or (3), it filed the motion not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken.\n   <em>\n    GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v.

We thus conclude that the trial court erred in finding that Roubanes committed a fraud upon the court and\n   granting Luke Civ.R. 60(B)(5) relief on that basis. Accordingly, we sustain Roubanes' first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Given our ruling on Roubanes' first assignment of error, we must reverse the trial court's judgment to the extent that it grants Luke relief from the orders requiring Luke to pay child support and Roubanes' attorney fees. Roubanes' remaining assignments of error advance alternative reasons for reversing the same portion of the judgment. Thus, our determination of Roubanes' first assignment of error renders moot the remaining assignments of error. We, consequently, will not rule on the second through fourth assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 33} By Luke's cross assignment of error, she argues that the trial court erred in refusing to find that Roubanes engaged in fraud upon the court by misrepresenting the value of real property the couple owned in West Virginia. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 34} During the parties' marriage, Roubanes purchased a house in West Virginia. Immediately prior to the summary trial, Roubanes filed a \"Statement of Assets and Liabilities\" in which he valued the West Virginia property at $38,640 and represented that the mortgage on the property amounted to $37,834.04. No transcript was made of the summary trial, so we have no record of exactly what Roubanes told the trial judge about the West Virginia property's value during the summary trial. When asked at his deposition what he said at the summary trial, Roubanes stated that the value he offered \"came right off the tax statement. It came right off the assessed value statement; and I would be guessing, but I think it was thirty-six or thirty-eight thousand dollars.\" (Roubanes Dep. at 298-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The trial judge included the West Virginia property in the \"Domestic Trial Summary Form,\" but he did not note in the form the appraised value of the property or the amount owed on the mortgage. Instead, the form only lists the \"equity value\" of the West Virginia property at $800. (Pl.'s Ex. 24, Roubanes Dep.) This value is consistent with the figures Roubanes reported in his \"Statement of Assets and Liabilities,\" which reflected that the equity value of the West Virginia property was $805.96. The trial court used the $800 value when dividing the parties' marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 36} During the Civ.R. 60(B) hearing, Luke produced Exhibit E, which her attorney described as a printout from the West Virginia auditor's website. Exhibit E appears to show that the value of the West Virginia property was $67,000 in tax year 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Luke relied on Exhibit E to contend that Roubanes misrepresented the value of the West Virginia property during the summary trial. Luke argued to the trial court that this misrepresentation warranted relief under Civ.R. 60(B)(5). The trial court rejected Luke's argument, stating the allegations of fraud associated with the marital property division constituted fraud upon Luke, and not the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Applying the law set forth above, we conclude that the alleged misrepresentation of the West Virginia property's value is not fraud upon the court. Luke merely complains that Roubanes falsely testified about the value of a marital asset. She does not claim that an officer\n   of the court participated in the alleged fraud. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that Roubanes did not commit fraud upon the court when he allegedly misrepresented the value of the West Virginia property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 38} In making her appellate argument, Luke cites precedent from this court holding that a trial court may grant relief under Civ.R. 60(B)(5) if a party fails to disclose a marital asset prior to the entry of a divorce decree.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clymer v. Clymer\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 91AP-438,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%20224478\">\n    1991 WL 224478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sept. 10, 1991) ;\n   <em>\n    Hellwege v. Hellwege\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 85AP-927,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%206335\">\n    1986 WL 6335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 5, 1986). Notably, in these cases, the question was not whether a party had committed fraud upon the court, thus entitling the opposing party to relief under Civ.R. 60(B)(5). Rather, the precedent at issue held that a party's failure to disclose a marital asset can constitute a Civ.R. 60(B)(5) ground independent from the fraud-upon-the-court basis for relief.\n   <em>\n    Trenner v. Trenner\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 01AP-743,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20124719\">\n    2002 WL 124719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 31, 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The above-cited cases are irrelevant to this case for two reasons. First, Luke's assignment of error only asserts that the trial court erred in failing to find fraud upon the court due to Roubanes' alleged misrepresentation regarding the West Virginia property. Because Luke's assignment of error does not contend that the trial court erred in failing to grant her Civ.R. 60(B) relief based on the rule followed in\n   <em>\n    Clymer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hellwege\n   </em>\n   , we need not address that contention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonn v. Bonn\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 12AP-1047,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-2313\">\n    2013-Ohio-2313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202444641\">\n    2013 WL 2444641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9 (\"[T]his court rules on assignments of error only, and will not address mere arguments.\"). Second, the precedent at issue only applies when a marital asset is entirely omitted from the property division; not where a party misstates an asset's value.\n   <em>\n    Tait v. Tait\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 92AP-306,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20249943\">\n    1992 WL 249943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sept. 29, 1992) ;\n   <em>\n    Hellwege\n   </em>\n   . As the alleged misrepresentation here relates solely to the property's value, this precedent does not justify relief from judgment in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that Roubanes did not engage in fraud upon the court when he allegedly misstated the value of the West Virginia property. Accordingly, we overrule Luke's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 41} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain Roubanes' first assignment of error, which moots the second through fourth assignments of error. Additionally, we overrule Luke's sole assignment of error. We thus reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, to the extent that it granted Luke Civ.R. 60(B) relief, and we affirm that judgment to the extent that it denied Luke Civ.R. 60(B) relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   BROWN, P.J., and BRUNNER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Civ.R. 60(B)(3) allows a court to vacate a judgment due to \"fraud * * *, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    According to Luke, Roubanes did not divulge the existence of the U.S. Bank account before or during the summary trial. Although Luke knew of the Chase Bank account at the time of trial, she claims that she did not know the amount of the funds that Roubanes had deposited into that account in 2008 or 2009. Roubanes maintains that he disclosed printouts of his bank account balances during the summary trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The adversarial process provided Luke with the means to uncover evidence to expose Roubanes' fraud, but she did not use those means. Luke failed to diligently pursue discovery and she relinquished her right to a full trial, where she could have cross-examined Roubanes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    No witness authenticated Exhibit E. Therefore, there is no evidence explaining the origin or meaning of the information contained on the page of the exhibit that appears to state the property's appraised value. Despite the murkiness surrounding Exhibit E, we will presume for purposes of this appeal that Exhibit E establishes that in 2008 a West Virginia government entity appraised the parties' property at $67,000.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
