L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition, a judge of the Superior Court denied his motion for a new trial. Dew has appealed from that ruling, and his appeal is currently pending in the Appeals Court. He can raise all of his claims in that appeal.\n     </history>\n    </footnote>\n    <div type=\"majority\">\n     <p id=\"p-7\">\n      Anthony Dew pleaded guilty in the Superior Court to multiple counts of trafficking of a person for sexual servitude, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (\n      <em>\n       a\n      </em>\n      ) ; assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (\n      <em>\n       b\n      </em>\n      ) ; drug distribution, in violation of\n     G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32 (\n      <em>\n       a\n      </em>\n      ) and 32A (\n      <em>\n       a\n      </em>\n      ) ; and other charges. He subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, seeking to withdraw his pleas. In connection with that motion, he filed several additional motions seeking postconviction discovery, appointment of counsel, judicial notice, and a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, all of which were denied. He then filed a petition in the county court for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking review of the Superior Court judge's orders on the latter motions. A single justice of this court denied the petition without a hearing. Dew appeals. We affirm.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-8\">\n      Our power of general superintendence under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is reserved for extraordinary circumstances, where a petitioner demonstrates both a substantial violation of a substantive right and the absence of an adequate alternative remedy. See\n      <em>\n       Watson\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Walker\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731296\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/447/1014/#p1014\">\n       447 Mass. 1014\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1014,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=854%20N.E.2d%201247\">\n       854 N.E.2d 1247\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2006). Relief is properly denied where, as here, the petitioner has an adequate alternative avenue to seek review. See\n      <em>\n       Tavares\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547357\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1168/#p1024\">\n       478 Mass. 1024\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1024,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547357\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1168/#p1024\">\n       89 N.E.3d 1168\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2018). \"An established route for the petitioner to obtain appellate review of the denial of his motion for postconviction discovery [and the other motions ancillary to his motion for a new trial] would be in connection with an appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial.\"\n      <em>\n       Donald\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735026\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/1007/#p1007\">\n       437 Mass. 1007\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1007,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20N.E.2d%20471\">\n       770 N.E.2d 471\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2002).\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      The single justice therefore neither erred nor abused his discretion in denying the petition under G.
