L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (<em>a</em> ) ; assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (<em>b</em> ) ; drug distribution, in violation of <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"484\" href=\"#p484\" id=\"p484\">*484</a>G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32 (<em>a</em> ) and 32A (<em>a</em> ) ; and other charges. He subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, seeking to withdraw his pleas. In connection with that motion, he filed several additional motions seeking postconviction discovery, appointment of counsel, judicial notice, and a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, all of which were denied. He then filed a petition in the county court for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking review of the Superior Court judge's orders on the latter motions. A single justice of this court denied the petition without a hearing. Dew appeals. We affirm.</p><p id=\"p-8\">Our power of general superintendence under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is reserved for extraordinary circumstances, where a petitioner demonstrates both a substantial violation of a substantive right and the absence of an adequate alternative remedy. See <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731296\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/447/1014/#p1014\">447 Mass. 1014</extracted-citation>, 1014, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=854%20N.E.2d%201247\">854 N.E.2d 1247</extracted-citation> (2006). Relief is properly denied where, as here, the petitioner has an adequate alternative avenue to seek review. See <em>Tavares</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547357\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1168/#p1024\">478 Mass. 1024</extracted-citation>, 1024, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547357\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1168/#p1024\">89 N.E.3d 1168</extracted-citation> (2018). \"An established route for the petitioner to obtain appellate review of the denial of his motion for postconviction discovery [and the other motions ancillary to his motion for a new trial] would be in connection with an appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial.\" <em>Donald</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735026\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/1007/#p1007\">437 Mass. 1007</extracted-citation>, 1007, <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20N.E.2d%20471\">770 N.E.2d 471</extracted-citation> (2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The single justice therefore neither erred nor abused his discretion in denying the petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p><p id=\"p-12\">After the single justice of this court denied Dew's G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition, a judge of the Superior Court denied his motion for a new trial. Dew has appealed from that ruling, and his appeal is currently pending in the Appeals Court. He can raise all of his claims in that appeal.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
