These consolidated appeals are the culmination of court proceedings that arose from part of the Schneiders' wrongdoings and involved investment in property in Parma Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104201, intervenor-appellant, city of Parma Heights, appeals the trial court's judgment denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in favor of appellee, The Home Savings &amp; Loan Company of Youngstown, Ohio (\"HSL\"). In 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104206, appellant Cleveland Construction, Inc. (\"CCI\"), also appeals the trial court's judgment denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in favor of HSL. In 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104232, appellant HSL challenges the trial court's judgments relating to the distribution of receivership assets. Additional parties to these appeals that filed appellate briefs include the receiver on the case, Matthew Fornshell, and prior owners of the subject property, Parma Heights Land Development, L.L.C., and ATC Realty Sixteen, Inc. Numerous other parties in the underlying cases are not part of this consolidated appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} For the purposes of judicial clarity, we consider the arguments raised in each appeal separately, but issue one consolidated opinion because the resolution of issues raised in one case impact those posed in the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The assigned errors raised herein concern trial court judgments relating to the priority and validity of various liens filed against parcels of real property in Parma Heights and the court's receivership orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Cornerstone Properties Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 2003, Pearl Development Company (\"PDC\"), an entity controlled by Joanne Schneider, proposed a mixed-use development project funded by private and public sources that could have potentially revitalized a large portion of Parma Heights near the intersection of Pearl Road and West 130th Street; the project was called \"Cornerstone\" and the involved property, \"Cornerstone Properties.\" The real property compromising Cornerstone Properties consisted of five separate parcels of land: three of the parcels were\n   aggregated into the \"Pearl\" property and the other two parcels were known as \"Garnet\" and \"Ruby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In March 2003, the Schneiders approached CCI, a construction management firm, to discuss the Cornerstone project. Thereafter, CCI entered into a contract with PDC to provide construction management for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 26, 2003, HSL issued a loan in the amount of $3,320,000 to the Schneiders in their personal capacities. To secure the debt, the Schneiders executed a note and an open-end mortgage in favor of HSL encumbering the Garnet property. On July 9, 2003, HSL issued a loan in the amount of $3,700,000 to PDC through its president, Joanne Schneider. In return, PDC executed a note and two separate open-end mortgages in favor of HSL encumbering the Pearl and Ruby properties. The Schneiders used $2,802,627.20 from the proceeds of the loan from HSL to satisfy two pre-existing mortgages that had previously encumbered the Pearl and Ruby properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In December 2003, Parma Heights City Council passed an ordinance authorizing the city to enter into a \"Project Development Agreement\" with the Schneiders and their business entities. The city and the Schneiders agreed that all reasonable costs incurred by the city for improvements to the Cornerstone Properties would be paid for by the Schneiders through service payments in lieu of taxes under a Tax Increment Financing Program (\"TIF\"). The contract also allowed for the collection of special assessments of 40 semi-annual payments over a 20-year period against the Cornerstone Properties if the Schneiders failed to make the payments under the TIF. The Schneiders agreed to file a petition with Parma Heights to levy a special assessment for the construction of the public improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In May 2004, the city passed a resolution to proceed with construction of the project. In July 2004, CCI provided PDC with a bridge loan in the amount of $2,500,000 so that PDC could continue construction on the project. Unfortunately, the Schneiders' scheme fell apart soon after construction began. When the Ponzi scheme collapsed, so did the funding for the Cornerstone project and by December 2004, construction on the project had completely halted. The Schneiders defaulted on their obligations to make service payments in lieu of taxes under the TIF. Joanne Schneider eventually pleaded guilty to a number of criminal charges and went to prison. Investors and contractors scrambled to recover what they could from the Schneiders' remaining assets, but, as mentioned, litigation resulting from their criminal activities continues to the present day. The property is still not fully developed or in use, and remains the largest undeveloped parcel in the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} CCI filed two separate mechanic's liens in the amounts of $720,152.22 and $837,583.50 against the Pearl property pursuant to R.C. 1311.01. The affidavits supporting each mechanic's lien stated that the last day of work on the Pearl property was December 3, 2004. CCI also obtained a judgment lien against PDC for the $2,500,000 bridge loan the construction management firm had provided to the development company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} More than a dozen separate civil actions were filed in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas as a result of the\n   project's failure. The actions were consolidated before a single trial judge. On February 4, 2005, the trial court appointed a receiver, appellee Matthew Fornshell, to oversee the assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Parma Heights' work on public improvements to the Cornerstone Properties ceased sometime in 2005 or 2006. On May 22, 2006, Parma Heights passed Ordinance 2006-16 and levied a special assessment in the amount of $2,695,852.55, which was the amount the city had spent \"to date\" on improvements to the Cornerstone Properties for \"construction and installation of public sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water mains, street lighting, concrete curbs, asphalt pavement sidewalks, traffic signals, other public utility lines, and all together with the necessary appurtenances thereto.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On October 16, 2006, the city certified $3,743,190.74 to Cuyahoga County for collection, which included the $2,695,852.55 in costs and $1,047,338.19 in estimated interest over the 20-year repayment period. The amount did not include $394,366.48 in fees and expenses the city had determined it was owed pursuant to the Project Development Agreement. The city had originally estimated that it would spend about $15 million on improvements to the Cornerstone Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In the meantime, the receiver moved the court to authorize the sale of the Cornerstone Properties free and clear of any liens, claims, or encumbrances and transfer the interests of the lienholders to the proceeds of the sale. The court set forth the auction procedures and, in doing so, precluded any claims on the property via the following June 2006 order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court further finds that the sales of the properties shall be free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances * * *. Accordingly, all such liens, claims and encumbrances which now exist or are hereafter placed of record prior to the date of sale on or against the properties shall be, and they hereby are, extinguished as liens, claims and encumbrances against the properties; rather, the liens, claims and encumbrances against a particular property will attach to the net proceeds of the sale of that property. All such net proceedings from the sale of a Property will be held in a separate interest bearing account until further order of the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In November 2006, the Cornerstone Properties sold at auction for $7,900,000 to the McGill Property Group, L.L.C. (\"McGill\"). The court confirmed the sale on January 2, 2007, and, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement entered into at auction, issued a judgment entry stating, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   4. The sale of the Properties to the Buyer shall be free and clear of any lien, claim, or encumbrance whether known or unknown, * * * including but not limited to those liens and encumbrances expressly identified and included in the title commitment issued with respect to the Properties and incorporated by reference in this Order * * *. Sale of the Property shall be free and clear of any and all asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, statutory or contractual * * * assessments and governmental funded improvements whether assessed or not, including assessments that can be filed or certified for inclusion on the County Auditor's tax duplicate now or in the future for any improvements already made to or for the benefit of the Properties. Any and all valid and enforceable liens, claims or encumbrances of the Properties, including but not limited to any liens or claims arising from any assessments, liens or taxes, or the provisions of any governmentally funded improvements, whether assessed or not,\n   shall be transferred, fixed and attached to the net proceeds of the sale of the Properties, with the same validity, priority, force and effect as such liens and/or claims had upon the properties immediately prior to the closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The net proceeds of the sale after expenses were $6,621,496.23, and was held by the receiver in a separate account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Following the sale, McGill assigned its rights to Cornerstone Properties to appellee Parma Heights Land Development, L.L.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was not until after the sale, McGill alleged, that it learned that the city had previously placed a special assessment on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On December 4, 2007, the city sought to intervene in the matter to protect its rights under the special assessment. The trial court granted the city's motion to intervene. The city now alleges it is owed $4,137,557.72 pursuant to its special assessment, which includes $3,743,190.74 it spent on improvements to the Cornerstone Properties (the principal amount due plus 20 years of interest) and an additional $394,366.48 in legal fees, engineering fees, other professional fees, and miscellaneous expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On December 21, 2007, the trial court issued a Findings and Order of Distribution. The decision limited secured claims to amounts due and owing as of February 4, 2005 and stated that allowed claims would be given the following priority: (1) administrative claims, (2) secured claims, and (3) unsecured claims. The distribution order also provided for a Secured Creditor Allocation account, which the court defined as \"ten percent (10%) of each Secured Claim that shall be set aside for payment of Allowed Administrative Claims.\" The order required the receiver to obtain the court's approval by way of application before paying an administrative claim, required the applications be served on \"all parties desiring notice that have filed a Notice of Appearance,\" and indicated that \"objections to the applications must be filed and served in accordance with the Local Rules of the Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In late 2008, the trial court issued an order requiring those parties that claimed secured creditor status with respect to the Cornerstone Properties to move for summary judgment on the issue of priority of the various liens. CCI, HSL, and Parma Heights each argued their respective liens had priority. Parma Heights Land Development, L.L.C., who owned Cornerstone Properties at the time, argued that the trial court should transfer the city's assessment on the Cornerstone Properties to the proceeds from the sale of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} HSL argued that because the proceeds of its loan were used to satisfy the Pearl mortgage, its lien had priority on the Pearl property pursuant to R.C. 1311.14. CCI claimed that their mechanic's liens on the Pearl property had priority pursuant to R.C. 1311.13(A) because the first visible work occurred prior to the recording of HSL's loan. CCI further asserted that the recorded instruments upon which HSL relied were flawed, thereby negating HSL's priority argument. Parma Heights argued that its special assessment had priority against all others asserting secured creditor status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Priority Opinion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On May 16, 2011, the trial court issued its ruling on the priority of the liens\n   asserted by the parties (\"Priority Opinion\"). In its Priority Opinion, the trial court made the following determinations: (1) the ten percent Secured Creditor Allocation set up for the benefit of the receivership had priority over all other lienholders; (2) HSL's July 10, 2003 recorded mortgage satisfied the two pre-existing mortgages that encumbered the Ruby and Garnet properties; (3) HSL's mortgage lien had \"priority as against all subsequently filed mechanic's liens, * * * but only as to the Ruby Property and the Garnet Property\"; (4) \"the Pearl Property was not encumbered by the mortgages [HSL's loan] satisfied\"; (5) HSL's loan funds were not used \"for improvements at the Pearl Property\"; and (6) because \"visible construction work commenced at the Cornerstone Properties before [HSL] recorded its mortgage,\" CCI's mechanic's liens took precedence as to the Pearl property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The trial court further found, with respect to the city's claim of priority based on its special assessment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Parma Heights] maintains that it is entitled to priority of its claims as against all others asserting secured status. The City bases its claim on legislation enacted on May 22, 2006[,] and thereafter certified to the Auditor of Cuyahoga County on October 16, 2006[,] imposing a Special Assessment against the Cornerstone Properties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   For a variety of reasons, the City of Parma Heights is not entitled to assert a claim of priority as against Home Savings and Loan Company or Lienholders. Putting aside for the moment the question whether the City's effort to impose its assessments is void as a matter of law, the City cannot unilaterally achieve retroactive super priority over other liens previously recognized in law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   * * * [T]he liens of Home Savings and Loan Company or Lienholders clearly predate the City's October 16, 2006 Special Assessment. The fact that the City had a contractual arrangement with the previous owners, the Schneiders who were operating a Ponzi scheme, is immaterial and does not affect in any way the priority of claims subsequently perfected before the City took any action of its own.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Following the issuance of its May 16, 2011 opinion and order, it was discovered that the order contained internal discrepancies. HSL filed a notice of appeal (8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 96911) and we remanded the case to the trial court for a decision on HSL's previously filed motion to partially vacate the Priority Opinion. In that motion, HSL argued that the Priority Opinion mistakenly identified the Garnet property as the property to which HSL's loan applied, rather than the Pearl property. HSL further argued that the evidence demonstrated that only \"$2,802,627.20 of the proceeds of the loan [to PDC] * * * were used to satisfy the J.A.M. Pearl Mortgage,\" so that fact should have been included in the Priority Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On August 29, 2011, the trial court issued a judgment entry granting HSL's motion to partially vacate the Priority Opinion. The amended judgment entry clarified that HSL's loan satisfied two pre-existing mortgages that encumbered the Ruby and Pearl properties and not the Garnet property. Based on this inadvertent error, the trial court reversed its prior determination that CCI had priority over the Pearl property, and concluded that HSL \"ha[d] priority of its liens as against all [other] lienholders.\" The court clarified that \"[t]o the extent that the court's May 16, 2011 opinion and order regarding the priority of liens held otherwise, the order is corrected consistent with the above.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} HSL and CCI separately appealed the trial court's August 29, 2011 amended judgment entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court heard CCI and HSL's consolidated appeals relating to the Priority Opinion and affirmed the trial court's determination that HSL had priority over CCI's mechanic's liens with respect to the Pearl property. This court stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [W]here a mortgagee substantially adheres to the provisions of R.C. 1311.14, its lien on the property has \"super priority\" over that of any mechanic's liens. R.C. 1311.14 gives a construction mortgage priority over mechanic's liens even if the mortgage was recorded subsequent to the effective date of the mechanic's liens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In this case, HSL provided evidence to show that: (1) it provided a construction loan to PDC, (2) the loan provided to PDC was used to satisfy the J.A.M. Pearl mortgage, and (3) PDC then began the Cornerstone project. This evidence was sufficient to satisfy R.C. 1311.14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   This court, therefore, cannot find that the trial court acted improperly in granting summary judgment to HSL on the priority of its lien against the Pearl property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Constr., Inc. v.

The Validity Opinion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The case was remanded to the trial court for the final disposition of the assets in the receivership estate. Parma Heights, CCI, and HSL each filed additional motions for summary judgment. In an order dated June 15, 2015, the trial court issued an opinion regarding the validity of liens (\"Validity Opinion\"). That decision granted summary judgment in favor of HSL, finding that HSL's mortgage on the Pearl property was a valid lien and CCI's mechanic's liens were invalid. In rendering its decision, the trial court rejected CCI's contention that HSL's mortgage was defectively executed and did not afford constructive notice to third parties that the mortgage encumbered the Pearl property. The trial court found that CCI failed to satisfy its burden of showing that it recorded the mechanic's liens within 75 days of its last day of work on the Pearl Property, as required by R.C. 1311.06(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The Validity Opinion did not address the validity of CCI's judgment lien or the city's special assessment. CCI and the city initiated appeals from the Validity Opinion, but this court dismissed the appeals for lack of final appealable orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    White v. Schneider,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103260, Motion No. 488703 (Oct. 1, 2015);\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. Schneider,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103261, Motion No. 488600 (Oct. 1, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Supplemental Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In November 2015, HSL filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment as to the amounts owed to HSL. In the motion, HSL argued that it is owed $3,320,000 plus contractual interest on the Garnet mortgage, and $3,700,000 plus contractual interest on the Pearl and Ruby mortgages, for a total of $7,020,000, plus contractual interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The receiver filed a brief in opposition, arguing that the trial court's December 2007 Order of Distribution decision expressly stated that secured claims could not include interest or penalty charges after February 4, 2005. Thus, the receiver claimed, HSL's \"request to include contractual interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum is contrary to the court's prior orders, which is the law of the case.\" HSL moved for leave to file a reply to the receiver's brief in opposition, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Also in November 2015, CCI filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment with respect to the validity of its judgment lien. The receiver filed a brief in opposition, arguing that CCI's judgment lien was invalid. CCI moved for leave to file a reply brief, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 33} On February 11, 2016, the trial court issued a series of judgment entries. The trial court denied HSL's supplemental motion for summary judgment as to the amounts owed to HSL. The trial court limited the amount of HSL's secured claim to $6,715,183.11 and determined that HSL was not entitled to interest accrued after February 4, 2005. The court stated that \"there are no additional funds in the Receivership Estate on which [HSL] has a secured claim.\" The trial court relied on the receiver's December 4, 2015 report filed pursuant to Local R. 26(B), where the receiver attested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   As of December 1, 2015, the aggregate balance of the real property accounts was $8,015,086.88. The proceeds from the sale of the Cornerstone Properties account for $6,715,183.11 of that aggregate balance. * * * The balance of the Secured Creditor Allocation Account as of December 1, 2015, was $416,112.46.

Chapter 727 does not expressly provide authority for such waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The trial court determined that the city failed to comply with R.C. 727.23, which authorizes a municipality to adopt an ordinance to proceed with a special assessment only after the expiration of the time for filing claims for damages under statute has expired. In this case, the city adopted Ordinance 2004-11 on May 24, 2004, contemporaneous with its adoption of Resolution 2004-11. R.C. 727.23, however, refers only to filing claims for damages under R.C. 727.18 and objections to the assessment under R.C. 727.15. Both R.C. 727.18 and 727.15 deal solely with the owner's rights to file claims or objections. The landowners at the time, which were the Schneiders and their business entities, never claimed they were prejudiced because they were not allowed to file a claim for damages. The Schneiders requested the special assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The trial court also concluded that the city failed to comply with R.C. 727.24 because the city began work on the project in 2003, prior to the May 2004 passage of Resolution 2004-11 and Ordinance 2004-11. But R.C. 727.24 sets forth how construction on a public improvement may proceed, what procedure a municipality must take if accepting bids, and what to do if a low bid exceeds estimates. While it certainly may not be advisable, we do not find that the plain reading of the statute prohibits a municipality from commencing with construction before passage of its resolution and ordinance to proceed, nor have the appellees provided us with any authority to support their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we disagree that Parma Heights' special assessment was invalid on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The trial court also found that the city failed to comply with R.C. 727.12 because Resolution 2004-11 did not show the amount of assessment against each parcel of land to be assessed, failed to show a breakdown of the cost estimate as to each parcel, and did not comply with R.C. 727.25 because, even after the city knew the actual cost of the improvement, it failed to apportion to each parcel of land\n   its share of the total cost of the improvement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 53} R.C. 727.12 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   When it is deemed necessary by a municipal corporation to make a public improvement to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments levied under this chapter, plans, specifications, profiles of the proposed improvement showing the proposed grade of the street and improvement after completion with reference to the property abutting thereon, and an estimate of the cost of the improvement shall be prepared and filed in the office of the clerk of the legislative authority of the municipal corporation and shall be open to the inspection of all persons interested.

First, Parma Heights argues that the Project Development Agreement it entered into with the Schneiders expressly waived any defects in the assessments. The contract provided that the \"special assessments be levied and collected without limitation as to the value of the Property assessed, and waive all the following relating to the Improvement and the special assessments: * * * any and all irregularities and defects in the proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 56} With respect to special assessments, the essential elements of a waiver are \"an existing right, knowledge of that right, and an intention to relinquish such right.\"\n   <em>\n    Marchky v.

The Schneiders petitioned Parma Heights to make the special assessments, knowingly waived defects and irregularities, and the assessments in this case were not made in an illegal manner, completely contrary to statutory procedures. Moreover, the Schneiders who were the original landowners petitioned for the improvements, and the subsequent landowners benefitted from the improvements to the land; the appellees are not claiming that they were prejudiced by the special assessments (except to the extent that they challenge the priority of the city's lien).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Second, the city argues that despite the issue of the validity of any waivers, it still substantially complied with statutory requirements. To support its position that it substantially complied with statutory requirements, Parma Heights cites this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

This court held that the city substantially complied with the statutes because it made a bona fide attempt to do so and its noncompliance was \"technical.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 4, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS at 8, 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20483572\">\n    1993 WL 483572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The trial court in the instant case distinguished\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   in its February 11,\n   2016 opinion, which found Parma Heights' special assessment invalid. In distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   , the trial court found that Solon had made a bona fide attempt to comply and substantially complied with the statutory requirements of R.C. Chapter 727, while, here, Parma Heights failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of R.C. Chapter 727. Put another way, the trial court found that the alleged violations of the statutory requirements in\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   were technical in nature, while the alleged violations in this case were both technical and substantive in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 63} R.C. 727.40 provides guidance when interpreting proceedings with respect to public improvements made by special assessment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Proceedings with respect to public improvements to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments shall be liberally construed by the legislative authorities of municipal corporations and by the courts in order to secure a speedy completion of the work at reasonable cost, and the speedy collection of the assessment after the time has elapsed for its payment. Merely formal objections shall be disregarded, but the proceedings shall be strictly construed in favor of the owner of the property assessed or injured as to the limitations on assessment of private property and compensation for damages sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Thus, R.C. 727.40 provides that courts shall liberally construe proceedings with respect to public improvements to be paid for by special assessments, such as the one in this case. We find that given the waivers in the Project Development Agreement, the city's attempts to comply with statutory requirements, and our liberal construction of proceedings, the competing lienholders have not carried the burden of showing that the city failed to substantially comply with R.C. Chapter 727 in passing the special assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Court Order Appointing Receiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The trial court further found that the special assessment was not valid because the assessment violated the court's amended order appointing the receiver. The court's order, dated February 28, 2005, provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Without prior consent from the Court, all creditors, claimants, bodies politic, parties in interest, and their respective attorneys, servants, agents, and employees, and all other persons, firms and corporations be, they hereby are, jointly and severally, enjoined and stayed from (a) commencing or continuing any action at law or suit or proceeding in equity to foreclose any lien or enforce any claim against the Receivership Assets, or against the Receiver in any court, and (b) from executing or issuing or causing the execution or issuance out of any court of any Writ, process, summons, attachment, subpoena, replevin, execution, or other process for the purpose of impounding or taking possession of or interfering With the Receiver in the discharge of his duties in this proceeding or With the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court over the Receivership Assets and the said Receiver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The trial court found that Parma Heights, as a lienholder, was required to comply with its order that all creditors were enjoined from commencing or continuing any proceeding to enforce any claim against the receivership without prior permission from the court. The court concluded that because the city did not ask permission from the court before it filed its special assessment, its attempt to certify the assessment failed as a matter of law. Parma Heights claims that its levying of the special assessments was not prohibited by the court's February 28, 2005 order\n   because the assessment was not an \"action at law or suit or proceeding in equity\" in a court nor was it the product of an execution or issuance \"out of any court\" of a writ, process, summons, attachment, subpoena, replevin, execution, or other process; therefore, the city contends, the levying of the special assessment did not violate the court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 67} HSL contends that the city's 2006 ordinance violated the court's February 28, 2005 order because Parma Heights, at the time it passed its 2006 ordinance, knew that the only way the city was going to be able to recover what it had expended in improvements to Cornerstone Properties was to pursue its claims in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 68} We agree with Parma Heights that its passage of Ordinance 2006-16 and certification of the special assessment did not violate the court's order appointing the receiver. We base this conclusion in part on the ambiguous language of the February 28, 2005 order. We also base our finding on the principles of equity. The evidence demonstrates that both the trial court and the appellees had knowledge that Parma Heights was continuing to make improvements to Cornerstone Properties after the February 28, 2005 court order, and the evidence reveals that this was at the bequest of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 69} In an affidavit dated January 22, 2008, then-mayor Martin Zanotti averred the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   8.

At a status conference in response to a question I asked the Judge about his expectations of the City[,] I was advised by him that the City should continue assisting the Court and the Receiver with preserving the receivership estate and in order to maintain the properties [sic] value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   12. Based upon the direction that I received from the Judge[,] the City expended additional taxpayer funds to preserve the receivership estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   13. Absent the Court's instructions to continue work, the City would have halted its efforts to construct improvements on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 70} At his January 12, 2009 deposition, the mayor explained that once the Schneider's Ponzi scheme failed, there were no other means for the city to recoup its investment in Cornerstone Properties; the only option the city had was to levy special assessments against the property. The mayor explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Once the property went into receivership, the city no longer had an owner [that] was going to develop the property, so the proposed means of recouping the city's investment in the property no longer was available. At that point in time, it was the only option the city had, to protect itself, was a special collector to collect its money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   R. 813, tr. 18. When asked why the city did not pass a special assessment when the property went into receivership in 2005, the mayor stated that the city \"could have,\" but, as the mayor explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   I believe it was in our best interest to work with the receiver and the court to try to determine how quickly [a new] developer would come in. Once it was\n   clear that it was going to get wrapped up in the legal process for a long period of time, the city had no other potential source for recouping its investment except on the special assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   It was probably my decision to at least work with the courts for awhile to see how quickly this property would-it had been our hope that once it went into receivership, the property would be quickly turned over to another developer and we would be able to recoup our investment quickly with that developer. Obviously, that didn't pan out. The city had to move forward with special assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   R. 813, tr. 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 71} It is clear from the mayor's deposition testimony that the city was trying to work with the court and the receiver to determine the best course of action before it took legal action or levied the special assessments against the property to recoup its investment. The city was expecting the area would be developed, not that it would remain undeveloped or mired in years of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 72} We are reminded that \"[w]here the rights of the parties are not clearly defined in law, broad equitable principles of fairness apply and will determine the outcome of each case individually.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonald Co. v.

In the instant case, the record shows that the total amount owed on the mortgages and liens on the Cornerstone Properties exceeded the value of the properties as estimated before the sale; thus, as a result, the properties would probably have sold for less than what was owed. The trial court determined that \"[a] sale of the Properties other than one free and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances would adversely affect the Receivership Estate and would be of substantially less benefit to the Receivership Estate.\" Thus, we find that the trial court maximized the benefit to the receivership estate by ordering the sale free and clear of all liens and claims, and the final sale order was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 78} The city knew about the pending receiver's sale, acquiesced to the sale, and did not object to the sale.

As a result, the city's only method of recovery is from the proceeds of the sale of the property. Therefore, we must determine lien priority, and to do so, we must address Parma Heights's first assignment of error in which the city argues that the trial court erred in finding that the city's special assessment lien did not have priority over other lienholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 84} In an order dated May 16, 2011, the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   [T]he City cannot unilaterally achieve retroactive super priority over other liens previously recognized in law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   * * * [T]he liens of Home Savings and Loan Company or Lienholders clearly predate the City's October 16, 2006 Special Assessment.

LEXIS 27 (1900), where the court determined that a bank's mortgage lien had priority over a village's assessment lien. In\n   <em>\n    Donohue\n   </em>\n   , a group of private property owners improved a portion of a road abutting their lots. The improvements were paid by a loan issued by a bank and secured by the lots. The lots were later annexed to the village. After the annexation, the property owners petitioned the village to improve the portion of the road abutting their lots and agreed to pay an assessment on their lots for the improvements. The village council passed an ordinance to install the petitioned-for improvements, entered into\n   a contract with a contractor, and passed an ordinance to assess the lots and issue bonds to pay for the improvements, knowing the work was already done and the proceedings were for the sole purpose of paying the balance due by the property owners for the improvements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 89} The bank foreclosed on the lots. The trial court decided that the city council could not order an improvement to be made and then, after the improvement is made, assess the benefitting properties. Because the village levied the assessment after the improvements were made, the court found that the bank's mortgage lien had priority over the village's assessment lien.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Parma Heights distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   , arguing that it decided to make improvements on the Cornerstone Properties and determined that the improvements would be paid by special assessments prior to actually making the improvements, even though it did not pass its ordinance to proceed until May 24, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   {\u00b6 91} HSL claims that work on the Cornerstone Properties actually began in 2003. HSL points to Mayor Zanotti's February 4, 2009 deposition, during which the mayor testified that he used a bulldozer at the July 11, 2003 groundbreaking ceremony and the demolition of a grocery store began the next day. The mayor also testified that the city started infrastructure work and issued contracts on the project prior to signing the Project Development Agreement with the Schneiders in December 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 92} We find that the\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   case, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Case that dates from 1900, is not binding on this court and is distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   , the work on the lots was\n   <em>\n    finished\n   </em>\n   at the time the village council passed its assessment and the assessment was passed solely for the purpose of paying the balance due. In this case, the work on the Cornerstone Properties was not complete by the time the ordinance for the special assessment was passed, and in fact, only a fraction of work had been done on the project before the city passed its resolution and ordinance to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 93} R.C. 5721.10 grants the city priority over other lienholders; the first lienholder is the state.

However, the legislature has created statutory liens and established their priority. Ohio law is quite clear. The state of Ohio shall have the first lien.\") We see no reason to deviate from this well-settled principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   {\u00b6 94} Thus, we find that the trial court erred in finding that Parma Heights' lien\n   by special assessment did not have priority over the other lienholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 95} Parma Heights' first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Amount of Lien to be Determined\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   {\u00b6 96} As this court has determined, Parma Heights has a valid lien that has priority over all other lienholders, except for the ten percent Secured Creditor Allocation account set up for the benefit of the receivership. While the trial court is in the best position to ultimately determine the total amount of Parma Heights' lien, it is necessary to address some of the arguments raised by the parties on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 97} The proceeds from the sale of the Cornerstone Properties totaled $6,720,784.74. Again, Parma Heights alleges it is owed $4,137,557.72, consisting of $3,743,190.74 spent for improvements to the Cornerstone Properties and an additional $394,366.48 in legal fees, engineering fees, other professional fees, and miscellaneous expenses incurred in connection with the Cornerstone Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 98} HSL claims that Parma Heights is not entitled to collect $394,366.48 in legal fees, engineering fees, other professional fees, and miscellaneous expenses because those fees were not included in Ordinance No. 2006-16 nor certified to the county auditor for collection. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 99} R.C. 727.25 provides that after the actual cost of a public improvement has been ascertained \"the legislative authority of the municipal corporation shall by ordinance assess * * * that portion of the total cost of the improvement to be paid for by special assessments.\" The statute further provides that \"such assessments shall be payable as provided in the resolution of necessity adopted under section 727.12 of the Revised Code, and shall be final upon the adoption of the ordinance provided for in this section, unless the ordinance and resolution are amended pursuant to section 727.251 of the Revised Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   {\u00b6 100} R.C. 727.30 provides that the city shall certify the special assessment to the county auditor, and the auditor places the special assessment on the tax list in the amount certified, and then the county treasurer collects the certified special assessments in the same manner and at the same time as other taxes are collected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 101} In this case, Parma Heights included the $394,366.48 in expenses and fees in its 2004 resolution, but omitted it from its 2006 ordinance and resolution. As previously discussed, R.C. 727.40 provides that special assessments proceedings \"shall be liberally construed by the legislative authorities of municipal corporations and by the courts * * * but the proceedings shall be strictly construed in favor of the owner of the property assessed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   {\u00b6 102} In accordance with the statutes cited above, we agree with HSL that the city cannot recoup the monies it spent on legal fees, engineering fees, other professional fees, and miscellaneous expenses for the simple fact that it did not include those fees in Ordinance No. 2006-16 or certify them to the county auditor for collection. Although those fees may have been part of the Project Development Agreement, they were not included in the ordinance; therefore, the city's only recourse is with the parties it contracted with in the Project Development Agreement (the now insolvent Schneiders and their business entities).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   {\u00b6 103} Next, CCI argues that the city cannot recoup more than 33 1/3 percent of the improved value of the property pursuant to R.C. 727.03. R.C. 727.03 provides that no assessments shall be levied that would be in excess of 33 1/3 percent of the actual improved value of the lot or\n   parcel, but R.C. 727.06 prescribes a process by which either 60 percent or 75 percent of the subject property owners may petition to pay the total cost of the improvement. The process set forth in R.C. 727.06 is what occurred in this case; the Schneider Entities, which owned 100 percent of the Cornerstone Properties, petitioned Parma Heights and agreed to have the total cost of the improvements assessed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roebling v.

We find no error with the waiver in this case. Thus, we find that the Schneider Entities waived the 33 1/3 percent cap on the special assessments, and Parma Heights was thereby allowed to assess the entire cost of its improvements to the Cornerstone Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   {\u00b6 105} The record shows the city spent, not including interest, $2,695,852.55 on improvements to the Cornerstone Properties. Thus, the city can recoup the full amount of the costs it expended, $2,695,852.55. As to what amount of interest, if any, the city is owed, the trial court is in the best position to determine that. But we remind the parties of what the city stated in its appellate brief and at oral argument-the city is not looking for a \"windfall.\" At oral argument, the city told the court it would be satisfied to recover the principal amount of $2,695,852.55 plus fees (those fees being the $394,366.48 this court found the city is not entitled to). For the sake of all parties, we hope a swift resolution will be reached, bringing an end to this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Cuyahoga No. 104206, CCI raised five assignments of error, challenging portions of the trial court's Validity Opinion. In 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104232, HSL raised six assignments of error, challenging portions of the trial court's distribution order and the trial court's denial of HSL's motion for summary judgment as to amounts owed.

CCI claimed that Campbell was an expert witness and HSL failed to identify him as such in accordance with court orders and\n   local rules; therefore, the court should have struck his affidavit. HSL argued that Campbell was not an expert witness, rather, he was a fact witness and the person who was most familiar with the Cornerstone properties and the location of the improvements that were to be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   {\u00b6 111} The trial court found that Campbell was not offering expert testimony in his affidavit. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in making that finding. Campbell was verifying and incorporating documents that were attached to HSL's motion for summary judgment. As president of the survey company that worked on the job, Campbell had personal knowledge of his own company's business records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   {\u00b6 112} CCI also sought to strike the affidavit of Timothy Briggs, who worked for Campbell, arguing that Briggs's affidavit contained inappropriate expert testimony.

But, as the trial court noted, Fornshell was not making statements based on his legal expertise. His averments were based on his familiarity with the Cornerstone Project, the documents he had reviewed in his position as the court-appointed receiver, and his on-site visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   {\u00b6 114} In light of the above, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying CCI's motions to strike.

HSL's Mortgage Lien\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   {\u00b6 115} The trial court initially granted summary judgment to HSL on the priority of its lien against the Pearl property, which this court affirmed, finding that where a mortgagee substantially adheres to the provisions of R.C. 1311.14, its lien on the property has \"super priority\" over that of any mechanic's liens.\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Constr., Inc. v.

The trial court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of HSL on the validity of its lien. In the second assignment of error, CCI claims that the court erred in this respect because the mortgage contained an incomplete legal description, thereby creating an issue of fact whether CCI, as a subsequent lienholder, had constructive knowledge of HSL's previously recorded mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   {\u00b6 116} As mentioned, in July 2003, PDC executed an open-end mortgage and security agreement with HSL for $3,700,000. The mortgage was secured, in part, by the Pearl property. Part of the documentation filed and recorded by HSL in support of its mortgage and note was an attachment, denoted \"Exhibit A,\" which consisted of the legal descriptions of each of the three parcels that made up the Pearl property. The legal descriptions for Parcels No. 3 and 4 were identical to the language contained in the recorded deeds.

[CCI's] mechanic's liens * * * have affidavits which on their face appear to contain all the information required under R.C. 1311.06. For the sake of argument, it may be said the CCI's mechanic's liens are valid on their face. However, whether the information is accurate or whether CCI meets the other statutory requirements are other issues requiring further examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   {\u00b6 126} The court found that CCI had not met its burden to demonstrate that it had performed lienable work within 75 days of filing its mechanic's liens as required by R.C. 1311.06(B)(3) and that issue remained in dispute. Thus, the trial court did not outright find that CCI's mechanic's liens were invalid but still denied CCI's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   {\u00b6 127} During oral argument in this matter, counsel for CCI conceded that should this court affirm the trial court's finding that HSL's mortgage liens were valid, then the issue of whether CCI's liens were valid is moot because HSL's mortgage liens exceed the amount the receiver has retained for secured creditors to recover from. We agree, but note that the amount HSL will recover has yet to be determined because Parma Heights now stands \"first in line\" based on our decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   {\u00b6 128} As we have determined that HSL's mortgage liens were valid and the issue of whether they take priority is settled, we need not consider whether the trial court erred in denying CCI's motion for summary judgment. In other words, because both Parma Heights and HSL take priority over CCI and because the amount remaining in the Secured Creditor Allocation account is far less than the amount owed to Parma Heights and HSL, whether the trial court erred in denying CCI's motion for summary judgment is moot. There is simply no money left for CCI to recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   {\u00b6 129} Accordingly, CCI's third and fourth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Receivership Orders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   {\u00b6 130} In its fifth assignment of error, CCI argues that the trial court erred in ordering the receiver to distribute funds to the unsecured creditors and allowing the receiver to take ten percent of the balance prior to distribution. HSL raised the same arguments in its second, third, and fourth assignments of error. Accordingly, we address these challenges to the trial court's receivership orders together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   {\u00b6 131} As mentioned, the trial court issued an Order of Distribution decision in December 2007. The decision provided for the creation of the Secured Creditor Allocation Account, which was defined as \"ten percent (10%) of each Secured Claim that shall be set aside for payment of Allowed Administrative Claims.\" The Order defined \"Administrative Claims\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   any Claims arising after February 4, 2005 for the actual fees and expenses necessary to preserve the value of the Receivership Assets, including but not limited to (1) Receiver's fees; (2) fees of professionals hired by the Receiver to assist him in the performance of his duties; (3) the costs and expenses necessary to preserve the value of the assets held in the Receivership Estate; and (4) federal, state, and local taxes incurred by the Receiver in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   {\u00b6 132} Initially, CCI and HSL argue that the trial court erred as a matter of law in its Order of Distribution decision by requiring ten percent of the proceeds of the sale of collateral for secured claims to be deposited into the Secured Creditor Allocation Account for payment of administrative expenses and claims.

As stated in the trial court's Order of Distribution, the Secured Creditor Allocation was created in an effort to \"preserve the value of the Receivership Assets.\" In our view, the trial court's creation of the Secure Creditor Allocation did not authorize the receiver to perform an act that exceeded the scope of R.C. 2735.04 as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   {\u00b6 138} Fornshell, as receiver, filed numerous applications requesting the trial court to authorize the payment of administrative claims from the Secured Creditor Allocation or the receiver's operating account. We recognize the contention that Fornshell's applications for the payment of administrative claims throughout the litigation (1) contained no supporting documentation, and (2) failed to explain how the administrative expenses paid from the Secured Creditor Allocation preserved the value of the receivership estate. That said, our review of the Fornshell's various applications involved the authorization of payment of receiver fees and itemized legal and professional services provided to the receiver. Each application provided a summary of the expenses incurred and stated that \"the Receiver will submit detailed invoices for the professional services provided to the Receiver, for the Court's in camera inspection.\" Under these circumstances, we find the relevant expenses were \"necessary to preserve the value of the assets held in the receivership.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   {\u00b6 139} Based on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by approving the receiver's payments of various administrative fees and costs from the Secured Creditor Allocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   {\u00b6 140} CCI and HSL next claim that the trial court erred in ordering the receiver to distribute any remaining funds to the unsecured creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   {\u00b6 141} On February 11, 2016, the court instructed the receiver to distribute any remaining assets in the receivership, including the remaining balance of the Secured Creditor Allocation, to \"unsecured creditors in a pro rata allocation\" or \"to a charity of the Receiver's choice\" if the receiver is \"unable to distribute assets to any unsecured creditors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   {\u00b6 142} As stated, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by requiring ten percent of the proceeds of the sale of collateral for secured claims to be deposited into a Secured Creditor Allocation for payment of administrative expenses and claims. Moreover, there is nothing in this record to suggest the trial court arbitrarily approved the receiver's payments of various administrative fees and costs from the Secured Creditor Allocation.

In this case, the funds placed in the Secured Creditor Allocation derived directly from the assets of each secured claim.

While the parties acknowledged at oral arguments that the remaining balance of the Secured Creditor Allocation account is minimal as a result of the amount of litigation in this case, we find the secured parties are entitled to recover the remaining balance of the Secured Creditor Allocation in the amount proportionate to the percentage of their secured claims placed into the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   {\u00b6 144} Based on the foregoing, CCI's fifth assignment of error is overruled in part and sustained in part.

Cuyahoga No. 101929,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3028\">\n    2015-Ohio-3028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20N.E.3d%20871\">\n    39 N.E.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the trial court issued a journal entry in November 2015, which set a briefing schedule with specific dates and parameters. With respect to the arguments raised by HSL, the briefing schedule specifically stated that HSL's supplemental motion for summary judgment as to amounts owed would be resolved on the basis of \"the motion and responses alone.\" All parties agreed to the briefing schedule. Accordingly, we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by enforcing its briefing schedule and denying HSL's motion for leave to file a reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   {\u00b6 147} HSL's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Entitlement to Contractual Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   {\u00b6 148} In its fifth and sixth assignments of error, HSL argues the trial court erred as a matter of law by limiting HSL's secured claim to the amount owed as of February 4, 2005, without contractual interest. HSL claims that because the receiver reported that it held a total of $7,037,195.12\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the receivership as of March 31, 2016, it was deprived of $17,195.12 in interest that accrued on its secured claim of $7,020,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   {\u00b6 149} We find HSL's argument concerning its entitlement to contractual interest to be moot. In light of this court's resolution of Parma Heights' appeal, the value of HSL's secured claim has greatly diminished. As discussed, the city has a valid special assessment lien and has priority over all other lienholders, including HSL. The city is entitled to recoup, at minimum, the costs it expended on improvements to the Cornerstone Properties\n   in the amount of $2,695,852.55. Because HSL does not have a first priority secured claim, the total balance held by the receiver, after payment to the city, will be significantly less than the principal balance of HSL's secured claim. Accordingly, consideration of whether HSL is entitled to contractual interest would merely be academic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   {\u00b6 151} Based on the foregoing, we find Parma Heights' lien is valid and the city has priority over all other lienholders. Thus, the city can recoup the full amount of the costs it expended, and the trial court is instructed to determine on remand what amount of interest, if any, the city is owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   {\u00b6 152} With respect to CCI's assigned errors, we find the trial court did not err by denying CCI's motion to strike three witness affidavits attached to HSL's motion for summary judgment. In addition, we find that CCI had constructive notice of the mortgage against the property, and the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of HSL on this basis. Because Parma Heights and HSL take priority over CCI, we find CCI's arguments concerning the validity of its liens to be moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   {\u00b6 153} As argued by CCI and HSL, we reverse the trial court's judgment concerning its order that the remaining balance of the Secured Creditor Allocation account be distributed among remaining unsecured creditors or to a charity of the receiver's choice instead of to the secured creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   {\u00b6 154} Regarding HSL's remaining assigned errors, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by enforcing its briefing schedule and denying HSL's motion for leave to file a reply brief. Further, issues concerning HSL's entitlement to accrued interest have been rendered moot by our resolution of Parma Heights' appeal. We recognize that our decision significantly impacts HSL's secured interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   {\u00b6 155} On remand, the trial court is instructed to redistribute the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the Cornerstone Properties and the Secured Creditor Allocation account consistent with the mandates of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   {\u00b6 156} The consolidated cases are affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   LARRY A.
