Keating is an attorney with Defendant-Appellee Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs. Plaintiff-Appellant Seniah Corporation retained Keating and Buckingham to represent it in two legal matters. In February 2010, Keating represented Seniah in a foreclosure action. Keating also represented Seniah in its Chapter 11 Petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, Case No. 10-60620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Cognizable Events and Termination of Relationship\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Seniah claimed Keating commit malpractice on two occasions during his representation of Seniah. On November 23, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court denied a motion to amend a Relief from Stay Order where Seniah requested an opportunity to file a plan of reorganization that would allow Seniah to protect the property subject to the foreclosure action. On August 15, 2011, the property subject to foreclosure\n   was sold at Sheriff's Sale for allegedly a fraction of its lowest appraised value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The foreclosure action concluded on September 16, 2011. The bankruptcy case closed on November 22, 2011. The attorney-client relationship between Keating and Seniah ended no later than November 22, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Initiation of Legal Malpractice Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 24, 2012, Seniah contacted Keating by letter to advise him of Seniah's potential claim for legal malpractice. The letter asked Keating to arrange for Seniah's representative to take possession of the file and to schedule a time for a meeting to discuss the matter. Keating gave the letter to Susan Rodgers, general counsel for Buckingham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 6, 2012, Rodgers sent Seniah a letter identifying herself as general counsel for Buckingham and indicating she was in receipt of Seniah's July 24, 2012 letter. Rodgers stated that \"we are investigating the matter and will be contacting [Seniah] shortly to discuss the firm's position.\" Rodgers did not state in the letter that she did not represent Keating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Rodgers, Keating, and Seniah met on September 21, 2012 to discuss Seniah's claim of legal malpractice. Rodgers did not state at the meeting that she represented only Buckingham's interests. The parties did not reach a settlement at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Seniah was concerned about the expiration of the statute of limitations on November 22, 2012. Rodgers drafted a Tolling Agreement to extend the statute of limitations. Keating was not involved in the drafting of the Tolling Agreement. The Tolling Agreement states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   This Tolling Agreement (\"Tolling Agreement\") is entered into effective October 3, 2012 between and among Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP (\"BDB\"), an Ohio limited liability partnership, and William K. Haines, Jr. (\"Haines\") and Seniah Corp. (\"Corporation\") * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Seniah Parties claim that certain legal services were not properly rendered by BDB in relation to the handling of the Seniah Corp. Bankruptcy Case * * * resulting in a potential malpractice claim (\"Potential Claim\"); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   BDB denies any basis for any Potential Claim and further denies that it performed services for Haines as a client in relation to the Potential Claim; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   BDB and the Seniah Parties desire to pursue a potential resolution of the Potential Claim, without prejudicing the Seniah Parties' right to bring claims against BDB due to the passage of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. The parties are entering into this Agreement for the purpose of preserving the status quo as of October 3, 2012 with respect to any applicable statute(s) of limitations and other time-related defenses relating to or arising from any applicable law on which the Potential Claim is/or may be based.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. The parties agree that as of October 3, 2012, the running of any statute(s) of limitations with respect to any and all possible causes of action and claims which the Seniah Parties may have against BDB with respect to the Potential Claim is tolled and suspended until this Agreement is terminated as set forth in Section 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   7. * * * This Agreement will terminate the earlier of January 31, 2013 * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   8. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the tolling of any statute(s) of limitations, the equitable doctrine of\n   laches, and the waiver of claims and defenses related to the passage of time with respect to the Potential Claim. No modifications or amendments to this Agreement are effective unless they are set forth in writing and signed by all of the parties. * * * This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of each party, as well as their heirs, successors, assigns, shareholders, members, officers, directors, agents, or insurers, as these terms are applicable. * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   9. Each party represents and warrants that the individuals whose signatures appear below is duly authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of their respective party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Tolling Agreement was signed by Seniah's counsel on behalf of William K. Haines, Jr. and Seniah Corp. Rodgers signed the Tolling Agreement as general counsel on behalf of Buckingham. Keating did not sign the Tolling Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Seniah and Rodgers met again on October 15, 2012. Keating was not present at the meeting. Seniah and Rodgers did not reach a settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Seniah and Rodgers participated in a private mediation on January 11, 2013. Keating was not present at the mediation. The matter was not settled at mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Malpractice Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On February 19, 2013, Seniah filed a complaint in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas naming Buckingham, Keating, and Joshua Berger, an attorney with Buckingham, as Defendants. The complaint alleged Keating and Berger committed legal malpractice relating to their representation of Seniah during a foreclosure action and a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceeding. The complaint sought to hold Keating and Berger liable in their individual capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Buckingham filed an answer to the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Keating and Berger filed a Motion to Dismiss on April 26, 2013. The motion to dismiss argued that pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), Seniah could prove no set of facts entitling it to relief because the applicable statute of limitations for a legal malpractice expired prior to the filing of the complaint. Keating and Berger noted Seniah filed its complaint for legal malpractice on February 19, 2013. They argued the complaint stated two cognizable events whereby Seniah could have discovered the legal malpractice. Those events, however, were beyond the one-year statute of limitations. Keating and Berger also argued Seniah could not rely upon the termination of the attorney-client relationship to determine the statute of limitations because the complaint failed to state any facts as to the attorney-client relationship termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On May 13, 2013, Seniah filed a \"Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint, Instanter.\" In support of its opposition to the motion to dismiss, Seniah argued the complaint was timely filed based on a Tolling Agreement entered into between Seniah and Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP on October 3, 2012. Seniah attached the Tolling Agreement to the May 13, 2013 motion as Exhibit A. Seniah also attached correspondence between the parties as exhibits to further support its opposition to the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On June 4, 2013, the trial court issued its judgment entry granting the motion to dismiss. In its judgment entry, the trial court agreed with the argument of Keating and Berger that the complaint was filed outside of the one-year statute of limitations. The trial court referred to the factual allegations in the complaint to find\n   Seniah could prove no set of facts warranting recovery. The trial court further found the Tolling Agreement did not serve to extend the statute of limitations for filing the legal malpractice complaint. The trial court found the Tolling Agreement was not signed by Keating or Berger and therefore was not binding upon those parties per the language of the Tolling Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 17} After the ruling, Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Seniah filed a motion for relief from judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Seniah dismissed Berger as a party-defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On December 19, 2013, the trial court denied Seniah's motion for relief from judgment. The trial court also granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP via judgment entry on January 13, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Seniah appealed the June 4, 2013 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas to this Court in\n   <em>\n    Seniah Corp. v. Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA00013,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-4370\">\n    2014-Ohio-4370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204907444\">\n    2014 WL 4907444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Seniah I\n   </em>\n   \"). In its appeal, Seniah argued the trial court erred in granting the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss. We agreed the trial court erred when it granted the motion to dismiss because the trial court considered evidence and materials outside the four corners of the complaint to reach its decision to grant the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18-19. We held that in order to consider matters outside the complaint, the trial court should have converted the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) to a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. We reversed the trial court's June 4, 2013 judgment entry granting the motion to dismiss and remanded the matter for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Upon remand, Keating filed a motion for summary judgment on January 12, 2015. Seniah filed a notice of dismissal on January 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On April 15, 2015, Seniah refiled its complaint naming Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP and Keating as defendants. Buckingham and Keating filed answers to the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On August 10, 2015, Keating filed a motion for summary judgment. Keating's sole argument in the motion for summary judgment was that Seniah's claim for legal malpractice was time-barred by the statute of limitations. Pursuant to the trial court's pre-trial order, Seniah's response was due on September 7, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Seniah did not file a response to the motion for summary judgment by September 7, 2015. On September 16, 2015, the trial court issued its judgment entry finding there were no genuine issues of material fact and Keating was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The judgment entry did not dispose of all pending claims. Seniah's claims against Buckingham were still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Seniah filed a motion for relief from judgment arguing its failure to answer was due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On October 28, 2015, Buckingham filed a motion for summary judgment. Buckingham argued Seniah's claims against Buckingham were barred by res judicata and the law of the case based on Seniah's failure to appeal the trial court's January 2014 judgment entry granting Buckingham's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The trial court denied Seniah's motion for relief from judgment on December 7, 2015. The trial court found Seniah failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits because it failed to identify an\n   expert to support its claim for legal malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The trial court granted Buckingham's motion for summary judgment on January 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Seniah appealed the December 7, 2015 judgment entry in\n   <em>\n    Seniah Corp. v. Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Stark No. 2016CA00039,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7516\">\n    2016-Ohio-7516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206392897\">\n    2016 WL 6392897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Seniah II\n   </em>\n   \"). Seniah argued the trial court erred by denying its motion for relief from judgment. In\n   <em>\n    Seniah II\n   </em>\n   , we held the September 16, 2015 judgment entry was not a final order, therefore Civ.R. 60(B) was not the proper procedural mechanism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Seniah's motion should have been considered a motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We reviewed the motion and found the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the motion. Keating argued in his motion for summary judgment that Seniah's claim for legal malpractice was barred by the statute of limitations, but did not address the substantive merits of Seniah's claim. The trial court found Seniah was not entitled to reconsideration because Seniah could not present a meritorious claim or defense on the basis that Seniah did not identify an expert witness to support its claim for legal malpractice. We held only the issue of the statute of limitations was before the trial court, not the merits of the legal malpractice claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Accordingly, we reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Upon remand, Keating filed his motion for summary judgment with the trial court on November 18, 2016. He renewed his argument that the statute of limitations on Seniah's claim had expired. Seniah responded to the motion and Keating replied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 31} On June 8, 2017, the trial court granted Keating's motion for summary judgment. The trial court first determined the date Seniah's claim for legal malpractice accrued was not based on the termination of the attorney-client relationship, but on two cognizable events that occurred no later than October 2011. Seniah filed its original complaint against Keating on February 19, 2013. Pursuant to R.C. 2305.11(A), the trial court determined Seniah's claim for legal malpractice occurred outside of the one-year statute of limitations. The trial court next examined whether the Tolling Agreement worked to toll the statute of limitations as to its claims against Keating. The trial court determined Keating was not a party to the Tolling Agreement and did not sign it. The language of the Tolling Agreement stated it applied to the signatories only: William Haines, Seniah, and Buckingham. Finally, the deposition testimony of Rodgers and Keating demonstrated Keating never authorized Rodgers to sign the Tolling Agreement on his behalf and Rodgers did not have authority to bind members of Buckingham in their individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} It is from this judgment Seniah now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Seniah raises one Assignment of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 34} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY GRANTING APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Seniah argues in its sole Assignment of Error that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of Keating. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary Judgment Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} We refer to Civ.R. 56(C) in reviewing a motion for summary judgment which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleading, depositions,\n   answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party's favor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record before the trial court, which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party's claim.\n   <em>\n    Dresher v.

The former client brought an action for legal malpractice against an attorney working for the law firm. The tolling agreement named the former client and law firm, but did not name the attorney. The First District held the clear terms of the tolling agreement did not toll the statute of limitations against the attorney because he was not named in the agreement and did not sign the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The plain language of the Tolling Agreement at issue herein states there was an agreement between \"Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP (\"BDB\"), an Ohio limited liability partnership, and William K. Haines, Jr. (\"Haines\") and Seniah Corp. (\"Corporation\").\" Keating was not named in the agreement and he did not\n   sign the agreement. If this Court applies\n   <em>\n    Taft\n   </em>\n   to these facts, there is no genuine issue of material fact that the plain language of the Tolling Agreement does not toll the statute of limitations against Keating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Seniah responds that while Keating is not named in the Tolling Agreement and did not sign the Tolling Agreement, the plain language of the Tolling Agreement still binds Keating. The Tolling Agreement states, \"This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of each party, as well as their heirs, successors, assigns, shareholders, members, officers, directors, agents, or insurers, as these terms are applicable.\" Keating is a shareholder of Buckingham. Seniah states that as a shareholder, Keating is bound by the plain terms of the Tolling Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The purpose of the Tolling Agreement is to invalidate the legal defense of statute of limitations if Seniah filed a lawsuit after the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Tolling Agreement was necessary to prevent Buckingham, or anyone acting on Buckingham's behalf, from seeking to defend against Seniah's claims on the basis of the statute of limitations. The Tolling Agreement states, \"This Agreement\n   <em>\n    is binding upon and inures to the benefit of each party\n   </em>\n   , * * *.\" (Emphasis added). The parties to the Tolling Agreement are, \"Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, LLP (\"BDB\"), an Ohio limited liability partnership, and William K. Haines, Jr. (\"Haines\") and Seniah Corp. (\"Corporation\") * * *.\" In her deposition, Rodgers testified she signed the Tolling Agreement on behalf of Buckingham. (Depo. 37). The term of the agreement, \"heirs, successors, assigns, shareholders, members, officers, directors, agents, or insurers\", therefore refers to anyone acting on behalf of one of the parties and precludes anyone from acting on the parties' behalf from seeking to avoid the legal effect of the Tolling Agreement. Seniah named Buckingham and Keating as defendants in its lawsuit for legal malpractice. Seniah sued Keating in his individual capacity. There are currently no pending claims against Buckingham; Keating is the remaining defendant. Keating is not seeking to defend against Seniah's claims as a shareholder on behalf of Buckingham. He is seeking to defend Seniah's claims against him in his individual capacity. Therefore, Keating does not fall within the group of \"heirs, successors, assigns, shareholders, members, officers, directors, agents, or insurers\" intended to be bound by the Tolling Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Resolution Trust Corp. v.

On July 24, 2012, Seniah contacted Keating by letter to advise him of Seniah's potential claim for legal malpractice. Keating gave the letter to Rodgers. Rodgers responded to the letter, stating she represented Buckingham. Seniah states Rodgers's act of responding to Seniah's letter sent to Keating demonstrates Keating gave Rodgers express authority to act on his behalf. Keating did not independently respond to Seniah's letter. Rodgers further demonstrated she represented Keating's interests by attending meetings and mediation with Seniah. Seniah states Rodgers therefore had express authority to execute the Tolling Agreement on behalf of Keating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Keating testified in his deposition that he did not give Rodgers express authority to act upon his behalf. Keating agreed he did not individually respond to Seniah's letter, but he did not ask Rodgers to respond to the letter. (Depo. 13, 16). Keating gave the letter to Rodgers because Seniah asked for its case file, which was the property of Buckingham. Rodgers's letter to Seniah stated she was general counsel for Buckingham and she wished to discuss the \"firm's position\" with Seniah. Keating attended a meeting with Seniah and Rodgers to discuss Seniah's alleged claims. (Depo. 34). Keating states at the meeting he was representing himself. (Depo. 19). Keating testified that Seniah never asked if he was represented by counsel. (Depo. 19). Keating denied having anything to do with the drafting or execution of the Tolling Agreement. (Depo. 28). He did not sign the Tolling Agreement or approve the Tolling Agreement. After Seniah filed its lawsuit and sued Keating in his individual capacity, Keating retained counsel. (Depo. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Based on the Civ.R. 56 evidence, we find that reasonable minds can only conclude there was no express or implied agency relationship between Keating and Buckingham as to the Tolling Agreement. Seniah had a potential claim for legal malpractice against Keating individually. Seniah never asked if Keating was represented by Rodgers. Keating and Rodgers never stated to Seniah that Rodgers represented Keating. In Rodgers's response, she stated she was contacting Seniah to discuss the law firm's position. Seniah cannot rely upon the October 15, 2012 meeting with Rodgers or the January 11, 2013 private mediation with Rodgers to support its claim for express authority because those events occurred after the execution of the Tolling Agreement on October 3, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 55} If express or implied agency does not exist, Seniah next argues that Rodgers had apparent authority to bind\n   Keating to the Tolling Agreement. Apparent agency exists \"where one who is assuming to act as an agent for a party in the making of a contract but in fact has no actual authority to do so, such party will nonetheless be bound by the contract 'if such party has by his words or conduct, reasonably interpreted, caused the other party to the contract to believe that the one assuming to act as agent had the necessary authority to make the contract.' \"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

There is no testimony that Keating was present when Rodgers or Seniah signed the Tolling Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The second prong of the apparent authority analysis requires Seniah to prove that it, acting in good faith, had reason to believe that Rodgers possessed the authority to bind Keating to the terms of the Tolling Agreement. Seniah relies on the events that occurred prior to the drafting of the Tolling Agreement to demonstrate that it had a good faith reason to believe that Rodgers possessed the authority to bind Keating to the terms of the Tolling Agreement. It states that because Rodgers responded to the letter regarding a possible claim for legal malpractice that it sent to Keating, Seniah believed Rodgers possessed the authority to bind Keating to the Tolling Agreement. Seniah claims its belief that Rodgers had authority to bind Keating to the Tolling Agreement was further reinforced because Rodgers appeared at a meeting to discuss Seniah's potential claims. Keating also appeared at the meeting. A second meeting and a mediation occurred after the execution of the Tolling Agreement, but these\n   events cannot be used to support Seniah's claim it believed Rodgers had the authority to bind Keating to the Tolling Agreement because the events occurred after its execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Reviewing these facts in a light most favorable to Seniah, we cannot find Seniah met its burden to establish these two events were a basis for a good faith belief that Rodgers had the authority to bind Keating to the Tolling Agreement. We do not find Rodgers's letter that stated she wished to discuss Buckingham's position and her attendance at a meeting where Keating also appeared cloaked Rodgers with apparent authority to bind Keating to the Tolling Agreement. Seniah failed to meet its burden to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that Rodgers had apparent authority to bind Keating to the Tolling Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    Ratification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Seniah claims if Rodgers lacked apparent authority to enter into the Tolling Agreement on behalf of Keating, Keating ratified the Tolling Agreement.

However, if the doctrine of equitable estoppel were to be applied as broadly as plaintiffs suggest, the statute of limitations would rarely be available as a defense.

There is no evidence that Keating made a factual misrepresentation to Seniah to change its position as whether to sue Keating for legal malpractice. The terms of the Tolling Agreement allowed Seniah to terminate the Tolling Agreement with 30 days advance notice. Even if the Tolling Agreement applied to Keating, Seniah could have brought suit against Keating at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Upon our de novo review, we find reasonable minds could only conclude that under the plain language of the Tolling Agreement and/or under the theories of agency, ratification, and equitable estoppel, the Tolling Agreement did not apply to Keating.
