Upon thorough review of the record and applicable law, we reverse the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Procedural and Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In June 2009, Passafiume was charged with aggravated theft and theft in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-09-525815 and tampering with evidence, drug possession, and possessing criminal tools in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-09-529125. On November 17, 2009, he pleaded guilty to aggravated theft as charged in the indictment in Case No. CR-09-525815 and attempted tampering with evidence and drug possession in Case No. CR-09-529125.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to entering his guilty pleas, the court engaged in a full colloquy with Passafiume and advised him of the constitutional rights he was waiving. The court also advised Passafiume, as a noncitizen of the United States, \"[Y]ou're hereby advised that conviction of the offenses to which you're pleading guilty may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\" When asked if he understood, Passafiume replied, \"Yes, your Honor.\" The court then found Passafiume's pleas to be knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered, and it found him guilty accordingly. The court sentenced Passafiume to five years of community control sanctions. The court also suspended Passafiume's driving privileges for five years and ordered Passafiume to pay court costs in both cases and restitution of $595 in Case No. CR-09-525815. Thereafter, in August 2012, upon the probation officer's\n   request, Passafiume's community control sanctions were terminated early. He did not appeal from his sentence or convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 20, 2016, approximately seven years after entering his guilty pleas, Passafiume filed a Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw guilty plea (in both lower court cases), claiming that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel prior to entering his November 2009 guilty pleas. In support, he argued that his attorney failed to advise him that his pleas would result in deportation. While acknowledging in an affidavit attached to his motions that the trial court \"mention[ed] something about [immigration consequences],\" he contended he was \"nervous * * * and did not think I would get deported as a result of the conviction since my attorney never mentioned anything about it.\" Passafiume stated that he was placed in removal proceedings in October 2016, he is subject to mandatory detention, and he had been in deportation proceedings previously but had received a waiver that allowed him to remain in the United States. He also contends that trial counsel failed to properly investigate his defenses and pressured him into pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The state opposed Passafiume's motions, stating that Passafiume has failed to demonstrate a manifest injustice. In support, the state provided that Passafiume cannot establish ineffective assistance of counsel because (1) counsel was not deficient-counsel was not required by the law at the time of Passafiume's conviction to advise him of deportation consequences, and there is no evidence, other than a self-serving affidavit, that defense counsel's performance otherwise fell below the standard of care; and (2) Passafiume cannot demonstrate prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On February 3, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on Passafiume's motions. During the hearing, Passafiume provided that he is a citizen of Italy and he came to the United States with his family in 1959 as an infant, and he has been a permanent resident of the United States. When he was a child, he and his family moved from New York City to Cleveland, and he has lived in Cleveland ever since. He stated that he could have become a United States citizen, but he \"never thought about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Passafiume testified concerning the underlying offenses. He stated that he was an innocent bystander who was unaware that an acquaintance of his whom he had driven to Walmart, the codefendant in Case No. CR-09-525815, had stolen a computer from the store. Passafiume also stated that he was an innocent bystander in Case No. CR-09-529125, where the police discovered drugs in the car he was driving. He contends that the drugs were discovered on the passenger seat where his friend, the codefendant in that case, had been seated prior to the police removing the friend from the vehicle. Passafiume testified that he explained all the above to his trial counsel, yet counsel advised him to plead no contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Passafiume testified that his prior attorney never advised him of any deportation consequences should he be convicted. He stated that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known he would be placed in mandatory detention and immigration proceedings, explaining that his entire family is in the United States and he has \"no life\" in Italy. Passafiume also explained that during the plea hearing, he did not fully understand when the court advised him about deportation consequences because he was \"taking a lot of pain meds and stuff like that.\" He conceded that he \"should have thought about the situation a little more, knowing that I was innocent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Passafiume also testified that in October 2016, he went to Cleveland Municipal Court to pay a fine on an OVI case for which he had served six months community control sanctions, and he was detained by immigration officials. He stated on cross-examination that he had been in deportation proceedings previously but received a waiver that allowed him to stay in the United States. He explained that, while he was ill, immigration officials had come to his home in 2004 for a petty theft charge. The supervisor \"let him be,\" however, because he was ill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After the hearing, the trial court issued one written ruling on Passafiume's motions to withdraw his guilty pleas. The court determined that\n   <em>\n    Padilla v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), applied retroactively, and applying its \"equity powers,\" it granted the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The state now appeals the court's decision, assigning the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I.

Assuming, arguendo, that\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   is retroactive, the trial court abused its discretion when it applied the wrong legal standard in granting Appellee's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Law and Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The state of Ohio contends on appeal that the trial court erred when it granted the appellee's motions to withdraw his November 2009 guilty pleas. In support, it argues that Passafiume has not demonstrated his trial counsel was ineffective because (1) trial counsel was not required to advise Passafiume of deportation consequences, and therefore, counsel's performance was not deficient; and (2) Passafiume cannot establish prejudice. The state also argues that the trial court failed to apply the correct legal standard in granting Passafiume's motions to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Motions to withdraw guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 32.1. Under this rule, \"[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" Crim.R. 32.1. A defendant who seeks to withdraw a plea of guilty after the imposition of sentence has the burden of establishing the existence of manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the court inquired whether any threats or promises had been made to induce him to plead, Passafiume replied, \"No, your Honor.\" When the court asked Passafiume if he was satisfied with trial counsel's representation, he replied, \"Yes.\" Passafiume also advised the court that he was not under the influence of any alcohol or narcotics or any \"medication that affects [his] judgment.\" When the court asked Passafiume if he \"underst[ood] what we're doing here today,\" he replied, \"Yes, I do, your Honor.\" Upon learning that Passafiume was a noncitizen of the United States, the court advised him that conviction of his offenses may have \"consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\" Passafiume advised the court that he understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Furthermore, in addressing the court at sentencing, counsel stated that Passafiume was in a drug treatment program since October 2009 and she addressed the issues in the presentence investigation report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Passafiume had a bout with drug use again having relapsed. He got himself back into the [drug treatment] program at the Keating Center. He was residing there, doing well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   * * * [B]ased on his medical conditions, [the Keating Center] no longer wanted him to reside in the program but that he is still participating in the program on an outpatient basis as well as going to all of his meetings, etc. * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   He is doing everything that he needs to do in order to maintain his sobriety. He has at all times been very upset about the fact that he found himself in a situation with drugs again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   As far as the theft case is concerned, your Honor, basically, Mr. Passafiume went to the store with a friend of his * * * who went to go buy a computer. It turned out that they were going to try and use their dead father's credit card,\n   etc., but [he] ended up walking out without paying for it at all, and Mr. Passafiume was in the car waiting for them. That person has since moved to Florida and we were un[able] to locate [him], and therefore, he took responsibility for the computer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Your Honor, basically, Mr. Passafiume has started himself on the road to recovery. He's done everything necessary, even prior to pleading in these cases, and I would just ask that the court give him an opportunity for community control sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} When asked if Passafiume had anything to say, he responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [A]s far as the theft case, your Honor, I know that I did wrong. And the officer that took my statement, they said the reason why they had charges is because I said I was taking money. After he got rid of the computer I meant he was paying me out of his own pocket. * * * I had no clue that he was stealing the computer. But I wanted to just get it over with, and I'll take responsibility and pay for it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 32} A fair reading of the record belies Passafiume's assertions that trial counsel failed to investigate his defenses, that he was dissatisfied with counsel, or that trial counsel pressured him into pleading guilty. Passafiume has therefore not demonstrated that trial counsel's representation was deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In its order granting Passafiume's motions to withdraw, the trial court essentially decried the unfairness of Passafiume's present situation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   This defendant has, for all intents and purposes, been a citizen of the United States for all but 13 months of his life. He has been a working person, who presumably has paid taxes over his lifetime and is now receiving social security benefits. He has no connection with Italy other than the fact that he was born there. The crimes at issue were not crimes of violence and * * * he could easily have presented [a defense].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 34} We note, however, that Passafiume bears the burden of demonstrating manifest injustice in the plea proceeding.\n   <em>\n    State v. Sneed\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80902,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-6502\">\n    2002-Ohio-6502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031667630\">\n    2002 WL 31667630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13 (a manifest injustice is \"an extraordinary and fundamental flaw in the plea proceeding\"). The manifest injustice \"relates to some fundamental flaw in the proceedings which result in a miscarriage of justice or is inconsistent with the demands of due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

And where, as in this case, the defendant claims his trial counsel was ineffective at the time he entered his plea, he bears the burden of showing that counsel's performance led to a manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    Bankston\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92777,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-1576\">\n    2010-Ohio-1576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 35} As we discussed previously, Passafiume's trial counsel was not obligated to advise Passafiume of immigration consequences resulting from his guilty pleas. Rather, the law at the time he entered his plea imposed a duty upon the trial court, and the trial court did in fact provide the advisement. Additionally, Passafiume told the court that he understood the court's advisement. In all other respects, the record reflects the trial judge engaged in a comprehensive Crim.R. 11 colloquy and Passafiume entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily. Passafiume has therefore not demonstrated that counsel's performance surrounding the plea hearing led to a manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Furthermore, we note that Passafiume had notice of potential immigration issues several years prior to pleading guilty in November 2009. The record shows that Passafiume had been in deportation proceedings in 2004, presumably\n   due to his earlier convictions, but received a waiver that allowed him to stay in the United States. On cross-examination, Passafiume explained what happened:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Passafiume: What they did, they didn't detain me, they came to my house. I was sick * * * and the immigration officer just called his supervisor and said that he was sick, so just let him be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Prosecutor: So this was in 2004, and I'm sure when you got that call there was a chance that you might be deported, I'm sure that you were worried about it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Passafiume: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Prosecutor: So that was something that was on your mind?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Passafiume: Yes. And I didn't commit any crimes until those stupid things with those guys, I was fine. As long as you don't get into no trouble, everything is fine. And I did not do anything until that happened with those idiots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Thus, the record demonstrates that prior to entering his guilty plea in November 2009, Passafiume understood, to some degree, that his legal troubles were threatening his ability to remain in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Huang\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

We therefore sustain the assignments of error, reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   MELODY J.
