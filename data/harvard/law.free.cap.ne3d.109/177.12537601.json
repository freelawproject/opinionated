Blain's alleged that defendant-appellee DANE Contractors, Inc., who had been hired to perform repair and restoration, failed to install a separate, dedicated power source for a newly installed cutting machine, causing the machine to experience power surges. It brought this breach of contract and negligence action against DANE,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that delays in installing a separate power source caused it to lose a three-year job worth $350,000 per year. DANE filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Blain's could not recover future lost profits on a contract that violated the statute of frauds and that the claimed lost profits were too remote or speculative. The court granted summary judgment without opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

Bell alleged that the defendant, Whitten, made certain statements to the buyer and third party, causing them to decide not to purchase the property. Bell filed an action alleging that Whitten toritously interfered with his contractual relationship.

A contract that is not within the statute of frauds is not a void or illegal contract, nor is there any public policy against its performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Keeton, Dobbs, Keeton &amp; Owen,\n   <em>\n    Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   , Section 129, 932 (5th Ed.1984) (\"The law of course does not object to the voluntary performance of agreements merely because it will not enforce them, and it indulges in the assumption that even unenforceable promises will be carried out if no third person interferes.\").

Blain's maintained that a contract did exist and that lost profits were ascertainable to a reasonable degree of certainty as shown by its expert who calculated lost profits based on the anticipated revenue to be generated from AGS's and Blain's historical profit margin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In general, contract damages should place the nonbreaching party in the position it would have been in had the breaching party fully performed under the contract.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Blain's maintained that the project would last three years, with the specific work to be completed in several bindery jobs over the time period. But what Blain's described as \"its\" project was, in fact, a project that belonged to AGS, not to Blain's. AGS pieced out several jobs to Blain's, all of which Blain's concedes were separately quoted and billed. AGS made it clear that it \"did not have a three-year contract or any type of contract\" with Blain's on the project. This was because AGS had made the decision, even before the events giving rise to this case, to purchase equipment that would allow it to do in-house the jobs that Blain's was performing for it. It was for this reason that AGS denied that it had any contract with Blain's, much less one that ran for three years. Blain's evidence shows only that it had the hope of bidding on AGS's business for the next three years. That hope did not establish that any contract existed between it and AGS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The record also does not disclose any contract between Blain's and DANE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Blain's did not attach a copy of its contract with AGS to its complaint. \"When any claim or defense is founded on an account or other written instrument, a copy of the account or written instrument must be attached to the pleading. If the account or written instrument is not attached, the reason for the omission must be stated in the pleading.\" Civ.R. 10(D). In fact, the complaint alleged that DANE had been hired by Cincinnati Insurance, Blain's insurer: \"Defendant DANE was retained and/or recommended and/or approved by Defendant Cincinnati.\" Blain's manager of operations reaffirmed that Blain's did not hire DANE when he averred that \"Cincinnati Insurance retained and recommended the services of Defendant DANE Contractors, Inc. (\"Dane\") to act as the general contractor.\" Affidavit of Edward Blain at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} It may be that Blain's was a third-party beneficiary of DANE's contract with Cincinnati Insurance. However, it had to establish its status as a third-party beneficiary by providing evidence on that point.\n   <em>\n    Campbell Oil Co. v. Shepperson\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

In other words, 69% of marginal revenues, on average, are used to cover variable and mixed overhead.\" Assuming annual revenues of between $350,000 and $380,000, the expert concluded that Blain's would have realized profits of between $327,600 and $355,680 on business provided by AGS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The expert's calculations were based on Blain's general business revenues and were not specific to work done for AGS. The evidence showed that Blain's did work for other clients that differed from the specific tasks that it performed for AGS. And even if the tasks were the same, it is reasonable to think that Blain's would price jobs differently based on the individual customer. The expert's failure to render an opinion based solely on work performed for AGS meant that he rendered an opinion that was too general to meet the reasonable degree of certainty standard for proving contract damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Finally, Blain's argues that regardless of whether it adequately proved lost profit with respect to AGS, it had claims for other lost business. We can summarily reject this argument because Blain's failed to offer any evidence of what those lost profits might be-its expert only gave an opinion with respect to lost profit from AGS. Since the claims based on a breach of contract only sought lost profits as damages, Blain's had to prove the loss.\n   <em>\n    Endersby v.
