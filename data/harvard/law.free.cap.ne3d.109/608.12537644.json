GALLAGHER, A.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Petitioners-appellants Reverend Kyle Earley, Reverend Larry Howard and Michelle Kinney (collectively \"appellants\") appeal the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas denying their petition for release of selected portions of the transcripts and exhibits from the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury proceedings relating to the investigation of the November 22, 2014 shooting death of Tamir Rice. Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellants' petition. Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 31, 2017, appellants filed a petition seeking the release of all grand jury transcripts and exhibits related to the investigation into the death of Tamir Rice. On February 9, 2017, they filed an amended petition limiting their request to the release of the following grand jury materials related to the Tamir Rice case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) all exhibits, including but not limited to diagrams, charts and photographs,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) all written statements submitted to or considered by the Grand Jury,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) all expert reports submitted to or considered by the Grand Jury,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (4) the testimony of experts who testified before the Grand Jury,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (5) all law enforcement reports submitted to or considered by the Grand Jury, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (6) transcripts of all special instructions and arguments provided to the Grand Jury by the Prosecuting Attorneys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellants are three individual citizens who are active members of the Cleveland Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (\"NAACP\"). They have no legal interest in the Tamir Rice matter other than as concerned citizens and as representatives of the NAACP. In their amended petition, appellants asserted that the release of the requested grand jury materials \"is of great public interest and will enhance the public's knowledge and understanding of the\n   methods by which this particular Grand Jury conducted its investigation and reached its decision.\" Appellants further asserted that given the former prosecuting attorney's prior \"selective release\" of information relating to the grand jury proceedings, including the identity of certain witnesses who testified before the grand jury and the release of certain expert reports and data related to the investigation, releasing the requested grand jury materials \"would serve the ends of justice based on the NAACP's and the general public's particularized need for disclosure which outweighs the need for secrecy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The state filed a response indicating that it had no objection to a \"limited release\" of the portion of the grand jury transcripts containing \"the prosecutors' legal instructions and voting instructions\" given the \"compelling public interests unique to this case\" and the existence of \"a legitimate public concern * * * concerning the manner in which the grand jury receive[d] legal instruction and voted on the issues in the case.\" However, the state opposed the release of the other grand jury materials appellants requested. The state further indicated that its response \"should not be viewed as precedent and is instead tailored to the specific, unique facts of the case at bar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 27, 2017, the trial court denied appellants' petition, concluding that disclosure of the requested grand jury transcripts and exhibits was not authorized under Ohio law. As the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The shooting death of Tamir Rice has received an enormous amount of media coverage. There have been vigils and community protests demonstrating strong public interest in the particulars of the investigation. However, this alone is insufficient grounds to set aside the dictates of Criminal Rule 6(E) or to allow for an exception which would persuade this court to grant the petition. Petitioners have failed to show a particularized need for the transcripts. To grant the petition would erode the plain language of Criminal Rule 6(E). Furthermore, the investigation into Tamir Rice's death only concluded four months ago and * * * disciplinary proceedings are presently underway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This court recognizes Petitioners' well-intentioned request. However, based on an analysis of Criminal Rule 6(E), the limited precedent available and the reasons set forth in the foregoing opinion, the petition must be denied. To do otherwise would eviscerate the historical practice of guarding the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. Release herein could set precedent whereby eventually any entity for almost any reason could be granted release of grand jury transcripts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellants appealed the trial court's decision, raising two assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Assignment of Error I:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The court that oversees the grand jury proceedings possesses the authority to release transcripts and exhibits related to those proceedings notwithstanding Criminal Rule 6(E)'s secrecy provisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Assignment of Error II:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In light of the unique facts surrounding this case, the irregularities reflected in the grand jury proceeding itself, and the interests of justice that transparency would serve, the court should have granted the requested release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 6} When considering the issues raised by this appeal, we are mindful of the deference we must give to the trial court's decision in this case.

The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states, in relevant part: \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10. The function of a grand jury is to inquire whether sufficient evidence exists to put an individual on trial for alleged criminal conduct, but it also serves as a shield against unfounded and oppressive prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Ohio Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 9} R.C. Chapter 2939 and Crim.R. 6 govern grand jury proceedings in Ohio. Once a grand jury is impaneled, the common pleas court administers an oath that requires the grand jurors to swear or affirm, among other things, that they will \"diligently inquire into and carefully deliberate all matters that shall come to [their] attention,\" that they \"will keep secret all proceedings of the grand jury unless [they] are required in a court of justice to make disclosure,\" that they \"will indict no person\n   through malice, hatred, or ill will,\" that they \"will not leave unindicted any person through fear, favor, or affection, or for any reward or hope thereof\" and that \"in * * * deliberations [they] will present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, according to the best of [their] skill and understanding * * *.\" R.C. 2939.06(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2939.07 (\"The grand jurors, after being sworn, shall be charged as to their duty by the judge of the court of common pleas, who shall call their attention particularly to the obligation of secrecy which their oaths impose, and explain to them the law applicable to such matters as may be brought before them.\"). The secrecy of the grand jury is crucial. Although the prosecuting attorney or an assistant prosecuting attorney may appear before the grand jury to interrogate witnesses, \"to give information relative to a matter cognizable by it\" or to give \"advice upon a legal matter when required,\" no person other than the grand jurors may remain in the room while the grand jurors are expressing their views or voting on the matters before them.

It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Deliberations of the grand jury and the vote of any grand juror shall not be disclosed. Disclosure of other matters occurring before the grand jury may be made to the prosecuting attorney for use in the performance of his duties. A grand juror, prosecuting attorney, interpreter, stenographer, operator of a recording device, or typist who transcribes recorded testimony, may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury, other than the deliberations of a grand jury or the vote of a grand juror, but may disclose such matters only when so directed by the court preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding, or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury. No grand juror, officer of the court, or other person shall disclose that an indictment has been found against a person before such indictment is filed and the case docketed. The court may direct that an indictment shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pursuant to Rule 46. In that event the clerk shall seal the indictment, the indictment shall not be docketed by name until after the apprehension of the accused, and no person shall disclose the finding of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance of a warrant or summons.

The interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings is not eliminated when an investigation has ended because disclosure could affect the functioning of future grand juries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Every matter that is brought before the citizens of this county who have\n   been entrusted by their fellow citizens to serve as grand jurors is important to someone. In each such case, there are individuals who are obviously interested in the outcome, including the accused or someone who has been in some manner aggrieved, e.g., a victim. Few cases have incited such community outrage as that surrounding the shooting death of Tamir Rice. The fact that the office of the former prosecuting attorney disseminated selected portions of the evidence presented to the grand jury under the guise of \"transparency\" was inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Nevertheless, appellants have not shown that they are entitled to the grand jury materials they seek under Ohio law. Appellant's request for disclosure is not for use \"preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding\" or for any other purpose for which disclosure is authorized under Crim.R. 6(E). Further, appellants have made no showing of a \"particularized need\" for this information that outweighs the need for secrecy of the grand jury proceedings. There is no Ohio case law or other authority that supports the release of grand jury transcripts and exhibits to persons who are merely interested in the proceedings. Grand jury proceedings are secret and are not be disclosed to the public to satisfy its curiosity regarding what occurred during those proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In this case, the record shows that the trial court carefully considered appellants' petition and the state's response. In a thoughtful, well-reasoned opinion, the trial court concluded that there was no basis under Ohio law for disclosure of the requested grand jury materials to the appellants. We cannot say that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or unconscionably in denying the appellants' petition. Accordingly, we overrule the appellants' assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   MARY J. BOYLE, J., and EILEEN T.

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the petition based upon the historical significance of the Remington case, extensive prior litigation regarding alleged improprieties in the grand jury proceedings, extensive previous disclosures of portions of the grand jury transcripts and the fact that the events underlying the grand jury investigation had occurred more than 35 years prior and the principals were all, but for Remington's former wife (who had already been interviewed by May), dead.\n    <em>\n     May\n    </em>\n    at 2199.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The court noted that although May's petition did not fall \"within the legislatively defined exceptions of Fed.
