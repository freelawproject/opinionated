This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The victims in this case are a married couple who reside in a single-family home in Richfield. On the morning of September 14, 2016, someone burglarized their home while they were at work. The wife homeowner discovered the break-in when she came home at lunchtime to care for their dogs. Video surveillance taken from the home, in conjunction with further investigation, led to the police identifying Mr. Lehman as the perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A grand jury indicted Mr. Lehman on a single count of burglary, in violation of R.C. 2911.12(A)(2). Mr. Lehman waived his right to a jury, and the matter proceeded to a bench trial. On the day of trial, Mr. Lehman stipulated to all of the essential elements of his charge, save for the one requiring the State to prove that someone was likely to be present in the home when he burglarized it. After hearing the evidence, the court found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to six years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Lehman now appeals from his conviction and raises one assignment of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [MR.] LEHMAN'S CONVICTION WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, MERITING REVERSAL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In his sole assignment of error, Mr. Lehman argues that his burglary conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, he argues that the court lost its way when it found that\n   someone was likely to be present at the time he burglarized the homeowners' residence. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} When a defendant argues that his conviction is against the weight of the evidence, this court must review all of the evidence before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Two of those dogs belonged to her and her husband, and the third belonged to their daughter and her fianc\u00e9. The wife homeowner testified that she did not always take her lunch hour at the same time and that she regularly returned home for forgotten items, to\n   care for the dogs, or for various appointments because her office was located less than three miles away. On the day of the burglary, she left her office at approximately 11:45 a.m. to return home for lunch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The husband homeowner testified that he left for work around 6:30 a.m. the morning of the burglary and was scheduled to work until 4:00 p.m. He admitted that he seldom left work once he arrived there, but stated that his schedule could vary from day-to-day and week-to-week. Because he worked on weekends, he had two weekdays off instead and sometimes had to change shifts to cover for his co-workers. Further, he testified that it was common for him to take vacation days in September because summer was a busy time and he risked losing his accrued vacation time each year if he did not use it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} There was testimony that the homeowners' daughter and her fianc\u00e9 came to the homeowners' residence twice each weekday because, while they were working, their dog stayed with the homeowners' dogs. The fianc\u00e9 testified that, around the time of the burglary, he dropped off their dog between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, and his fianc\u00e9e dropped off the dog before 8:00 a.m. on Wednesdays and Fridays. He also testified, however, that his schedule varied depending on his clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} A second homeowner testified that he was home at approximately 8:15 a.m. on the day of the burglary. While walking to his laundry room, he was startled to see a man standing outside his front door. He testified that a large portion of his front door was made of glass, so he could clearly see the man through the door. Noting that his presence also appeared to have startled the man, he approached the front door and spoke to the man without opening it. According to the second homeowner, when he asked the man what he was doing there, the man said \"something about a lawn mower on Craigslist.\" The second homeowner then expressed that he had no knowledge of that item and watched as the man left, climbed into an SUV, and drove away. The defense stipulated that Mr. Lehman was the man at the second homeowner's residence that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Mr. Lehman testified in his own defense. He testified that he went to the homeowners' and the second homeowner's residences on the day of the burglary because he was trying to locate jewelry that had been stolen from his uncle. Believing that individuals who resided in the two households had purchased the jewelry on the internet, he went there intending to buy it back. Mr. Lehman claimed that he went to the homeowners' residence around 9:30 a.m. the day before the burglary and tried knocking on their door for 5-10 minutes. When no one answered, he decided to return the following day. Mr. Lehman testified that, on the day of the burglary, he went to the second homeowner's residence before driving to the homeowners' residence. He testified that he was \"[p]ositive no one was home\" at the homeowners' residence because he knocked for several minutes to no avail and a jogger he stopped told him the residents were at work. On cross-examination, he conceded that he lied to the police when they interviewed him about this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Mr. Lehman argues that the trier of fact lost its way by convicting him because the evidence weighs in favor of the conclusion that no one was likely to be present when he broke into the homeowners' residence. He notes that, at the time of the burglary, both of the homeowners were at work and there was evidence that their daughter had already left\n   her dog at their house. According to Mr. Lehman, the homeowners and their daughter's fianc\u00e9 purposely made it appear that there were frequent variations in their schedules when, in fact, there were not. He argues that they were well aware that the \"likely to be present\" element was the only contested issue in the case because they were present when the parties discussed that issue at the start of trial and, on cross-examination, admitted discussing that issue in advance of trial. Mr. Lehman claims that those discussions caused them to exaggerate their schedule variations. As such, he asserts that their testimony was not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Having reviewed the record, this Court cannot conclude that the trier of fact lost its way when it found that someone was \"likely to be present\" at the homeowners' residence at the time of the burglary. \" 'People come home for many reasons-personal, sickness, lunch, etc.' \"\n   <em>\n    Treichel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20556909\">\n    1996 WL 556909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, her husband and her daughter's fianc\u00e9 both testified to a range of variation in their work schedules. There was evidence that either the homeowners' daughter or her fianc\u00e9 came to the home each morning to drop off their dog and, when the fianc\u00e9 brought the dog, he generally arrived during the timeframe in which the burglary occurred.
