CELEBREZZE, JR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Cornelius Lynch (\"Lynch\"), brings this appeal challenging his convictions for rape and kidnapping. Specifically, Lynch argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to dismiss the indictment based on preindictment delay, the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, and that the charges should have been dismissed based on double jeopardy grounds. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The instant appeal arose from an incident that occurred between Lynch and his girlfriend's daughter, M.H. At the time of the incident, M.H. was 12 years old, and Lynch had been living with his girlfriend, S.P., and M.H. for a few years. M.H. alleged that Lynch sexually assaulted her on May 26, 1994. M.H. reported the incident to her mother the next morning, and M.H. went to the hospital where a rape kit examination was performed. M.H. spoke with hospital staff and the police about the incident, and she indicated that Lynch was her assailant. Cuyahoga County Division of Children and Family Services (\"CCDCFS\") investigators also interviewed\n   M.H. and Lynch. Approximately two weeks later, M.H. recanted her allegations against Lynch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Although M.H. recanted her allegations, her rape kit was submitted to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\") for DNA testing in August 2012. DNA testing established that Lynch could not be excluded as the source of semen on the vaginal swab from the rape kit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After learning of the DNA match, investigators reinterviewed M.H. and S.P. M.H. informed the investigators that Lynch assaulted her in May 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 15, 2014, in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-585501-A, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a three-count indictment charging Lynch with (1) rape, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), with a furthermore specification alleging that Lynch purposely compelled the victim to submit by force or threat of force, (2) rape, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), and (3) kidnapping, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4). Count 1 alleged that Lynch engaged in vaginal intercourse with M.H., and Count 2 alleged that Lynch engaged in cunnilingus with M.H. Lynch was arraigned on May 30, 2014. He pled not guilty to the indictment. Shortly after Lynch was indicted, S.P. died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Lynch's counsel filed a motion to withdraw on July 2, 2014. The trial court granted counsel's motion, and the court assigned a new attorney to represent Lynch on July 9, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 31, 2014, Lynch's counsel filed motions for independent DNA analysis and to dismiss the indictment based on preindictment delay. Lynch's counsel filed a supplemental motion to dismiss based on preindictment delay on November 17, 2014. On February 12, 2015, the trial court denied defense counsel's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On August 5, 2015, Lynch's counsel filed a motion for reconsideration of the motion to dismiss for preindictment delay. The trial court denied defense counsel's motion for reconsideration on October 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On February 2, 2016, Lynch's counsel filed a second supplemental motion to dismiss based on preindictment delay. On February 12, 2016, the trial court denied defense counsel's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A jury trial commenced on March 7, 2016. On March 10, 2016, the trial court declared a mistrial based on an issue that arose with one of the 12 jurors. On March 11, 2016, Lynch's second attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. The trial court granted counsel's motion, and the court assigned a new attorney to represent Lynch on March 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On September 9, 2016, Lynch's counsel filed a motion to reconsider the defense's previous motions to dismiss based on preindictment delay. After holding a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to reconsider on September 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} A second jury trial commenced on September 15, 2016. At the close of trial, the jury found Lynch guilty on all three counts on September 20, 2016. The trial court referred Lynch to the probation department for a presentence investigation report and set the matter for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court held a sentencing hearing on October 20, 2016. The trial court merged Counts 1 and 3 for sentencing purposes. The state elected to sentence Lynch on Count 1. The trial court imposed a prison term of 15 years to life on Count 1, and a prison term of 15 years to life on Count 2. The trial court ordered the counts to run concurrently. The trial court found\n   Lynch to be a sexually oriented offender and reviewed his reporting requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On November 1, 2016, Lynch filed the instant appeal challenging his convictions. He assigns four errors for review, which we will address out of order for ease of discussion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I. [Lynch's] rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court denied his motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay and then denied his motion to reconsider that ruling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   II. Prosecutorial misconduct encouraging the jury to convict based on sympathy for M.H. violated [Lynch's] constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process and to be convicted based only on the evidence against him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   III. Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance when he failed to object to the prosecutor's improper argument as set forth in the [s]econd [a]ssignment of [e]rror.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   IV. Because there was no manifest necessity for the trial court to grant a mistrial, the constitutional protection against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense required that the charges against [Lynch] be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defense counsel further asserted that the state was unable to show that the delay in prosecution was reasonable. The state argued that S.P.'s unavailable testimony would not be exculpatory due to the DNA evidence linking Lynch to M.H.'s rape kit. The state explained that the police ceased the active investigation in 1994 because M.H. recanted her allegations against Lynch, and that the case was reopened when the prosecution received the new DNA evidence linking Lynch to the rape kit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court indicated that it reviewed the case law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Jones I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

We cannot say that S.P.'s testimony that the allegations against Lynch could not be true would minimize or eliminate the impact of the DNA evidence and bolster the defense. Furthermore, Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice by speculating that he could have asserted an alibi based on S.P.'s testimony that he was in bed with her at the time M.H. alleged that he raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Although S.P. was not available to testify at trial, Lynch acknowledges that \"[w]e know much of what [S.P.] would have testified to from her statements as they appear in [M.H.'s] medical record from the hospital at the time they took the rape kit.\" Appellant's brief at 4. Regarding S.P.'s unavailable testimony about M.H.'s motive for fabricating the allegations, the record reflects that Lynch was available to testify, and did, in fact, testify about any motives M.H. may have had for fabricating the allegations. Lynch testified that S.P.'s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father rather than Lynch. Accordingly, S.P.'s testimony on this point would have been cumulative to Lynch's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Lynch's claim of prejudice regarding the loss of CCDCFS records or notes is speculative at best. He presumes that the CCDCFS investigators took notes during the interviews of M.H. and Lynch, and retained these notes in the case file. As noted above, M.H. recanted her allegations against Lynch approximately two weeks after the May 26, 1994 incident. Lynch asserts that the missing CCDCFS records \"would provide a concrete explanation of why there was no basis for the prosecution.\" Appellant's reply brief at 5. Lynch presumes that the CCDCFS records or notes contained a \"concrete explanation\"-other than the fact that M.H. recanted-as to why the allegations were found to be unsubstantiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Lynch's claim of prejudice regarding the loss of chain of custody information\n   is also speculative. There is no evidence that the information regarding the storage conditions at the Fourth District or how the rape kit was transported to the main property room was initially preserved but subsequently lost as a result of the delay. The missing information may be evidence of an incomplete chain of custody; however, this defense would have existed regardless of the passage of time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones II\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

He explained that S.P.'s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father. During closing arguments, defense counsel stated that when S.P. took M.H. to the hospital, S.P. told the doctors that she was sure that M.H. made up the allegations against Lynch \"because [her children] want [S.P.] to get back with their natural father[.]\" (Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   1304-1305.)

Based on this evidence, the prosecutor reasonably inferred that M.H. would not assent to or endure an invasive rape kit examination if she made up the allegations.

In fact, the record reflects that defense counsel requested a mistrial after the foreperson informed the trial court about the issues that arose with Juror 7: \"Your Honor, I would-I think we're in a position now-with the alternate being excused yesterday, I think we're in the same position we would be in with a hung jury, and I would request a mistrial[.]\" (Tr. 518.) Defense counsel reiterated this request while the trial court was polling the individual jurors about these issues: \"Your Honor, we're asking for a mistrial.\" (Tr. 552.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Lynch appeared to disagree with defense counsel's request for a mistrial. When counsel stated that the defense was asking for a mistrial, Lynch asserted, \"[n]o, no, we're not.\" (Tr. 553.)

In support of his argument, Lynch suggests that although the alternate juror had been discharged, the alternate could have been brought back. Lynch asserts that the trial court failed to investigate the possibility of bringing back the alternate. These arguments are unsupported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The record reflects that the trial court made multiple attempts to reach the alternate juror. The jury commissioner attempted to contact the alternate juror, left the alternate a voicemail, and told the alternate to return the phone call. (Tr. 520.) Before declaring a mistrial, the trial court stated, \"I would like to see if the alternate is available,\" and \"I'm going to * * * see if we can get ahold of the alternate, if the alternate is available.\" (Tr. 530, 566.) When the trial court declared a mistrial, it explained, \"we don't have the alternate here to replace [Juror 7] with an alternate.

The record reflects that the trial court exercised sound discretion in determining that Juror 7 was unable to follow the court's instructions and perform his duty. After learning about the issues that arose with Juror 7, the trial court conducted a thorough inquiry, questioning the foreperson, Juror 7, and each juror separately. The trial court permitted defense counsel and the prosecution to question the jurors as well. Furthermore, before deciding to discharge Juror 7 or declare a mistrial, the trial court made multiple attempts to reach the alternate juror. The trial court only declared a mistrial after determining that (1) the jury would not be able to reach a fair and just resolution in the case with Juror 7 on the panel and (2) the alternate juror could not be reached. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that there was a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Finally, Lynch cites\n   <em>\n    State v.
