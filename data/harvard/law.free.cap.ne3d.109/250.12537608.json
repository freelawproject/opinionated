Subsequently, defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   postconviction petition. Counsel was appointed to represent defendant on the petition but was later permitted to withdraw. The court subsequently dismissed the petition on the State's motion. Defendant appeals, challenging the orders granting counsel leave to withdraw and dismissing the petition. We hold that postconviction counsel failed to demonstrate compliance with the mandate of Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. Feb. 6, 2013) that counsel \"ascertain [the defendant's] contentions of deprivation of constitutional rights.\" We therefore vacate the orders allowing withdrawal of counsel and dismissing the petition, and we remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 3 In December 2005, defendant was indicted on two counts related to an alleged shooting in Aurora on November 22, 2005. Count I charged defendant with attempted first-degree murder ( 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a), 9-1(a)(1) (West 2004) ) and alleged that defendant \"performed a substantial step towards the commission of [first-degree murder], in that he without lawful justification and with the intent to kill Julian Ramos, shot Julian Ramos with a firearm.\" Count II charged defendant with aggravated discharge of a firearm ( 720 ILCS 5/24-1.2(a)(2) (West 2004) ) and alleged that defendant \"discharged a firearm in the direction of another person in that he shot at Julian Ramos with a firearm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 4 Prior to jury selection, the State moved to amend count I to allege that defendant \"shot\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   Julian Ramos\" (emphasis added) instead of \"shot Julian Ramos.\" Defendant did not object, and the trial court permitted the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 5 In its opening statement, the State anticipated that the evidence would show that, on November 22, 2005, defendant was driving a car with three fellow members of the Latin Kings gang. One of the passengers was Blake Pannell, an informant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). During the drive, another passenger, Augustin Montes, saw a pedestrian he recognized as Ramos. Montes, armed with a handgun, left the car and shot at Ramos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 6 The evidence at trial was recounted in detail in our disposition on direct appeal. See\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , No. 2-08-091. Pannell testified that, in November 2005, he was a member of the Latin Kings, working as an informant for the FBI. On November 22, 2005, Pannell was riding around Aurora with three fellow Latin Kings: defendant, Montes, and Ruben Hernandez. Defendant was driving. The four were looking for graffiti that was insulting to the Latin\n   Kings. When they saw such graffiti, they would spray paint over it with insults to the Insane Deuces, a rival gang. For security purposes, they had a gun, which belonged to defendant. Shortly after joining his associates that day, Pannell activated the secret audio-recording device that he was wearing.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    \u00b6 7 Pannell testified that, at some point during their drive, Montes remarked that he observed a pedestrian who belonged to the Insane Deuces. The four plotted how to shoot the pedestrian. Defendant drove the car in pursuit of the intended target. Montes twice exited the car with the gun in order to shoot the pedestrian. The first time Montes exited, Pannell also left the car and spray painted over some nearby graffiti. Before Montes exited the second time, Pannell covertly removed the clip from the gun, which left Montes with just the one bullet in the chamber. Pannell witnessed Montes fire the one bullet at the pedestrian. The four then drove in further pursuit of the pedestrian but relented when he reached an area with a number of bystanders.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    \u00b6 8 Pannell testified that he observed the pedestrian while the group was pursuing him. However, only in the following exchange did Pannell name the pedestrian:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n    \"Q. Were you ever going to give the clip to [Montes]-for him to complete the shooting of Julian Ramos?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    A. No.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    \u00b6 9 Pannell testified that, after the encounter with the pedestrian, he and his three associates went to the home of Marina Moreno, an aspiring Latin Queen. Montes hid defendant's gun in Moreno's bedroom ceiling.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    \u00b6 10 The State played for the jury a copy of Pannell's audio recording. Voices are heard declaring an intent to shoot someone and then commenting on the subject as he is pursued and flees. Mixed in with the statements are the sounds of a car door shutting. The State also introduced into evidence a transcript of the audio recording. Ramos is not identified by name in the recording itself or in the transcript.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    \u00b6 11 Moreno testified that, on November 22, 2005, defendant came to her house with Pannell, Hernandez, and Montes. After the group left, defendant phoned Moreno and told her that there was a gun in the ceiling in her room. About a week later, Moreno took the gun and delivered it to defendant at his request. She was not certain that the gun belonged to defendant, but she had seen him with it on prior occasions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    \u00b6 12 The State also called the FBI agent who worked with Pannell. The agent testified that Pannell contacted her on November 22, 2005, to report a shooting that had just occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    \u00b6 13 The State's final witness was an Aurora police officer who testified as an expert on gang activity. The expert explained that animosity between rival gangs can manifest itself in arguments, fights, or shootings. The expert opined that the shooting on November 22, 2005, was gang-related.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \u00b6 14 Following that expert's testimony, the State declared that it had no other witnesses. Ramos had not testified. The State moved to amend both counts of the indictment by substituting \"another\" for \"Julian Ramos.\" Count I as amended would allege that defendant, \"without lawful justification and with the intent to kill another, shot at another with a firearm.\" Count II as amended would allege that defendant \"discharged a firearm in the direction of another person in that he shot at another with a firearm.\" The State explained that its reason for the proposed amendment was that it \"couldn't find\" Ramos, though it had subpoenaed him for\n    prior settings of the trial. The State contended that the amendment would conform the indictment to the evidence at trial, which was that \"an individual was shot at, a person was shot at by [Montes].\" The State suggested that Ramos's name was \"surplusage\" in the indictment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \u00b6 15 Defense counsel objected to the proposed amendment. The trial court asked how the amendment would prejudice the defense, and defense counsel replied that the amendment would permit the State to argue that defendant was guilty as long as there was someone in the area whom Montes could have shot at, whether it was Ramos or not. The court replied:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    \"I don't think that is what they [the State] are saying. I think that they are saying it is a person who[m] [Montes] saw and said he's a rival guy and that is the person. * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    I think they are identifying him in that way. I don't think they are saying it could be anybody. I mean, it is not like there were ten people there that were being shot at.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b6 16 The court added that it would not permit the State to argue in closing that defendant would be guilty as long as Montes shot at some individual, even if it were not the individual whom Pannell testified he and his associates pursued. Finding no prejudice to the defense, the court allowed the amendment to both counts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b6 17 Subsequently, the State rested and the defense called one witness, an Aurora police detective. The detective testified that, when he spoke with Pannell on the evening of November 22, 2005, Pannell did not mention having done any spray painting or having exited the car near the time of the shooting. Nor did Pannell mention that the gun in the car belonged to defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 18 In its closing argument, the State did not mention Ramos by name but referred generically to the person who Pannell testified was pursued by his group on November 22, 2005.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \u00b6 19 In the defense's closing, counsel commented on Ramos's absence. In rebuttal, the State argued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    \"Do we have to show that Julian Ramos-what do we have to show about Julian Ramos? Well, there is no evidence about Julian Ramos. We do have evidence, evidence from the day of the shooting that Augustin Montes chased after a guy that Blake Pannell identifies as a heavyset Hispanic kid. Identity is not an issue. If you look at the instructions, it says that. And what you will get is the instructions. And I in no way mean to misspeak. The definition of * * * attempted first degree murder * * * is that without lawful justification with the intent to kill an individual, [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] does any act which constitutes a substantial step towards the killing of an individual.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 20 At this, defense counsel objected, remarking that the State was \"dangerously close to insinuating that * * * this guy just vanished into thin air.\" Counsel noted that the State had \"already named him as Julian Ramos.\" The State replied that its remarks about what it had to prove were simply in response to the defense's comment on Ramos's absence. The trial court instructed the State that it could \"talk about the jury instructions and the individual.\" Continuing with its argument, the State commented:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    \"Again, it's an individual shooting another person. Don't have to identify that person. That person, in fact, does not have to come and testify. You won't see an instruction that says you must hear-\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b6 21 Defense counsel again objected, and the court sustained the objection.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 22 The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts. Defendant filed a posttrial motion, reasserting that the trial court erred in permitting the amendments that eliminated the name \"Julian Ramos.\" The trial court denied the motion. The court then sentenced defendant to 23\u00bd years in prison. The court merged count II into count I for purposes of sentencing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 23 On direct appeal, defendant raised no issue regarding the amendments to the indictment. We affirmed defendant's convictions. See\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    , No. 2-08-0919.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b6 24 In October 2010, defendant filed a\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    postconviction petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) ( 725 ILCS 5/122-1\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    (West 2010) ). The petition was over 500 pages, including attachments. He raised numerous contentions of error. One paragraph of the petition read:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    \"Petitioner was denied his right to the effective assistance of appellate counsel where appellate counsel failed to raise me being prejudiced by these amending at the day of trial and at the closing of trial [right] before closing arguments. On Nov. 5, [2007,] petitioner was prejudiced by the Court allowing the word be changed from 'shot' to 'shot at' on the first day of trial, which [the] judge agreed that this amending came as [a] surprise, also no motion by the State for this amending which is required by 725 ILCS 5/115. Nov. 7, [2007,] there was another amending that was allowed that the judge allowed of the name of [the] alleged victim to be removed and for count one to read, 'the intent to kill another,' and for count two to read, 'shot at another with a firearm,' which the State said the name is mere surplusage. No motion on file for this second amending and with his name being removed in the Criminal Procedure Book 5/114-1 says that in section 10, the misnomer results in substantial injustice to the defendant, nothing of 5/115-5 of the Criminal Procedure says the name could be removed and this done [right] before closing arguments of trial. He wasn't even there at trial and they even used his name in [opening] statements, during trial and closing arguments. Case [law] says that you can't broad[en] an element of the offense has to be returned to the Grand Jury for any changes. Then the judge makes a statement saying there wasn't ten people being shot at, so how would you replace the alleged victim with another if there's no one to say that there was another.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b6 25 In July 2011, defendant inquired by letter into the status of his petition. In August 2011, the circuit court clerk responded by letter that the petition was \"[i]n the docket as of August 3, 2011\" and that there was \"no future court date.\" The court's first order on the petition was dated May 15, 2012, and stated: \"Rachel Hess was appointed to represent [defendant] in his post-conviction petition on April 2, 2012, but it was erroneously put on 07 CF 1840, a closed case.\" Hess was later permitted to withdraw because of her workload, and new counsel was appointed. In January 2014, new counsel filed an affidavit of compliance with Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. Feb. 6, 2013) as well as a motion for leave to withdraw as counsel. Counsel identified four individual claims raised in defendant's\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petition, and counsel explained why each lacked potential merit. In April 2014, counsel filed an addendum to her motion to withdraw, addressing the potential merit of two additional claims raised in defendant's petition. Neither the original motion nor its addendum addressed the potential merit of, or even acknowledged, defendant's claim that\n    appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the amendments to the indictment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \u00b6 26 The trial court granted counsel's motion to withdraw. Subsequently, the State moved to dismiss the petition. The State recognized that defendant claimed that appellate counsel \"was ineffective on the petitioner's direct appeal.\" However, the State did not recognize that defendant claimed ineffectiveness based on appellate counsel's failure to claim that the amendments to the indictment were improper.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b6 27 The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, and defendant filed this timely appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b6 28 II. ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 29 Defendant makes several alternative requests for relief in this appeal. His preference is that we assess the merit or potential merit of the claim in his\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    postconviction petition that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to contend on direct appeal that the trial court erred in permitting the State to amend count I by striking the name \"Julian Ramos.\" Defendant's first three alternative choices of relief are (1) an outright reversal of his conviction, (2) a reversal of his conviction and a remand for a new trial, and (3) a remand for a third-stage evidentiary hearing under the Act. See\n    <em>\n     People v. Bailey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12533903\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/102/114/\">\n     2017 IL 121450\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 18,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=421%20Ill.%20Dec.%20833\">\n     421 Ill.Dec. 833\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12533903\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/102/114/\">\n     102 N.E.3d 114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (petition will advance to third-stage review if it presents a substantial showing of a constitutional violation).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    \u00b6 30 Defendant's fourth alternative choice of relief does not involve our assessing the merit or potential merit of his\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    amendment claim. Specifically, defendant argues that the trial court erred in permitting his appointed postconviction counsel to withdraw, because counsel failed to provide the level of assistance required under the Act during second-stage proceedings. See\n    <em>\n     People v. Greer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2444097\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/212/192/#p204\">\n     212 Ill. 2d 192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 204,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Ill.%20Dec.%20153\">\n     288 Ill.Dec. 153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=817%20N.E.2d%20511\">\n     817 N.E.2d 511\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2004) (the Act guarantees the petitioner a \" 'reasonable' \" level of assistance from appointed counsel). In determining whether that level of assistance was provided, we need not-and must not-address the merits of the petition. See\n    <em>\n     People v. Suarez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3606913\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/224/37/#p51\">\n     224 Ill. 2d 37\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 51-52,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Ill.%20Dec.%20774\">\n     308 Ill.Dec. 774\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.E.2d%20977\">\n     862 N.E.2d 977\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007). For the following reasons, we agree with defendant that the trial court erred in allowing counsel to withdraw. Accordingly, we vacate the order of withdrawal and the later dismissal of the\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petition, and we remand for the appointment of new postconviction counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b6 31 The Act ( 725 ILCS 5/122-1\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    (West 2010) ) provides a procedural mechanism by which a criminal defendant can assert that his federal or state constitutional rights were substantially violated in his original trial.

If the record shows that counsel did everything required of him or her under Rule 651(c) and that all the claims in the original petition were patently without merit, then it serves no purpose to reverse a grant of leave to withdraw simply because of insufficiencies in the motion.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 30.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <em>\n     Komes\n    </em>\n    properly construed\n    <em>\n     Greer\n    </em>\n    .

In the Rule 651(c) certificate that counsel filed with her motion to withdraw, she stated that she (1) \"reviewed [defendant's]\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    filings concerning [this] matter,\" (2) \"examined the entire record to ascertain any errors or constitutional deprivations,\" and (3) \"consulted with [defendant] in person concerning potential issues.\" In her motion to withdraw, counsel stated that she consulted with defendant on specific dates \"to ascertain and discuss his contentions of deprivation of constitutional rights.\" She further stated that she \"reviewed the entire record available to her * * * and * * * concluded that [defendant's] petition present[ed] no issue of merit upon which [defendant] could expect to obtain relief.\" Counsel then purported to state what, \"[i]n short, the petition and its related documents allege.\" She set forth four individual claims and explained why they lacked potential\n    merit. Several months later, counsel filed an \"addendum\" to the motion to withdraw. Counsel noted that the trial court had asked her to \"address two additional points found in [the] post conviction petition,\" which counsel failed to address in her motion to withdraw. Counsel proceeded to address two additional claims and explain why they were not potentially viable. At the hearing on the motion to withdraw, counsel asserted that, in her motion, she \"went through the issues and stated * * * positions and case law to address\n    <em>\n     each one.\n    </em>\n    \" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    \u00b6 42 Thus, counsel confirmed at the hearing that her motion purported to recapitulate the claims of the petition as she understood them. However, in neither her original motion nor its addendum did counsel acknowledge the amendment claim. This was because, we infer, counsel did not discern the claim among the others. Counsel's oversight was perhaps understandable, given the length and density of the\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petition, but counsel was not thereby excused from compliance with Rule 651(c)'s mandate that she \"ascertain [defendant's] contentions of deprivation of constitutional rights.\" Ill. S. Ct. R. 651(c) (eff. Feb. 6, 2013). \"Unless the record shows that counsel has, in fact, ascertained the petitioner's claims, we cannot assume that the claims are in their final form, and deciding their frivolity is likely to be premature.\"\n    <em>\n     Komes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20100014\">\n     2011 IL App (2d) 100014\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 32,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20Ill.%20Dec.%20440\">\n     352 Ill.Dec. 440\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20N.E.2d%20300\">\n     954 N.E.2d 300\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \u00b6 43 We recognize that a reviewing court has permission under\n    <em>\n     Greer\n    </em>\n    to affirm the grant of a motion to withdraw even where counsel has not explained why each of the petitioner's claims lacks potential merit. But\n    <em>\n     Greer\n    </em>\n    was unequivocal that the reviewing court cannot relieve counsel of his or her duty under Rule 651(c) to ascertain the petitioner's claims.\n    <em>\n     Greer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2444097\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/212/192/#p204\">\n     212 Ill. 2d at 212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Ill.%20Dec.%20153\">\n     288 Ill.Dec. 153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=817%20N.E.2d%20511\">\n     817 N.E.2d 511\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Counsel in\n    <em>\n     Greer\n    </em>\n    at least understood what the\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petition contained. Counsel \"stated, as to each issue raised in defendant's\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petition, that counsel could not 'properly substantiate' the claim.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 195,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Ill.%20Dec.%20153\">\n     288 Ill.Dec. 153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=817%20N.E.2d%20511\">\n     817 N.E.2d 511\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Obviously, it is imperative that counsel ascertain what the\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petition actually contains before asserting to a court that the petition lacks potential merit. We stress that we do not read\n    <em>\n     Greer\n    </em>\n    as prescribing any particular form for a motion to withdraw. Our holding is simply that here, though counsel attempted twice to state the claims in the\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petition, we cannot conclude that counsel ascertained the claim that she failed to mention in those two tries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \u00b6 44 Given counsel's apparent failure to discern the amendment claim, we cannot deem the claim to have been in its \"final form\" when the trial court evaluated its potential merit. It would likewise be premature for us, on review, to judge the claim's potential merit.
