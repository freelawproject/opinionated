The defendants were discharged from the plaintiff\u2019s employ. They applied for and were awarded unemployment benefits by the examiner. The plaintiff appealed to the unemployment commissioner on the ground that the period when benefits became due should have been deferred because the defendants had been discharged for \u201cwilful misconduct.\u201d The purpose of the appeal in each case was to insure to the plaintiff the benefit of the fact that the discharge was for that cause upon its merit rating under General Statutes, Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 1337e, as amended by \u00a7 713f, Sup. 1941, and \u00a7 961h, Sup. 1945. The commissioner sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeals, and the defendants thereupon appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed their appeals and affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. From these judgments the defendants have appealed to this court. The question as presented to us is: Was the commissioner\u2019s conclusion one which he could reasonably and properly reach?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The material facts in the commissioner\u2019s finding may be thus summarized: The plaintiff is a manufacturer of boilers and employs about 100 men in its plant in New Haven. Each person upon entering\u2019 the plaintiff\u2019s employ is given a handbook of \u201cInformation for Employees,\u201d receipt of which is acknowledged in writing. The working hours of the employees are checked by means of time cards inserted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>stamping in a time clock, and each employee is required to record the time of his entering or leaving by punching this clock. The lunch hour is from 12 to 12:30 p.m., but a warning whistle is sounded at 12:25. On September 17, 1945, the defendants reported for work at the end of the lunch hour, Waselik punching in at 12:29 and Cicarelli at 12:30 p.m. Prom 12:31 until about 12:50 both defendants went about the plant presenting cards to other employees for their signatures, which signatures would indicate a desire for union membership. Approximately sixty-five employees had been solicited before the defendants were made to desist and report to the superintendent\u2019s office. There they were discharged from the plaintiff\u2019s employ for violating rule 18 in the handbook. This reads: \u201cSubscriptions, Campaigns, etc. In the interest of its employees, the Company has found it necessary to prohibit the taking up of subscriptions or solicitations on behalf of any organizations unless authorized by the management.\u201d This rule was applicable only to the time during which the employees involved were being paid by the plaintiff. The defendants had obtained no permission to solicit the plaintiff\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The defendants\u2019 contention, that the commissioner\u2019s finding that they \u201csolicited\u201d their fellow employees is unwarranted, is without merit. \u201cSolicit\u201d means \u201cto entreat; importune; ... to approach with a request or plea; to seek . . . actively.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.). There was direct testimony as to solicitation of several employees by Waselik, and sufficient evidence that both defendants distributed these union membership application cards, talked to the distributees to get them to sign and outside the gates later in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>day collected sixty-five of the cards which were signed. The defendants are entitled to no correction of the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The errors assigned in the court\u2019s dismissal of the defendants\u2019 appeals from the commissioner present to this court for determination a single question, which, as stated in the opening sentence of their brief, is whether or not the defendants were \u201cdischarged for wilful misconduct in the course of employment, and consequently are disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits for the statutory period, as provided for in\u201d \u00a7 710g (2)(B) of the 1943 Supplement to the General Statutes. Its answer depends upon the meaning of the words \u201cwilful misconduct in the course of his employment\u201d as used in the statute. Section 718f of the 1941 Supplement to the General Statutes, which \u00a7 710g amended, makes provision for a waiting period as a prerequisite of recovery in every case, and its subdivision (4), presently relevant, defines a \u201cwaiting period week\u201d as one \u201cwith respect to which [an unemployed individual] has received no benefits but during which he was eligible for benefits in all other respects and was not ineligible for benefits under any provision of subsection (b) hereof.\u201d The portion of this subsection (b), as amended by \u00a7 710g, pertinent to the issue presented to us, reads: \u201cDisqualifications. An individual shall be ineligible for benefits . . . (2) during the week in which . . . [the employee] has . . . (B) been discharged for wilful misconduct in the course of his employment, and for the next four following weeks, none of which shall count towards the waiting period provided for in subdivision (4) of subsection (a) hereof.\u201d The defendants concede that the plaintiff had the right to discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>them, bnt claim that they were not guilty of any such \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d as would justify a discharge on that ground and so automatically defer their unemployment benefits for four weeks under the above provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">While this court has not been called upon to determine what constitutes \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d under this statute, we have passed upon the meaning of \u201cwilful and serious misconduct\u201d on the part of an injured employee which under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 5226 of the G-eneral Statutes, precludes an award of compensation. Thus in <em>Gonier </em>v. <em>Chase Companies, Inc., </em>97 Conn. 46, 115 A. 677, we said (p. 55): \u201cMisconduct is any improper or wrong conduct. . . . By wilful misconduct is meant either intentional misconduct, that is, such as is done purposely with knowledge, or misconduct of such a character as to evince a reckless disregard of consequences to himself by him who is guilty of it.\u201d And further, at page 57, we stated: \u201cMere violation of a rule does not always constitute wilful misconduct. To have that effect the disobedience must have been deliberate, not merely a thoughtless act on the spur of the moment. . . . The breach of a rule by one who knows at the time that he is breaking the rule is a wilful breach; but if by direct proof, or out of the circumstances, it appears to have been the result of thoughtlessness or inadvertence, the breach cannot be held to have been wilful.\u201d It follows that improper or wrong conduct which is intentional, that is, such as is done purposely with knowledge, constitutes wilful misconduct, and therefore the deliberate violation of a reasonable rule in connection with work is sufficient to constitute wilful misconduct. See <em>Sharkiewicz </em>v. <em>Cushman Chuck Co., </em>11 Conn. Sup. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>221, 224; 55 Yale L. J. 147, 162; 1 P. H. Social Security Tax Service \u00b6 27,806.5; 2 C.C.H. Unemployment Ins. Service \u00b6 1970. The case of <em>Boynton Cab Co. </em>v. <em>Neubeck, </em>237 Wis. 249, 296 N. W. 636, relied upon by the defendants, is not authority to the contrary, for the employee\u2019s misconduct in that case amounted to no more than inefficiency, inadvertence, or negligence. See p. 260. \u201c. . . what is wilful misconduct is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Gonier </em>v. <em>Chase Companies, Inc., </em>supra, 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Whether in the instant case the conclusion that these defendants were guilty of wilful misconduct was warranted depends upon whether their conduct, detailed in the finding and violative of the plaintiff\u2019s rule, could be held reasonably to amount to a deliberate violation of a reasonable rule within the principles stated in the preceding paragraph. For some twenty minutes the defendants in soliciting their fellow employees were engaged in purposes from which the plaintiff derived no return although the men involved were being paid by it for this time. The interference with production implicit in such conduct is manifest, even aside from the direct testimony of it in the record, and is sufficient to show not only that the rule in question, which was designed to guard against such interference, was reasonable but also that its violation by the defendants was material and amounted to improper or wrong conduct, that is, misconduct. The finding leaves no doubt that this misconduct was intentional rather than thoughtless or inadvertent, and so was deliberate, for the finding shows that both defendants were familiar with the rule but, notwithstanding, intentionally disregarded it to serve their own purpose. That this purpose was to augment the membership of a labor union is of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>significance upon the record before us. In this connection, however, as indicative of the reasonableness of the rule in the instant case, it is interesting to note that the federal courts have repeatedly held that under the Wagner Act, so-called, a rule forbidding solicitation for union membership during working hours is not only reasonable but the discharge of an employee by the employer for violation of it is not \u201can unfair labor practice.\u201d See <em>Midland Steel Products Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>113 F.2d 800, 805; <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>William Davies Co., </em>135 F. 2d 179, 182; <em>Carter Carburetor Corporation </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>140 F. 2d 714, 716; <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Empire Furniture Corporation, </em>107 F. 2d 92, 95. The conclusion of the commissioner that the defendants were guilty of wilful misconduct within the meaning of \u00a7 710g (2) (B) of the 1943 Supplement was fully warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The defendants have filed a motion in this court asking that the unemployment compensation administrator be ordered to pay their expenses upon these appeals under \u00a7 1341e (h) of the 1939 Supplement. Not only was no such claim made in the Superior Court but a further sufficient answer to it is that in so far as appears the administrator has neither ruled nor been requested to rule upon the granting of such an allowance. The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
