The defendant, hereinafter called the landlord, brought the action against the plaintiff, hereinafter called the tenant, before a justice of the peace. In response to a motion for oyer a copy of the lease was filed. It contained a provision: \u201c. . . the Tenant waives and will waive all right to trial by jury in any summary proceeding hereafter instituted . . . against the Tenant in respect of the demised premises. . . The tenant filed a motion for a jury trial, but subsequently on motion of the landlord the justice struck the case from the jury docket. The only error claimed is this ruling of the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In this jurisdiction summary process actions are tried to a jury only on motion of one of the parties made in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 5973 of the General Statutes. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Main, </em>102 Conn. 640, 641, 129 A. 786. A right of trial by jury even when guaranteed by the constitution may be waived; <em>Leahey </em>v. <em>Heasley, </em>127 Conn. 332, 336, 16 A.2d 609; <em>State v. Rankin, </em>102 Conn. 46, 49, 127 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>916; and, where a statute provides that an action shall be tried by jury only when claimed for the jury docket, a failure to make such a claim waives the right. <em>Noren </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>72 Conn. 96, 98, 43 A. 649. In a pending action of summary process a party can voluntarily waive trial by jury and does so unless he makes a motion that the case be so tried; a binding agreement for such a waiver made in advance of the institution of such an actioii does not violate public policy; and there is no reason why such an agreement should not be given effect, as the justice did in his ruling. <em>Waterside Holding Corporation </em>v. <em>Lask, </em>233 App. Div. 456, 253 N.Y.S. 183; <em>Van Leyden v. 360 East 55th Street Corporation, </em>39 F. Sup. 879. Both parties to the lease are residents of, and the premises are located in, Connecticut; the only \u201csummary proceeding ... in respect of the demised premises\u201d known to our law would be an action of summary process; and the parties must have intended the provision in the lease to apply to such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
