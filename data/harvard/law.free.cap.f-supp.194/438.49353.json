Alabama G.S.R. Company, 306 I.C.C. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">This case involves rates for the movement outbound from various river ports of grain and grain products which have arrived at those ports by barge.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">The issues before this Court are whether the Commission correctly held (1) that the application of local rates to ex-barge traffic and lower proportional rates to ex-rail traffic from certain ports on the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers violates Section 3(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act and,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) that the application of local rates to ex-barge traffic from ports on the Tennessee River and from New Orleans at the same time that lower proportional rates apply to ex-barge traffic from the port of Memphis constitutes unlawful preference to the port of Memphis and unlawful prejudice to the Tennessee River ports and to New Orleans in violation of Section 3(1) of the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The history of this litigation is long, the same being commenced over ten years ago, by a complaint filed with the Commission in January of 1951. A detailed recital of the sequence of events would serve no useful purpose; they are detailed in an action involving a phase of this case before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Arrow Transportation Company v. United States, 176 F.Supp. 411, affirmed, 361 U.S. 353, 80 S.Ct. 406, 4 L.Ed.2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">At the outset it should be stated that this Court is fully cognizant of the well settled law that the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission should not be set aside, modified or disturbed by a court, on review, if they lie within the scope of the Commission\u2019s authority, are based upon adequate findings and are supported by substantial evidence. Judicial review in this matter then is very limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Let us pass to a brief review of the facts of the controversy. A substantial surplus of grain is produced in the Midwestern Grain Belt. A deficit exists in areas of the Southeast, where there are expanding livestock and poultry industries. There is a substantial and growing movement of grain from the Midwest to the South.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Under the existing rate structure the railroads charge their full local rates for the transhipment by rail of grain and grain products from a number of Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri River ports to destinations in the South when the shipment has had a prior movement to the port via barge (ex-barge), whereas they charge lesser rates from those same river ports to the same destinations when the grain and grain products have had a pri- or movement to the ports via rail (ex-rail) .</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The circumstances surrounding the handling of ex-rail and ex-barge grain at the river ports are the same. Both the inbound car and inbound barge are placed at the elevator\u2019s point of unloading where the grain is unloaded by, and comes into the possession and control of, the elevator where it loses its identity. When the elevator operator later ships out an equal amount of grain, he orders and loads a rail car which is then shipped to a new destination. When a rail freight bill is surrendered the outbound railroad charges a proportional rate lower than the local rate otherwise applicable. When the grain loaded outbound is supported by an inbound barge bill, the physical treatment is identical. But at ports where proportional rates do not apply to ex-barge grain, the ex-barge grain is assessed the full local rate when it is reshipped. From some of the Mississippi River ports, including Memphis, the railroads publish equal proportional rates on ex-rail and ex-barge grain. No Section 3(4) issue is presented as to those rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">Grain can move by barge from Midwestern ports such as Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Peoria to Memphis, New Orleans, or any of the ports on the Tennessee River from which it can be transhipped by rail to its destination in the South. The Tennessee River ports and the port of New Orleans are in direct competition with the port of Memphis for this traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">The handling of ex-barge grain is the same at all of the ports. At Memphis the elevator operator surrenders the inbound bill of lading and receives a proportional rate lower than the local rate. At the Tennessee River ports and at New Orleans, he must pay the full local rate. There is no factual showing in the record to justify this difference in treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">The higher level of rates which applies on ex-barge traffic from the Tennessee River ports and from New Orleans makes it difficult for those ports to compete with the port at Memphis. This rate structure inhibits the movement of barge grain beyond the ports. The high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>er ex-barge rates from the Tennessee River ports have deprived shippers of the inherent advantage of barge transportation as required by the National Transportation Policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"> Suffice it to say the findings of the Commission of discrimination against barge lines under Section 3(4) and the findings of undue preference to the port of Memphis and undue prejudice to the Tennessee River ports and New Orleans, are amply supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The railroads introduced a cost study which compared the cost to the outbound railroad of handling grain and grain products from Memphis which had a prior movement via barge, with grain and grain products which had a prior movement by rail. On the ex-rail side of the equation, the cost study commingled grain which passed through Memphis without a stop in transit for elevation or processing grain products which passed without stop-in-transit, and grain which was elevated or processed at these ports and was transhipped.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the Commission erred in rejecting the railroads cost evidence. The railroads had the burden of proving a difference in the cost of handling like traffic. They failed to carry this burden. The cost evidence introduced by the railroads does not compare like with like, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Mechling, 1947, 330 U.S. 567, 67 S.Ct. 894, 91 L.Ed. 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Almost all, if not all, the legal issues raised by the plaintiffs were raised as defenses in Arrow Transportation Co. v. United States, 1959, 176 F.Supp. 411, affirmed 361 U.S. 353,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 80 S.Ct. 406, 4 L.Ed. 2d 362. When counsel for the railroads were asked by the court to explain their position with respect to the Arrow case, they argued that the Arrow case involved merely the question of whether the divisions received on ex-rail movements over \u25a0the Tennessee River ports were improperly excluded as evidence. We believe the holding went much further.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">As to the Tennessee River interests it would seem to bar plaintiffs from relitigating the Section 3(1) issue. As to the Section 3(4) issue, the Arrow case seems a precedent squarely in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The threshold question presented in the Arrow case was whether there is Section 3(4) discrimination. In order to decide the question the Alabama Court had to dispose of the same contentions as plaintiffs herein argue. (1) Is the barge line a \u201cconnecting carrier\u201d within the meaning of Section 3(4)? (2) Must there be findings of \u201cpublic interest\u201d under Section 15(3), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15 (3) ? (3) Must the barge lines expressly seek joint rates with the railroads? The Alabama Court discussed each of these questions, and held that none of the arguments constituted a valid reason for denying relief. Moreover, this Court is in complete agreement with that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">We believe the railroads and the barge lines are \u201cconnecting carriers\u201d within the meaning of Section 3(4) of Title 49 U.S.C.A. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Mechling, 330 U.S. 567, 67 S.Ct. 894, 91 L.Ed. 1102; Dixie Carriers v. United States, 1956, 351 U.S. 56, 76 S.Ct. 578, 100 L.Ed. 934; and Arrow Transportation Company v. United States, 1959, 176 F.Supp. 411, affirmed 1960, 361 U.S. 353, 80 S.Ct. 406, 4 L.Ed. 2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>If relief is necessary to cure a discrimination against water transportation in violation of some provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq., there is no requirement, as a condition of relief, that the barge lines be parties to \u201cthrough routes\u201d or that the Commission make a finding under either Sections 15(3) or 307(d) of the Act. Nor does Section 4 of the Act impose a condition on the power of the Commission to act. The Commission is empowered by the Act to grant relief in such form as is required to remedy the violation of Section 3(4). Interstate Commerce Commission v. Mechling, supra; Dixie Carriers v. United States, supra; and Arrow Transportation Company v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The failure of the railroads to publish proportional rates when grain and grain products from river ports to the South have had a prior movement by barge to those ports on the same basis as the proportional rates applicable when the grain and grain products have arrived by rail is discriminatory under Section 3(4) of the Act. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Mechling, supra, and Arrow Transportation Company v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The failure of the railroads to publish proportional rates from the Tennessee River ports and New Orleans on grain and grain productions which have had a prior movement to those ports by barge on the same relative level as the railroads publish on grain arriving by barge at Memphis is unduly preferential to the port of Memphis and unduly prejudicial to Tennessee ports under Section 3(1).

United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Judgment in this case wil be entered in conformity with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Counsel for the prevailing parties will please prepare and submit an appropriate Journal Entry of Judgment but it will not be entered until after notice to all' parties.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\">.
