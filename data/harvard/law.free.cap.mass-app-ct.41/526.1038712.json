L. c. 265, \u00a7 22. On appeal he alleges that: (1) his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move to suppress the testimony of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses; and (2) the trial judge\u2019s failure to provide an instruction on fresh complaint in his final charge created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>1. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel a defendant must establish: (1) that his representative\u2019s performance reflected \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention . . . falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary, fallible lawyer,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974); and (2) that these shortcomings deprived him of \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\u201d or in some other way materially affected the outcome of his trial. <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. 497, 503 (1992). Consonant with these principles, failing to pursue a futile tactic does not amount to constitutional ineffectiveness. Here, a motion to suppress likely would have done little to advance the defendant\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">At trial, the victim\u2019s sister, Marquise, was permitted to testify concerning comments made by the defendant during a telephone call. The remarks<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were overheard by Marquise as she surreptitiously listened in on a conversation between her mother and the defendant on an extension phone in her home. The defendant claims that by secretly listening in on his conversation with the victim\u2019s mother, Marquise violated the Federal wiretap statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 (1994), as well as the cognate Massachusetts statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. The defendant further avers that notwithstanding the fact that Marquise was not a public official (or acting at the direction of a public official), both statutes bar admission of the fruits of Marquise\u2019s allegedly illegal actions at the defendant\u2019s criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Although there is some uncertainty about the scope of the statutes\u2019 application, it appears that, in some situations at least, wiretap evidence unlawfully obtained by private persons may be subject to exclusion. See <em>Heggy </em>v. <em>Heggy, </em>944 F.2d 1537, 1540 (10th Cir. 1991), cert, denied, 503 U.S. 951 (1992) (reference to \u201cany person\u201d in portion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 relating to statute\u2019s scope of application construed to include private citizens); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>406 Mass. 421, 423 (1990) (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 \u201cforbids the interception of certain oral communications by private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>individuals\u201d). Whether this principle applies here, however, need not be decided. In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that Marquise\u2019s actions did not amount to an illegal wiretap, either for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, or G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. The remedial provisions of those laws, therefore, need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">While under both the State and Federal statutes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a telephone extension may constitute an \u201cintercepting wire device,\u201d both laws have created an exception for standard telephone instruments furnished to a subscriber by a communications common carrier and used by the subscriber in his or her \u201cordinary course of business.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 (5)(a)(i); G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99(B)(3). This \u201cordinary course of business\u201d provision, while construed somewhat narrowly in the workplace context, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>63 F.3d 1391, 1396 (6th Cir. 1995), cert, denied, 116 S. Ct. 1672 (1996), has been interpreted expansively in the context of a subscriber\u2019s residence. We turn first to the Federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Although the issue has not been squarely addressed by either the Supreme Court or the First Circuit, the defendant has not brought to our attention, nor have we found, a single instance in which any Federal court has ever held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 is violated where a family member merely listens in on (but does not record) the telephone conversation of another family member through the use of a standard residential extension phone. For example, in <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>558 F.2d 677 (2d Cir. 1977), the court observed that: \u201cAppellee\u2019s activity would clearly not be prohibited if it consisted merely of listening into his wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s telephone conversations from an extension phone in his apartment. Congress explicitly exempted such activity from coverage by the Act. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(5)(a)(i). Such a use of an extension phone in appel-lee\u2019s own home would certainly be in the \u2018ordinary course of [the user\u2019s] business\u2019 \u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 678-679. The decision in <em>Anonymous </em>was based, in part, on a review of the legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, which evinces a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>clear attempt to exempt benign and unsophisticated forms of intra-familial eavesdropping in the home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Similarly, in <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Ingle, </em>944 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1991), cert, denied, 502 U.S. 1044 (1992), the court concluded that a mother did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 by listening in on the conversations of her son using an extension phone in her home. In reaching its decision, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201c[T]he interception at issue here is not reached by [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520], The interception of a family member\u2019s telephone conversations by use of an extension phone in the family home is arguably permitted by a broad reading of the exemption contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(5)(a)(i) .... \u2018[W]e think the (5)(a)(i) exemption is indicative of Congress\u2019s intention to abjure from deciding a very intimate question of familial relations, that of the extent of privacy family members may expect within the home.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1536, quoting from <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>490 F.2d 803, 809 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 419 U.S. 897 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The Seventh Circuit, in <em>Scheib </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>22 F.3d 149, 153-154 (1993), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 929 (1994), expressly relied upon this portion of <em>Newcomb </em>in concluding that a father had not violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 by eavesdropping on conversations between his son (who lived with his father) and the child\u2019s mother (from whom the father was divorced) using an extension phone. \u201cWe cannot attribute to Congress the intent to subject parents to criminal and civil penalties for [listening in on] their minor child\u2019s phone conversations out of concern for the child\u2019s well-being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Similar results have been reached in a large number of other Federal decisions. See <em>Lizza </em>v. <em>Lizza, </em>631 F. Supp. 529, 532 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. 1986) (\u201c[18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520] exempts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>from coverage under the Act the ordinary use of an extension phone to listen in on a conversation\u201d). See also <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>490 F.2d at 805 (refusing to apply 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 to a broad range of types of intra-family eavesdropping); Per<em>fit </em>v. <em>Perfit, </em>693 F. Supp 851, 855-856 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (applying extension phone exception for merely listening).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Likewise, State courts that have considered the question have reached similar results. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Telles, </em>139 N.H. 344, 347-348 (1995), for example, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire (in a factual context very similar to the present case) concluded that a witness\u2019s use of an extension phone to eavesdrop on her houseguest\u2019s telephone conversations with the defendant fell within the exception defined by \u00a7 2510(5)(a)(i), and so the witness\u2019s testimony concerning the contents of those calls was admissible at the defendant\u2019s criminal trial. In reaching its decision, the court placed special emphasis on the fact that the witness \u201cdid not record the conversations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348 (Johnson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">While, as noted, the First Circuit has not addressed the question of eavesdropping between family members on a residential extension phone, its decisions construing other provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 suggest that it would reach the same result as these cited decisions. For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>720 F.2d 227 (1st Cir. 1983), cert, denied, 464 U.S. 1073 (1984), the court stated that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 \u201cwas directed against the use of sophisticated electronic equipment, and not against. . . rudimentary material. Under the statutory definitions, [a co-conspirator\u2019s] use of the phone receiver to overhear the conversation did not constitute a proscribed \u2018interception\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted) (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 228-229. Along the same lines, in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Poulos, </em>11 F.3d 271, 280 (1st Cir. 1993), the First Circuit stressed the difference between using sophisticated wiretap equipment and a standard-issue telephone for the purposes of determining whether a particular case of eavesdropping constituted a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. See also <em>Griggs-Ryan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>904 F.2d 112, 116 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasizing that not every overheard telephone conversation constitutes a violation of the Federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">It is true, as the defendant points out, that some courts have been reticent to exempt <em>all </em>forms of eavesdropping by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>means of residential extension phones from the purview of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. Specifically, in the context of divorce litigation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 has been applied to forbid the use of a residential phone by one spouse to make <em>recordings </em>of the other spouse\u2019s private conversations. However, as noted above, we have found no reported Federal decision in which there was deemed to be a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 in the residential extension phone context where no recording was made. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>63 F.3d at 1395 n.7; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>542 F.2d 661, 673 n.24 (6th Cir. 1976) (on \u201cvast difference between overhearing someone on an extension and installing an electronic listening device to monitor all incoming and outgoing calls\u201d). Moreover, apart from instances of interspousal spying, we have found no case in which the use of an extension phone to listen in on the calls of another member of the household has been deemed to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 \u2014 whether or not a recording was made. See <em>Scheib </em>v. <em>Grant, 22 </em>F.3d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In his brief, the defendant attacks the notion that there is any meaningful distinction between using an extension phone merely to listen in on a call and situations in which a recording device is employed. We disagree. Without doubt, both potentially involve invasions of privacy. However, as suggested in <em>Miller, 720 </em>F.2d at 228-229, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 is aimed at deterring a particular evil: the use of increasingly sophisticated electronic surveillance equipment for the purpose of eavesdropping on telephone conversations. A person who listens in on a residential extension phone simply does not pose the same threat to telecommunications security as a high-tech snooper. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>63 F.3d at 1394.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Absent a recording device, an eavesdropper on a residential line must be physically present in the home at the time of a particular call to intercept the conversation. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Otto, 2 </em>Cal. 4th 1088, 1106-1107, cert, denied, 506 U.S. 956 (1992). As a result, his opportunities are sharply diminished, and his chance of being detected is high.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, such situations are likely to involve only regular members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>household, as between whom there is often a diminished opportunity for maintaining the privacy of conversations in the first place. Such considerations appear to be the basis for Congress\u2019s limitation of the \u201cordinary course of business\u201d exception of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(5)(a)(i) to situations involving only basic telephone equipment and not appurtenant devices (e.g., tape recorders).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>542 F.2d at 673 n.24; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Robert Bosch Corp., </em>38 F.3d 736, 740 (4th Cir. 1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>63 F.3d at 1394-1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In view of the Federal case law, we conclude that Marquise\u2019s use of an extension phone in her home to eavesdrop on the call between her mother and the defendant \u2014 an act motivated by understandable concern for her sister \u2014 did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. Further, to the extent that the provisions of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, relating to the use of extension phones were modeled on the Federal law, see <em>Campiti </em>v. <em>Walonis, </em>611 F.2d 387, 395-396 (1st Cir. 1979), we likewise hold that Marquise\u2019s actions did not violate \u00a7 99. As the court observed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass, at 251:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201c[G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99] in major portion matches section for section the provisions of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520]. Admittedly, the phraseology of [the Massachusetts statute] is not word for word that of the Federal act. However, in substance the requirements of the Massachusetts statute are the same as those of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520], as the legislative history of [the Federal law] shows that they should be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Bolstering our conclusion in this regard is the near exact coincidence of the language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(5)(a)(i), and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 (B) (3), relating to the applicability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>law to extension phones.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the Supreme Judicial Court gave a fairly strong indication of its approach to eavesdropping in the home in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Todisco, </em>363 Mass. 445, 452 (1973), in which the court observed that \u201c[t]he clear and obvious legislative intent [of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99] was to prevent the illegal use of devices external and extraneous to the regular telephone equipment.\u201d A residential extension phone like the one used here by Marquise does not fall into this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Since there were no statutory violations, it is impossible to conclude that defens\u00e9 counsel\u2019s failure to press a motion to suppress Marquise\u2019s testimony \u201cdeprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence,\u201d a necessary prerequisite for relief where ineffective assistance of counsel is alleged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass, at 96. The defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective representation, therefore, fails.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">2. <em>Fresh Complaint. </em>When fresh complaint testimony is admitted, a defendant is entitled to have the jury informed that such evidence may be used for corroborative purposes only. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 396 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almon, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 721, 724 (1991). Moreover, while not a strict requirement, it is generally recommended that the judge provide the limiting charge at the same time the fresh complaint evidence is introduced. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 660 (1992). In conformity with this convention, the judge here charged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>jury at length on the proper use of fresh complaint evidence during the testimony of two of the three fresh complaint witnesses (without any objection by the defendant, no charge was given with respect to the very cursory testimony of a third corroborating witness). The defendant does not quibble with either the timing or content of these instructions, nor would he have a proper basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Rather, the defendant here assigns error to the lack of any final instruction on the use of fresh complaint evidence. However, while providing such an instruction is the preferred course, it is not absolutely essential. As the court previously has concluded, where, as here, the judge fully instructs the jury about fresh complaint principles during trial, the fresh complaint evidence does not constitute the major part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the evidence is not used to fill gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case, and \u2014 perhaps most important \u2014 no final instruction is requested by the defense, the failure to provide a final charge sua sponte does not constitute reversible error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Canning, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 279, 287-288 (1992). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 394-395 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Despite the defendant\u2019s contentions to the contrary, the present situation differs substantially from the facts of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almon, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 724-726, upon which the defendant heavily relies. There, the decision to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of the judge\u2019s omission of a final fresh complaint instruction expressly was predicated upon the fact that (1) there were an unusually large number of corroborating witnesses, each of whom provided detailed testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass, at 659-660 (relating to dangers of \u201cpiling on\u201d fresh complaint testimony); and (2) the Commonwealth\u2019s case was very weak. These same circumstances, however, were not present here. As noted, only two witnesses presented any detailed fresh complaint evidence at trial. Moreover, unlike the defendant in <em>Almon, </em>here the defendant\u2019s own admissions left little doubt that intercourse had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Likewise, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 761-762 (1995), also relied upon by the defendant, is inapplicable. There, the judge omitted contemporaneous instructions to the jury and then compounded his error by giving an incomplete description of the use of fresh complaint evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>in his final charge. In <em>Trowbridge, </em>therefore, the jury never were properly instructed on the issue. Such was not the case here. The judge\u2019s contemporaneous instructions were flawless. We also note that the decision to reverse in <em>Trowbridge </em>was not grounded solely on the error in fresh complaint instructions but rather was the result of an accumulation of errors. <em>Trowbridge, </em>like <em>Almon, </em>does not control our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">As noted, defense counsel failed to object to the trial judge\u2019s omission. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of practice that where a party alleges error in a charge he must bring the alleged error to the attention of the judge in specific terms in order to give the judge an opportunity to rectify the error, if \u00e1ny.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffee, </em>379 Mass. 353, 357 (1979). While errors not objected to at trial may provide a basis for reversal, this \u201cpower ... is rarely exercised,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pares-Ramirez, </em>400 Mass. 604, 609 (1987), and only where a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is posed, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). After a careful review of the record, we conclude that none exists in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Finally, the defendant has reasserted his argument relating to the use of fresh complaint evidence at his trial under the rubric of ineffective assistance of counsel, i.e., that his trial advocate fell below the performance standards delineated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass, at 96, by failing to object to the lack of a fresh complaint instruction in the judge\u2019s final charge. However, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619 (1994), the court concluded that the substantial risk analysis embodied in <em>Freeman </em>is functionally equivalent to the test contained in <em>Saferian </em>for determining whether putative attorney error requires a new trial. Where a defendant is not entitled to relief under one standard, he is likewise entitled to no remedy under the other. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass, at 624 n.4. Accordingly, having already determined that the defendant is not entitled to any relief for the alleged trial errors under <em>Freeman </em>principles, we need not consider them again.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Marquise testified that after her mother had hung up (and so, presumably, the defendant thought no one was on the line), the defendant laughingly stated: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t she let me marry her?

There, in considering whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 barred the use of a husband\u2019s tape recordings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>his wife\u2019s conversations in the wife\u2019s trial for the husband\u2019s murder, the Supreme Court of California concluded that \u201c[t]he differences between casually overhearing part of a conversation on an extension phone and intentionally wiretapping all incoming and outgoing calls [with a tape recorder] are substantial. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The \u201cordinary course of business\u201d exception of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510(5)(a)(i) extends only to \u201cany telephone or telegraph instrument . . . furnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The Federal statute exempts telephone equipment \u201cfurnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business and used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business . . .\u201d while the State exemption applies to equipment \u201cfurnished to a subscriber or user by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business under its tariff and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">We note in passing that even had we concluded that Marquise\u2019s testimony was improperly admitted, we likely would have deemed the error harmless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 352 n.5 (1993) (distinguishing standards of review for claims of constitutional versus nonconstitutional error). The defendant admitted to investigating officers that he had intercourse with the victim, and Marquise\u2019s contested testimony did no more than confirm that fact. Although the defendant used vulgar language during the telephone conversation, see n.l <em>supra, </em>nothing that he said bore on the issue of consent, the key issue in dispute at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
