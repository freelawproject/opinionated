In response to the officer\u2019s questions, the defendant stated that he was the operator of the vehicle, that he was drunk and should be arrested. The officer accommodated him, and the defendant later was convicted by a District Court jury of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24). The only issue on appeal is whether the defendant\u2019s admission of operation was sufficiently corroborated to support the denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The Commonwealth\u2019s case consisted entirely of the officer\u2019s testimony which essentially was as follows: Responding to an 8:30 p.m. radio call on February 4, 1994, at an intersection near South Station, he saw a 1993 Pontiac on a traffic island in the middle of the intersection and \u201cresting on top of a downed . . . traffic control signal.\u201d He observed firefighters rolling up fire hoses and that the Pontiac was \u201csoaked . . . with water\u201d and \u201cstill smoldering.\u201d After a conversation with a fire lieutenant, the officer walked across the street to the defendant, who was standing alone on the sidewalk approximately thirty feet from the Pontiac. Next to the defendant was a brief case, a golf bag, and fishing tackle. The officer observed \u201ca couple of people on the other side of the intersection . . . probably . . . fifteen, twenty feet\u201d from the Pontiac. He did not recall there being more than seven or eight people, other than police and firefighters, in that entire area at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In response to the officer\u2019s questions, the defendant stated that he was the operator of the Pontiac and that he had not been injured in the accident. He also produced a Missouri driver\u2019s license and indicated that the registration was in the Pontiac and that the vehicle was a rental, a fact later verified by the police. An odor of alcohol about the defendant gave rise to further questions, leading the defendant to say he had consumed four drinks. The officer, applying field sobriety tests, then asked the defendant to recite the alphabet. After three failed attempts at recitation, the defendant was able to sing the entire alphabet. There followed a balancing test (standing on one leg while touching the tip of one\u2019s nose with the right and then the left index finger) which the defendant performed successfully, just before blurting out that he was drunk arid should be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The defendant relies on the corroboration rule, adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, 392 </em>Mass. 453, 457-458 (1984), and holding that a conviction may not be based solely on evidence of an extrajudicial confession by the. accused. <em>Id. </em>at 457. \u201c[T]he corroboration rule applies to admissions as well as confessions,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>411 Mass. 371, 375 (1991), and where the evidence offered in corroboration of an out-of-court admission is entirely ambiguous and speculative, it is error to deny a defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>401 Mass. 470, 473 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cIn its typical form, the corroboration rule requires that there be some evidence tending to establish the \u2018corpus delicti\u2019 .. . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra </em>at 458.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Noting that the purpose of the rule is \u201cto guard against conviction for imaginary crimes,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Supreme Judicial Court adopted an orthodox definition of \u201ccorpus delicti\u201d as meaning merely \u201cthe specific kind of loss or injury embraced in the crime charged\u201d and not requiring also evidence of \u201ca criminal agency as the source of that loss or injury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThus, in a homicide case, the corroborating evidence need only tend to show that the alleged victim is dead.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consistent with this approach, the court declared that \u201c[t]he corroborating evidence need not point to the accused\u2019s identity as the doer of the crime.\u201d <em>Ibid. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 947, 948 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The statute under which the defendant is charged, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), as amended through St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 IB, permits conviction upon proof that a defendant, \u201cupon any way . . . operate[d] a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . .\u201d It does not require within its elements proof of tangible injury or an identifiable victim. Accordingly, the orthodox definition of \u201ccorpus delicti\u201d discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>392 Mass, at 458, does not directly advance our analysis. The Federal courts have chosen with respect to Federal crimes \u201cin which there is no tangible corpus delicti\u201d to require that \u201cthe corroborative evidence must implicate the accused in order to show that a crime has been committed.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 147, 154 (1954). <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 489 n.15 (1963). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez-Alvarez, </em>970 F.2d 583, 591 (9th Cir. 1992); 7 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2072 &amp; n.4 (Chadbourn rev. 1978 &amp; Supp. 1996). Our decisions, however, do not appear to have adopted the Federal approach in cases in which tangible loss or injury is not an aspect of the elements of the charged crime. Rather, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>401 Mass, at 472-473, the Supreme Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Court, in reviewing a conviction under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, alluded to, and apparently adopted as a standard, its statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>392 Mass, at 458, that the required corroboration be \u201csome evidence, besides the confession, that the criminal act was committed by someone, that is, that the crime was real and not imaginary.\u201d In another case involving application of the corroboration rule to a conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol, this court also relied on the statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra, </em>to the effect that independent evidence that the crime was real was sufficient to corroborate. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNel-ley, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 985, 987 (1990). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>421 Mass. 289, 291 (1995), which states that the element of operation requires corroborative evidence that the defendant was the driver but relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra, </em>as establishing the standard for corroborative evidence in an operating under the influence prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u201cThe test governing the required finding issue is the familiar one stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), and, in satisfying that test, the Commonwealth may rely on reasonable inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>421 Mass, at 290-291.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cInferences drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need not be inescapable or necessaxy, so long as they are reasonable, possible and not unwarranted because too remote.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullen, </em>395 Mass. 225, 230 (1985), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">At trial, there was ample corroborative evidence that the charged crime had occurred. The position of the Pontiac, on an island in the middle of the intersection and resting on top of a toppled traffic control signal, alone was sufficient to raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>an inference of operating under the influence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>398 Mass. 63, 68 (1986) (\u201cThe manner in which the automobile was parked, half on the street and half on the sidewalk, was evidence that it may have been driven by a driver under the influence of alcohol\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Even if the Federal approach or that intimated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>421 Mass, at 291, were to be applied, there is sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that the defendant operated the Pontiac. Its location, coupled with evidence of a recent fire, support the conclusion that it had been driven shortly before the officer arrived. The peculiar circumstances in which the defendant was observed while standing alone, not far from the Pontiac, coupled with his knowledge of the fact that it \u201cwas a rental\u201d reasonably could connect him to the vehicle. Such circumstances and facts combined with \u201cthe defendant\u2019s cooperation with the field sobriety tests\u201d permit an inference of operation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>420 Mass. 630, 632 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Towers, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 561 (1993). Such an inference is also supported by the failure of the bystanders at the scene to dispute the defendant\u2019s identity as the operator when the officer obviously was treating him as such by administering the field sobriety tests. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>421 Mass, at 291. \u201cThe fact that there were other persons present at the scene, unsupported by evidence tending to suggest that someone other than the defendant was operating the [Pontiac], cannot serve to undermine the probative value of the corroborative evidence previously discussed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291-292. That an item of evidence reasonably supporting operation may not be compelling does not render it fatally ambiguous or unduly speculative, especially when considered with other equally reasonable inferences tending to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Titerally meaning \u201cthe body of a crime,\u201d \u201ccorpus delicti\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he body (material substance) upon which a crime has been committed, <em>e.g., </em>the corpse of a murdered man, the charred remains of a house burned down.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 310 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\">For further discussion of the purpose of the rule, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra </em>at 457, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landenburg, post </em>23 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">There is an indication in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>411 Mass, at 374, that the standard for the corroboration rule may be less demanding and may require \u201cmerely that \u2018there be some evidence, besides the confession, that the criminal act was committed by someone, that is, that the crime was real and not imaginary,\u2019 \u201d quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>392 Mass, at 458. This standard may perhaps be harmonized with the adoption in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde </em>of the orthodox meaning of \u201ccorpus delicti,\u201d by limiting it to cases other than homicide prosecutions which require proof of tangible injury or an identifiable victim and by requiring evidence implicating the accused in crimes in which there is no tangible \u201ccorpus delicti.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
