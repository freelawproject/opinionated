Abodeely Insurance Agency, Inc. (Abodeely), advising it that its agency contract was cancelled, effective May 31, 1990.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reason given for the cancellation was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201cfailure to report coverages bound in accordance with the agency agreement, and acceptance of business which does not conform to our underwriting criteria.\u201d Claiming that the stated basis for the cancellation was a pretext and that the true reason was Commerce\u2019s desire to eliminate Abodeely as a competitor of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Abodeely brought this action for breach of contract. On the basis of conflicting evidence on the issues of Abodeely\u2019s history of late reporting and accepting risks outside Commerce\u2019s underwriting criteria, the jury found that there had been no material breach of the agency contract and awarded damages to Abodeely. The principal issue on Commerce\u2019s appeal is whether it could cancel the agency contract \u201cat will\u201d or whether, as the jury was instructed, a material breach was required before Commerce could cancel the contract without liability. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">1. <em>The facts. </em>There is no dispute that the contract between Abodeely and Commerce required Abodeely to follow Commerce\u2019s underwriting rules and policies in soliciting business, binding Commerce, and issuing policies. The contract also required Abodeely to mail Commerce a \u201ccomplete report of each binder ... on the day of its execution and not later than its effective date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">There is also no dispute that on or about September 12, 1989, a binder was issued by Abodeely on property that was destroyed by a fire on October 4, 1989, in which two people died. The first notice given Commerce that it had been bound by Abodeely was on October 5, 1989, by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">What was very much in dispute at trial was whether Abodeely\u2019s history of late reporting of binders was peculiar to it or a tolerated practice also engaged in by other agents of Commerce and whether the most recently destroyed property was, consistent with Commerce\u2019s underwriting guidelines, located \u201cin a safe area, relatively free from crime . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Against the backdrop of the factual disputes to be resolved by the jury in determining whether Commerce\u2019s cancellation of the agency contract was in breach of its terms, we set out the pertinent paragraphs of Article VII, the termination provisions of the agency contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201ca. This Agreement is terminable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">(1) <em>Immediately </em>upon written notice by the Agent to the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">(2) <em>Immediately </em>and without prior notice to the Agent if any public authority suspends, revokes, or refuses to renew the Agent\u2019s license or certificate of authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">(3) At the Company\u2019s option in the event of merger, sale, or transfer of the Agent\u2019s business, or upon formation or termination of any corporation or partnership by the Agent, unless the Agent promptly notifies the Company prior to such event and the Company consents in writing to the assignment of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">(4) By either party <em>immediately </em>upon written notice to the other in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, abandonment, willful misconduct, fraud, abuse of authority, or failure to pay monies due after written demand therefore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">\u201cb. It is the intention of both parties to this contract to make a genuine attempt to resolve <em>any differences </em>that may precipitate a termination of this Agreement. If such a solution is not found, then upon not less than 180 days\u2019 written notice by the Company to the Agent, the Agent\u2019s authority to solicit and issue policies increasing the Company\u2019s liability, exposure or risk shall cease as of the Termination Date.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">The contract did not indicate that it was to be in effect for a specified period and did not have an expiration date; it was terminable only under the provisions of Article VII, set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">Disagreement concerning the meaning of the contract was resolved by the trial judge on Abodeely\u2019s motion in limine seeking to preclude any mention or evidence of grounds for termination of the contract other than those set out in paragraph (a) which, as argued by Abodeely, was simply modified by paragraph (b). Commerce argued that the contract was terminable at will and that paragraph (b) gave it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>rights to terminate in addition to those set out in paragraph (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both readings of the contract were rejected by the judge who concluded that paragraph (b) controlled the procedures to be followed in respect to any material breach other than those that allowed for an immediate termination of the contract under paragraph (a). Consistent with his reading of the contract, the judge ruled that Commerce could introduce evidence at trial of a breach of contract or of a fiduciary duty by acts by Abodeely beyond those specified in paragraph (a). In response to special questions, the jury found that, although both parties had made a genuine effort to resolve their differences, there was no material breach of the contract by Abodeely.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">2. <em>Termination of the contract. </em>When construing a contract, the following rules apply. \u201cA contract is to be construed to give reasonable effect to each of its provisions. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Monarch Life Ins. Co., </em>345 Mass. 261, 264 (1962). \u2018[Ejvery phrase and clause must be presumed to have been designedly employed, and must be given meaning and effect, whenever practicable, when construed with all the other phraseology contained in the instrument, which must be considered as a workable and harmonious means for carrying out and effectuating the intent of the parties.\u2019 <em>Charles I. Hosmer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>302 Mass. 495, 501 (1939).\u201d <em>J. A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 789, 795 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">As stated by the trial judge in his memorandum of decision: \u201cA contract will not be deemed to be terminable at will merely because it contains no precise expiration date, if the contract delineates the circumstances in which the parties may cease to be obligated to perform it. <em>Kirkley </em>v. <em>F. H. Roberts Co., </em>268 Mass. 246, 252 (1929). <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Boston Copper Co., </em>15 Pick. 351, 361 (1834). Since Article VII specifies circumstances in which either or both of the parties could terminate the agreement, it is not terminable at will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">On appeal, Commerce argues that paragraph (b) allows it to terminate the contract on the basis of <em>\u201cany </em>differences\u201d between the parties that they were unable to resolve. A majority of the panel concludes, however, that mandatory participation in a negotiation process triggered by differences that could result in a termination of the contract is inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>with an \u201cat will\u201d contract. As observed in <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96, 101 (1977), a contract that \u201creservefs] to the parties an explicit power to terminate the contract without cause on written notice\u201d is a \u201cclassic terminable at will employment contract.\u201d Such a reservation of power cannot be said reasonably to have been made here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">From this conclusion, that Commerce could not terminate its relationship with Abodeely at will, the judge considered what circumstances or occurrences would excuse Commerce from any further obligation under the contract. Relying upon <em>Ward </em>v. <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 98, 100-101 (1983) (\u201cIt is well established that a material breach by one party excuses the other party from further performance under the contract\u201d), the trial judge concluded that the only type of difference that \u201clegitimately\u201d could precipitate a termination of the agreement would be a material breach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, and as recognized by the trial judge, to read paragraph (b) as simply giving a right to cancel the contract for a material breach would be to render the provision mere surplusage: a material breach of the contract by one party would excuse the other from further performance irrespective of paragraph (b) and as matter of law. See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 237 (1981) (\u201c[I]t is a condition of each party\u2019s remaining duties to render performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises that there be no uncured material failure by the other party to render any such performance due at an earlier time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">This reasoning compelled the trial judge to conclude that to give paragraph (b) meaning and effect (see <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass, at 795) it must be read as a <em>limitation </em>upon the right to be excused, as matter of law, from any further obligation under the contract on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>a material breach. Put another way, the trial judge determined that, in the event of a material breach <em>other </em>than those described in paragraph (a)(2) and (a)(4), which allow for immediate termination, paragraph (b) obligates the parties genuinely to attempt a resolution before exercising the right to refuse further performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Based upon his reading of Article VII, the trial judge correctly left it to the jury to decide whether, on the basis of the circumstances of the case, Abodeely\u2019s failures constituted a material breach of the contract under paragraph (b). See <em>Lander </em>v. <em>Samuel Heller Leather Co., </em>314 Mass. 592, 595-596 (1943); <em>Cetrone </em>v. <em>Paul Livoli, Inc., </em>337 Mass. 607, 610 (1958); <em>Boston Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass. 184, 200 (1973). Although a majority of the panel has concluded that Commerce did not have the right to terminate Abodeely at will, we do not think it necessary to determine whether the trial judge was correct in construing the disputed phrase, \u201cany differences that may precipitate a termination of this Agreement,\u201d to mean a material breach other than one specified in paragraph (a)(2) and (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Even if paragraph (b) were to be construed as giving Commerce the right to terminate the contract for less than a material breach by Abodeely, we would conclude that \u201cany differences\u201d cited by Commerce would have to be found to be, at the very least, objectively reasonable and honest. Cf. <em>Salem Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph Rugo, Inc., </em>343 Mass. 103, 106 (1961); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allmon, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 712, 715 (1984). Such a determination would also be one for the jury to make based upon the circumstances of the case. However, even were we to read Commerce\u2019s requests for jury instructions generously and conclude that they squarely asked the trial judge to put to the jury the issue of whether its reasons for terminating the contract were objectively reasonable and honest even if Abodeely was not in material breach of the contract, Commerce makes no complaint on appeal about the form of the special questions or the trial judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested instructions. Instead, Commerce relies solely on the argument that it has made from the outset, that it could terminate the contract at will. In these circumstances, it is unnecessaiy for us to go beyond the conclusion that Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the contract is erroneous. See <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Ferrera Bros. Inc., </em>306 Mass. 90, 92-93 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>3. <em>The breach of the contract. </em>There is ample support in the record for the trial judge\u2019s determination that the evidence was sufficient to put to the jury the question of whether Abodeely\u2019s actions rose to the level of a material breach of the contract. Commerce\u2019s arguments, that it was entitled to a directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or a new trial, are premised upon its .claim of an \u201cat will\u201d contract and erroneously rely almost exclusively upon the evidence favorable to its position<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> without taking into account that presented by Abodeely. See <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Honeyman, </em>406 Mass. 43, 45-46 (1989); <em>Foster </em>v. <em>The Loft, Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 292 (1988), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">4. <em>Inconsistent verdicts. </em>Although Commerce argues that there is an inconsistency between the jury\u2019s general verdict (that Commerce was liable on Abodeely\u2019s action for breach of contract) and its answer to an interrogatory (that Commerce made a genuine attempt to resolve any differences with Abodeely), the record shows that the case was submitted to the jury with special questions rather than with written interrogatories accompanied by a general verdict form. Compare Mass.R.Civ.P. 49(a) with 49(b), 365 Mass. 813 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u201cUnder rule 49 (a), the jurors return answers to each question or each issue submitted to them. The jurors do not return a general verdict. The answers to the questions or issues submitted are considered a special verdict consisting of \u2018a statement of facts the jury have found from which the judge determines the appropriate judgment.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lic-ciardi, </em>387 Mass. 670, 675 (1982). In determining whether there is an inconsistency in the jury\u2019s answers, the answers are to be viewed in the light of the attendant circumstances, including the pleadings, issues submitted, and the judge\u2019s instructions. If the jury\u2019s answers can be harmonized, they must be resolved so as to harmonize them.\u201d <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 800 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>In response to the four questions put to them,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the jury answered that Abodeely did not materially breach the contract, that Abodeely did not materially breach its fiduciary duty, that Abodeely did make a genuine attempt to resolve any differences with Commerce, and that Commerce did make a genuine attempt to resolve any differences with Abodeely. Commerce does not argue, nor could it, that there is an inconsistency in the jury\u2019s answers to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Even were we to construe Commerce\u2019s argument to be that the judgment awarding Abodeely damages for breach of contract was inconsistent with the jury\u2019s finding that Commerce had made a genuine attempt to resolve any differences with Abodeely, that contention would also fail. Neither paragraph (b) nor the law provides that a party\u2019s attempt to resolve any differences arising out of the performance of a contract excuses that party from further performance of its contractual obligations. As put to the jury, Commerce\u2019s cancellation of the contract could be excused only by Abodeely\u2019s material breach. The judgment against Commerce is, therefore, consistent with the jury\u2019s determination that Abodeely did not materially breach the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-16\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 163, as amended through St. 1977, c. 910, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNo company shall cancel the authority of any independent insurance agent for fire or casualty insurance, or both, if said agent is not an employee of said company . . . unless the company gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>written notice of its intent to cancel such agent ... at least one hundred and eighty days before the proposed effective date of any such cancellation . . . .\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Neither party argued that evidence extrinsic to the agreement was necessary to an interpretation of Article VII.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Justice Armstrong would read paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) as a listing of reasons for termination that justify Commerce in dispensing with good faith discussions prior to sending its termination notice, and he would hold that paragraph (b) allows Commerce to terminate for any reason, subject to its obligation first to discuss with Abodeely in good faith a possible resolution of differences between them. Based upon that reading of the contract and the jury\u2019s determination that the parties did make a genuine attempt to resolve their differences, Justice Armstrong would reverse the judgment and enter judgment for Commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">We construe the word \u201clegitimately,\u201d as used by the trial judge, to mean \u201clawfully\u201d or \u201cwithout liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Commerce makes a separate but somewhat related argument concerning the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of evidence which it claims would have shown the degree of the risk involved in insuring the property that was destroyed by fire.
