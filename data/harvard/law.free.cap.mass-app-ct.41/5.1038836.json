L. c. 266, \u00a7 14) and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A). He claims on appeal that an evidentiary ruling by the trial judge was harmful error. We think not, and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">After wounding an occupant with a knife, the burglar fled the premises. As he was hurrying down the street away from the dwelling, an unknown voice from the direction in which he was heading called out, \u201cDavid.\u201d Testimony to that effect was objected to by the defendant as \u201cobviously a highly prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>udicial statement.\u201d The trial judge admitted it. as \u201cpart of the res gestae.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The statement was an out-of-court declaration offered to show that the person hurrying away from the dwelling was the defendant; that is to say, it was hearsay. Such a statement is inadmissible in evidence unless it comes within a recognized exception to the rule of exclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The term res gestae (part of the happening) is in judicial and academic disfavor. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.16 (6th ed. 1994); Hughes, Evidence \u00a7 569 (1961). However, under labels that are more precisely descriptive or explanatory, as \u201cspontaneous exclamation\u201d or \u201cexcited utterance,\u201d such statements are admitted, provided that they relate to the event at issue and bear indicia of trustworthiness, e.g., spontaneity and absence of a motive to fabricate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>420 Mass. 226, 233-234 (1995). Trial judges have broad discretion to decide admissibility, see <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Boston-Leader, Inc., </em>340 Mass. 195, 197 (1960), and the prosecution is not required \u201cto produce the declarant at trial or to demonstrate unavailability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>417 Mass. 350, 364 (1994). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 604, 606-607 (1994); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.16, at 520 (6th ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 1995).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge here ruled, in effect, that the requirements for admission as a spontaneous exclamation exception to the hearsay rule were met, and we do not disturb that exercise of her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">As noted, the defendant objected to the evidence on rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>vancy grounds, i.e., that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This case would be different if the unidentified voice had called out \u201cRocky,\u201d without proof that is the defendant\u2019s nickname. The probative relationship between \u201cRocky\u201d and Rockett, without more, would be too conjectural. (If, on the other hand, the voice had said, \u201cDavid Rock-ett, where are you going?\u201d relevancy would not be an issue.) We have long taken an expansive view of relevancy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>414 Mass. 343, 356, cert, denied, 510 U.S. 815 (1993). In order to admit the evidence, the inference that the proponent is asking the jury to draw need not be the only plausible one. The trial judge\u2019s admission of \u201cDavid\u201d was not an abuse of her discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In addition to the foregoing considerations, we note that there was other evidence identifying the defendant as the burglar. In particular, Paul Cabral, who had been in the presence of the defendant previous to that night testified that he and the man with a knife, who jumped off the dwelling steps and ran down the street, looked at each other, and that man was the defendant. His description of the person\u2019s build and what he was wearing matched the description given by the witness who heard \u201cDavid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s initial proffer called the evidence \u201chearsay\u201d that should be admitted as \u201ceither an excited utterance, or as a present sense impression.\u201d The defendant\u2019s objection, like his contention here, was on relevancy grounds, i.e., the word \u201cDavid\u201d was prejudicial but not probative because its meaning was uncertain and because, the declarant being unknown, it was without foundation. It appears from her ruling that the judge analyzed it as hearsay. Neither ground of objection has merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\">We do not invoke the line of authority to the effect that such statements, whether or not they are labeled hearsay, are admissible to give the jury the benefit of the complete occurrence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>300 Mass. 45, 50 (1938); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>356 Mass. 604, 609 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, 376 </em>Mass. 201, 207 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The defendant does not contend that he was deprived of his constitutional rights either under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution or art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The issue whether art. 12 affords broader rights than the Sixth Amendment has not yet been addressed. See <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 366; <em>Alvarado, supra </em>at 606 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\">A relevancy objection is different from a hearsay one, but here the two objections are closely related. One way of arguing that an excited utterance does not relate to the underlying event is to urge that the relationship between the fact (\u201cDavid\u201d) and the ultimate issue (the identity of the burglar) is too speculative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel, while objecting to that testimony, impliedly conceded its relevancy by arguing, not that some other \u201cDavid\u201d was being called and that the linkage to the defendant would be unfairly conjectural, but that the word was perhaps \u201cbehave\u201d or some other sound-alike.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
