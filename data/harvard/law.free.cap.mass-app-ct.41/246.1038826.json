Lisbon, had been a steward at the Bristol County house of correction for ten years when he suffered an incapacitating heart attack on March 30, 1989, while working at the facility\u2019s cook house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on the 1991 medical opinion of his personal physician and the certificate of a regional medical panel, Lisbon claimed accidental disability benefits, pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), on the ground that his attack was precipitated by a prison riot and a confrontation with prisoners on March 30, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Citing Lisbon\u2019s many health problems that predated his jail employment (which included coronary artery disease, three prior heart attacks, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, unhealthy eating habits, and a long-term smoking habit that lasted until 1988) as the more likely cause of his incapacity, the Bristol County Retirement Board (the board) rejected Lisbon\u2019s claim. On Lisbon\u2019s appeal to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), an administrative magistrate recommended approval of his benefit application on the strength of his medical evidence. CRAB, however, concluded that Lisbon had failed to establish that his disabling heart attack was the result of an incident or a series of incidents occurring while in the performance of his duties rather than the product of the natural progression of his coronaiy arteiy disease and associated long-term illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Lisbon sought judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>A judge in the Superior Court found the magistrate\u2019s analysis persuasive and ruled that CRAB had wrongly denied Lisbon accidental disability benefits. On the board\u2019s appeal, we conclude that CRAB did not err in determining that Lisbon had failed to demonstrate his entitlement to those benefits and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Background. </em>The relevant factual background of this case is undisputed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lisbon had, as noted above, a long history of medical problems, including \u201c[arteriojsclerotic coronary heart disease.\u201d During the time he was employed as a cook at the Bristol correctional facility, he had experienced an \u201cinferior wall myocardial infarction\u201d in 1983 and \u201ccoronary episodes\u201d in 1986 and 1987. All of these \u201cheart attacks\u201d required hospitalization but were not (on this record) job-related. On March 30, 1989, while Lisbon was working at the cook house, a prison riot broke out elsewhere at the facility. Lisbon could see some of the riot from his cook house window, including inmates setting fires in the prison yard. At one point, \u201cseveral\u201d inmates entered the cook house, but left without incident when Lisbon ordered them out. There is no indication that the inmates said or did anything to menace or threaten Lisbon. He nonetheless locked the cook house. Correction officials shut down the jail and ordered all personnel, including Lisbon, to remain at their stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Soon thereafter, Lisbon began to have chest pain and was taken to the rear gate where emergency equipment and riot police were located. Lisbon was there examined by emergency medical technicians and then taken to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. He was diagnosed as having \u201ccoronary artery disease\u201d and remained hospitalized for two and one-half weeks. His personal physician noted in a January, 1991, report to Lisbon\u2019s attorney that Lisbon\u2019s chest pain was \u201cclearly related\u201d to emotional and physical stress experienced at the jail during the riot and that Lisbon had suffered a \u201cmyocardial infarction\u201d at work. Lisbon has not worked since March 30, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Lisbon applied for accidental disability retirement in July, 1990. On his application, Lisbon cited his March 30, 1989, \u201cheart attack\u201d as the \u201cpersonal injury or hazard undergone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>by reason of which [he] claimed to be incapacitated.\u201d His claim was confirmed, as noted above, by the written opinion of his personal physician, who also concluded that Lisbon was permanently disabled by reason of the job-related injury. Following a July 17, 1991, examination, a regional medical panel certified that Lisbon was permanently disabled and that his disability was \u201csuch as might be the natural and proximate result of personal injury sustained or hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Because the medical panel suggested that it had, to some extent, relied on the \u201cheart law,\u201d G. L. c. 32 \u00a7 94,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in reaching its decision, despite Lisbon\u2019s ineligibility under that law, the board sought clarification from the medical panel. In October, 1991, the chairman of the panel responded, stating that \u201c[djespite our statement to the contrary, Mr. Lisbon\u2019s application for disability retirement was not considered under the \u2018Heart Law\u2019 but rather under Accidental Disability.\u201d The panel also declined to amend its conclusions. The chairman further stated: \u201cA detailed history regarding the confrontation [at the jail on March 30, 1989] was obtained and this convinced the Panel that it was highly stressful and productive of symptoms leading to his hospitalization. . . . The Panel finds there is a causal link to work in this case, despite the cited risk factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">On November 20, 1991, the board denied Lisbon\u2019s application. Lisbon filed an administrative appeal to CRAB. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>administrative magistrate of the Division of Administrative Law Appeals heard the case on March <em>4, </em>1993. The only testifying witness was Lisbon; all medical evidence was documentaiy. On May 15, 1993, the magistrate recommended that the board award Lisbon accidental disability retirement benefits, concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cThe Appellant is an employee of the Bristol County House of Correction. He is not an employee of the Department of Correction and therefore is not entitled to the presumption under G. L. c. 32 sec. 94. While his duties may be the same as an employee within the Department of Correction, the statute is specific as to who is included and entitled to the \u2018heart law\u2019 presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">\u201cThe medical panel has found that the riot of March 30, 1989, with regard to the Appellant, was highly stressful and productive of symptoms leading to his hospitalization and a heart attack. It was their opinion, originally and upon request for clarification, that the riot was the causal link leading to Mr. Lisbon\u2019s disability. The panel was aware of the Appellant\u2019s past medical history and the risk factorfs] he had with regard to heart disease before they made their decision. No evidence was introduced to rebut the findings of the panel or to show that the panel employed an erroneous standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cBased on the above, I find that the Appellant has established that the riot of March 30, 1989, was the cause of his disability. This matter is remanded to the Respondent for the awarding of accidental disability benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The board objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision and requested that CRAB deny Lisbon\u2019s application for disability retirement. On October 23, 1993, CRAB adopted the magistrate\u2019s factual findings, but denied Lisbon disability benefits on the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">\u201cA condition precedent to the allowance of accidental retirement benefits is the affirmative certification by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>majority of the Medical Panel that the applicant is substantially unable to perform his duties, that such disability is likely to be permanent, and that there is a medical possibility of a causal relationship between the disability and a personal injury or hazard undergone while in the performance of his duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201cIn this case, the members of the Medical Panel certified that in their opinion [Lisbon] is permanently disabled from performing the duties of a steward at the Bristol County House of Correction and further indicated that there is a medical possibility of a causal relationship between the Appellant\u2019s disability and a personal injury or hazard undergone while he was in the performance of his duties. Nonetheless, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, \u2018gives to the local board [and subsequently on appeal to this Board], the determination whether, on the relevant evidence, the causal relationship exists.\u2019 <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 756 (1993).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cHere the facts indicate that the Appellant was working in the cook house when a riot broke out on March 30, 1989. He viewed the disturbance out a window and, when several inmates entered the cook house, he ordered them out. Later he experienced chest pain. The facts also indicate that the Appellant has a past history of hypertension, coronary problems, exogenous obesity and diabetes mellitus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">\u201cThe burden is on the Appellant to prove the causal nexus between his disability and an incident or series of incidents occurring while in the performance of his duties which resulted in that disability. The Appellee, consistent with its responsibilities, held that the Appellant failed to sustain that burden. Based upon the facts as found and the evidence presented herein, this Board concurs with that finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201cThe decision of the Appellee denying the Appellant\u2019s application for accidental retirement benefits is, therefore, affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>On November 12, 1993, Lisbon filed this action for review of CRAB\u2019s adverse decision. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge characterized CRAB\u2019s determination that Lisbon had failed to sustain his burden of proving work-related causation as \u201cconclusory . . . [and] against the clear weight of the evidence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> .... [It] reverses, without reason, the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s [ALJ] well founded conclusion that [Lisbon] is entitled to benefits. The record overwhelmingly indicates that [Lisbon\u2019s] exposure to the rioting prisoners caused him to suffer a heart attack.\u201d The judge observed that CRAB provided no \u201cadequate explanation [or] . . . basis for its disagreement with the ALJ, from which this court concludes that the agency\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d The instant appeal followed. We uphold CRAB\u2019s disposition, however, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">1. The judge, citing <em>Vinal </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 100 (1982), reversed CRAB in substantial part because CRAB failed to \u201cexplain\u201d its \u201cdisagreement\u201d (as perceived by the judge) with the magistrate\u2019s \u201crulings\u201d regarding causation. That failing the judge regarded as fatally depriving CRAB\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d of substantial eviden-tiary support. The judge\u2019s conclusion in this regard was not, however, supported or mandated by <em>Vinal. </em>The only occasion requiring agency explanation for its disagreement with a hearing officer\u2019s findings arises when those findings are based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>upon live witness testimony and credibility determinations made thereon. <em>Vinal, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 100-102. No such medical (or other) testimony was presented here with respect to the issue of causation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">CRAB\u2019s d. ision, agreeing with that of the board, explicitly concluded on the basis of medical and other evidence, including the magistrate\u2019s subsidiary findings (which CRAB expressly adopted), that Lisbon had not sufficiently established causation. CRAB\u2019s statement satisfied its responsibility to provide a reasoned articulation for its rejection of the magistrate\u2019s recommendation so as to allow meaningful appellate review. See <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>369 Mass. 488, 497 (1976); <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 483 n.2 (1985). The judge erred insofar as he held CRAB\u2019s decision to be inadequately explanatory and for that supposed reason unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">2. In ruling that Lisbon was entitled to disability benefits, the judge rested on the magistrate\u2019s decision, which he praised as being \u201cwell founded\u201d on the basis of \u201coverwhelming[ ] [evidence].\u201d The magistrate\u2019s decision was, unfortunately, doubly flawed. The magistrate explicitly based his conclusion upon the medical panel\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d that the riot \u201cwas highly stress<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ful and productive of symptoms leading to [Lisbon\u2019s] hospitalization and a heart attack\u201d and the panel\u2019s \u201copinion, originally and upon request for clarification, that the riot was the causal link leading to Mr. Lisbon\u2019s disability.\u201d The medical panel certification did not, however, include any such \u201cfindings.\u201d As was its obligation, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3); 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.10(8) (1989), the panel certified only whether or not the disability was \u201csuch as <em>might be </em>the natural and proximate result of the personal injury sustained or hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed\u201d (emphasis added), in Lisbon\u2019s case responding affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Such a medical panel certification \u201cis not conclusive of the ultimate fact of causal connection but stands only as some evidence on the issue.\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 483. It is a mere statement of \u201cmedical possibility.\u201d <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 756, 762 (1993). \u201cThe final determination . . . whether causation was proved [is] reserved to [CRAB], based on the facts found and all the underlying evidence, including both the medical and non-medical facts.\u201d <em>Blanchette, supra. </em>See also <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>341 Mass. 611, 616 (1961). The existence of such an affirmative certification is not in itself a basis for concluding that an applicant has satisfied his burden of proving the causal connection between his disability and a work-related accident or incident, see <em>id. </em>at 614; <em>Wakefield Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>352 Mass. 499, 502-503 (1967); <em>Shrewsbury Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 379, 381 (1977), particularly in light of \u201cthe strict causation standard imposed by [G. L. c. 32].\u201d <em>Blanchette, supra </em>at 485. To the extent the magistrate\u2019s causation decision in favor of Lisbon rested on the medical panel\u2019s original certification, it could have been reasonably set aside by CRAB, and the judge\u2019s conclusion relying on that decision is similarly vulnerable. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The magistrate further improperly relied on the chairman of the medical panel\u2019s subsequent letter of \u201cclarification\u201d stating that there \u201cis a causal link\u201d between the riot and Lisbon\u2019s disabling condition. The chairman\u2019s statement, even assuming it accurately reflected the other panelists\u2019 opinions (as to which the record is silent), is entitled to no weight. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>panel has no statutory authority to express an unqualified . . . opinion as to causation, and such an opinion, if expressed, is a nullity . . . [T]he statute gives to the local board, not to the panel, the determination whether, on the relevant evidence, the causal relationship exists.\u201d <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 762. The chairman\u2019s statement was the sort of \u201cgratuitous\u201d observation \u2014 going beyond the panel\u2019s statutory duty by opining about actual causation and evaluating purported evidence of causation \u2014 that is inappropriate in disability retirement proceedings. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>341 Mass, at 613-614; <em>Wakefield Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>352 Mass, at 502-503; <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 761-762. The judge\u2019s approbation of the magistrate\u2019s dependence upon such ultra vires medical panel views is derivatively inappropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">3. Lisbon had the burden of proof on the question whether there existed the requisite causal relationship between his incapacity and a work-related incident. See <em>Wakefield Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>352 Mass, at 502. To discharge that burden, it was incumbent upon him to establish his case by a preponderance of the evidence. He had to show that it was more likely that his disabling heart attack was caused by his exposure to the circumstances of the riot on March 30, 1989, either directly or by aggravation of his preexisting heart disease, than by the natural, cumulative, deteriorative effects of his preexisting diseased condition and unhealthy habits. See <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., </em>307 Mass. 246, 250 (1940); <em>Josi\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 415, 417-418 (1949); <em>Zavaglia </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>345 Mass. 483, 487 (1963); <em>King\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 488, 489-492 (1967); <em>Craven </em>v. <em>State Ethics Commn., </em>390 Mass. 191, 200 (1983); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>414 Mass. 360, 365-367 (1993); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 638-639.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The judge\u2019s description of Lisbon\u2019s causation case as supported by \u201cthe clear weight of the evidence,\u201d and \u201coverwhelming evidence,\u201d was hyperbolic. The only competent evidence in Lisbon\u2019s favor on that issue was the medical panel\u2019s certification and his personal physician\u2019s subsequent opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As discussed in the preceding section, an affirmative certification cannot by itself discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proving the required causal connection; and neither the board nor CRAB was required to accept the documentary \u201cconclusions [as to causation] expressed by [Lisbon\u2019s] personal physician.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1018, 1019 (1984). The quantum of evidence presented by Lisbon on the causation issue \u2014 establishing the possibility of a causal connection between the riot and his disabling heart attack \u2014 was reasonably deemed insufficient by CRAB when measured against the extensive evidence of his long-standing health problems and proclivity to heart attacks. See <em>Josi\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass, at 417-418 (1949); <em>Tartas\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 585, 587 (1952); <em>Cataldo </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>343 Mass. 312, 313-314 (1961); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 1019 (\u201cIn the circumstances, and in light of the substantial evidence concerning the plaintiffs longtime smoking habit, there was no error in CRAB\u2019s conclusions that the plaintiff had failed to sustain his burden of proof on the question of causation\u201d); <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 483-484.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Lisbon\u2019s presentation \u2014 supported by no medical testimony \u2014was even weaker than that of disability applicants held to have failed to discharge their burden of proof despite expert testimony in their favor. See <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass. 58, 65-66 (1961); <em>Cataldo </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>343 Mass, at 313-314; <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>369 Mass, at 495-497. Lisbon\u2019s case stands in marked contrast to the one he most relies on, <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra, </em>because of the existence there of (1) \u201cuncontradicted [medical] testimony\u201d that the applicant\u2019s myocardial infarction was caused by an activity on the job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and (2) no contrary medical evidence. 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 636-641. See also <em>Teacher\u2019s Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>346 Mass. 663, 665-667 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">4. As noted earlier (note 5, <em>supra) </em>a court may not set aside a CRAB decision, not otherwise legally erroneous, that is supported by substantial evidence. Contrary to the judge\u2019s conclusion, CRAB\u2019s denial of disability benefits to Lisbon was so supported. Judicial \u201creview under the substantial evidence standard is circumscribed.\u201d <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>403 Mass. 350, 354 (1988). It is a standard of review \u201chighly deferential to the agency\u201d, which requires (as G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7] mandates) according \u201c \u2018due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In order to be supported by substantial evidence, an agency conclusion need not be based upon the \u201cclear weight\u201d of the evidence (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>or even a preponderance of the evidence, but rather only upon \u201creasonable evidence,\u201d <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 43, 54 (1985), i.e., \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d after taking into consideration opposing evidence in the record. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 1(6), 14(8); <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). If the agency has, in the discretionary exercise of its expertise, made a \u201cchoice between two fairly conflicting views,\u201d and its selection reflects reasonable evidence, \u201c[a] court may not displace [the agency\u2019s] choice . . . even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>386 Mass. 414, 420 (1982); <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>38 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Ct. 673, 677 (1995). See also <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 164 (1988) (the essence of discretionary authority is the power to choose within a range of acceptable options, whether or not courts might reach differing or even opposite conclusions on the same record).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">CRAB\u2019s decision satisfies the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201dstandard. There is undisputed record evidence that Lisbon\u2019s coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and excessive obesity long antedated his government employment. Notwithstanding repeated warnings from his physician, he refused to quit his life-long heavy smoking habit until shortly before his disabling incident. He would not abandon his unhealthy eating habits despite years of medical and counseling efforts. He suffered heart attacks in 1983, 1986, and 1987, none of which he suggests was related to his job or its unusual circumstances. His physician noted as early as 1986, in connection with one of his coronary episodes, that Lisbon exhibited \u201cobvious severe risk factors,\u201d and by 1987 presented with \u201cincreasing angina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">This was not a case in which no or little contrary medical evidence existed detracting from the applicant\u2019s medical evidence, as in <em>Vinal </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 90-91, or <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 640. \u201cNor is this a case where the [CRAB] decision ... is not in accord with the facts found [and in the record].\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass, at 49. Rather, despite \u201cevidence tending to show that . . . [Lisbon\u2019s disability] was a result of the [March 30, 1989, incident] ... it cannot be said that there was no evidence from which a reasonable mind could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48. CRAB might, in its discretion, have determined that Lisbon\u2019s last heart attack was job-related. However, in applying its expertise to the substantial evidence in this record indicating the possibility of natural disease progression as. the cause of the disability, CRAB was not required to do so. It was reasonable for CRAB to base its adverse decision on the record of Lisbon\u2019s predisposition to heart attacks, especially where the only evidence tending to show work-related causation was the inconclusive medical panel certification and the post hoc conclusion of Lisbon\u2019s physician. See <em>id. </em>at 48-49; <em>Cataldo </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>343 Mass, at 313-314; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 1019; <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 4835 485-488.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and order that a judgment be entered affirming CRAB\u2019s denial of accidental disabibty retirement benefits to Lisbon.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">We reject the board\u2019s contention that Lisbon is not entitled to disability benefits because he was not \u201cin the performance of his duties\u201d but rather was \u201cwaiting to leave work for the day.\u201d The board cites only distinguishable authority for this questionable proposition and ignores the fact that Lisbon was ordered to stay at his post until the riot was over.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The facts come from the findings of the administrative magistrate, which CRAB adopted as its own and which neither party challenges, and the underlying medical reports and certifications that were exhibits before the magistrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The medical panel explained: \u201cThe Panel considered his current state of health due to the diagnosis of coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus and history of hypertension and came to the unanimous conclusion that he could not continue his present job as a cook in the correctional facility. The Panel accordingly has answered yes to Question One in Section F and yes to Question Two in Section G because of the progressive nature of [arteriosclerotic] coronary heart disease. The Panel carefully considered the history of confrontation with prisoners which necessitated hospital admission and the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made on the April 4, 1989 hospital admission. The Panel has therefore answered yes to Question Three in Section H.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 94, first enacted in 1950, presently creates a causation presumption in favor of fire fighters, police officers, and certain other public employees, including Department of Correction staff assigned to the supervision and custody of prisoners that any disabling or fatal heart condition experienced during employment shall be deemed to have been suffered in the line of duty. Lisbon did not qualify as a covered person under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In ruling that CRAB\u2019s determination that Lisbon had \u201cfailed to sustain his burden goes against the clear weight of the evidence,\u201d the Superior Court judge misstated the court\u2019s obligation when reviewing a CRAB decision. Judicial review of a CRAB decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, is narrower than that. On appeal, courts are not called upon to determine whether the CRAB decision was based on \u201cthe weight of the evidence,\u201d nor may they substitute their judgment for that of CRAB. Rather, they may set aside or modify a CRAB decision only if, after giving due regard to CRAB\u2019s expertise in applying the public retirement statute to a variety of factual situations, see <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 487-488 (1985), they conclude, on the basis of the entire record, that \u201cthe [CRAB] decision is . . . [unsupported by substantial evidence,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e), i.e., \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support (CRAB\u2019s) conclusion, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6).\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass. 45, 47 (1961). Since, however, the judge went on to restate his reasoning for reversing CRAB\u2019s decision in terms of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, we shall disregard his earlier anomalous phraseology and review his decision as one holding that CRAB\u2019s denial of disability benefits for Lisbon was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The only testimony in any way relevant to the causation issue was that of Lisbon which formed the basis for the magistrate\u2019s finding that Lisbon \u201cbegan to experience chest pain\u201d after the inmates had left the cook house and after he had been informed that all jail personnel were being held over because of the riot. CRAB did not disagree with but rather accepted this finding. The mere coincidence of Lisbon\u2019s chest pain and the workplace incident, however, \u201cdo[es] not, standing alone, support [a] finding[ ] of causation . . . [which] \u2018must rest upon expert medical testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>King\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 488, 490 (1967). <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass, at 46-48; <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>346 Mass. 663, 666 (1964); <em>Wakefield Contributory Retirement Bd., </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>352 Mass. 499, 502-503 (1967). No expert medical testimony was presented here. Contrast <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 636-637, 639-640 (1985). As to the findings of the magistrate not based on credibility, but rather on documentary evidence, which <em>Vinal </em>somewhat cryptically holds are only entitled to \u201csome deference,\u201d 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 99, 101, CRAB \u201cwas not bound by the [magistrate\u2019s] recommendation . . . [not] based on credibility. . . . The record before [CRAB] was the [same] record before the [magistrate] and [CRAB] was ... in the same position as the latter to decide the application, including whether the burden of proof had been met.\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 483 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In light of the discussion in this section, as well as that in note 9, <em>infra, </em>the judge\u2019s observation, that \u201cFour doctors concluded that the stress of [the riot and prisoner confrontation] . . . caused plaintiff to suffer a heart attack,\u201d did not accurately describe the competent evidence of causation in this record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">As explained above, the panel chairman\u2019s \u201cclarification\u201d opinion and any panel conclusion stating the actual existence of a causal connection between disability and workplace incident were nullities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The judge\u2019s decision does not reflect the deference due CRAB\u2019s expertise in retirement law matters. Such an oversight is especially questionable in this \u201cdifficult area of the law,\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 487, which is \u201cnotoriously complex,\u201d <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 463 (1985), and in which courts accord \u201cgreat weight\u201d to CRAB\u2019s interpretation and application of the statutory provisions it is charged with administering. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
