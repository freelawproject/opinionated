The regulation, 524 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.00(23) (1991), set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires that only elevator personnel licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>under G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 7IB,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> perform certain demolition work. On cross motions for summary judgment, the judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, ruling the regulation was invalid</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">\u201cto the extent that it requires a person licensed under G. L. c. 143, Sec. 7IB to dismantle or remove an elevator or elevator equipment in a building or structure undergoing repairs, renovations or remodeling, or where the hoistway is intended for reuse, after the elevator has been decommissioned (that is, once the elevator car, weights, and cables have been placed at their lowest level in the building or structure).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In its appeal, the board presses its statutory authority to adopt the regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the statute enabling the board to issue regulations, when read with the statute requiring licensure of certain elevator personnel, does not authorize the regulation. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">We turn first to the enabling act, G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 68. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examrs. of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985); <em>Worcester Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Prevention Regulations, </em>400 Mass. 464, 466 (1987). In relevant part, the statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u201cThe board of elevator regulations shall promulgate amendments to the regulations relating to the construction, installation, alteration and operation of all elevators, and relative to the location, design and construction of shafts or enclosures for elevators, safety devices, gates and other safeguards, protection against the elevator or hoisting machinery, and means to prevent the spread of fire . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">See also \u00a7 69 which provides the procedure for drafting and issuing amendments to the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The licensing statute to which the judge and the disputed regulation refer, G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 7IB, is administered by the board of examiners, and not the board of elevator regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 71B provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">\u201cNo person shall work as an elevator constructor, maintenance man and repairman in the construction, maintenance or repair of elevators unless he holds a license therefor granted by the board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The statute is a penal one as \u00a7 7 ID provides for a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 for anyone working \u201cas a constructor, maintenance man and repairman in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>construction, maintenance or repair of elevators without a license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Both \u00a7 68, the enabling act, and \u00a7 71B, the licensing act, use similar terms \u2014 \u00a7 68 speaks of \u201cconstruction, installation, alteration and operation\u201d of elevators, and \u00a7 7IB of \u201cconstruction, maintenance or repair.\u201d Neither refers to removing or dismantling elevators.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Moreover, long-standing practice supports the wreckers\u2019 claims that the regulation is unauthorized. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examrs. of Electricians, </em>395 Mass, at 246 (\u201cwant of assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert to exercise it is . . . significant\u201d). An affidavit of one of the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which appears uncontested, avers that, until paragraph 23 of the regulation was added, \u201cthere was never any question that removal of elevators was part of a demolition contractor\u2019s work,\u201d whether the building was to be demolished or gutted out and renovated.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The board seeks to sustain its regulation on two grounds. First it claims that since elevator equipment removed from a building may be reinstalled in other buildings following decommissioning, the regulation falls within the board\u2019s statutory authority. This argument appears specious since installing (or reinstalling) an elevator is governed by G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63, and requires both inspection and certification prior to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The board also argues that the regulation is directly related to its statutory authority to adopt regulations relating to \u201cprotection against the elevator or hoisting machinery and means to prevent the spread of fire.\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 68. The board\u2019s safety argument relies heavily on the affidavit submitted by board chairman Edward Sullivan, the \u201cexperienced elevator constructor,\u201d who, because of his private interest, \u201cexcused himself from the board\u201d at the public hearing on the regulations. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Sullivan\u2019s affidavit recounted one incident where unlicensed laborers removed some elevator equipment with a torch causing electric wiring to catch on fire. It was his \u201copinion\u201d that licensed elevator personnel would not have used a torch.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Sullivan\u2019s safety concern may be overstated as evidenced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>the following comments made at the public hearing by the chairman of the meeting, the building inspector of Danvers: \u201c[A]ll of the accidents that were reported seemed to occur when the car of the elevator was in some position other than at its lowest level parked, so to speak, or as the code refers to it, placed out of service.\u201d See 524 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.00 (1986) (\u201cElevators Placed Out of Service\u201d). The building inspector saw no need for the requirement of a licensed elevator constructor once the safety precautions of placing the cab and counterweights at their lowest level were taken. In this connection, we note that under the judge\u2019s order the decommissioning of elevators, the more dangerous portion of the operation, is left to licensed elevator personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Even if Sullivan\u2019s opinion that licensed elevator personnel would not have used a torch on electric wiring is taken as valid, see <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 438 (1995) (on summary judgment review is in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party), there is no reason why safety regulations may not be propounded to apply to nonhcensed as well as to licensed elevator personnel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The question here, as in <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examrs. of Electricians, </em>395 Mass, at 242 &amp; 249, a case upon which the plaintiffs rely, is whether the Legislature intended a broad or narrow reach to the terms of the enabling act, particularly in view of the penal licensure provision. <em>Simon </em>instructs, at 249, that where, as here, the licensure statute is penal, it \u201cmust be as strictly construed as a criminal law.\u201d We conclude that, although the board\u2019s claim of authority under \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 69 is entitled to some weight, the statutes do not give it the authority to accord to licensed elevator workers such exclusive func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>tions as it ordered. Neither the literal words of the enabling act nor Legislative policy suggests that the Legislature intended the board to grant elevator personnel a legal monopoly over removal of elevators by extending the licensure act. See <em>Simon, supra </em>at 249.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-16\">Title 524 Code Mass.

The board of elevator regulations has jurisdiction over appeals by persons aggrieved by the action of the board of examiners in denying, revoking, or suspending a license. G.
