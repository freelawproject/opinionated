The judge allowed the motion and entered the requested declaration; the Barretts appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">Laureen Finnell baby-sat for Sean three days a week, from 7:30 in the morning to 4:30 in the afternoon, a total of nine hours, for which she was paid fifteen dollars per day. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>baby-sitting arrangement between the Barretts and Laureen did not include the preparation of lunch for Sean; that was usually provided by Sean\u2019s mother. On February 19, 1992, Laureen placed a bowl of boiling water on the table in preparation for making \u201ccream of wheat\u201d for herself for lunch. The bowl was the same color as the bowl in which Laureen kept candy on the kitchen table. After she poured the boiling water into the bowl, Laureen went to a videotape recorder near the kitchen to insert a videotape. While she was absent from the kitchen, Sean put his left hand in the bowl of water, burning his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The Finnells, and their home, were insured by the plaintiff under a standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. The policy was in full force at the time of the injury. The sole issue on appeal is whether Laureen\u2019s activities, while caring for Sean, fall within the business exclusion clause contained in the policy issued by the plaintiff to the Finnells.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The homeowner\u2019s policy excludes coverage for bodily injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201carising out of or in connection with a business engaged in by an insured. This exclusion applies but is not limited to an act or omission, regardless of its nature or circumstance, involving a service or duty rendered, promised, owed or implied to be provided because of the nature of the business . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The policy also contains an endorsement which states: \u201cIf an insured regularly provides home day care services to a person or persons other than insureds and receives monetary or other compensation for such services, that enterprise is a business. . . .\u201d The defendants do not dispute that babysitting is a business activity within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The Barretts argue that Laureen\u2019s preparation of her own lunch was outside of the business of caring for Sean, and therefore the injury sustained by Sean should be covered by Laureen\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Laureen\u2019s business was to care for Sean and prevent him from being harmed. The service was to be performed continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>ously from 7:30 in the morning to 4:30 in the afternoon, and she was paid a flat fee of fifteen dollars for each day\u2019s work. Whether the injury was caused by what Laureen did do (placing the bowl of boiling water within Sean\u2019s reach) or failed to do (failing to make certain that Sean could not hurt himself in Laureen\u2019s house) during her working hours \u2014 that is, during her business hours \u2014 is of no importance in view of the fact that the policy\u2019s exclusion applies to any \u201cact or omission\u201d involving a service rendered or promised which arises out of the business of baby-sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Although the issue presented by this case has not, to our knowledge, been the subject of an appellate opinion, cases from other jurisdictions involving language similar to that contained in Laureen\u2019s policy support the result we reach. The court in <em>Farmer\u2019s Ins. Co. of Ariz. </em>v. <em>Wiechnick, </em>166 Ariz. 266, 269 (1990), rejected the appellants\u2019 argument that the business exclusion did not apply because at the time of the child\u2019s injury the baby-sitter was taking care of her dog, an activity unrelated to her babysitting activities. The court held that the exclusion applied to any injuries sustained by the child while in the baby-sitter\u2019s care, regardless of what particular activity the baby-sitter was engaged in at the time. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cWhatever incidental activities a baby-sitter is involved in, maintaining proper supervision and a safe environment for children is the most basic element of a baby-sitter\u2019s job. It does not matter whatever else a baby-sitter might be doing at the time a child is injured, while the child is in the babysitter\u2019s charge the baby-sitter is engaged in the pursuit of caring for that child.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Millers\u2019 Mut. Ins. Assn. of Ill. </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>888 S.W.2d 406, 407-408 (Mo. Ct. App. 1994) (the business exclusion applied even though the injury to the child was caused by the husband leaving the door to their home open \u2014 an argument to the contrary was dismissed by the court as \u201cfrivolous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The Barretts\u2019 argument relies in part on a different form of exception to the business exclusion clause which does not appear in the policy issued by the plaintiff to the Finnells. We decline to discuss it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
