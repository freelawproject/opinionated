His major contention, however, is based on receipt of postverdict evidence from a juror who claims to have been biased on account of the defendant\u2019s homosexuality. We affirm the convictions and the denial of the motion for a new trial. Our recitation of the facts will be limited to those relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">1. <em>Claim of juror bias. </em>On the Monday following the verdicts reached the preceding Friday, a member of the jury that had convicted the defendant returned to court and informed, a court officer that he had some afterthoughts or doubts about the verdicts reached by the juiy. The trial judge held a lobby conference on Wednesday with the juror and told him that if he had a matter of conscience that he thought ought to be told, he should put it in a notarized affidavit. The juror did so and in a subsequent letter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stated that \u201cmy verdict was bias at the conclusion of Christian Delp\u2019s trial.\u201d He explained that he was having difficulty determining which side was lying since there were no eyewitnesses to the rapes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\u201cI was taken aback by Christians dialect. That when I heard it, I considered Christian a Homosexual. And from that point, accepted Commonwealths testimony as Gospel, while on the other hand, found defense testimony, no matter how helpful to Christians case, unsubstantial. And that my verdict was based on Christians Homosexuality.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">After defense counsel requested a new trial, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>410 Mass. 89 (1991), the judge held a hearing and heard oral testimony from the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The juror testified that until Christian took the stand, he thought he was not guilty, and as stated in his affidavit, he \u201chad felt that I, myself, had found Christian Delp guilty solely on his apparent homosexuality.\u201d His weighing of the testimony was influenced by the fact that he believed that Delp was a homosexual and by \u201cthe prompting of other jurors.\u201d When the juror was questioned about other jurors, the prosecution objected, but after defense counsel cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>410 Mass. 89, the judge said he would allow the interrogation. The juror, however, was not questioned further about other jurors, and said that he did not want to implicate any other juror. He added, \u201cI think that if I had had my senses with me at the time that I would have rebuffed their remarks about Christian\u2019s homosexual; but homosexuality, I think, affects different people in different ways. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The judge asked the juror: \u201cWould you say that when you left here you were satisfied with the jury verdict, even personally, but that over the weekend that you thought about it and then thought that perhaps you had, yourself, second thoughts about it? Is that a fair statement?\u201d The juror answered, \u201cI would say that\u2019s pretty accurate, yes.\u201d In reply to questioning by the prosecutor, the juror testified that he tried not to be biased, that he did not hate any particular group, that at the time he left the courtroom he believed he had done his duty, and that he had listened to the evidence throughout the case. The judge took the matter under advisement and a month later, without any findings, denied the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Before turning to the defendant\u2019s arguments, a brief discussion of recent Massachusetts cases involving juror postconviction testimony may be in order. The seminal case, of course, is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 196 (1979), in which the Supreme Judicial Court, citing <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>107 Mass. 453, 460 (1871), explained that it still adhered \u201cto our rule which requires courts to protect jurors and their verdicts from unwarranted intrusions and which emphasizes the importance of the finality of jury verdicts.\u201d <em>Fidler </em>limited the admissibility of juror testimony to the existence of \u201cextraneous \u2018disturbing\u2019 influences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. Pointing out that these influences often can be objectively ascertained and frequently be corroborated, the court concluded that \u201c \u2018where overt factors are present by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the verdict\u2019s validity can be objectively assessed, the law\u2019s commitment to a just result warrants receiving evidence as to the alleged acts of misconduct. But where the juror would testify solely to matters resting in his own consciousness, the dubious value of the testimony is outweighed by the need for stability in verdicts\u2019 and the testimony should be excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, quoting from 3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Evidence par. 606[03], at 606-25 (1978). See also rule 606(b) of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which \u201cis in accord\u201d with current Massachusetts law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 155-156 n.25, cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). The <em>Fidler </em>court recognized that the line between overt factors and matters resting in a juror\u2019s consciousness is not easily drawn and that difficult cases would arise. 377 Mass, at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">While bias of a juror is not, \u201cstrictly speaking,\u201d an extraneous matter, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>391 Mass. 645, 653 (1984), and while \u201cthe current Massachusetts rule . . . exclud[es] evidence of mental processes,\u201d evidence of remarks by jurors in the jury room showing bias are admissible, at least where there is a substantial likelihood of prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass, at 155-156 n.25. In that case, the defendant claimed that a. female juror \u201chad called a black witness \u2018Sapphire,\u2019 a patently racist term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153. The court assumed, the Commonwealth not having argued that evidence of racial bias relates to the jurors\u2019 mental processes, that the judge acted properly when he asked each juror whether he had heard the comments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 156. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>391 Mass, at 653, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>where the court upheld the trial judge\u2019s implicit finding that a juror was not biased. If any doubt remained as to the admissibility of such evidence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>410 Mass, at 97, established that remarks of jurors in the jury room indicating ethnic prejudice which suggest that the defendant \u201cdid not receive a trial by an impartial jury, . . . cannot be ignored,\u201d and a hearing must be held.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Although the defendant argues that the judge improperly refused to allow counsel to explore whether \u201chomosexual bias resonated around the jury room during deliberations,\u201d the transcript, as indicated above, demonstrates that the judge did not preclude questioning as to remarks made by other jurors. While the juror may have sensed a reluctance by the judge to discuss the thought processes of other jurors, counsel, who was aware of and had expressly cited <em>Laguer, </em>did not pursue that line of questioning after being allowed to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The more difficult question is the juror\u2019s claim that he was biased. Here, the matter does not relate to overt factors or communications to the jury, but rather concerns the juror\u2019s uncorroborated posttrial testimony claiming his own previously undisclosed bias. Whether such testimony may properly be considered on a motion for a new trial is doubtful, at least in the absence of extreme prejudice. As stated in <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 U.S. 140, 148 (1892), \u201c[pjublic policy forbids that a matter resting in the personal consciousness of one juror should be received to overthrow the verdict, because being personal it is not accessible to other testimony; it gives to the secret thought of one the power to disturb the expressed conclusions of twelve.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>392 Mass. 28, 41 n.17 (1984), while finding it unnecessary to decide whether a juror\u2019s uncorroborated posttrial testimony concerning his uncommunicated preverdict knowledge may be considered on a motion for a new trial, the Supreme Judicial Court was \u201cof the opinion . . . that permitting jurors to \u2018remain silent during deliberations and later assert that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>were influenced by improper considerations,\u2019 <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Eagle, </em>539 F.2d 1166, 1170 (8th Cir. 1976), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1110 (1977)] \u2018would add unduly to the already fragile state of criminal convictions.\u2019 <em>United States ex rel. Owen </em>v. <em>McMann, </em>435 F.2d 813, 817 (2d Cir. 1970), cert denied, 402 U.S. 906 (1971).\u201d See also <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Polley, </em>689 F.2d. 562, 580-581 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Brofford </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>751 F.2d. 845, 853-854 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 474 U.S. 872 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Commonwealth did not object here to the admissibility of the evidence. Moreover, an assumption that the evidence was admissible would not lead to a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>406 Mass. 843, 855 (1990). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 638 (1993). The judge\u2019s colloquy with the juror leaves us no doubt that he viewed the juror\u2019s assertion of bias as an example of the oft expressed second thoughts of a conscientious juror, see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gerardi, </em>586 F.2d. 896, 898 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>578 F.2d 757, 764 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 981 (1978), which do not in any way necessitate a new trial. Although he made no findings, the judge\u2019s conclusion, after questioning the juror, \u201cclearly implies his finding that the juror was not biased.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>391 Mass, at 653. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunnington, </em>390 Mass. 472, 478-479 (1983). Since nothing in the record leaves us \u201cwith a firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d the judge\u2019s denial of the motion is affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass, at 156. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunnington, </em>390 Mass, at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The primary claim of ineffectiveness is that trial counsel did not develop certain evidence contained in a hospital report, in a school report and perhaps in other records, to the effect that the victim suffered from \u201cimpaired reality testing.\u201d The trial was held shortly after the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867 (1991), and, as a result of that decision, the defendant\u2019s counsel was given massive amounts of material to consider, including, perhaps, copies of some records stating that the victim had \u201cimpaired reality testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">After the conclusion of the trial, the material given to counsel was either lost or destroyed, perhaps even twice, and the defendant and the Commonwealth have been unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>agree as to what material was seen by trial counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge, based on docket entries, but before a transcript was available, thought that certain documents were not part of the materials. The validity of that ruling is not clear. The defendant at one point, through new counsel, who also represents him on this appeal, made a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, but was not sure that the evidence was, indeed, newly discovered. The motion was denied without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In view of the destruction of the copies of the records and the extreme difficulty of ascertaining which records were before counsel (the trial judge has retired, and it appears that trial counsel is deceased), it would seem fruitless to seek at this time a determination of exactly which records were in the hands of trial counsel. Accordingly, on a renewed motion for a new trial, if the defendant chooses to file such a motion, the records should be considered as either having been before counsel or as newly discovered. The question for decision should be whether the defendant can show through expert testimony that the records containing the term \u201cimpaired reality testing\u201d or words of similar import would cast such doubt on the victim\u2019s ability \u201cto perceive, recollect, and recall the incident[s] in question,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 45, 48-49 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Syrafos, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 211, 216 (1995), so as to tend to create a reasonable doubt that might not otherwise exist. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 223, 226 (1996). In such event, a new trial would be in order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The remaining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do not involve factual matters outside the trial record and hence can be resolved on the defendant\u2019s direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adamides, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 344-345 (1994). The contentions are without merit. The evidence that the defendant had molested another young boy two years younger than the victim in the same manner and during the same time period was admissible in the discretion of the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 470-472 (1982); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 205, 213-214 (1994). Counsel\u2019s decision not to request a limiting instruction may have been a tactical move not to highlight the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As to the argument that defense counsel failed to object that \u201cfresh\u201d complaint testimony by the victim, made four to six months after the last alleged incident, was stale, counsel did indeed object to such testimony from one witness. After the judge ruled that staleness was a question for the jury, counsel was not ineffective in assuming the same ruling would apply to the second fresh complaint witness to whom the victim spoke at a comparable time. Moreover, the complaints \u201cwere well within the boundaries of \u2018freshness\u2019\u201d in light of the victim\u2019s age, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169, 187-188 (1993); counsel was not required to pursue an argument with little chance of success.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Although the judge\u2019s \u201cfresh complaint\u201d instructions were not as clear as they might have been, they adequately conveyed to the jury that it was for them to decide whether the complaints were fresh and that such evidence could only be used as corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">3. <em>Disclosure of exculpatory evidence. </em>The defendant faults the Commonwealth for failing to turn over evidence to the defendant that the victim suffered from \u201cimpaired reality testing.\u201d The records showing this diagnosis presumably were held by the Department of Social Services. \u201cA prosecutor\u2019s duty . . . extends only to exculpatory evidence in the prosecutor\u2019s possession or in the possession of the police who participated in the investigation and presentation of the case,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 407 (1992), and does not extend to evidence held by other government agencies. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 734 (1993). No special factors exist here to extend that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\">The affidavit was lost, but the juror filed a letter which he sent to defense counsel and the prosecutor.

Nor may his affidavit or evidence of any statement by him concerning a matter about which he would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The trial judge\u2019s finding that the term had been used in a jocular manner without any racial prejudice which would affect the verdict was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">After such a hearing, the trial judge in the <em>Laguer </em>case ultimately concluded the jury had not been exposed to extraneous influences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 310 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">This may have been a tactical decision.
