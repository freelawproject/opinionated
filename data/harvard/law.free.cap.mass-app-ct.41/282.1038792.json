On Greyhound\u2019s <em>motion </em>under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), a Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint because of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to have exhausted their administrative remedies and other procedural defects. After a hearing, another Superior Court judge allowed Greyhound\u2019s motion, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, for sanctions on account of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cinsubstantial and frivolous claims,\u201d awarding Greyhound the full amount of its requested attorney\u2019s fees. The second judge, in a handwritten notation in the margin of the motion, indicated that his reasons for the award were the plaintiffs\u2019 continued prosecution of their action despite the pendency of administrative proceedings concerning the marina and their legal reliance on a document that was \u201cpatently\u201d not what they contended it was. The judge did not, however, make the \u201cseparate and distinct finding\u201d or the specification of his computational methodology mandated by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The plaintiffs appealed the sanction to a single justice of this court, as authorized by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The single justice affirmed both the imposition and the amount of the fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>award on the basis of the record before the Superior Court judge, despite the absence from the judge\u2019s \u00a7 6F award of the required finding and specification. Relying primarily on the asserted legal errors represented by those omissions, the plaintiffs appealed to a full panel of this court, purportedly pursuant to the second paragraph of \u00a7 6G. At oral argument, the panel inquired whether the 1992 amendment to the second paragraph of \u00a7 6G, which provided that the single justice\u2019s decision of the \u00a7 6F appeal \u201cshall be final,\u201d may have divested the panel of jurisdiction to decide the appeal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a question the parties had not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The parties submitted supplemental presentations on that issue. Those materials were, unfortunately, essentially conclu-soiy arguments that merely reiterated the statutory language favoring their respective positions while overlooking the inconsistent provisions. Neither party could cite to any helpful legislative history<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the amendment or any case authority directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">A plausible argument can be constructed for the proposition that amended \u00a7 6G should be read to exclude any further appeal to a full panel of this court from a final determination by the single justice of an appeal of a \u00a7 6F award. It is accordingly incumbent upon us to address the novel issue of the proper interpretation of the 1992 amendment to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, before addressing the merits, since jurisdictional issues should, except in extraordinary circumstances, be addressed whenever raised. See <em>Litton Bus. Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981); <em>Goes </em>v. <em>Feld-man, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 85 (1979); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Neponset River Marine &amp; Sportfishing, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 129 (1982). From 1976 until 1992, \u00a7 6G said nothing about a decision of the single justice being \u201cfinal,\u201d but only that the single justice hearing the appeal \u201cshall schedule a speedy hearing thereon\u201d and conduct the appeal \u201caccording to the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d See note 5, <em>supra. </em>It was recognized at the time that the provisions of \u00a7 6G constituted \u201ca confusing statutory scheme,\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Shriberg, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 284 (1991), containing \u201can anomalous route of appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 282, as well as other \u201cobscurities.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 792, 793 (1980). Chief among such obscurities was the question whether the single justice\u2019s determination of a \u00a7 6G appeal was reviewable by a panel of the Appeals Court, a matter as to which the statute was silent. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">That issue was resolved in <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky, </em>where this court construed the original version of the statute to admit of panel review because \u201cthere is nothing in \u00a7 6G which purports to attribute any measure of finality to an order entered by one of our single justices under that section.\u201d 10 Mass. App. Ct. at 794. The court contrasted \u00a7 6G in this respect with G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, which has always expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>provided that an Appeals Court single justice\u2019s decision on costs for an indigent party \u201cshall be final,\u201d in the sense of permitting no further appeal. See <em>Gos </em>v. <em>Brownstein, </em>403 Mass. 252, 254 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">With the enactment of St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 561, the rationale of <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky </em>seemed to vanish and with it the underpinning of the justification for full panel review of single justices\u2019 \u00a7 6G rulings. Finality has, the defendant Greyhound contends, been explicitly accorded the \u00a7 6G decision of the single justice. Greyhound ignores, however, the words in the sentence of the second paragraph of amended \u00a7 6G that immediately follows \u201cshall be final\u201d: \u201cAny appeal to the supreme judicial court or the appeals court shall proceed according to the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d Those words, the plaintiffs maintain, must envision continued \u00a7 6G appeal to and review by a panel of the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The 1992 amendment to \u00a7 6G plainly injected an ambiguity into the statute with respect to the decision of the single justice. We are obliged to give ambiguous, imprecise, or faultily drafted statutes \u201ca reasonable construction,\u201d with the primary goal of \u201cconstruing] the statute to carry out the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190 (1976). In doing so, we must \u201cavoid[] a construction which would negate legislative intent or defeat its intended utility.\u201d <em>Milton Commons Assocs. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 116-117 (1982). We attempt to ascertain legislative intent first, as we do with all statutes, \u201cfrom the words used.\u201d <em>Lehan </em>v. <em>North Main St. Garage, Inc., </em>312 Mass. 547, 550 (1942). We examine the words used both in the problematic section and in \u201cother parts of the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). We give all those words their usual, ordinary, and common meanings. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 546 (1976). Our objective is to confer upon the \u201cstatute . . . as a whole ... an internal consistency,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 316 (1991), as well as fidelity to the extracted legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Applying these tools of statutory construction, in the absence of any illuminating legislative history, one might initially conclude that the General Court may well have intended to make the single justice\u2019s resolution of the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of a G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, sanction \u201cfinal\u201d in the sense of not being subject to further review. Such is the usual connotation of the word \u201cfinal,\u201d in all of its dictionary meanings: i.e., something that is the last step, the very end result of a process, which is \u201c[n]ot to be changed or reconsidered . . . [and is] unalterable,\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 682 (3d ed. 1992), or \u201cnot to be altered or undone.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 851 (1968).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The absence of any qualifying language modifying \u201cfinal\u201d lends support to such a construction. When the Legislature has intended to qualify the nonreviewability of \u201cfinal\u201d decisions, it has known how to do so explicitly. See, e.g., G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13 (decision of the appellate tax board \u201cshall be final as to findings of fact\u201d); G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 26 (court\u2019s acceptance of property appraisal \u201cshall be final except that any party aggrieved by such appraisal shall have an appeal on matters of law\u201d); G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43 A (decision of the court \u201cshall be final, except as to matters of law\u201d). Contrast G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D (decision of an Appeals Court single justice on indigent\u2019s appeal of denial of a motion for funds, which the statute says, unqualifiedly, \u201cshall be final,\u201d is not reviewable; see <em>Gos </em>v. <em>Brownstein, </em>403 Mass, at 254-255).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Further buttressing the nonreviewability position are the statutory command that the single justice\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d decision must be \u201cspeedy\u201d and the structure of \u00a7 6G, which seems inconsistent with any further review beyond the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \u201cfinal\u201d decision of the single justice. The Legislature left what might be viewed as a salient clue to its intent in a distinct change made by the 1992 amendment. The original mandate of \u00a7 6G, that the single justice hold \u201ca speedy hearing\u201d on an appeal of a \u00a7 6F award, was transformed into the requirement that there be a \u201cspeedy decision\u201d on such an appeal. Such a telling alteration of the statutory language \u201cbespeaks a clear Legislative intention to expedite\u201d the appellate process. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354, 356 (1974). To permit the delay necessarily attendant upon a second tier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>of review of a \u00a7 6F sanction \u201cwould undermine the speedy procedure envisioned by\u201d the present form of \u00a7 6G. Cf. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 968, 970 (1991) (construing G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 5, to preclude a second level of review of the denial of a motion to waive a bond in a summary process action, even in the absence of any \u201cfinality\u201d language in the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">An additional appeal from a single justice\u2019s decision might also be seen as a deviation from the apparent statutory design for single-tier appellate review of a \u00a7 6F award. The first paragraph of \u00a7 6G creates two parallel avenues of appeal: one, to the single justice of the Appeals Court, from \u00a7 6F decisions by judges of the Superior, Land, Housing or Probate Court; and the other, to the full bench of the Supreme Judicial Court, from \u00a7 6F decisions that \u201carise[] in the appeals court\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or before a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. Amended \u00a7 6G goes on to provide that, while appeals continue to be de novo, <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>403 Mass. 332, 336 (1988) (at the reviewing tribunal\u2019s discretion, see <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeTourneau, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 880, 881-882 [1981]), the outcomes of both tracks are to be both \u201cspeedy\u201d and \u201cfinal.\u201d There being no further review from the final decision of the full bench of the Supreme Judicial Court, it arguably perpetuates a procedural \u201canomaly,\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Shriberg, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 282, to allow a two-tier review for \u00a7 6F awards emanating from the Superior, Land, Housing, or Probate Courts when there is only one review of awards imposed by the Appeals Court or a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, particularly when the word \u201cfinal\u201d in the statute points in the opposite direction. Compare <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 970.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Notwithstanding these valid points in support of the nonre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>viewability by the panel of a single justice\u2019s \u00a7 6G decision, we are ultimately unpersuaded, because we are unable to ignore the retention in amended \u00a7 6G of the original statutory clause \u201c[a]ny appeal to . . . the appeals court shall proceed according to the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d The accepted canons of statutory construction \u2014 reflecting the fundamental principle of separation of powers expressed in article XXX of our Declaration of Rights \u2014 compel us to treat no part of the statute as superfluous or surplusage. Rather, the oft-announced injunction is that \u201cevery word of a legislative enactment is to be given force and effect.\u201d <em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>362 Mass. 216, 219 (1972). While this is not an ineluctable doctrine, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Apalakis, </em>396 Mass. 292, 298 (1985); 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06 (5th ed. 1992); Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes are to be Construed, 3 Vanderbilt L. Rev. 395, 404 (1950), it is our obligation \u201c[wjherever possible . . . [to] give meaning to each word in the legislation,\u201d <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984), \u201cunless no other possible course is open,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMenimon, </em>295 Mass. 467, 469 (1936), in order to make the entire statute \u201c \u2018if possible ... an effectual piece of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass, at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We conclude that the words \u201cappeal to . . . the appeals court\u201d cannot be disregarded as surplusage, because it is possible to give them not merely a functionally meaningful but an institutionally desirable construction. The single justice\u2019s decision must, of course, enjoy some measure of finality, else <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the word \u201cfinal\u201d inserted by the 1992 amendment of \u00a7 6G would itself be meaningless surplusage, contrary to the principle just discussed. We do not, however, have to determine the full extent of that quality of finality. The instant case presents us only with the question whether the single justice, by adopting the Superior Court judge\u2019s \u00a7 6F award that failed to address statutory requirements, committed error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It might be reasoned that the finality language of amended \u00a7 6G was intended to preclude panel review of legal errors because of the continued availability of G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. That statute affords relief by way of an action in the nature of certiorari to correct judicial legal errors apparent on the record where a statute provides no other method of review. See <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>422 Mass. 459, 463-464 (1996). It is a remedy that is available even when a statute provides that the ruling of the court whose decision is sought to be reviewed \u201cshall be final.\u201d See <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Mayor of Cambridge, </em>253 Mass. 193, 199-200 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">On this very issue, however, <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky, supra, </em>retains vitality and points to the continued propriety of panel review for errors of law under revised \u00a7 6G. The decision in <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky </em>rested not solely on the lack of any indicia of finality in the original version of the statute but, more basically, on \u201csound principles of judicial administration.\u201d 10 Mass. App. Ct. at 795. Construing \u00a7 6G to prevent appeal to a panel by those aggrieved by a single justice\u2019s order would predictably \u201clead to a practice under which persistent counsel would take those orders by complaints in the nature of certiorari ... to the single justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, who could not transfer the cases elsewhere under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, and whose judgments would be subject to still further appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 114. . . . [I]t would hardly serve the purpose for which this court was created for us to throw the orders entered by our single justices under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, into the Supreme Judicial Court.\u201d 10 Mass. App. Ct. at 794-795.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The same policy concern for sound principles of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>administration still applies under the amended \u00a7 6G.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It dictates the conclusion that a single justice\u2019s \u00a7 6G order should not be exempt from reviews for error of law by a panel of the Appeals Court, at least to the same extent as certiorari review.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">For present purposes we need not go beyond this conclusion and need not consider the finality of a single justice\u2019s \u00a7 6G decision with respect to findings of fact or discretionary rulings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The instant appeal raises no challenge to either the single justice\u2019s findings or the exercise of the single justice\u2019s discretion. Rather, it argues manifest errors of law by both the trial judge and the single justice resulting from the omission of the requisite specification in the \u00a7 6F order with respect to lack of good faith and fee methodology. Failure \u201cto comply with the explicit directives of c. 231, \u00a7 6F, which require that the judge include in his order \u2018specific facts and reasons\u2019 for his findings, as well as \u2018the method by which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>amount of the award was computed\u2019 ... in and of itself warrants reversal of the order.\u201d <em>Strand </em>v. <em>Herrick &amp; Smith, </em>396 Mass. 783, 792 (1986). In particular, an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 6F requires both an evidentiary showing and an explicit judicial finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not advanced in good faith. See <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stough-ton, </em>403 Mass. 332, 336-338 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The order of the single justice affirming the Superior Court judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant is accordingly vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further action not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F, as inserted by St. 1976, c. 233, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part, that sanctions in the form of \u201creasonable counsel fees and other costs\u201d may be imposed on motion of a party, after a hearing, upon the court\u2019s determination, made \u201cas a separate and distinct finding, that all or substantially all of the claims . . . were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith\u201d; and the court \u201cshall specify in reasonable detail the method by which the amount of the award was computed and the calculation thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">At the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, \u00a7 6G, as amended by St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 561, provided (and still provides) as follows: \u201cAny party aggrieved by a decision on a motion pursuant to section six F may appeal as hereinafter provided.

That technical legal meaning has no relevance to the present circumstances. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 629 (6th ed. 1990) (which also records the usual meaning of \u201ca decision from which no appeal or writ of error can be taken\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The explicit differentiation of the Appeals Court single justice from \u201cthe appeals court\u201d in G.

Against that background, the 1992 amendment\u2019s use of the word \u201cfinal\u201d might seem to have functional meaning only in application to the decision of the Appeals Court single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>justice. Investing the single justice\u2019s \u00a7 6G dispositions with finality would not only produce a consistent statutory structure of single-tier review, but would also further the judicial policy against allowing the determination of counsel fees to proliferate into a series of ancillary litigations. See <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983); <em>Cooter &amp; Gell </em>v. <em>Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 408 (1990); <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 544 (1985). Of course, it is highly unlikely that the Legislature, had it actually considered the matter, would have deemed a decision of any sort by an Appeals Court single justice the equivalent in definitiveness to a decision of the full bench of the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">See Johnedis, Impact of the Appeals Court on the Supreme Judicial Court, 77 Mass.

Cf. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>251 Mass. 569, 616 (1925) (\u201c[The proposed statute says] the decree of the Superior Court \u2018shall be final\u2019 .... \u2018Where jurisdiction is given to a court or magistrate by a statute, and there is no provision for an appeal, the decision of the court or magistrate is final\u2019 . . . subject [only] to the limited review available by writ of certiorari\u201d); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Mayor of Cambridge, </em>253 Mass, at 199 (\u201cAlthough the statute provides that \u2018The decision of the court shall be final and conclusive upon the parties,\u2019 and as such [the] decision, so far as it relates to questions of fact, will not be reversed, yet the parties are not deprived of the right to have manifest errors of law corrected by a writ of certiorari\u201d). As to discretionary matters, it should make little practical difference to the outcomes in the vast majority of cases whether single justice decisions are reviewable for abuse of discretion, because of the highly deferential applicable standard of review. The party \u201cwho claims an abuse of . . . discretion assumes a heavy burden. . . . On appellate review of a claim of an abuse of discretion . . . \u2018[t]he question is not whether we . . . should have made an opposite decision from that made by the . . . judge. To sustain . . .
