We must decide whether the judge\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and whether they show clear and convincing evidence of parental unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The proceedings began under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24; the Department of Social Services (department) then moved for the court to determine whether it would be in Ramon\u2019s best interests to dispense with parental consent to his adoption. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26(4); G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. After a trial on the merits of the department\u2019s petition, the judge issued his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Certain undisputed facts were found by the judge and are as follows. Ramon was bom on July 27, 1991, twenty-one days after his parents were married. The father abused alcohol and marijuana and would often become violent. When the mother feared for her safety during one of his rages, she had her parents come to their residence to add substances to the father\u2019s drinks so that he would fall asleep. The father would embark on drinking binges at least two times a month when the family received their welfare check. The parents were often unable to budget their money to provide healthy foods for the entire month.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">On August 28, 1992, the father was arrested for attacking the mother. She posted bail for him. The family came to the department\u2019s attention due to that incident. On August 29, 1992, a report of neglect of Ramon was filed pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, as a result of the father\u2019s arrest for domestic assault and battery. An investigation mandated under G. L. c 119, \u00a7 5IB, to evaluate the \u00a7 51A report of neglect of Ramon due to domestic violence between the parents revealed that the mother could not care for Ramon while the father was in jail because \u201cRamon reminded her too much of [the father].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Between September, 1992, and March 3, 1993, the department conducted an assessment of the family and attempted to arrange services for them. At the family\u2019s residence, shortly before they were evicted, the department\u2019s social worker, Gina Parlee, observed piles of garbage in the sink, no food in the refrigerator, cat feces covering the floor, and cockroaches and flies. Visiting nurse services were provided by Nancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Howes, a nurse with the Visiting Nurse &amp; Health Services of Franklin County (VN &amp; HS). Sue Williams, also of the VN &amp; HS, began providing counseling to the parents in the fall of 1992. Jay Killough of REACH, an early intervention program for children with developmental disabilities, also began providing services to the family at that time. In addition, Par-lee made a referral to Beacon Clinic for alcohol counseling for the father in November, 1992. However, the suggestions for improving personal hygiene, cleaning their dwelling and improving their nutrition and Ramon\u2019s medical care were not followed and the father refused to participate in the substance abuse program. The parents were also erratic in keeping Ramon\u2019s medical appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In spring of 1993, Ramon\u2019s genitals swelled to twice their normal size and bled for two days from a severe diaper rash. His parents, however, did not make a doctor\u2019s appointment until Howes made a home visit and insisted that they do so. At the home, Howes observed that Ramon had been wearing a soiled diaper for a long time. She as well as Parlee observed that the family had chronic personal hygiene problems: the mother showered once a month, the father showered once every two months and Ramon was bathed once or twice a week. When the parents failed to bring Ramon to the appointment for his diaper rash and Parlee could not locate them at their residence, the department exercised emergency custody pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B(3), and filed the care and protection petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">This occasion was not the only time Ramon\u2019s parents neglected his medical care or missed scheduled doctor\u2019s appointments. On April 14, 1993, Howes found that medication for Ramon\u2019s ear infection, which was to be administered three times a day, had not been given at all. Pediatric medical records revealed that scheduled appointments were not kept, Ramon had a variety of \u201cunexplained bruises,\u201d he and his parents were dirty when they came to the doctor\u2019s office, and Ramon was behind in his vaccinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">On May 1, 1993, the mother suffered a spinal cord injury in an automobile accident. At the Cooley Dickinson Hospital, the father left his son unattended for approximately forty-five minutes. The hospital filed an emergency \u00a7 51A report and the department exercised its legal custody under the existing care and protection order and placed Ramon with foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>parents. Ramon adjusted easily to his foster home following his placement in May, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">From October, 1993, to August, 1994, the father continued to abuse the mother physically. She obtained a G. L. c. 209A restraining order against him at one point while she stayed in a homeless shelter. The two also lived at various other locations during that time. In approximately October, 1994, the father was again arrested for assault and battery on the mother. The father had thrown a telephone at her, hit her in the elbow, and threatened to kill her. The father was subsequently found guilty of assault and battery and threatening to commit a crime (murder), and was given a suspended sentence of ten days in a house of correction. Due to this incident, the mother was taken by ambulance to the hospital with an elbow injury that required a cast.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">To facilitate reuniting the parents with Ramon after Ramon came into the department\u2019s custody, the department arranged for a relative to care for Ramon and supervise weekend visits. Ramon was placed in the relative\u2019s care on October 8, 1993. However, except for one visit by the mother, neither parent came to see Ramon for the next month. Ramon was then returned to his original foster parents. After May, 1994, although parental visits were available two times a month, the parents only visited Ramon three times until the trial in February, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">While Ramon lived with his relative, his foster parents had taken care of another foster child. Ramon became attached to this child when he was returned to his foster parents. When the child was returned to his parents in December, 1993, Ramon began experiencing \u201csevere night terrors,\u201d which, at their worst, would wake him up every ten to twenty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Therapeutic treatment to alleviate this condition was provided by James Porter, a psychotherapist with the Valley Programs Clinic. Porter engaged in \u201cplay therapy\u201d with Ramon. The sessions revealed a recurrent theme expressed by Ramon: the terrorization of a \u201cmother\u201d puppet by a \u201cwolf\u2019 puppet. During this \u201cplay,\u201d Ramon would also talk about a third puppet, which was a child being left alone while the mother puppet expressed concern about it. Both foster parents were involved throughout this therapy, consulted Porter for advice on several occasions, and facilitated Ramon\u2019s improvement through their nurturing care. The sessions eventually ended as the nightmares became much less frequent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Upon review of the record, we conclude that the following findings of fact of the judge were supported by the evidence and were not clearly erroneous. Further, we conclude that the record contained clear and convincing evidence of parental unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A. <em>Challenged factual findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The parents challenge three of the trial judge\u2019s factual findings, that: (1) while in the care of his parents, Ramon was exposed to \u201csomething very frightening to him,\u201d through his parents\u2019 \u201cown neglect or abuse,\u201d which traumatized him; (2) Ramon was denied proper medical care by his parents; and (3) the department offered appropriate services to the parents. The father separately argues that the trial judge unfairly incorporated many of the appellants\u2019 proposed findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">A trial judge\u2019s findings \u201cmust be left undisturbed absent a showing that they are clearly erroneous. . . . Moreover, the judge\u2019s assessment of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses is entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993), and cases cited. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it, or when, \u2018although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The burden is therefore on the appellant to show an appellate court that a finding is clearly erroneous. <em>First Pa. Mort. Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 621-622 (1985). In this case, the appellants have not sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">First, the parents\u2019 contention that Ramon did not witness something frightening to him which traumatized him, is belied by the mother\u2019s own testimony at trial and by experts\u2019 testimony to the contrary. That domestic violence occurred in the household is not disputed. Also, the mother admitted at trial that when the father\u2019s violence \u201cwould start in front of the baby,\u201d she would \u201ctake the baby away\u201d to the bedroom. She stated that this happened on five or six occasions when Ramon was between three and six months old. The mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>additionally admitted the father would sometimes \u201clos[e] control\u201d and yell loudly at Ramon when Ramon was one and a half years old. Further, Porter, who has a master\u2019s degree in counseling psychology and who treated Ramon for sixteen sessions, testified that Ramon\u2019s \u201cplay therapy\u201d formulations indicated \u201c[Ramon] had been exposed to some sort of violence in the home environment, and a general lack of consistency in the home environment, and neglect as well.\u201d Dr. Carolyn Newberger, a developmental and clinical psychologist who is the research director of the Family Development Program at Children\u2019s Hospital, opined at trial that when a child experiences night terrors and \u201cenact [s] themes in his or her play of children being attacked by others,\u201d it is \u201cbecause there is something in that child\u2019s experience about which the child is very frightened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">This case is different from <em>Adoption of Stuart, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 389-390 n.15 (1995), which was remanded by this court because no physical evidence was introduced to corroborate the therapist\u2019s opinion that the child had been sexually abused. Here, the evidence shows that Ramon did witness domestic violence and experience night terrors. Moreover, the \u201cplay therapy\u201d evidence and the conclusions of Porter and Dr. Newberger support the judge\u2019s finding that Ramon was disturbed by violence. See <em>Custody of Eleanor, supra </em>at 799. We recognize that \u201c[tjhere are significant reported psychological problems in children who witness domestic violence, especially during important developmental stages.\u201d <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>422 Mass. 590, 599 (1996), citing Cahn, Civil Images of Battered Women: The Impact of Domestic Violence on Child Custody Decisions, 44 Vand. L. Rev. 1041 (1991). See Federico and Kinscherff, <em>Custody of Vaughn: </em>Impact of Domestic Violence On Child Custody; Children Are No Longer the Forgotten Victims, 40 Boston Bar J. 8 (Sept./Oct. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Second, the trial judge was not clearly in error in finding that Ramon was repeatedly denied proper medical care. The parents\u2019 contention that the trial judge based this finding on the sole incident of Ramon\u2019s diaper rash is not supported by the record. Neither is the mother\u2019s argument that there is nothing to show that a doctor would have prescribed something different from the ointment which she did apply to the rash. Here, the evidence shows that Ramon suffered a se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>vere diaper rash, during which he bled for two days before his parents would make a doctor\u2019s appointment, and then only at Howes\u2019s insistence. The report of the court investigator also supports Howes\u2019s observation that on the day she made a home visit and discovered Ramon\u2019s diaper rash, March 1, 1993, Ramon \u201clooked as if he had sat in a soiled diaper for a long time,\u201d that the parents had no diapers or food, and had \u201cno plan\u201d for obtaining them. The evidence further shows that Ramon had an ear infection for which his parents could not properly administer his prescribed medication, and that he eventually needed to have tubes surgically inserted into his ears. Ramon\u2019s parents also had an admitted and documented inability to get him to his medical appointments, and pediatric records showed he was behind in his vaccinations. Accordingly, there is no clear error in the judge\u2019s finding of medical neglect. See <em>Custody of Eleanor, supra </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Third, the parents\u2019 contention that the department did not offer appropriate services to them has no merit. The mother claims that she is a victim of her own upbringing and suggests that the department should have helped her in other ways than it did. The father argues that the department used its services to facilitate its plot to take his son away from him. Neither position is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The evidence shows that the department offered counseling services and treatment to the mother before as well as after her marriage to the father. The mother would not enter a substance abuse program offered by the department because her boyfriend, her eventual husband, could not visit. The department also offered a variety of services to the parents after it became involved with the family in August, 1992. Visiting nurse services were provided by Howes. Williams began providing counseling to the parents in the fall of 1992. Kil-lough of REACH also began providing services to the family at that time. In addition, Parlee made a referral to Beacon Clinic for alcohol counseling for the father in November, 1992. The department even attempted to bring the family together by placing Ramon with a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">However, the department\u2019s services and suggestions for improving personal hygiene, cleaning their dwelling and improving their nutrition and Ramon\u2019s medical care were not followed, and the father refused to participate in the substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>abuse program. The parents were also erratic in keeping appointments. Although the mother explains her lack of participation in counseling by asserting that the father controlled her life and would not let her visit Ramon or participate in services offered by the department, the department should not be faulted for the parents\u2019 refusal to utilize the offered services. Therefore, the trial judge\u2019s finding that the department offered appropriate services to the family was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">B. <em>Parental unfitness and dispensing with parents\u2019 consent to adoption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The judge concluded that the parents were currently unfit to provide for the care and protection of Ramon and that he should be committed to the department\u2019s custody. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge further found that the parents lacked the current ability, capacity, readiness and fitness to assume parental responsibility for Ramon, and that it would be in his best interests to dispense with the need for his parents\u2019 consent to his adoption. See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. The parents contend that the evidence does not show clearly and convincingly that they are currently unfit to parent Ramon. They also argue that the trial court placed undue weight on the relationship between Ramon and his foster parents in determining that it was in his best interests to dispense with parental consent to his adoption. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">General Laws c. 210, \u00a7 3, lists the factors a court may consider in determining the fitness of a child\u2019s parent to decide whether the best interests of the child would be served by dispensing with parental consent to adoption. The factors include: whether another member of the family has been abused; whether the child is younger than four years of age and a court has transferred custody of the child from the parent to the department and the parents were unable to utilize services offered to correct the situation; whether the parent, without excuse, failed to provide proper care and custody for the child and it can reasonably be inferred will not be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>do so in the future<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; whether the child has formed a positive bond with a subsequent caretaker; the parent\u2019s capacity to meet the special needs of the child; the parent\u2019s lack of effort to remedy conditions creating the risk of harm to the child; failure to visit the child when the child is not in custody of the parent; and a condition which makes the parent unable to care for the child. See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. \u201cParental unfitness must be determined by taking into consideration a parent\u2019s character, temperament, conduct, and capacity to provide for the child in the same context with the child\u2019s particular needs, affections, and age.\u201d <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 711 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">First, the trial judge\u2019s comprehensive and trenchant findings show the parents\u2019 unfitness to care for Ramon by clear and convincing evidence. See <em>ibid. </em>The judge found that the parents\u2019 main and critical area of unfitness was their inability to break the cycle of violence and instability due to the father\u2019s alcoholism and their inability to protect Ramon from the consequences of their own proclivity to domestic instability. The evidence showed that: (1) the mother was continually abused by the father; (2) Ramon experienced medical neglect by his parents in their failure to take him to his doctor\u2019s appointments or properly treat his diaper rash and ear infections; (3) Ramon was under four years of age when a court transferred custody to the department and the parents did not correct the circumstances of neglect and domestic violence; (4) Ramon had formed a positive bond with his foster parents<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; (5) the parents failed to use the variety of services offered to them by the department or attempt to remedy the areas of hygiene, household cleanliness, nutrition and the budgeting of money and domestic violence identified for them as areas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>needing change by the department; (6) the parents failed regularly to visit Ramon while he was in foster care; and (7) the father has a condition of chronic alcohol and marijuana abuse for which he refuses to be treated. There is no evidence to show a reasonable likelihood that the parents\u2019 unfitness at the time of trial might be only temporary, unlike the situation in <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339 (1992), and the parents have a long and documented history of domestic violence leading to Ramon\u2019s neglect. Therefore, the judge\u2019s determination that clear and convincing evidence exists to prove that both parents are unfit to provide for Ramon\u2019s best interests was not clearly erroneous. See <em>Adoption of Mary, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Second, we conclude that the trial judge properly considered Ramon\u2019s bond with his foster parents along with the other factors enumerated above in making his determination. \u201cAlthough the bonding of a child with foster or adoptive parents is not a dispositive consideration, it is a factor that has weight in the ultimate balance.\u201d <em>Adoption of Nicole, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 262-263 (1996). The parents\u2019 claim that the trial judge unfairly weighed their parenting abilities against those of the foster parents because he considered their poverty and that there was limited evidence concerning Ramon\u2019s attachment to them is not supported by the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 Mass. 755, 766-767 (1983) (judge\u2019s inappropriate comparison of the advantages the foster parents offered the child with those offered by the mother\u2019s unconventional lifestyle \u201cd[id] not clearly recognize the mother\u2019s presumptive right to raise the child as she sees fit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\">This argument will not be separately addressed as, \u201ceven in the event of verbatim adoption of a submission of counsel, an appellate court. . . does not change the standard of review.\u201d <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 465 (1991) (citations omitted). See <em>First Pa. Mort. Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 622 n.12 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The parents\u2019 arguments do not specifically contest the department\u2019s intervention under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, except to suggest at oral argument that the department\u2019s intervention was premature and would not have happened if the mother had not been injured in the automobile accident. As such, their contentions regarding their unfitness will be addressed under the more stringent standard of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">We note that, although not part of the record on appeal, at oral argument it was undisputed that the mother had gone back to living with the father and had another child with him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">At trial, Dr. Newberger opined that Ramon had formed his \u201cprimary bond\u201d with his foster parents and that, due to his special need for continuity and stability because of the trauma he had suffered, he should be placed with a \u201cstable family\u201d sensitive to his psychological status. She also said that removing Ramon from his foster home would be very damaging to Ramon because it would be a \u201cdisruption in a bonded, trusted relationship.\u201d She considered the foster parents\u2019 home \u201cexemplary,\u201d and Ramon\u2019s \u201cbest\" chance to do very, very well.\u201d Porter testified that the interactions between Ramon and his foster parents were \u201cvery caring\u201d and that they \u201cseemed very keyed in to Ramon and very sensitive to his needs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The judge questioned Dr. Newberger at length about the significance of a biological link in determining the best interests of a child. Although Dr. Newberger endorsed Ramon\u2019s living with his foster parents as being in his best interest, she also stated that \u201cit would be very helpful to Ramon not to have completely severed that biological tie.\u201d In questioning Dr. Newberger, the trial judge also stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to compare this set of parents to any other set of parents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
