(Continental), was injured by a Stop &amp; Shop Companies, Inc. (Stop &amp; Shop) truck, at or near a Stop &amp; Shop loading dock, as he was making a delivery of bread products to a Stop &amp; Shop grocery store in Everett. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The Mitchells sued Stop &amp; Shop for damages caused by its driver\u2019s negligence, and Stop &amp; Shop, a certified insured under Continental\u2019s broad form vendor\u2019s agreement, cross claimed against Continental for Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s costs of defense and for indemnification of its liability to the Mitchells.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following settlement of the Mitchells\u2019 claims, judgment was entered for Stop &amp; Shop against Continental pursuant to an earlier allowed motion for summary judgment. Continental appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">By the terms of the vendor\u2019s broad form coverage, Continental had undertaken \u201cto defend [and] indemnify . . . [Stop &amp; Shop, the] \u2018vendor,\u2019 but only with respect to the distribution or sale in the regular course of the vendor\u2019s business of Continental Baking Company\u2019s products. . . .\u201d This coverage was subject to certain exclusions, which are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The vendor\u2019s broad form coverage is an outgrowth of modem product liability law, which not only makes a manufacturer strictly liable, generally, for injuries caused by defects in its product, see <em>Swartz </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>375 Mass. 628, 630 (1978); <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633, 639-641 (1978); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>397 Mass. 183, 187-191 (1986) (limiting strict liability to sales and leases), but extends strict liabihty as well to the distributor or retailer of the manufacturer\u2019s product. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-314 &amp; 2-315; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 961, 961-962 (1992). The retailer or distributor who has acted merely as a conduit for the product and has not altered it or otherwise acted in a manner that contributed to the injuries may then normally sue the manufacturer of the defective product for indemnification. <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>386 Mass. 95, 100-101 (1982). See also <em>Oates </em>v. <em>Diamond Shamrock Corp., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 448 (1987). Because the liability trail in such cases leads back to the manufacturer of the defective product, it has generally been concluded that the purpose of the vendor\u2019s broad form endorsement is to curtail that circuitry of action by extending the insurance coverage of the manufacturer down the line to the distributor and the retailer of the product. <em>Dominick\u2019s Finer Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>163 Ill. App. 3d 149, 152 (1987). <em>American White Cross Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., 202 </em>NJ. Super. 372, 379 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">So understood, the vendor\u2019s coverage as a whole has been held to relate only to injuries that arise out of the product itself. <em>Oliver Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>187 Cal. App. 3d 1510, 1516-1518 (1986). <em>SDR Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>196 Cal. App. 3d 1433, 1438-1439 (1987) (\u201cthe commercial purpose behind the vendor\u2019s endorsement is [to ensure] that the manufacturer\u2019s insurer will defend and indemnify the vendor for losses <em>caused by the manufacturer\u2019s </em>product\u201d [emphasis original]). <em>Dominick\u2019s Finer Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>163 Ill. App. 3d at 152. The exclusions from coverage are interpreted as an attempt to define the boundary between those instances in which the retailer\u2019s exposure to liabihty arises purely from its role as a conduit, and those in which, by altering or repairing or repackaging the product, it \u2014 the retailer \u2014 may itself have caused or contributed to the injuries. See <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Reliance Ins. Co., </em>654 F.2d 494, 497-498 (7th Cir. 1981), citing <em>Mattocks </em>v. <em>Daylin, Inc., </em>452 F. Supp. 512, 515-516 (W.D. Pa. 1978), affd. mem., 614 F.2d 770 (3d Cir. 1979); <em>SDR Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>196 Cal. App. 3d at 1437-1439; <em>American White Cross Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>202 N.J. Super, at 380-381.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Although Mitchell was injured in the course of delivering a Continental product to Stop &amp; Shop, his injuries cannot be said to have been caused by the product or to have arisen in \u201cthe distribution or sale in the regular course of the vendor\u2019s [i.e., Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s] business of Continental Baking Companies\u2019 products. . . .\u201d Rather, they arose from the distribution in the regular course of Continental\u2019s business of its products to a vendor. The factors that caused the accident were totally unrelated to defects in the products. On precisely parallel facts \u2014 injury to a manufacturer\u2019s deliveryman due to a hazardous condition at the premises of the vendor \u2014 another court has ruled that there was no coverage for the vendor under the broad form endorsement. <em>Dominick\u2019s Finer Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Stop &amp; Shop argues that it should be indemnified because Mitchell was injured in the course of \u201cinstallation [or] servicing operations performed at the vendor\u2019s premises in connection with the sale of the product . . . .\u201d The language relied on comes from the exception to part (b)(iii) of the policy exclusions (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>There is no need to consider the coverage exclusions where there is no coverage to begin with. While exclusions to coverage may sometimes be useful in determining the scope of coverage where that is ambiguous, Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s construction of the exclusion and the exception thereto loses sight of the purpose of the vendor\u2019s broad form coverage, to extend the manufacturer\u2019s own product liability coverage to the distributors or retailers (\u201cvendors\u201d) whose own liability arises simply from their role in passing the product on to the customer. If Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s position were accepted, Continental would be required to cover Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s liability to, for example, a customer who comes to Stop &amp; Shop to buy Continental\u2019s bread and slips on a banana peel, or a Stop &amp; Shop stockperson who injures his or her back stocking Continental products on the shelves. In none of these cases would Continental\u2019s own product liability insurance (if it were not a self-insurer) be implicated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>We agree with the position accepted by the <em>Dominick\u2019s </em>court, that \u201cthe declared and unambiguous intent of the vendor\u2019s endorsement is to provide coverage only for claims arising out of the product and that it does not cover vendors for their own negligence.\u201d 163 111. App. 3d at 152. It was error to rule that Continental was required to defend and indemnify Stop &amp; Shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Continental and Stop &amp; Shop reached a settlement of the Mitchells\u2019 claim, reserving their appellate rights as to the third-party claim. According to their stipulation, Continental is to recover $367,542.54 from Stop <em>&amp; </em>Shop if Continental should prevail in the appeal. The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered for Continental in accordance with the terms of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Continental is a self-insurer of its product liability, but, under Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s own liability insurance requirements for its suppliers, was required to give Stop &amp; Shop evidence that it had insurance in place giving Stop &amp; Shop the benefit of the broad form vendor\u2019s coverage of commercial product liability policies. Continental issued to Stop &amp; Shop a certificate of such coverage, and Stop &amp; Shop thus stands in the position of an additional insured under a product liability policy affording broad form vendor\u2019s coverage to the insured\u2019s (i.e., Continental\u2019s) vendors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u201c1.
