The Commonwealth tried this case on a joint venture theory that the defendant and his brother were coventurers in their attack on the victim. During the attack, the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>brother repeatedly banged the victim\u2019s head on the concrete pavement of a parking lot. The concrete pavement is the dangerous weapon that the Commonwealth alleges was used in this case. The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s proof was insufficient because the Commonwealth failed to show that: (1) he knew at the start of the fight that his brother possessed such a weapon or intended to use it in his fight with the victim; or (2) the \u201cconcrete pavement\u201d in this case is a weapon under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. He also argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that he was guilty of the wilful and malicious destruction of a window in the vehicle through which they attempted to pull the victim. We conclude that in this case \u201cconcrete pavement\u201d is not a dangerous weapon and reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. We affirm his conviction for wilful and malicious destruction of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Jeffrey Czyzewski and his girlfriend went to a bar in Holyoke. There Czyzewski played a game of pool with the wife of Donald Sexton, the defendant\u2019s brother. During the game, Czyzewski accused her of cheating and ended the game. Thereafter, Donald Sexton approached Czyzewski three times demanding an apology. On the second occasion, the defendant accompanied his brother and informed Czyzewski that he would stand by his brother if anything happened. On the third occasion, Donald Sexton smashed a beer bottle against the bar but was grabbed before he did anything with it. The defendant, his brother, and his brother\u2019s wife then left the bar. Czyzewski and his girlfriend followed a short time later. When they got into their car, a van pulled beside them. The defendant, his brother, and a third man got of the van and came over to their car. The two brothers kicked in the passenger side window where Czyze-wski was sitting and attempted to pull him out of the car but were thwarted in their efforts when Czyzewski\u2019s girlfriend managed to start the car and drive away. As they drove off, the defendant and his brother said, \u201cLet\u2019s go get him.\u201d The defendant, his brother, and their companion then got into the van and followed the Czyzewski vehicle. The Czyzewski vehicle was about to run out of gas so Czyzewki and his girlfriend returned to the bar\u2019s parking lot. The van followed. Czyze-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>wski, Donald Sexton, the defendant, and their companion left the vehicles. The defendant and his brother immediately started to push and shove Czyzewski. The defendant lifted Czyzewski\u2019s jacket up over his head so that he was restrained. Together the defendant and his brother then threw him to the ground. There the defendant\u2019s brother banged Czyzewski\u2019s head against the pavement at least five times while the defendant repeatedly kicked him. The fight ended when the bar owner and another man broke it up. The defendant and his brother left before the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We address the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">1. <em>Assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. </em>To establish guilt under a joint venture theory, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant was: \u201c(1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, 402 </em>Mass. 482, 486 (1988). The defendant argues that, due to the nature of the weapon used in this case, the concrete pavement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he could not have known in advance that his brother was going to use the pavement as a weapon or share the intent that his brother do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument fails because there is no need to prove an anticipatory compact between the parties to establish joint venture. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 513 (1987). It is enough to prove that at the \u201cclimactic moment\u201d the parties acted together to carry out their goal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 435 (1993). Here, the defendant was aware that, at the very least, an assault and battery was about to occur in the parking lot, as was evidenced by their mutual statement, \u201cLet\u2019s go get him.\u201d Further, the defendant himself was kicking and punching the victim as his brother pounded the victim\u2019s head against the concrete pavement. At no point did the defendant withdraw from the conflict, and eventually the brothers retreated together. From this evidence a jury could infer the requisite intent and knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The question whether the \u201cconcrete pavement\u201d is a dangerous weapon under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, poses the more troublesome issue. The judge instructed the jury that \u201cconcrete pavement\u201d could be considered a dangerous weapon if the jury found that it was used in such a manner as to cause death or serious injury. While it is true that ordinarily the determination whether an object that is not dangerous per se is a dangerous weapon under \u00a7 15A is a question of fact for the juiy, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Appleby, 380 Mass. 296, 305 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Marrero, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922 (1984), there are certain objects or instrumentalities that do not qualify as dangerous weapons under \u00a7 15A as a matter of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 193 (1980) (human teeth or other parts of the human body). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 15 (1995) (ocean). We hold that the pavement in this case also does not meet the statutory definition of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">As we noted in <em>Shea, </em>under our case law dangerous weapons per se or as used under \u00a7 15A all share a common factor, namely the object in issue is an \u201cinstrumentality which the batterer controlled, either through possession of or authority over it, for use of it in the intentional application of force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. In other words, it is an object or instrumentality that the batterer is able to wield to inflict serious injury or death upon another. See cases collected in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass, at 304-305; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 192-193. Because the pavement in this case was simply part of the surroundings in which the defendant found himself while perpetrating an assault and was not something which he could control or with which he could arm himself, we hold that it does not meet the definition of a dangerous weapon under \u00a7 15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In reaching this conclusion we also considered the following. First, it is a well settled principle of statutory construction that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>415 Mass. 697, 699 (1993). Second, we observe that, in the almost seventy-year history of this statute, there have been no reported cases that have held similar objects, such as the ground, the sidewalk, or the floor to be dangerous weapons in the commission of assault crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 193-194 (statute\u2019s enforcement history considered in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>whether human body parts constitute a dangerpus weappn). Third, althpugh the result was predetermined by the statutory or case law definition of a dangerous weapon in their jurisdiction, a number of courts in other States have held pavement or similar items not to be dangerous weapons. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Legendre, </em>362 So. 2d 570 (La. 1978) (concrete pavement); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>United States, </em>583 A.2d 661 (D.C. 1990) (stationary bathroom fixtures); <em>State </em>v. <em>Houck, </em>652 So. 2d 359, 360 (Fla. 1995) (pavement or asphalt). Contrast <em>People </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>65 N.Y.2d 761 (1985) (sidewalk); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>101 Or. App. 277 (1990) (sidewalk). Finally, the Commonwealth is not left without a remedy for attacks such as this. Such attacks can be prosecuted under other felonious assault statutes. See, e.g., G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15 (assault with intent to murder, or to maim or disfigure); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 29 (assault with intent to kill).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">2. <em>Wilful and malicious injury to property. </em>The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant smashed the window in the car from which he attempted to remove Czyzewski or that he did so wilfully and maliciously. This argument fails because the Commonwealth presented evidence that both the defendant and his brother kicked in the window in their attempt to remove the victim from the car. The jury could infer that they did so with the intent to beat Czyzewski in retaliation for the remark he made to Donald Sexton\u2019s wife. This evidence was sufficient for the judge to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, </em>411 Mass. 167, 170-171 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The judgment on the indictment charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon is reversed, the portion of the verdict resting on the defendant\u2019s use of a dangerous weapon is set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the defendant\u2019s resentence for assault and battery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 199. The judgment on the indictment charging wilful and malicious destruction of property is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">We observe that, for some reason not apparent on the record, the Commonwealth did not, but probably could have alleged \u201ca shod foot\u201d to be the dangerous weapon. However, the nature of the defendant\u2019s footwear was not identified at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
