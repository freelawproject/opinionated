(Nau-set).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">The matter was tried before a Superior Court jury. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>answer to special questions, the jury found that the plaintiff had a contract with her employer; that the contract of employment was permanent; and that both defendants had intentionally and improperly interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s contract, causing her termination by Nauset. The jury awarded the plaintiff $300,000 for economic damages and $200,000 for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendants filed a motion for a directed verdict, which was denied. The motion was renewed at the close of all the evidence and again was denied. After the verdicts, the defendants filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial. The motion was denied, and the defendants claim error. The defendants also contend that the evidence was insufficient to defeat their common law immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The standard for reviewing a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict which challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence \u201cis whether \u2018the evidence, construed against the moving party, justifies] a verdict against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bonin </em>v. <em>Chestnut Hill Towers Realty Corp., </em>392 Mass. 58, 59 (1984), quoting from <em>D\u2019Annolfo </em>v. <em>Stoneham Hous. Auth., </em>375 Mass. 650, 657 (1978). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we look to see \u201cwhether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting from <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). Using the above standard, we summarize the facts and draw reasonable inferences therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">On August 15, 1982, Jenkins was hired by Nauset to be its executive director. Nauset is an independent, nonprofit corporation that provides services to individuals with disabilities and mentally retarded individuals in the Cape Cod and Islands (Cape) region. Nauset had the only sheltered employment program on the Cape. In such a program, clients perform various tasks in a workshop setting. Nauset had a workshop located in Eastham and, in the mid-1980\u2019s, had built another facility in Hyannis.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Nauset received its funding from several sources, including the Department of Mental Retardation (DMR) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Department of Mental Health. The largest source of its funding was through its contract with DMR. When Jenkins left Nauset in 1989, DMR was providing Nauset with $750,000 to $800,000 of Nauset\u2019s total funding of $1,400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In November, 1987, the defendant Richard O\u2019Meara was appointed by DMR to be its Southeastern Regional Director. In that position, O\u2019Meara became the awarding authority for all contracts and services in the Cape region. In 1988, the defendant Richard DeTucci became the director of the Cape region for DMR. DeTucci was responsible for negotiating contracts with providers, planning and redirecting the programs benefiting the mentally retarded in the Cape region, and overseeing their implementation. O\u2019Meara was DeTucci\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The area directors of DMR were responsible for overseeing contracts under the supervision of the regional offices. If a contractor, such as Nauset, was not performing adequately, the area director was expected to take affirmative action to make sure that the clients\u2019 health and well-being were protected. If a director decided that, in order to accomplish that end, a contract should not be renewed, it was within his authority to deny renewal. It also was within the authority and discretion of the area director to tiy to work out problems with providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In 1988, the trend in regard to programs for clients was turning from sheltered workshop programs, which Nauset provided, to supported employment programs. Those programs involved clients entering the community with a job coach or crew coach and being trained to perform a job. The supported employment program was more expensive because it required more staff. DeTucci was an advocate of the supported employment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Nauset decided that it needed to respond to the trend from sheltered employment programs to supported employment programs. Therefore, Nauset made a decision to consolidate its Eastham facility with its new larger Hyannis facility in order to shift staffing to respond to the supported employment program. DeTucci and DMR were unaware of Nauset\u2019s plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">On December 16, 1988, Jenkins held a meeting with clients\u2019 parents and told them of Nauset\u2019s plans. DeTucci and O\u2019Meara were not invited to the meeting. Jenkins informed the parents that the facility in Eastham would be severely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>curtailing its services and that clients would be moved to the facility in Hyannis or into community settings. Many of the parents were concerned about the proposed move.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On December 22, 1988, Jenkins wrote a letter to the clients\u2019 parents, expanding on the topics discussed at the meeting. In the letter, Jenkins stated that DMR had \u201cmandated\u201d a change from the sheltered workshop program to a supported employment program. The letter defined the meaning of the supported employment program and stated that Nauset, because of the lack of \u201cnew monies,\u201d had developed its own plan to handle the \u201cmandated\u201d conversion. Nauset planned to convert staff positions in the sheltered workshop program to the new program. Further, Nauset planned to transfer to the facility at Hyannis all the clients now at Eastham. Jenkins also enclosed a sample letter which concerned parents could send to public officials, including legislators, or to DMR about the proposed changes. A list of the names and addresses of the public officials and legislators was provided to the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">As a result of the letter, media attention was drawn to the proposed changes. DeTucci became angry with Jenkins because he believed that she had misrepresented DMR\u2019s position as to the proposed changes and also because DMR was not afforded an opportunity to address the matter prior to the letter being sent. DeTucci also believed that the proposed consolidation of the Eastham facility with Hyannis was an issue that should have been part of contract negotiations. O\u2019Meara was not directly involved in this incident but was indirectly involved as DeTucci\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">On January 16, 1989, another meeting was held with parents, Nauset staff, DeTucci, and representatives of the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission. Jenkins was at that meeting. The consolidation was discussed, and DeTucci denied that he had ordered Nauset to \u201cclose\u201d the Eastham facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The day after the meeting, Jenkins met with State Senator Henri Rauschenbach, Nauset officials, and DeTucci to discuss the parents\u2019 anger at the proposed changes. At the meeting, DeTucci denied that he had ordered the closing of Eastham or its consolidation with Hyannis. Jenkins agreed with De-Tucci and stated that she believed that the decision to consolidate was necessary for Nauset to remain financially viable and that it was Nauset\u2019s decision to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The relationship between Jenkins and DMR further deteriorated in March of 1989. On March 1, 1989, one of Nauset\u2019s clients was diagnosed with measles. On March 3, having learned of the measles and concerned about a potential measles epidemic, a number of officials from DMR and the Department of Public Health (DPH) tried to reach Jenkins in an attempt to obtain client health records to determine who had been previously vaccinated and those who might be susceptible to catching the contagious disease. Neither Jenkins nor her assistant were at work that day. The administrator in charge that day was also out of the office. The officials were unable to obtain access to Nauset\u2019s records, despite their representation to a Nauset employee that this was a health emergency and that Nauset\u2019s refusal to comply would jeopardize its license. Nauset\u2019s administrative assistant finally reached Jenkins in the afternoon and informed her of the numerous calls from DMR and DPH regarding the possible measles outbreak. It was not until after 9 p.m. that evening that Jenkins finally called O\u2019Meara. Earlier that day, DMR\u2019s chief of staff ordered an emergency suspension of Nauset\u2019s license because Nauset\u2019s \u201crefusal to provide information and access to [DMR] and [DPH] and to cooperate with both [departments with respect to the existence of a dangerous disease (measles), thereby endangered] the life, safety, and health of clients or staff within its facility.\u201d A quarantine was imposed. It was lifted on March 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">On March 9, 1989, after consultation with his supervisor and DMR\u2019s legal department, O\u2019Meara presented a letter to Ted Southworth, the president of Nauset. The letter stated that DMR would not renew its contract with Nauset for fiscal year 1990. The reason for DMR\u2019s decision was its \u201crecent experience concerning a possible measles outbreak in which the lack of cooperation of Nauset staff culminated [in] a situation endangering the life, safety, and health of clients within the agency and the general public.\u201d That experience, according to the letter, and Nauset\u2019s \u201cunilateral approach ... to close the Eastham workshop . . . led [O\u2019Meara] to conclude that there ha[d] been no constructive change in the willingness of Nauset staff to work cooperatively with [DMR].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">After Nauset received the letter, its board of directors passed two resolutions (1) instructing Jenkins to meet with her staff and inform them specifically about the authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>DPH to demand information and generally about the need to cooperate with supervisory authorities at all times, and (2) instructing Southworth to meet with DMR to \u201cexpress the [board of directors\u2019] regret [] about the friction that arose concerning the measles issue . . . during the absence of [Jenkins] and further to seek guidance from [DMR] in an attempt to comply with their directions more efficiently.\u201d Southworth met with O\u2019Meara and DeTucci, and O\u2019Meara agreed to hold his March 9 letter regarding next year\u2019s contract in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">On March 27, 1989, a meeting was held with O\u2019Meara, DeTucci, Senator Rauschenbach, Southworth, and two other Nauset representatives. Southworth requested that DMR restore Nauset\u2019s funding for the next year. O\u2019Meara stated that Nauset would not be granted the new contract if it continued with Jenkins as its executive director. On March 28, 1989, Southworth requested Jenkins\u2019 resignation, and she resigned. At the suggestion of O\u2019Meara, one Richard Walker was appointed in her place. On April 5, 1989, DMR restored Nauset\u2019s license to operate. Jenkins then brought this action against DeTucci and O\u2019Meara claiming improper interference with her employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">To make out a claim of intentional interference with a contract, a \u201cplaintiff must prove that: (1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>G.S. Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991). Both DeTucci and O\u2019Meara agree that Jenkins had an employment contract with Nauset. O\u2019Meara concedes that he interfered with that contract but claims he did not do so improperly. DeTucci denies that he interfered with the contract at all. DeTucci argues that, although he was present at the March 27 meeting where O\u2019Meara notified Southworth that DMR\u2019s contract with Nauset would not be renewed if Jenkins continued as executive director, he said nothing regarding the situation. His mere presence at the meeting, he claims, is not enough to constitute interference. For the purposes of our analysis, we assume, without deciding, that DeTucci did interfere with Jenkins\u2019s employment contract. We rule, however, that O\u2019Meara and DeTucci did not <em>improperly </em>interfere with the contract, and therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>judge committed error in denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We begin our analysis with a brief explanation of the relationship between DMR and Nauset. DMR is charged by the Legislature with the responsibility of taking \u201ccognizance of all matters affecting the welfare of the mentally retarded citizens of the [Commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 19B, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 9. Among other things, DMR is authorized to \u201center into agreements with nonprofit charitable corporations, partnerships or collaboratives for the providing of mental retardation services.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Once DMR enters into such an agreement and provides money to the private facility, it is entitled, in our view, to have the facility cooperate with it in order that DMR\u2019s mission of providing services to the mentally retarded is fulfilled. O\u2019Meara\u2019s and DeTucci\u2019s function as representatives of DMR was to ensure that the various programs to help the mentally retarded were carried out by the private facility and also to make sure that the health and well-being of the clients were protected. With that as background, we now examine the various positions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">1. <em>Improper motive. </em>Jenkins claims that O\u2019Meara\u2019s and De-Tucci\u2019s motive for interfering with her contract was improper because it was based on retaliation or ill will resulting from \u201cstrained relations.\u201d See <em>Draghetti </em>v. <em>Chmielewski, </em>416 Mass. 808, 817 (1994). According to Jenkins, O\u2019Meara and DeTucci perceived her as being a \u201cproblem\u201d to them, and therefore, they decided to force her out of her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">There were indeed strained relations between Jenkins and the DMR representatives, DeTucci and O\u2019Meara. However, those relations developed as a result of the December 22 letter in which Jenkins falsely stated that DMR had \u201cmandated\u201d certain changes that were extremely unpopular with the clients\u2019 parents and as a result of the \u201cmeasles\u201d episode where Jenkins and her staff were uncooperative with representatives of DMR and DPH in their efforts to obtain records in order to react to a medical emergency. Thus, it was Jenkins\u2019s conduct which resulted in the strained relations. Compare <em>Draghetti </em>v. <em>Chmielewski, supra </em>at 817, where the strained relations were caused by the conduct of the defendant, not by the plaintiff, as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Taking into account the purpose of DMR as stated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Legislature, the relationship between DMR and Nauset, the duties assigned to DeTucci and O\u2019Meara by DMR, and the conduct of Jenkins, we hold that there was no evidence that DeTucci and O\u2019Meara <em>improperly </em>interfered with Jenkins\u2019s employment contract. Rather, the record demonstrates that DeTucci and O\u2019Meara were fulfilling their obligation to take affirmative action to make sure that DMR\u2019s programs were advanced and that the clients\u2019 health and well-being were protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">2. <em>Improper means. </em>Jenkins claims that DeTucci and O\u2019Meara used improper means to interfere with her employment contract by (1) intervening directly with Nauset\u2019s board of directors and (2) allegedly misrepresenting information to Nauset about the measles incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">O\u2019Meara\u2019s decision to notify the board of directors about the nonrenewal of the contract did not constitute improper means. Utilizing such means was within O\u2019Meara\u2019s authority and discretion, and certainly was within the legitimate interest of DMR. The board was the governing body of Nauset, and it was the logical entity for O\u2019Meara to notify regarding DMR\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Jenkins argues that instead of notifying the board, O\u2019Meara should have talked with her about DMR\u2019s concerns. The evidence shows that DeTucci and O\u2019Meara had informed Jenkins about their concerns in regard to her conduct toward DMR and its representatives. DeTucci was present with Jenkins at several meetings after the December 22 letter and had expressed his (and DMR\u2019s) displeasure with Jenkins\u2019s performance. Later, when Jenkins finally talked to O\u2019Meara about the measles episode, Jenkins testified that O\u2019Meara expressed anger and disappointment as to her and her staff\u2019s conduct during that emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Jenkins\u2019s claim that DeTucci and O\u2019Meara misrepresented information to Nauset is without merit. Misrepresentations of information may be considered to be \u201cimproper means\u201d in the context of interference with contractual relations. See <em>Draghetti </em>v. <em>Chmielewski, supra </em>at 816-817 (police chief knowingly interfered with police officer\u2019s teaching contract by sending letter to police academy misstating that the officer had scheduling conflict between his responsibilities at the police department and the academy). Here, Jenkins claims that there was no evidence that she was uncooperative during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>measles episode and that the contents of DMR\u2019s March 9 letter to the board, stating that she was uncooperative, constituted misrepresentations. Contrary to Jenkins\u2019s claim, the letter did not state that Jenkins was uncooperative during the measles episode. It stated that her staff was uncooperative, a statement that is supported by the record. On this record, there were no misrepresentations in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In sum, we hold that DeTucci and O\u2019Meara did not improperly interfere with Jenkins\u2019s employment contract. Because of our holding, we do not consider the issue whether the evidence was sufficient to defeat the defendants\u2019 common law immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The order denying the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court where a judgment shall be entered in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-17\">The action was also brought against the Department of Mental Retardation; Nauset Workshop, Inc.; David P. Forsberg, then secretary of the Executive Office of Human Services; and Mary McCarthy, then Commissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation. Stipulations of dismissal were entered early in the litigation for the Department of Mental Retardation, Forsberg, and Nauset Workshop, Inc. Summary judgment was granted in favor of McCarthy. The plaintiff did not file a cross appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
