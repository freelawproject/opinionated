L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5). That hearing resulted from the appeal by both the employee and the employer, a self-insurer, from a conference order pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, filed on April 14, 1992, awarding temporary total incapacity compensation from April 19, 1991, to July 2, 1991, in addition to medical benefits under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 30, and $1,000 in counsel fees, plus expenses, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">At issue at the hearing, held pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, on December 12, 1992, were the employee\u2019s claims for temporary total compensation, medical benefits, and a claim for further benefits beyond July 2, 1991, as well as attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. The employer also appealed from the conference order raising issues of liability, disability, and the extent of disability. The administrative judge found that the employee was temporarily and totally disabled from April 18, 1991, to July 2, 1991, but then was capable of returning to work without restrictions. He also denied and dismissed the employee\u2019s claim for further benefits after July 2, 1991. The employee appealed to the reviewing board, which summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employee\u2019s claim for an attorney\u2019s fee was not addressed at either the hearing or reviewing board level.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The employee argues that the administrative judge failed to address all of his claims and issues in controversy, and this failure is a ground for reversal. However, with the exception of the employee\u2019s argument that a medical opinion improperly was adopted, which we address later, he does not argue any error in the administrative judge\u2019s disposition of any of his claims other than attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, we have no occasion to revisit the other claims and issues. The employer contends that it prevailed because no further compensation was awarded beyond that granted at the conference level.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">1. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Section 13A(5)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that when an insurer contests a claim and the employee prevails at a \u00a7 11 hearing, the insurer shall pay a fee of $3,500 to the employee\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The regulations applicable at the time of the hearing in this case, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1992), state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>that an employee \u201cshall be deemed to have prevailed, for the purposes of M.G.L. c. 152, s. 13A(l)-(3), when compensation is ordered or is not discontinued . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even though the employer challenged the employee\u2019s claims of disability at the de novo hearing, the evidentiary burden was on the employee with respect to all of his claims. See <em>Ginley\u2019s Case, </em>244 Mass. 346, 348 (1923); <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1068 (1982); <em>Mulcahey\u2019s Case, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 (1988). Thus, all the benefits granted in the conference order were in jeopardy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given that the employer appealed from the conference order and the judge entered a de novo finding of total temporary disability, the employee prevailed within the meaning of \u00a7 13A(5) since, in the terms of the interpretive regulation, \u201ccompensation [was] ordered\u201d in the sense that the previously ordered payments were confirmed. Had the administrative judge, responding to the employer\u2019s appeal, in any way reduced the temporary disability payments awarded by the conference order, the employee would have been exposed to a recoupment claim by the employer for the recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of overpayments pursuant to \u00a7 11D(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See generally Gar-gano, Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 1.02, at 1-106-1-108 (3d ed. rev. 1994); Locke, Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act \u00a7 7.18 (Supp. 1995). Consequently, the employee falls within the typical \u201cprevailing party\u201d formulation of one who succeeds on any significant litigation issue, achieving \u201csome of the benefit\u201d sought in the controversy. <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978). Cf. <em>Daly\u2019s Case, </em>405 Mass. 33, 41 (1989). See generally Gargano, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1.04; Locke, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 12.1-12.4. The decisions of the board and the administrative judge implicitly denying the employee\u2019s claim for an attorney\u2019s fee are, therefore, based on an error of law, and we remand this case to the Department of Industrial Accidents for an order that the employer pay the statutory legal fee and expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Lettich\u2019s Case, </em>403 Mass. 389, 395 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">2. <em>Adoption of medical opinion. </em>There is no merit in the employee\u2019s argument that the administrative judge improperly adopted the opinion of the employer\u2019s physician in concluding that the employee was able to return to work without restriction. In any event, the administrative judge\u2019s decision indicates he relied on more than the opinion of the employer\u2019s physician. See generally <em>Amon\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 210, 214-215 (1943); <em>Woolfall\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1070, 1071 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the Department of Industrial Accidents for an order requiring the employer to pay the statutory attorney\u2019s fee of $3,500 and necessary expenses pursuant to \u00a7 13A(5). In all other respects the decision of the reviewing board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-14\">The employee was injured on April 18, 1991, while employed as a Boston penal institutions department corrections officer at the Suffolk County house of correction. He returned to work on July 10, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">For a summary of the four stages in the review process in the Department of Industrial Accidents, see <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Indus. Acc., </em>415 Mass. 218, 223-225 &amp; n.13 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The terms of St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 103, provide that \u00a7 13A, as amended by \u00a7 35 of c. 398, shall apply to services performed after the effective date of the act, which was December 23, 1991. It appears that all the services of counsel at issue in the present case were performed- after this date, the \u00a7 11 hearing having been held late in 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b64-10\">In pertinent part \u00a7 13A(5), as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 35, provides: \u201cWhenever an insurer ... contests a claim for benefits and . . . the employee prevails at [a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 11] the insurer shall pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>a fee to the employee\u2019s attorney in an amount equal to three thousand five hundred dollars plus necessary expenses. An administrative judge may increase or decrease such fee based on the complexity of the dispute or the effort expended by the attorney.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The regulations in effect at the relevant times in the present case were effective on May 8, 1992. They do not differ from those currently in effect, issued on September 1, 1993. The reference in the regulations to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(3), however, appears to refer to the statute in effect prior to the comprehensive amendments enacted in 1991. Former \u00a7 13A(3) is now paragraph (5), so it appears that the regulation still is intended to apply to appeals from conference orders. Cf. <em>Arbogast </em>v. <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 719, 722 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The entire paragraph of the regulation states: \u201cIn any proceeding before the division of dispute resolution, the claimant shall be deemed to have prevailed, for the purposes of M.G.L. c. 152, S. 13A(l)-(3), when compensation is ordered or is not discontinued at such proceeding, except where the claimant has appealed a conference order <em>for which there is no pending appeal from the insurer </em>and the decision of the administrative judge does not direct a payment of weekly or other compensation benefits exceeding that being paid by the insurer prior to such decision . . (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Our record is silent as to whether the employer actually paid compensation for the closed period after the \u00a7 10A conference order. Compliance with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 17, would result in payment being made within fourteen days of the issuance of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">As inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 32, this section provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn insurer that has paid compensation pursuant to a conference order, shall, upon receipt of a decision of an administrative judge or a court of the commonwealth which indicates that overpayments have been made be entitled to recover such overpayments by unilateral reduction of weekly benefits ... of any remaining compensation owed the employee. Where overpayments have been made that cannot be recovered in this manner, recoupment may be ordered pursuant to the filing of a complaint pursuant to section ten or by bringing an action against the employee in superior court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Nothing in the record or arguments before us suggests that the complexity of the dispute or the effort expended by the attorney are such as would justify increasing or decreasing the statutory fee of $3,500.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
