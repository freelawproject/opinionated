Instead, she was paid $23,263, prompting her to complain of \u201cmisleading and false advertisement\u201d to the Attorney General who forwarded her complaint to the commission. In an administrative hearing before the commission, she maintained that the defendant had violated G. L. c. 93A. A hearing officer, in a decision adopted by the commission, ruled that the commission is not subject to the provisions of that statute, and in any event, had not violated it. He found that the commission\u2019s advertisement of an average prize of $50,000 was made in good faith and that the plaintiff was induced to play Mass Millions by the advertised size of the jackpot (eleven million dollars) and not because of the advertisements relating to the second prize. The hearing officer concluded that the plaintiff had been paid the amount due her under the commission\u2019s then applicable parimutuel rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The plaintiff appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, seeking judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A in a complaint which, as amended, also contained three common law counts alleging breach of contract, deceit and negligent misrepresentation, together with a count alleging violation of G. L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 9. The judge affirmed the commission\u2019s decision and, acting on the parties\u2019 cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), allowed that of the commission. Subsequently, a second judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from judgment and allowed the commission\u2019s second motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the common law counts and the count under G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this appeal the plaintiff raises two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">1. <em>The G. L. c. 93A claim. </em>The plaintiff invokes c. 93A, claiming the commission is a \u201cperson\u201d engaged in trade or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>commerce and, therefore, subject to its provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She cites no cases, nor are we aware of any, holding that statutorily created bodies such as the commission are proper defendants under c. 93A. It is generally accepted that the Commonwealth cannot be impleaded in its courts except where an act of the Legislature clearly manifests its consent. <em>Morash &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 612, 615 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>ELM Med. Labs., Inc., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 77-79 (1992). \u201cChapter 93A contains no explicit indication that governmental entities are to be liable under its provisions.\u201d <em>United States Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>402 Mass. 228, 232 (1988). See also <em>All Seasons Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston, </em>416 Mass. 269, 271 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Although it is apparent that c. 93A does not expressly expose the commission to suit, we need not rely on that ground since we conclude that the commission is not a \u201cperson\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce.\u201d \u201c[I]t is a widely accepted rule of statutory construction that general words in a statute such as \u2018persons\u2019 will not ordinarily be construed to include the State or political subdivisions thereof.\u201d <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 214, 219 (1962). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>ELM Med. Labs., Inc., supra </em>at 76-77; <em>Kilbane </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 286-287 (1982) (holding that since the Commonwealth does not come under the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-third, it cannot be held liable under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 91, which proscribes false advertising by \u201c[a]ny person\u201d). Even if we assume the commission is a person within the statutory definition, compare <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., 399 </em>Mass. 569, 575 (1987),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> amenability to suit under the statute cannot be considered apart from the context of the particular acts under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>review. See <em>Planned Parenthood Fedn. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Problem Pregnancy of Worcester, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 480, 492-493 (1986) (\u201cPP, Inc.\u2019s status as a \u2018charitable\u2019 corporation is not, in and of itself, dispositive of the issue whether c. 93A applies\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThus, the proscription in \u00a7 2 of \u2018unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\u2019 must be read to apply to those acts or practices which are perpetrated in a business context.\u201d <em>Lantner </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>374 Mass. 606, 611 (1978). See also <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, 775 (1992); <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Assn., </em>417 Mass. 48, 52 (1994). We must therefore determine whether the commission acts in a business context as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The Legislature has mandated the commission to \u201cconduct a state lottery,\u201d G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 24, as inserted by St. 1971, c. 813, \u00a7 2, and to establish a fluid consisting \u201cof all revenues received from the sale of lottery tickets . . . [i]n order to provide local property tax relief and continue services at the local level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 35, as amended through St. 1977, c. 185. The activities of the commission are driven by legislative mandate, not business or personal objectives. Compare <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, supra </em>at <em>777. </em>In that respect, it stands in sharp contrast to State-regulated racetracks which \u201care private proprietary corporations engaged in trade and commerce.\u201d <em>DePasquale </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 662 (1990).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the conduct of a lottery generally is prohibited and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>criminalized by statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 271, \u00a7\u00a7 7 &amp; 9. The commission\u2019s lotteries exist in an environment where similar lawful activities within the Commonwealth consist only of government sponsored lotteries, and \u201craffles\u201d and \u201cbazaars\u201d conducted by certain nonprofit organizations under permits issued pursuant to statutory authority. See G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 7A. Thus created, protected and regulated by and pursuant to statute, the commission\u2019s activities hardly resemble endeavors conducted in a conventional business context. Given this dissimilarity, we conclude that \u201c[t]he deterrence goals of c. 93A are inapplicable\u201d to the commission\u2019s lottery activities. <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Assn., supra </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">2. <em>The common law administrative claims. </em>The plaintiff asserts she is entitled to litigate the common law counts in her amended complaint because they are independent and preexisting causes of action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She also argues she was not required to raise these causes of action before the commission because it is without jurisdiction to hear them or to grant her appropriate relief. Such views misperceive the proper relationships between courts and administrative agencies. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-222 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The commission is authorized by statute to determine the types of lotteries and the sizes of prizes to be awarded and to establish rules and regulations it deems necessary or desirable. See G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 24. It is beyond dispute that where the Legislature has entrusted such matters to an administrative agency, its adjudicatory proceedings must be utilized before there may be resort to the courts. See <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>320 Mass. 467, 469-470 (1946). Cf. <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 451-452 (1973). With the exception of her claim of violation of c. 93 A, everything which the plaintiff placed before the commission is a subject well within its jurisdiction and discretion and properly was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>dressed at the administrative hearing. At that hearing, conducted without any limitation of issues,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> plaintiffs counsel summed up her view of the issues as misrepresentation and false advertising by the commission, and argued the applicability of c. 93 A, concluding that the plaintiff was \u201casking for what she bargained for.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff put before the commission the substance of the causes of action which she later formulated as separate counts in the Superior Court. The focus of all these counts is on whether the plaintiff is entitled to a prize of $50,000 and the record shows the commission addressed all the relevant factual issues inherent in the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">By purchasing a ticket the plaintiff entered into a contractual arrangement with the commission and is deemed to have reasonable notice of the pertinent regulations and rules of the game. See <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>State Lottery Commn., </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 686, 689 (1986). See also <em>DePasquale </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. at 661. In its decision, the commission determined any contractual issue when it concluded that the prize properly was calculated in accordance with its regulation applicable to parimutuel payoffs. 961 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.54(7) (1991). There is no contention in the pleadings, nor has it been argued to us, that the commission did not follow its regulations and rules. The commission\u2019s decision also resolved the claims of deceit and misrepresentation in finding that the advertising was prepared in good faith, that there was no reliance by the plaintiff on it and that, in any event, if c. 93A were applicable, there was no violation of its provisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, there was no issue presented to the Superior Court that is appropriate for direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>judicial determination outside of review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), and the judge therefore did not err in allowing the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Although the plaintiffs amended complaint can be read to state that her action against the commission followed her acceptance of payment of the prize, the commission did not raise as a defense the regulation which provides that such a payment operates as a discharge of the commission and the director from further liability or responsibility. 961 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.45 (1986). The parties do not argue such an issue on appeal. Contrast <em>Craft </em>v. <em>Capital Dist. Regional Off Track Betting Corp., </em>107 A.D.2d 952, 953-954 (N.Y. 1985). We proceed, therefore, to address the issues relating to the sufficiency of the plaintiffs amended complaint.

Supp. 386 (D. Mass. 1986), for the proposition that the government is a person subject to c. 93 A liability. In that case, the Federal judge acknowledged that \u201cChapter 93A does not by its terms specifically apply to public agencies,\u201d but held that the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, in his capacity as a landlord, is subject to suit under c. 93A as a \u201cperson,\u201d citing the specific application of c. 93A to landlord-tenant relations. <em>Id. </em>at 387-388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-12\">The Commonwealth asserts the actions of the commission are exempt from c. 93A by the terms of \u00a7 3, as inserted by St. 1983, c. 242, which states that nothing in c. 93A \u201cshall apply to transactions or actions otherwise permitted under laws as administered by any regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of the commonwealth. . . .\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>cannot construe that section as applying to the operations of the commission at issue in this case.
