We reach it after a sequential statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">On November 19, 1994, about 11:45 p.m., James Horrigan was arrested on route 62 by North Reading Officer Robert Marchionda, and later was charged by complaint with operating under the influence of liquor and with civil violations of speeding and crossing a marked lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">The matter came to trial in Cambridge District Court, jury-of-six session, on the afternoon of March 23, 1995. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Called by the Commonwealth, Marchionda testified that while on uniform patrol in a cruiser that night, headed east on route 62, he observed a car traveling west in the next lane at forty-five miles per hour in a thirty mile per hour zone and swerving or weaving. Marchionda said he made a three-point turn, gave chase, and, activating his lights, caused the car to pull to the side of the road and stop. As he asked the driver, James Horrigan (defendant), routine questions, he smelled the odor of alcohol and saw the glassy-eyed sign of inebriation. Marchionda said he put Horrigan through a series of field sobriety tests which he believed demonstrated impairment of Horrigan\u2019s capacity to drive. Thereupon Marchionda wrote a citation and placed the defendant under arrest. On cross-examination the officer conceded that the defendant, although swerving, had not crossed the center line, and that the defendant had understood and responded to instructions during the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Officer Kevin Brennan, who had arrived as backup, in his testimony confirmed that the defendant had difficulty with the tests and smelled of alcohol; he reported also that the defendant had been belligerent, agitated, swearing repeatedly while being conducted to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The Commonwealth rested, defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding was denied, and the defense called Horri-gan\u2019s mother to the stand. She testified to receiving a telephone call from her son (a youth, eighteen years old) at 12:20 a.m. and picking him up at the police station. The witness said Horrigan sounded clear and direct on the phone; on the drive home about 2 a.m. he appeared angry and upset, but sober. With the close of the mother\u2019s redirect examination, the presiding judge, Judge Sragow, recessed the case for the day. A transcript from the tape for the day ran to but eighty-two pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">As the trial was about to resume the next morning, the first justice of the court entered the courtroom and made an announcement declaring a mistrial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m Judge Sherman and I\u2019m the First Justice of this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201cRegretfully, about 30 minutes ago we were informed of a medical emergency in Judge Sragow\u2019s family, as a consequence of which this case cannot go forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u201cI\u2019m required, under the rules of court, to declare a mistrial. That means that this case for these purposes at this point in time is over and that the parties will have to start all over again, depending upon what the schedule of the session is. And that, I would assume, you would arrange, please, with the clerk. The Jury of Six office will reschedule the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cI have no idea as to the nature of the emergency but it\u2019s the \u2014 I\u2019ve been working with Judge Sragow now since the day of her first appointment and I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s the first day she\u2019s ever missed work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your inconvenience but you\u2019re excused at this point. And if counsel will see the clerk, arrangements will be made for your convenience to reschedule the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Before trial commenced on the rescheduled day, April 26, 1995, the defendant moved for dismissal on double jeopardy grounds. The motion was denied by Judge Sragow in chambers. Another judge presided at trial. The prosecution called Officers Marchionda and Brennan, as before. Now the prosecution called a third witness, the booking sergeant, Joseph Thibodeau. Thibodeau said he believed Horrigan was drunk during the booking; on reaching his cell, Horrigan fell asleep. The defense, following the mother\u2019s testimony, put Horrigan on the stand. He admitted to having had two beers earlier that evening but denied having been intoxicated: he was very tired, he said, he had done eight hours work stacking rocks as a mason\u2019s assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">This second trial ended the day it began. The jury found the defendant guilty of driving under the influence and speeding. He was sentenced to one year\u2019s probation with a program of alcohol evaluation and one year\u2019s loss of license; he was fined for speeding. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, claiming error in the denial of his double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">1. <em>Manifest necessity.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where jeopardy has attached \u2014 as it did here when the first jury were empaneled and sworn, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Collins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>412 Mass. 349, 352 (1992) \u2014 a judge may not declare a mistrial with a prospect of second jeopardy except for \u201cmanifest necessity,\u201d and that limited power is to be used with \u201cgreatest caution\u201d and for \u201cvery plain\u201d reason. So said Justice Story in a famous passage of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824): \u201c[T]he law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In light of the importance to the defendant of the right to be free of exposure to a second jeopardy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the burden of justifying a mistrial purporting to rest on manifest necessity falls on the Commonwealth. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978). An appellate court \u201cshall be deferential to the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in ruling that a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 exists for a mistrial \u2018only if it is clear from the record that the judge has given careful consideration to the available alternatives and to the defendant\u2019s interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 79 (1985), quoting from <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 517, 519 (1982). In <em>Steward, </em>the court said, \u201cTwo principles emerge for guidance: (1) counsel must be given full opportunity to be heard and (2) the trial judge must give careful consideration to alternatives to a mistrial.\u201d 396 Mass, at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In the present case, neither of the \u201cprinciples\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>observed. The statement of the first justice was sudden, brief, and unexpected, neither preceded nor accompanied by discussion with counsel. There was no consideration of alternatives to handling the situation less drastic than mistrial. Indeed, the first justice\u2019s statement that he was required by rules of court to order a mistrial indicates that he was impervious to possible alternatives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As in <em>Steward, </em>where \u201cthe judge declared a mistrial because he thought that he was compelled to do so,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 77, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right was infringed when it appeared that reasonable alternatives might exist. Thus it could have been ascertained upon brief continuance when Judge Sragow might become available \u2014 conceivably quite soon, as the emergency was in the family and likely not her own. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass, at 79-80; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>412 Mass, at 351-352; contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>598 F.2d 132, 133-136 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert, denied, 440 U.S. 939 (1979). Another possibility was that, upon discussion, the defendant might have consented to having another judge of the court, if available, come in and continue with and complete the trial. See Mass. R.Crim.P. 38(a), 378 Mass. 916 (1979), \u201cDisability of Judge\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">\u201cIf by reason of death, sickness, or other disability the judge before whom a jury trial has commenced is unable to proceed with the trial, any other judge of that court or properly assigned to that court, upon certifying in writing that he has familiarized himself with the record of the trial, may proceed with and finish the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">2. <em>Consent. </em>The Commonwealth argues that, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>manifest necessity did not exist, the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim should fail because his counsel \u201cconsented\u201d to the mistrial by not registering an objection at the time. The Commonwealth points to the moments during which the first justice spoke \u2014 more particularly, perhaps, the interval between the speaker\u2019s third paragraph and the end of his statement \u2014 as time in which the defendant could have considered, and then uttered an objection. This underestimates or ignores the difficulty of reaching a decision (in which the defendant has an evident personal stake) whether the defense would be advantaged or the opposite by a second trial: the possibilities ahead (such as the appearance of a new prosecution witness) cannot be instantly calculated. Therefore, to equate silence with \u201cconsent\u201d when the occasion comes abruptly and unexpectedly seems quite unwise. And an examination of the decisions shows that, where silence in the face of a declaration of mistrial has been held to indicate consent, the total situation was such that the defendant could reasonably have anticipated that the issue of a mistrial would arise and could prepare himself for the event; silence could then be plausibly read as acquiescence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Otherwise, where there was not such an opportunity,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> our cases show that consent is not lightly inferred from silence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>A further consideration. Here, the first justice stated that he was bound by rules to order the mistrial, and he ordered it peremptorily. He said, \u201cI\u2019m required, under the rules of court, to declare a mistrial .... [Tjhis case ... at this point in time is over . . . .\u201d The defendant had a basis for believing that an objection would be futile. In like cases, defendants have not been held obliged to make futile gestures, and silence has not been taken to amount to consent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We note, finally, that \u201c[t]he important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 609 (1976). The question whether the defendant has indeed retained control by a consent real rather than fictitious is \u201cimportant.\u201d On this question the Commonwealth bears the burden, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 313, 315 (1979), and in this instance has not carried it.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>The judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the complaint is to he dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of double jeopardy \u2014 \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\u201d \u2014 applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 793-796 (1969). The common law of Massachusetts has long provided similar protection. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>410 Mass. 174, 176 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u201cEven if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may be grossly unfair. It increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused, prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted. The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503-504 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\">It is not clear what rule or rules of court the judge had in mind. As indicated below, Mass.R.Crim.P. 38(a) provides a means of continuing the trial rather than aborting it by a declaration of mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>423 Mass. 506 (1996), the court considered the applicability of rule 38(a) to situations where the defendant does not consent to the substitution. Any difficulty with such a forced expedient are naturally relieved where the defendant consents. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to the rule, second paragraph (Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 574 [Law Co-op. 1979]); and see the <em>Carter </em>case at 509 n.2:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u201cMany defendants may prefer the continuation of trial. That course reduces legal costs that the nonindigent defendant bears personally. If the defendant is not free on bail there is also an incentive to hasten any possible acquittal and resulting release from custody. The defendant may prefer the substitute over the original judge or believe that the case is proceeding fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>vorably. These incentives may reduce the number of cases in which substitution, rare in and of itself, is contested.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">See, as typical, <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>936 F.2d 6, 9-11 (1st Cir. 1991): defendant\u2019s silence (absence of objection) was taken as consent to the judge\u2019s declaration of mistrial where all were aware of errors several hours earlier at trial and possible curative instructions had been discussed at conference; defense counsel \u201cshould have anticipated the possibility of a mistrial and been prepared to object\u201d (at 11).
