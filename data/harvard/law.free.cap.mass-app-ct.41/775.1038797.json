(Media), under G. L. c. 93D, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to erect a billboard at each of two sites in Boston \u2014 100 Tenean Street and 650-700 Morrissey Boulevard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both locations are adjacent to the Southeast Expressway, an interstate highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">On the appeal by the city of Boston (city), a judge of the Superior Court, proceeding under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, affirmed the decision of the board, and the. city appealed from the final judgment claiming error in the administrative process. As required by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(5), our review is confined to the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">1. <em>The statutory and administrative structure. </em>General Laws c. 93D, \u00a7 2, as inserted by St. 1971, c. 1070, \u00a7 1, prohibits outdoor advertising \u201cwithin six hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way . . . of a highway in the interstate or primary systems except <em>...(d) </em>Signs, displays and devices which are located in areas which are zoned industrial or commercial under authority of law and which have permits issued under the provisions of section three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Section three of c. 93D, as \u00bfmended by St. 1977, c. 530, \u00a7 5, states that the board \u201cis authorized to issue permits for the erection and maintenance of signs, displays and devices described in clause[ ] . . . <em>(d) </em>of section two,\u201d (quoted above) provided that the erection and maintenance of such signs comply with agreements between the Department of Highways (DH)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the United States Secretary of Transportation as authorized by G. L. c. 93D, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section three also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>provides that no permit is required for signs described in clauses <em>(b) </em>and (c) of \u00a7 2 (signs advertising activity conducted on the property on which the sign is located and signs advertising the sale or lease of property upon which the sign is located \u2014 so-called \u201con-premises\u201d signs).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The agreement between the DH and the Secretary of Transportation (the agreement)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> states that its purposes are, inter alia, to \u201cdetermine the size, lighting and spacing of signs . . . which may be erected . . . within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way [of interstate highways located] within areas zoned industrial or commercial . . . [and] to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel and to preserve natural beauty.\u201d A \u201csign\u201d is defined in the agreement to mean \u201cany outdoor sign . . . which is visible from any place on the main-traveled way of an Interstate . . . highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">With regard to the space <em>between </em>signs on interstate highways, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>the agreement provides that \u201c[s]pacing between signs along each side of the highway shall be a minimum of 500 feet.\u201d We shall refer to this requirement as the \u201cspacing requirement.\u201d There is no provision in the agreement which describes how the distance between signs is to be measured; we discuss this difficulty below.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">A further limitation imposed by the agreement is that signs \u201cmay not be located within 300 feet of State or other public parks, playgrounds, forests, reservations, and scenic areas designated as such by the Department [of Highways].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We shall refer to this requirement as the \u201cpark requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Where a question arises as to whether a proposed sign complies with c. 93D and the agreement, a certification by the DH that a proposed billboard conforms to G. L. c. 93D <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>\u201cshall constitute a rebuttable presumption of the matter[ ] certified.\u201d 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07(3)(1988).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">2. <em>The spacing requirement as applied to Tenean Street. </em>As noted above, G. L. c. 93D, \u00a7 3, provides that the board may issue billboard permits for off-premises signs provided that there is compliance with the spacing requirement. The application of the intervener, Media, included the certification of the DH, dated June 11, 1989, that the proposed sign was in conformity with c. 93D.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The administrative record includes the outdoor advertising inspection report of Inspector Regan, also dated June 11, 1989. In response to the question appearing on the report \u2014 \u201cHow many feet to nearest billboard (distance)\u201d \u2014 no information was provided by Inspector Regan. At the bottom of the form appears the statement \u201cConforms to 93D.\u201d Media\u2019s application was accompanied by the certificate of Robert H. Johnson, the DH chief engineer, dated June 11, 1989, in which he states that the proposed sign is \u201cin conformity with the provisions of Chapter 93D of the General Laws.\u201d The certificate is silent as to the spacing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">At the hearing before the hearing officer, Edmund Pantal-one testified. He stated that he was an inspector for the \u201cOutdoor Advertising Agency.\u201d On cross-examination by the city, he testified, without objection, that the outdoor sign on top of the J. Freeman building, north of the proposed sign, was \u201c[bjetween 300 and 400 feet\u201d from the proposed Media sign. The plan of the area, which is in the appendix to the brief, shows a \u201cJ. Freeman, Inc.\u201d building northwest of the proposed sign; it appears from markers on the plan (there is no scale on the copy in the appendix) that the building is within 500 feet of the Southeast Expressway.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The hearing officer\u2019s recommended decision to approve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>application did not discuss the absence of any material measurements in Inspector Regan\u2019s report, nor did it discuss the agreement or the effect of Pantalone\u2019s testimony \u2014 admitted without objection \u2014 which, if credited, would appear to establish a violation of the spacing requirement under the agreement. The decision of the board adopted in full the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The judge in the Superior Court noted that the parties were in disagreement regarding the interpretation of the agreement \u2014 Media and the board arguing that the agreement only regulates the distance between off-premises signs, while the city argued that the agreement regulates the distance between any signs and that the proposed sign was within the prohibited 500 feet zone from an on-premises sign. The judge, without deciding this dispute, concluded that regardless of which signs were covered, the spacing requirement under the agreement required that the distance between signs be measured \u201calong each side of the highway,\u201d and the city had failed to present evidence of such a measurement. In these circumstances, the judge held, the board was entitled to rely on the DH certification of conformity with the requirements of c. 93D.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In our view, (i) the failure of Inspector Regan to record his measurement of the distance from the proposed sign to the \u201cnearest billboard,\u201d taken together with (ii) the plan of the area, and (iii) the testimony of Pantalone \u2014 which the hearing officer did not discredit \u2014 that the distance between the proposed sign and the sign on top of the J. Freeman building was 300 feet to 400 feet (both signs being within the regulated zone of 660 feet), rebutted the presumption of the certification of compliance. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 5.8.5, at 235 (6th ed. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The issue whether the proposed sign would violate the spacing requirement must be resolved by the hearing officer, and we must remand the case for that purpose. The hearing officer must determine both <em>how </em>the distance between two signs is to be measured and the actual measurement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the proposed sign and the nearest existing outdoor sign visible from the highway. Resolution of these issues in the first instance requires the exercise of the board\u2019s expertise to assure obedience to the high purposes of the agreement<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (to promote both safety and the natural beauty of areas surrounding interstate highways), see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as inserted by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3 (court shall give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency\u201d). The board\u2019s decision will be given some deference. See <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>416 Mass. 540, 555 (1993) (\u201cIn reviewing mixed questions of fact and law, the [appellate tax] board\u2019s expertise in tax matters must be recognized, and its decisions are due \u2018some deference\u2019\u201d). As to the distance measured, the decision of the board will not be reversed or modified if it is based on substantial evidence, see <em>ibid., </em>Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 1638, at 163 (1986), an element that is plainly lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In connection with <em>how </em>the distances are to be measured \u2014 to be decided in the first instance by the board \u2014 we offer these observations. The clause of the agreement requiring \u201cspacing between signs along each side of the highway\u201d to be not less that 500 feet contains a critical ambiguity: is the phrase \u201calong each side of the highway\u201d meant to modify \u201csigns\u201d (that is, the draftsman may have intended to refer to any sign which is within the regulated zone of 660 feet, and the measurement to be taken is along the direct line between the proposed sign and the nearest existing outdoor sign visible from the highway), or was the phrase meant to modify \u201cspacing\u201d (that is, the draftsman may have intended to look only to what a traveler on the highway would likely see \u201calong each side\u201d of the highway), and the measurement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>that event, which we set out in the margin, would be more complex.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We decline to choose among these alternatives; indeed, there may be additional approaches which are equally rational. The choice must be made by the board, selecting that method of measurement which, in the judgment of the board, is most likely to carry out the purposes of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1958. Moreover, the board may decide that a proposed sign is required to pass more than one test to be acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">We also conclude, contrary to the argument of Media and the board, that the signs to be measured are both on-premises and off-premises signs. While \u00a7 2 does distinguish between on-premises and off-premises signs, and \u00a7 3, as we noted earlier, is expressly made inapplicable to on-premises signs,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the distinction made by \u00a7 3 is only for the purpose of determining the availability of permits issuable thereunder. No such distinction is made in the spacing clause, or in the definition of a \u201csign\u201d under the agreement which the board is obliged to enforce when issuing \u00a7 3 permits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">We return to the administrative record. While Pantalone\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>testimony would appear to have rebutted the certification of the DH as to conformance to c. 93D, the question of the spacing requirement, and the effect to be given to Pantalone\u2019s testimony, were left unresolved. The hearing officer makes no mention of the issue<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> although the relevant testimony (albeit to a limited extent) was elicited on cross-examination and the issue regarding the spacing requirement was clearly identified to the hearing officer by the city\u2019s letter dated December 14, 1992. The issue was briefed again in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The result is that a substantive issue was overlooked by the hearing officer, and left uncorrected by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In sum, the city, as the appealing party, has the burden to demonstrate the invalidity of the administrative determination, <em>Merisme </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 474 (1989), and here it has established that the decision of the board, which adopted in full the recommendations of the hearing officer, must be set aside as to Tenean Street because of error of law \u2014 the failure to consider and act upon a substantive issue put forward by a party to the proceedings. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8) (agency decision must include a determination of each issue of fact and law necessary to the decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">3. <em>The spacing requirement as applied to Morrissey Boulevard. </em>For similar reasons, we reach the same conclusion regarding the spacing requirement as applied to the proposed sign on Morrissey Boulevard. Joseph B. Chaisson, a resident of the area and an officer of various neighborhood associations, testified that other signs, visible from the Southeast Expressway, were within 500 feet of the proposed sign. Pan-talone also testified that another on-premises sign was within 500 feet of the proposed sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The DH certified the application as being in conformity with c. 93D on July 3, 1989, and Regan\u2019s inspection report dated June 26, 1989, states that the distance to the nearest billboard was \u201cmore than 500 feet.\u201d However, Pantalone\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>inspection report dated September 12, 1989, recites that an on-premises sign is within 500 feet of the proposed sign, and he so testified. Again, the hearing officer\u2019s recommended decision recites the DH certification but makes no mention of the spacing requirement under the agreement which was, as we have seen, a live issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The judge concluded that the hearing officer was entitled to rely on the DH certification. While we agree with the judge as to the \u201cmurkiness of the record,\u201d we do not agree that the DH certification is sufficient to carry the day for Media. Based on the testimony of Chaisson and Pantalone, as well as the inspection report of Pantalone, the DH certification was effectively rebutted. The critical issue of the spacing requirement, which was raised before the hearing officer, should have been dealt with by the hearing officer and the board. The decision of the board, which merely adopted in full the findings and conclusions of the hearing officer, is defective as matter of law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">4. <em>The park status of Morrissey Boulevard </em>\u2014 <em>the park requirement. </em>It is not disputed that the proposed sign would be within 300 feet of Morrissey Boulevard, including the grass slope embankments of the Southeast Expressway between Morrissey Boulevard and the roadway of the Southeast Expressway. If, as the city claims, Morrissey Boulevard falls within the definition of a \u201cpublic park\u201d under Federal<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or State law,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the proposed sign may not be erected and the permit would have been wrongfully issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The city\u2019s principal witness, Julia O\u2019Brien, director of planning for the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), testified that Morrissey Boulevard has been designated a metro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>politan parkway; that is, \u201ca roadway that links to the various parks of our park system.\u201d The purpose of an MDC parkway is \u201cpleasure driving,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. O\u2019Brien also conceded that commercial activity exists on both sides of Morrissey Boulevard in the area at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">There was also evidence that a DH inspector, after viewing the site, concluded that Morrissey Boulevard was not a park within the regulatory definition of that term. We agree with the judge; there was substantial evidence, under applicable Federal and State standards, that Morrissey Boulevard is neither a public park nor a reservation reserved for recreation or conservation purposes, nor is it a. scenic area designated by the DH. The board\u2019s decision on this issue must be affirmed. See <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992) (\u201cThe standard of review is highly deferential to the agency on questions of fact and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">This case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings before the board consistent with this opinion, including detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, regarding the spacing requirements for both the Tenean Street and the Morrissey Boulevard permit applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Chapter 93D regulates outdoor advertising signs which are adjacent to highways.

Regs. \u00a7 3.12(6)(1988). We need not comment on the apparent inconsistency between the agreement and the regulation for, as we state below, nothing at issue in these proceedings turns on the distance from a park.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b806-9\">General Laws c. 93, \u00a7 29, as inserted by St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 4, authorized the board to \u201cmake . . . rules and regulations for the proper control and restriction of billboards, signs and other advertising devices ... on public ways or on private property within public view of any highway, public park or reservation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Our discussion of the testimony of Pantalone, and the plan which accompanied the application of Media, assumes that the appropriate method of measurement is along a straight line between the existing sign and the proposed sign. We discuss this assumption in more detail <em>infra. </em>What is important here is that the hearing officer never addressed the issue of the spacing requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The judge also rested her decision on Pantalone\u2019s testimony that the proposed sign complied with c. 93D and the agreement, but there was no discussion of Pantalone\u2019s testimony regarding the 300-400 foot distance between signs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Federal Department of Transportation is content to leave the resolution of these issues to local authorities.

If this procedure is followed, two (or more) lines perpendicular to the centerline of the highway would be drawn, one to the proposed sign, and one (or more) lines to outdoor signs near to the proposed sign. The distance between signs could then be measured along the highway (i.e., from the starting point, on the highway, of each of the perpendicular lines).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">An alternative would be to follow the methodology set forth in the regulation regarding the calculation of the 660 feet of regulated space for outdoor signs: you proceed from the sign to \u201cthe <em>nearest </em>edge of the right-of-way adjacent to\u201d the interstate (emphasis added). See 23 CFR \u00a7 750.706 (1996).
