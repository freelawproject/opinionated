The plaintiff had engaged the defendants under a contingent fee agreement signed by the plaintiff and the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that under the agreement the defendants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the right to retain a fee of only $10,000, and it sought the recovery of $39,980 and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At the close of the plaintiffs case, and at the close of all the evidence, the plaintiff moved for a directed verdict. The motions were denied. Both motions were grounded on the claim that the written contingent fee agreement must be construed against the defendants, and when so construed, the defendants would be entitled to a fee of $10,000. Following the answers of the jury to special questions, a final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>was entered awarding the defendants $49,980 as their fee. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. The plaintiffs claim was settled more than thirty days after the date of the fee agreement but prior to the commencement of any action. The defendants argue that the fee agreement was a \u201cpartially integrated contract\u201d because there was no provision in the contingent fee agreement for the calculation of the fee in the event the case was settled after thirty days and before suit was brought. For that reason, argue the defendants, the judge was correct in admitting parol evidence of an antecedent oral agreement (establishing the fee at 16.66 percent of any settlement of the claim following the initial thirty-day period and prior to suit) which did not vary or contradict the terms of the written contingent fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The judge\u2019s decision to permit the introduction of conversations between the parties regarding the fee arrangement in the event the claim was settled after thirty days and before the commencement of an action led directly to special question number one for the jury,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> namely, whether <em>\u201c\\p]rior </em>to the execution of the Fee Agreement\u201d (emphasis added) there was an agreement setting the defendants\u2019 fee in the event the claim was settled after thirty days but before suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The special question just quoted should not have been submitted to the jury. A contingent fee agreement which is not in writing, and therefore does not comply with S.J.C. Rule 3:05(4), 382 Mass. 762 (1981), is champertous. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Goulette, </em>344 Mass. 307, 310 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The interpretive issue is whether, in paragraph (2) of the agreement which we set out in note 2, <em>supra, </em>the clause \u201cwithin thirty (30) days of this date\u201d is a <em>condition </em>to a settlement that reduces the fee to $10,000, or merely a reference to the attorneys\u2019 expectation that suit would be brought within thirty days if the case was not settled by that time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The choice between the two interpretations is sufficiently close (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>note <em>4, supra, </em>suggests) that the resulting muddle may properly be regarded precisely as the kind of \u201cobscurity\u201d to which the court referred <em>In the Matter of Kerlinsky, </em>406 Mass. 67, 73 n.5 (1989) (where the agreement is subject to Rule 3:05, the guiding principle is that \u201cany obscurities in the agreement will be taken against the attorney who drafted it\u201d). This is based on the obligation of the attorney who drafts such an agreement to \u201csee[ ] that all its parts were completed with clarity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. Here the defendants failed to perform that obligation, and we must take the \u201cobscurities\u201d of the agreement against the defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This construction is consistent with the plain meaning of the first sentence of the same paragraph: \u201cGhent agrees that <em>if suit is filed </em>in this matter payment for services will be on a contingent fee basis as outlined below.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The contingent fee basis referred to in this last quoted clause and \u201coutlined below\u201d was 16.66% of the first $300,000, and 40% of any excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">So construed, the agreement must be taken to mean that the agreed fee was $10,000 if the case was settled prior to suit, and the defendants are obliged to return $39,980 to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The plaintiff is entitled to interest on $39,980 at the legal rate from February 11, 1985, the date the defendants confirmed in writing that they would continue to hold the funds in dispute. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C. The defendants did not engage in any unfair or deceptive act or practice, and there is no basis for the plaintiffs claims under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 51. The defendants\u2019 counterclaim must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The judgment is reversed. A new judgment is to be entered ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiff $39,980, with interest at the legal rate from February 11, 1985, and dismissing the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-16\">he following is the fee agreement signed by the parties:</p>\n<p id=\"ABo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201cAnthony Ciaramitaro, individually and as president for the Grace &amp; Nino, Inc. of 28 Dale Avenue, Gloucester, MA 01930 retains the Attorneys Orlando &amp; White of One Western Avenue, Gloucester, MA 01930, to perform the legal services mentioned in paragraph (1) below.
