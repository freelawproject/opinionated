In October, 1992, Ashley told an investigator from the Department of Social Services that both parents had sexually abused her and her younger brother over a period of years. As a result of these accusations and subsequent police investigation, the . children were placed in foster care. Both parents were charged, the defendant on thirty-five indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ments for rape of a child (three with force), six counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, and two counts of posing or exhibiting a child in a live performance involving sexual conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After trial and three days of deliberation, the jury convicted the defendant on eleven indictments for rape of a child and all of the indecent assault and battery and unlawful exhibition of a child charges. The defendant appeals, bringing up for review numerous eviden-tiary points and other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We conclude that the judge improperly admitted expert testimony on the characteristic profile of an incestuous family and other testimony directly linking the characteristics of sexually abused children to the complainants in this case. Consequently, we reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The issue that requires our scrutiny pertains to testimony offered by the government\u2019s expert, Dr. Denise Gelinas, a psychologist, and Maureen Brown, a school counselor and social worker, regarding \u201cchild disclosure processes\u201d and on the behavior patterns of children who have suffered sexual abuse. It is settled that the trial judge has discretion to allow such expert testimony where it may assist the jury in deciding a contested issue, including \u201cexpert testimony on the typical symptoms of sexually abused children because the information is beyond the common knowledge of jurors and of assistance in assessing a victim witness\u2019s testimony and credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 629-630 (1989), and cases cited. Though the <em>Dockham </em>court held that testimony about the behavioral signs and symptoms sexually abused children frequently exhibit may be admitted at the judge\u2019s discretion, \u201cthe line between proper testimony as to patterns of disclosure of child sexual abuse victims and improper testimony constituting endorsement of the credibility of a victim-witness is indeed a narrow one.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 148 (1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such limits as bear on the discretion of a trial judge to bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>impermissible opinion testimony in child sexual abuse cases were recently discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 186 (1996). The test of admissibility of sexual profile testimony is whether \u201cthe witness explicitly links the opinion to the experience of the witness child.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Such testimony clearly amounts to impermissible vouching. \u201cWhere there is no link between the expert testimony and the victim, the opinion is usually allowed.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>and cases cited. However, in some cases, the <em>Richardson </em>court said that \u201copinion testimony that does not explicitly link the opinion to the child witness [may] nevertheless constituteQ impermissible vouching.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The case at bar falls into the last category. The line was crossed when, over the defendant\u2019s objection, Dr. Gelinas went beyond the description of general principles of social or behavioral science that might assist the jury in their deliberations concerning credibility and gave testimony concerning family dynamics that evolved into profile testimony that signaled the jury that the child complainants were sexually abused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This testimony included her statement that \u201cthe most characteristic constellation or structure of an incestuous family is one in which the mother is usually . . . overburdened or impaired in some way[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]. . . . [The father] usually ha[s] in some ways a more active relationship with the children in the family than [the] mother does . . . and . . . that puts the oldest [child], usually daughter, at risk to be sexually abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>by the father in a situation in which he feels pretty highly entitled .... I almost hate to go into it but, basically, it puts the incestuously abused child in a terrible position because the person she is closest to . . . and the one to whom she probably feels the most loyal is the one who\u2019s doing the sexual[ ] abus[e].\u201d In essence, the expert gave characteristic sexual profile testimony that presented the defendant\u2019s family situation as prone to sexual abuse, suggesting to the jury that this was a reliable factor as to whether sexual abuse occurred. This inadmissible profile evidence had the effect of identifying the defendant as a person likely to commit incestuous sexual abuse, and the complainants as children who testified truthfully to the occurrence of sexual abuse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 201-202 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Maureen Brown, Ashley\u2019s school counselor, over objection, offered her personal observations gleaned from regular counseling sessions with Ashley over several years. Before allowing Brown to give testimony concerning Ashley\u2019s behavioral symptoms, the judge said that he was \u201ca little leery of [Brown] giving an opinion on the ultimate issue in this case.\u201d However, not having made a definitive ruling at that time, the judge permitted her to testify that \u201cthe biggest. . . sign[ ] that [she] observe[d] in [Ashley] that [she] could categorize as consistent with [her] experience dealing with traumatized children . . . would be [Ashley\u2019s] need to present kind of a blank slate. Very often children who have been raised in abusive homes are clearly given a rule, don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t trust, don\u2019t feel.\u201d Over the defendant\u2019s objection, Brown identified as \u201cclinical symptoms\u201d Ashley\u2019s \u201c[in]ability to deny or repress her feelings,\u201d social isolation from her peers, resistance to \u201ctherapeutic relationships,\u201d \u201cstares or spaceyness,\u201d and other diagnostic behaviors. She concluded that \u201c[t]hese . . . things ... in my experience and in the literature are significant in determining an abused child.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although she did not directly render an opinion as to whether Ashley was sexually abused, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>we conclude that Brown\u2019s testimony amounted to a lay opinion that Ashley was an abused child. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 458, 467-468 (1996). Her testimony went beyond her classroom observations of Ashley by improperly relating those observations to her experience with other traumatized children. Such testimony borders on a statement as to how this witness feels about the credibility of the child complainant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 759 (1995) (doctor\u2019s opinion testimony comparing child complainant to general characteristics of sexually abused children impermissibly intruded upon jury\u2019s province to assess credibility of the child witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Together with Dr. Gelinas\u2019s testimony that some children disassociate in order to adapt to sexual abuse and that one of the behaviors observed is that \u201cthe child will often look kind of spacey,\u201d Brown\u2019s testimony acquired the veneer of an expert. The danger of such implicit vouching is greater where, as here, the witness is testifying to actual interaction with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Although Dr. Gelinas was not a treating therapist, somewhat lessening the risk that her testimony could \u201cbe construed as impliedly supporting the truthfulness of [the complainants],\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 583, 591 (1994), that was not the case with Brown. Brown\u2019s direct testimony about Ashley\u2019s demeanor at school and behavior in regular small group discussions was highly suggestive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Coupled with Dr. Gelinas\u2019s testimony of behavioral symptoms of sexually abused children, there was a substantial risk that the jury\u2019s confidence in Ashley\u2019s credibility would be enhanced. This was especially true when the testimony came from her school counselor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 827, 832 (1994) (warning prosecutors to avoid questions to witnesses of whether child victim\u2019s behavior conformed to the \u201cgeneral characteristics\u201d of abused chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>dren). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, supra </em>at 592 (treating therapist who testifies to general syndromes might be viewed as implicitly endorsing the complainant\u2019s testimony by virtue of the fact that she has accepted complainant into therapy).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In a recent decision, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 453 (1996), we reviewed the testimony of a treating therapist who exceeded the permissible testimonial boundaries by explicitly connecting the complainants to the general syndromes associated with sexual abuse. In <em>Brouillard, </em>we also concluded that the evidence \u201chad the effect of impermissibly vouching for the complainants\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451. As in <em>Brouillard, </em>the combination of Gelinas\u2019s expert testimony and Brown\u2019s testimony, while not directly vouching for the complainants\u2019 credibility nor expressly connecting the children\u2019s claim of sexual abuse to the defendant, served as the functional equivalent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass, at 759-760. We conclude that such testimony is inadmissible because it usurps the jury\u2019s traditional functions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass, at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Having concluded that the direct testimony on credibility should not have been admitted, we turn now to the question of whether there was reversible error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mon-tanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 504-505 (1991). Part of that determination turns on what the prosecutor argued to the jury. We reprint in the margin a portion of the closing argument in which she urges the jury to consider whether the defendant\u2019s wife had a motive to lie. The argument pushed nearly all of the \u201chot-button\u201d issues and matched the inadmissible expert testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing statements regarding Dr. Gelinas\u2019s testimony compounded the problem. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks suggested to the jury that the defendant sexually abused his children simply because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>fit the mold, e.g., that he was married to a retarded woman, placing him in the position of being the more responsible, more powerful parent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass. 719, 725, 726 n.6 (1991) (admission in evidence of child battering profile is reversible error since a reasonable jury could have inferred that the prosecutor was implying that the defendant fit the \u201cchild battering profile,\u201d and, as a result was responsible for the child\u2019s fatal injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">To make matters worse, in another part of her argument the prosecutor emphasized that neither Dr. Gelinas nor the counsellor, Brown, had a motive to lie. There was no suggestion by the prosecutor that the witnesses\u2019 opinion of the credibility of the complainants would ordinarily be inadmissible, and the judge\u2019s charge merely repeated \u201cboilerplate\u201d instructions concerning credibility and the nature of expert testimony. Without more, there was a substantial likelihood that the jury would consider the sexual profile and opinion testimony as supportive of the accuracy, reliability, and truthfulness of the children\u2019s testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 150-151.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Guilt or innocence on these charges ultimately turned on the question of the children\u2019s credibility; evidence of sexual abuse was not overwhelming, and physical evidence of abuse was notably minimal. It cannot be said that the jury would have convicted even in the absence of the error in admitting the profile testimony and testimony linking characteristics of the child complainants to characteristics of sexually abused children. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, supra </em>at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\"><em>Other issues. </em>The other points raised by the defendant are either without merit or are unlikely to arise at any retrial. With regard to the defendant\u2019s argument regarding the denial of his motion for a court-ordered polygraph test, we note that the Supreme Judicial Court has given no indication that it intends to abandon the formulation in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, 293 </em>F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), in the polygraph contest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>406 Mass. 201, 205 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABq\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-14\">We use pseudonyms, as is our custom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, the mother was under indictment for rape of her children. She testified at her husband\u2019s trial as a witness for the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Several scholarly studies of incest families and sexually abused children caution that there are no \u201ctypical\u201d traits or common characteristics that portray child sexual abuse. The literature casts considerable doubt on whether psychological expert testimony should be used to usurp the jury\u2019s role in deciding guilt or innocence. See Friedrich, Child Abuse &amp; Sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Abuse, in The MMPI [Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]: Use With Specific Populations, at 246-256 (Greene ed. 1988) (\u201cA common misconception about sex offenders against children is there exists a \u2018sex offender profile,\u2019 and the degree to which an individual \u2018fits\u2019 that profile relates to the degree of certainty a clinician has regarding likelihood of offense); Scott &amp; Stone, MMPI Profile Constellations in Incest Families, 54 J. Counseling &amp; Clinical Psychology 364 (1986) (\u201cMost of the studies of incest families that appear in the literature have theorized personality and family dynamics on the basis of clinical observation as opposed to empirical or psychometric investigation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-9\">During the hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to allow Dr. Gelinas to testify on child abuse accommodation syndrome and delayed disclosure, the trial judge limited the scope of such testimony to the \u201carea of descriptions of this syndrome, to offer some explanations as to why children would delay reporting.\u201d The prosecutor assured the court that the testimony would be so limited. The trial judge assumed that the proffered profile would be focused on the victim and family traits in general, and not on the family traits of the accused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The defendant\u2019s wife has limited intellectual capacity and was allowed to testify only after the trial judge made a preliminary determination of competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Brown was not qualified by the judge to give an expert opinion, nor was she presented to the jury as an expert, and therefore any limiting instruction to the jury regarding evaluation of expert testimony would not have been considered in their assessment of Brown\u2019s opinion testimony. That testimony based on literature and comparative observations of other abused children went beyond the range of testimony permissible by laypersons. Still, she was mistakenly permitted to offer a lay opinion on the subject based on her professional experiences dealing with Ashley. Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>there was danger of prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Wolcott, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 207 (1990). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass, at 186.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The prosecutor asked, \u201cDid you ever see her stare?\u201d Brown testified affirmatively, \u201cmostly when we were in a small group situation with three girls her age.

Did that help you to understand it? If that alone wasn\u2019t enough, consider that in conjunction with Denise Gelinas\u2019s testimony that in incest cases there is always, often a weaker parent and powerful parent.
