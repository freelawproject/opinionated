The father is incarcerated after pleading guilty to second degree murder. The children\u2019s paternal grandparents were, at first, appointed coguardians with the maternal grandmother, and they were to share physical custody of the children with her, but they were removed as coguardians after a judge found them both unsuitable to act in that capacity. They were, however, given extensive visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">The maternal grandmother appeals from that part of a judgment granting the paternal grandparents visitation rights with their three grandchildren. Those rights, we note, exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the rights granted to the paternal grandparents under the original guardianship decree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge did not give any reason or make written findings of fact as to why the expansive visitation she ordered is in the children\u2019s best interests. Therefore, we vacate that portion of the judgment that granted visitation rights to the paternal grandparents and remand the matter for further proceedings on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>On April 19, 1991, when the three children (all boys) were ages seven, three, and one, their father murdered their mother. As noted, the father pleaded guilty to second degree murder and is presently incarcerated. Upon learning of their daughter-in-law\u2019s murder, the paternal grandparents picked up the three children, drove them to a park, and told them that their mother was dead and had gone to heaven.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Three days after the murder, the maternal grandmother was granted temporary guardianship of the three children. Later the same day, the paternal grandparents filed a petition, also asking for temporary guardianship of the three children. On October 28, 1991, the paternal grandparents and the maternal grandmother agreed to act as coguardians, and a judgment incorporating the parties\u2019 stipulations \u2014 including one for shared physical custody of the children according to an agreed-upon schedule, see note 2, <em>supra </em>\u2014 was entered by the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In May, 1992, the maternal grandmother filed a complaint for modification of the guardianship judgment. She requested an order prohibiting further contact between the children and their father, which she alleged had previously occurred without her knowledge while the children were under the paternal grandparents\u2019 care. She later amended her complaint to ask for sole guardianship of the children as well. The paternal grandparents filed a cross petition seeking to remove the maternal grandmother as coguardian and to restrict her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>visits with the children. In addition, the father filed a motion to intervene, and the children\u2019s paternal great aunt filed a separate petition for sole guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On June 9, 1992, a Probate Court judge issued temporary orders prohibiting further telephone or face-to-face contact between the three children and their father without order of the court and further instructing that a \u201cstructured visitation plan\u201d with the father was to be developed under the guidance of a designated mental health professional. Five months later, the maternal grandmother filed a complaint for contempt, alleging that, contrary to the judge\u2019s temporary order, the paternal grandparents were continuing to allow unsupervised contacts between the children and their father. Subsequently, the judge appointed a guardian ad litem for the children, who prepared a report on the situation. All matters (including the maternal grandmother\u2019s original complaint for modification, her complaint for contempt, the paternal grandparents\u2019 cross petition, the father\u2019s motion to intervene in the proceedings, and the children\u2019s paternal great aunt\u2019s separate petition for sole guardianship) were consolidated for trial. The trial consumed five days of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">After the trial, a judgment captioned \u201cRemoval of Fiduciary and Appointment of Successor Decree\u201d was entered removing the paternal grandparents as coguardians of the children and appointing in their place the maternal grandmother\u2019s daughter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The judgment also included the orders here under appeal establishing the paternal grandparents\u2019 visitation rights with the children. Those orders included the visitation rights contained in the original decree, plus additional visitation rights for every other Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Thanksgiving school vacation, Christmas school vacation, February school vacation, April school vacation, and for every summer school vacation. Finally, the decree ordered visitation between the children and their father once every six months \u201cin the presence of a mental health professional.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">One month after entry of the judgment, on July 8, 1994, the judge issued a memorandum containing extensive findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of fact and rulings of law. The judge\u2019s findings focus in large part upon the paternal grandparents\u2019 and the maternal grandmother\u2019s conduct as coguardians and not at all upon the subject of visitation with the paternal grandparents or whether such visitation would be in the children\u2019s best interests. The judge found that the maternal grandmother and the paternal grandparents had not been able to communicate effectively with each other concerning the children, nor had they acted in concert to further the children\u2019s best interests. More strikingly, the judge found that the paternal grandparents had acted \u201cunilaterally [i.e., without seeking the advice of the maternal grandmother, the therapists who were counseling the children, or the court] against the best interests of the [children].\u201d Specifically, the judge found that the paternal grandmother had \u201cfacilitated\u201d telephone, mail, and face-to-face contacts at the prison between the children and their father without prior discussion or consultation with the maternal grandmother, who she knew would disapprove, or with either therapist then working with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The judge found the paternal grandfather unable or unwilling to control his wife\u2019s \u201cinexplicable behavior\u201d and, therefore, ruled that he, too, was unsuitable to act as a co-guardian. The paternal grandmother\u2019s actions, according to the judge, were done \u201cwith complete disregard to the [children\u2019s] emotional health\u201d and furthered her son\u2019s best interests at the expense of the children\u2019s. The judge also found as a fact that the paternal grandparents had violated the temporary order barring further contact with the father by allowing unmonitored telephone conversations to occur between him and one or more of the children while the children were visiting at the paternal grandparents\u2019 home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge ruled that the paternal grandparents had not come to terms with the circumstances of their daughter-in-law\u2019s death and had been less than truthful with the children about the matter, preferring to tell them that the father had killed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>children\u2019s mother by accident or that her death had been \u201ca mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">By contrast, the judge found that the maternal grandmother and her surviving daughter had \u201calways acted in the [children\u2019s] best interests.\u201d Despite the father\u2019s having killed the children\u2019s mother, both maternal relatives had been able to promote a relationship between the children and their paternal grandparents, and they had assured the judge that they would continue to do so and would also cooperate with any court-ordered visits with the father. The same cannot be said of the paternal grandparents, who stated in their petition seeking sole guardianship of the children that they would restrict the maternal relatives\u2019 visits with the children to occasional supervised contacts. The judge found that the paternal grandparents would withhold visits between the children and the maternal relatives for a period of three to six months if they were declared sole guardians, and also that they would attempt to keep the oldest child apart from his two younger brothers as much as possible. The judge concluded that the paternal grandparents \u201care unsuitable as coguardians\u201d and are \u201cincapable of acting in the best interests of the [children].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Visitation rights of the grandparents of minor children whose parent, or parents, are deceased (or divorced, married but living apart, or under an order for separate support) have been recognized in the Commonwealth since 1972, when G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, was enacted. See St. 1972, c. 631.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All fifty States have adopted similar provisions. See 3 McCahey, Kaufman, Kraut, Gaffner, Schwartz, &amp; Silverman, Child Custody &amp; Visitation Law and Practice \u00a7 16.12[3] (1996). As in Massachusetts, a substantial majority of States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>explicitly tie grandparents\u2019 rights to visitation to the best interests of the grandchildren. See, e.g., Cal. Family Code \u00a7\u00a7 3103, 3104 (West 1994); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 61.13(2)(c) (1995); Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 775, \u00a7 5/11-7.1 (1994); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 257.022 (1995); N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 458.17-d (1992); N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 72 (McKinney Supp. 1996); 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5311 (Purdon 1991); Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 767.245 (West 1993). See also Annotation, Grandparents\u2019 Visitation Rights, 90 A.L.R.3d 222, 232 (1979). In particular, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, states that \u201creasonable visitation rights\u201d may be granted \u201cupon a written finding that such visitation rights would be in the best interest of the . . . minor child\u201d \u2014 a finding conspicuously absent in the decree itself or in the accompanying findings of fact. The judge, in making her visitation orders, committed error because she did not comply with the statute\u2019s prerequisite for granting visitation rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201cIf the parents of an unmarried minor child are divorced, married but living apart, under a temporary order or judgment of separate support, or if either or both parents are deceased, . . . the grandparents of such minor child may be granted reasonable visitation rights to the minor child during his minority by the probate and family court department of the trial court <em>upon a written finding that such visitation rights would be in the best interest of the said minor child </em>...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In her visitation orders, the judge preserved and, indeed, expanded in the paternal grandparents\u2019 favor a shared physical custody arrangement of the children between both sets of grandparents, while placing exclusive legal control of the children with the maternal relatives. The expansion was made despite the judge\u2019s detailed findings that in critical respects the shared physical custody and guardianship arrangement had not worked out and that the two sides of the family had been unable to cooperate or work together effectively toward furthering the children\u2019s emotional welfare. Detailed findings that the expansive visitation ordered on behalf of the paternal grandparents would be in each child\u2019s best interests are particularly crucial here, given the judge\u2019s conclusions that, in their role as coguardians, the paternal grandparents had been \u201cincapable of acting in the best interests of the [children]\u201d and that they had also violated the court\u2019s earlier June 9, 1992, no-contact order with the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Finally, we point out that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, allows the judge, within her discretion, to grant grandparents <em>\u201creasonable </em>visitation rights\u201d (emphasis added) upon making the necessary best-interests findings. In keeping with the statute, therefore, specific findings should also be entered upon remand that any visitation ordered is \u201creasonable\u201d under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>unusual and unfortunate facts of this case. The judgment is vacated as it pertains to visitation rights between the paternal grandparents and the three children. In all other respects, the judgment is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-15\">The other guardian is the maternal grandmother\u2019s daughter, an aunt of the minor children, who resides with the maternal grandmother.
