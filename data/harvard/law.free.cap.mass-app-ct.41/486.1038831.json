The defendant father filed a motion to dismiss or to decline jurisdiction, in relevant part under \u00a7 <em>2(d) </em>of G. L. c. 209B, the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (MCCJA), on the basis of a pending custody action in Florida. A Probate Court judge denied the father\u2019s motion and entered a temporaiy order granting custody of the children to the mother and ordering that the children not be removed from Massachusetts. A single justice of this court granted the father\u2019s petition to file an interlocutory appeal from the order denying the motion to dismiss, and the father appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The parties\u2019 children were bom on October 26, 1985, and April 29, 1987, respectively. The family lived in Massachusetts until February 14, 1994, when they moved to Florida, where the children attended school.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 19, 1995, the mother and children returned to Massachusetts, where they remained until August 14, 1995, when they returned to Florida. On August 27, 1995, the father, a commercial fisherman, left on a fishing trip and, without his knowledge, the mother and children returned to Massachusetts, where they remain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The father continues to reside in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On January 4, 1996, the father filed a \u201cPetition for Dissolution of Marriage and Other Relief\u201d in the Circuit Court of the Twentieth Judicial Circuit, Collier County, Florida, requesting, inter alia, that the Florida court exercise jurisdiction over issues of child custody and support pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 61.1308(l)(a)(2) &amp; (l)(b), the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act enacted in Florida.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The mother filed the present Massachusetts complaint for custody and support on March 12, 1996, and the father moved to dismiss that complaint on March 26, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On April 25, a judge of the Florida court entered an order (1) determining that the court had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter under Florida law and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., 9 U.L.A. 233 (Master ed. 1988) (UCCJA)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) requesting that the Massachusetts court defer jurisdiction over the minor children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>their custody, and child support issues. The Florida judge also ruled that Florida is the home State of the children, that it is in the best interest of the children that they be returned to Florida forthwith and that they attend school in Florida. The Florida judge granted the mother visitation rights. The next day, in Massachusetts, after a hearing in which the Probate Court judge was presented with the Florida order determining jurisdiction, he denied the father\u2019s motion to dismiss the Massachusetts custody complaint and entered a temporary order granting custody to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On appeal, the father raises another challenge to the jurisdiction of the Probate Court. He asserts that the Probate Court actions violated the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 173 8A (1995) (PKPA), and argues that the disposition in this case is controlled by <em>Delk </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>421 Mass. 525, 529-534 (1995). We agree. It is not seriously disputed that the Massachusetts Probate Court had jurisdiction over the custody issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe jurisdictional inquiry, however, may not stop with an examination of our statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531. See <em>Custody of Brandon, </em>407 Mass. 1, 11 n.11, 13-15 (1990). Here, as in <em>Delk, </em>the Probate Court was the second court called upon to adjudicate a custody dispute, and thus it must satisfy the jurisdictional demands of the PKPA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Delk, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The Florida judge made a custody determination consistent with \u00a7 1738A(a) of the PKPA, and expressly requested that the Probate Court defer its exercise of jurisdiction. The Florida court has continuing jurisdiction if it satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of both the PKPA and its State law. Although the children no longer lived in Florida on April 25, 1996, the Florida court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>continued under \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(A) &amp; (E), (d) of the PKPA because the father remained in Florida. <em>Delk, </em>421 Mass, at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">On the matter of whether Florida fulfilled the conditions of its State law for purposes of determining whether it had jurisdiction, we defer to the determination of the Florida court. <em>Id. </em>at 533-536. The parties contest whether the children left Florida to reside in Massachusetts on June 19, 1995, as the mother asserts, or on August 27, 1995, as the father argues. Under Florida law, \u201chome State\u201d is defined as \u201cthe [Sjtate in which the child, immediately preceding the time involved, lived with his or her parents, [or] a parent ... for at least 6 consecutive months,\u201d with \u201c[p]eriods of temporary absence of any of the named persons . . . counted as part of the 6-month or other period.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 61.1306(5). Florida may exercise jurisdiction if it \u201c[h]ad been the child\u2019s home [S]tate within 6 months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from [Florida] because of his or her removal or retention by a person claiming custody . . ., and a parent . . . continues to live in [Florida].\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 61.1308(l)(a)(2), as amended by St. 1995, c. 95-147. The Florida judge found that Florida was the home State of the children, and that the Florida court had jurisdiction. Implicit in this is the Florida judge\u2019s acceptance of the father\u2019s version of the facts. We regard this finding as dispositive under Florida law. <em>Delk, </em>421 Mass, at 533-534.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The Probate Court may not exercise jurisdiction by virtue of \u00a7 1738A(g) of the PKPA which provides that \u201c[a] court of a State shall not exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for a custody determination commenced during the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another State where such court of that other State is exercising jurisdiction consistently with the provisions of this section to make a custody determination.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Delk </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The order dated April 26, 1996, denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or to decline jurisdiction is reversed.
