The building inspector of the town and the defendant board of appeals said no. On the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, a judge in the Superior Court, on cross motions for summary judgment, ordered the defendants to issue a building permit and annulled the decision of the board of appeals denying the plaintiff a permit. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">Many of the facts are not in dispute. In 1969, the plaintiff purchased a 5,023 square foot parcel of land containing a dwelling and a garage. These structures were lawfully built <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>before 1947 (that is, they conformed to the then applicable law) when the town of Auburn amended its zoning by-law to require in residential districts a minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet. Prior to the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the lot, its predecessor in title had requested a permit to raze the dwelling,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, shortly after buying the property, the plaintiff had the dwelling demolished. Twenty-one years later, it obtained a permit to demolish the garage, and that structure was razed in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">By 1993, the zoning by-law had been further amended, this time to require a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet. The plaintiff sought a building permit to erect a single-family house on its 5,023 square foot lot, a request the building inspector denied. Thereupon, the plaintiff appealed to the zoning board of appeals and also applied for a variance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting that the lot contained only fifty percent of the now required square footage, the board affirmed the decision of the building inspector, ruling that the buildings were \u201cabandoned\u201d no later than 1990, and, therefore, their \u201cgrandfathered\u201d nonconforming status ceased two years later in 1992. The board presumably relied on \u00a7 S.2.4.2 of the zoning by-law which is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The entire text of art. 8 of the by-law and the first four paragraphs of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, as in effect prior to St. 1994, c. 60, \u00a7 67, are reproduced in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The motion judge disagreed, ruling that \u00a7 8.1 of the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>by-law and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 4,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were the governing provisions and that they permit Dial Away to use the lot for a single-family residence despite its noncompliance with the current by-law, which requires an area of 10,000 square feet and 100 feet of frontage; the lot also is deficient in frontage, having 82.9 feet. In relevant part, \u00a7 8.1 of the by-law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">\u201c8.1 <em>Nonconforming Lots </em>- Any lot which complied with the minimum area, frontage, and lot width requirements, if any, in effect at the time the boundaries of the lot were defined by recorded deed or plan may be built upon or used for single-family residential use, notwithstanding the adoption of new or increased lot area, frontage or lot width requirements, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">8.1.2. The lot had at least 5,000 square feet of area and 50 feet of frontage at the time the boundaries of the lot were defined . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Ruling that Dial A way\u2019s proposal for the single-family dwelling submitted to the building inspector and the board conformed to the conditions of \u00a7\u00a7 8.1.1, 8.1.2, and 8.1.3, the judge held that, because the lot complied with the zoning requirements in 1944, when the property was deeded to the previous owners, \u00a7 8.1 \u201cpermits Dial Away to use the lot for a single-family residence despite current zoning by-laws <em>99</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">1. <em>Applicability of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 1, rather than par. 4; inapplicability of \u00a7 8.1 of the by-law. </em>An analysis of art. 8 of the zoning by-law and of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, leads us to conclude that the judge was wrong in ruling that \u00a7 8.1 of the by-law and \u00a7 6, par. 4, of G. L. c. 40A are the applicable provisions, and that the board is correct that c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 1, is the controlling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 4, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u201cAny increase in area, frontage, width, yard, or depth requirements of a zoning ordinance or by-law shall not apply to a lot for single and two-family residential use which at the time of recording or endorsement, whichever occurs sooner was not held in common ownership with any adjoining land, conformed to then existing requirements and had less than the proposed requirement but at least five thousand square feet , of area and fifty feet of frontage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Orleans, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 15 (1987), this court was also faced with the question whether the case was governed by the first or by the fourth paragraph of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. In holding that the first paragraph and not the fourth governed the construction of an addition to the nonconforming residence belonging to the plaintiff in that case, we indicated that par. 4 applies only to vacant land, pointing out that its \u201cimmediate statutory ancestor,\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5A, as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3 (a provision which did not differ materially from par. 4), \u201capplied to original construction on vacant lots but not to alterations of existing structures which had become nonconforming, such as the one involved in this [Willard\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. Similarly, here, we consider that par. 4 of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, while applying to some construction on vacant lots, does not apply to \u201creconstruction\u201d of a single or two-family residential structure. Such reconstruction, as was the alteration to a single or two-family structure in <em>Willard, </em>is explicitly governed by the second \u201cexcept\u201d clause of par. 1 of \u00a7 6. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The first paragraph of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, is set forth in the margin, and the second \u201cexcept\u201d clause is italicized.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Paragraph 1, but not par. 4, addresses reconstruction. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Planning Bd. of Reading </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Reading, </em>333 Mass. 657, 661 (1956)(demolition of existing buildings and erection of a new building for the same nonconforming use not permitted where by-law contained words \u201calteration\u201d and \u201cextension\u201d but not \u201creconstruction\u201d). Cf. <em>Angus </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 473 (1977)(stress on word \u201crebuilt\u201d in one part of by-law contrasted with word \u201cenlarged\u201d to preclude board of appeals under latter term to grant a permit for the voluntary razing of existing buildings and the construction of entirely new nonconforming buildings in their place).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">An analysis of the Auburn by-law leads to the conclusion that \u00a7 8.1 also is not applicable here. Article 8 is the parallel to c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and is divided into three parts. Section 8.1, discussed earlier, relates to nonconforming <em>lots </em>and is the analog to par. 4 of \u00a7 6, c. 40A. Section 8.2 concerns nonconforming <em>uses, </em>and provides that such uses cannot be resumed if discontinued for a period of two years or more, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>and \u00a7 8.3 treats nonconforming <em>structures. </em>Section 8.3.1 states that the requirements of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, shall apply. Section 8.3.2 relates to changing a nonconforming structure and allows such structures to be altered, recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>structed, extended, or . structurally changed, provided that such alteration, reconstruction, extension, or structural change conforms to all the dimensional requirements of the by-law. Section 8.3.3 precludes rebuilding or reconstruction without a special permit if a nonconforming structure is damaged to an extent greater than fifty percent of its fair market value before it was damaged, unless reconstruction is completed within two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Sections 8.2 and 8.3 evidence a legislative disfavor of non-conformities and an intent to eliminate them where possible. In the context of these provisions, it would be anomalous indeed to construe \u00a7 8.1 to allow in perpetuity the rebuilding and demolition of dwellings on the plaintiffs undersized lot because of the happenstance that in 1944 a house was built that conformed to the then existing by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u201cConsidering the eventual elimination of nonconforming uses as an objective underlying zoning regulations,\u201d <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Chilmark, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 551 (1990)(discussing c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 4), citing <em>Strazzulla </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Wellesley, </em>357 Mass. 694, 697 (1970), cert, denied, 400 U.S. 1004 (1971), and, in particular, that of Auburn\u2019s, we interpret \u00a7 8.1 to apply only to original construction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">2. <em>Application of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 1, to reconstruction of single and two-family residences. </em>Having decided that neither par. 4 of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, nor \u00a7 8.1 of the Auburn bylaw supports the construction of a house in replacement for one tom down, we turn to the governing provision, par. 1 of \u00a7 6 of c. 40A, see note 5 <em>supra. </em>That paragraph, in the second <em>except </em>clause, gives special status to nonconforming single and two-family residences and allows them to be rebuilt despite changes in the zoning by-laws. <em>Goldhirsh </em>v. <em>McNear, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 460 (1992). For these buildings, \u201calteration, reconstmction, extension or stmctural change\u201d is permitted despite a change in the zoning by-law if such activity \u201cdoes not increase the nonconforming nature of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>structure.\u201d If not for this provision, \u00a7 8.3.3 of the by-law would probably apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">3. <em>Abandonment. </em>The board, as indicated earlier, determined that the plaintiff\u2019s nonconformity had been abandoned. Although c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and art. 8 of the by-law to some degree protect nonconformities, both provide that nonconformities may be deemed abandoned in certain situations. Thus, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 3, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cA zoning ordinance or by-law may define and regulate nonconforming uses and structures abandoned or not used for a period of two years or more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Nothing in par. 3 suggests that it does not apply to single and two-family residences, and we assume it is applicable to such dwellings. As we have seen, \u00a7 8.2.4.2, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>provides for abandonment of discontinued uses, and \u00a7 8.3 limits the rebuilding of nonconforming structures to two years without a special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Neither \u00a7 6, par. 3, of c. 40A nor \u00a7 8.2 of the by-law specifically refers to abandonment of the right to rebuild on a nonconforming lot. Nevertheless, it is apparent that, when a building is totally demolished, the use to which it was put is necessarily discontinued. Although construction of \u00a7 8.2.4.2 to apply here would promote the policy of the by-law as a whole, our cases seem to distinguish between nonconforming uses and structures.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Orleans, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 20; <em>Goldhirsh </em>v. <em>McNear, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 456; <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Assoc., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 658 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>421 Mass 106 (1995). Moreover, since there is a distinction in art. 8 among nonconforming lots, uses, and structures, we are not persuaded that the two-year abandonment of use provision may be directly applied to the failure to rebuild on an undersized lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Abandonment, however, may be found apart from ordinance. An affidavit of the president of Dial Away states that the dwelling had been destroyed by accident when a truck ran into it and that the building was removed as it \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>dangerous, uninhabitable and an eye sore.\u201d He also stated that he always intended to construct a single-family residence. The judge noted that \u201cthere is nothing in the record to contradict the assertions of Dial A way\u2019s sole owner and president . . . that he had always intended to build another single-family residence on the lot but that he decided to forestall construction until sewers were installed.\u201d The president\u2019s affidavit, however, acknowledged that sewers were constructed in the early 1980s, thus weakening his avowals.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u201cTo constitute an abandonment [other than where defined by ordinance], the discontinuance of a nonconforming use [structure or lot] must result from \u2018the concurrence of two factors, (1) the intent to abandon and (2) voluntary conduct, whether affirmative or negative, which carries the implication of abandonment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Derby Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>407 Mass. 703, 708 (1990). The voluntary demolition of a building constitutes abandonment, <em>Berliner </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>363 Mass. 767, 772 (1973), but \u201c[m]ere nonuse or sale of property does not, by itself, constitute an abandonment.\u201d <em>Derby, supra </em>at 709. An involuntary demolition may permit the owner to rebuild under certain circumstances. See <em>Berliner, supra </em>at 772 &amp; n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The record before us does not sufficiently explain the nature of the 1969 demolition to enable us to determine whether the plaintiff was entitled to rebuild within a reasonable time. <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, we consider this a case where the lapse of time following the demolition \u2014 twenty-three years \u2014 is so significant that abandonment exists as matter of law. Here, the \u201cevidence of things done or not done . . . carries the implication of abandonment. . . [and] [s]upports a finding of intent, whatever the avowed state of mind of the owner. . . .\u201d <em>Dobbs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Northampton, </em>339 Mass. 684, 686-687 (1959). See <em>Mioduszewski </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>337 Mass. 140, 145 (1958) (four-year cessation \u201cmay well have fatally interrupted\u201d nonconforming use).

L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, in relevant part provides: \u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, a zoning ordinance or by-law shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing on such ordinance or by-law required by section five, but shall apply to any change or substantial extension of such use, to a building or special permit issued after the first notice of said public hearing, to any <em>reconstruction, </em>extension or structural change of such structure and to any alteration of a structure begun after the first notice of said public hearing to provide for its use for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>extent <em>except where alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change to a single or two-family residential structure does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. . </em>.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">We also find some support for this construction in 1972 House Doc. No. 5009, Report of the Department of Community Affairs Relative to Proposed Changes and Additions to the Zoning Enabling Act, at 36-37, where \u00a7 5A is referred to as applying to \u201cundeveloped lots\u201d that is \u201cto lots on which construction has not yet commenced and/or no building permit has been issued at the time the ordinance or by-law is amended in such a way to create the potential of illegality through the imposition of more restrictive dimensional (and in some cases \u2018use\u2019) regulations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Our interpretation of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, par. 4, does not mean that the paragraph applies only to original construction. In <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 764 (1985), the court held that \u201ccompliance of a lot with the common ownership requirement [in \u00a7 6, par. 4] is determined by looking at the most recent instrument of record prior to the effective date of the zoning change from which the exemption is sought.\u201d If a buyer bought vacant land (even if a building thereon had been previously demolished) and the by-law at the time of purchase permitted building on that lot, it would seem that the lot would have protection from a subsequent zoning change. The plaintiff, however, is not protected by this interpretation of par. 4 because, at the time of its purchase, the minimum lot size requirement was 7,500 feet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 8.1 to apply only to original construction differs from our construction of par. 4, of \u00a7 6 of c. 40A, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>because the language of the by-law does not permit the construction put on the timing of the \u201crecording\u201d by <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass, at 764. Paragraph 4, of course, would control. <em>Planning Bd. of Reading </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Reading, </em>333 Mass, at 660.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The term \u201cnonconforming use\u201d is sometimes used genetically to cover all nonconformities.
