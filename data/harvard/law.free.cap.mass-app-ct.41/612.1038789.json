L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), from a decision of the reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) affirming an award of total and partial disability compensation to Morris S. Phillips. Phillips cross-appeals. Arrow contends on appeal that the board erred by refusing to consider Arrow\u2019s defenses under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E, which bars workers\u2019 compensation for retirees in some situations, and under \u00a7 41, the statute of limitations. Arrow raised these defenses for the first time on its appeal to the board from a decision of an administrative judge of the department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his cross-appeal, Phillips contends that it was error for the board to reverse the administrative judge\u2019s application of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 A, which had allowed Phillips the maximum benefit rate because Arrow had refused to compensate Phillips prior to the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><em>Background. </em>Phillips filed his claim for benefits against Syl-vania Electric Products (Sylvania) and Arrow with the department on July 1, 1988, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10. Phillips asserts that he was rendered totally disabled from August 1, 1984, and thereafter due to a condition of berylliosis caused by work conditions during his 1941-1942 employment at Syl-vania. On November 8, 1988, the judge held a conference between the parties pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, and denied Phillips\u2019s claim for compensation by an order filed December 5, 1988. Phillips appealed from the denial pursuant to \u00a7 10A(3) and a hearing was held pursuant to \u00a7 11 on January 12, 1989, before the same judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">At the January 12, 1989, hearing, Phillips contended that his claim was compensable under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 30, 13,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 35C and 51 A. Arrow raised the following issues: it claimed exemption from liability for any nonberylliosis-related problems; it questioned whether Phillips was actually disabled, and if so, to what extent; it asserted that the inhalation of beryllium particles was not causally related to Phillips\u2019s disability; and it claimed that Phillips was not entitled to benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 36,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 13 and 30. The judge received certain of Phillips\u2019s medical records and personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>papers in evidence and heard Phillips\u2019s testimony on direct and cross-examination. The judge closed the record but allowed the parties until March 16, 1989, to file depositions of the physician experts and additional medical records. The judge filed her decision almost two years later, on January 25, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The relevant facts as found by the administrative judge and later adopted by the board are as follows. At the time of the hearing before the judge, Phillips was 67 years old. Phillips had worked for Sylvania as a janitor from 1941 to 1942, where his duties included sweeping a room free of broken fluorescent bulbs that had been coated with beryllium liquid. This room also contained beryllium powder, which covered the floor, permeated the clothes of employees and saturated the air. On one occasion, Phillips cut his arm on a broken beryllium light bulb, requiting four stitches. The parties stipulated that Phillips was exposed to free beryllium oxide during his employment at Sylvania. Phillips was drafted into the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and served until 1946. Phillips earned a law degree at Boston University, and after a brief stint in private practice became a conveyancer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1952. He retired from the Corps\u2019s real estate division on January 31, 1984. Phillips now receives both monthly retirement benefits and monthly social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Phillips testified that his health was not a factor in deciding to retire. He asserted that he planned to return to work in a private law partnership with a colleague. Phillips admitted, however, that no plans were in writing and that the colleague had only agreed to give Phillips some work and eventually to form a partnership. While the judge found that Phillips actually had no firm plans to resume his legal career, she also found that he would not have been able to work as an attorney due to his debilitating medical problems which began in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In 1973, Dr. Walter Donahue, Sylvania\u2019s medical director, diagnosed Phillips as having a beryllium-related lung disease. Other evidence of berylliosis arose in medical examinations throughout the next decade. Dr. Lawrence Baker (on behalf of Phillips) and Dr. Alan Balsam (on behalf of Arrow) examined Phillips in 1989. The judge adopted the opinions of Drs. Baker and Balsam that, as a result of beryllium exposure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Phillips suffers from pulmonary berylliosis, which gave rise to a condition of hypercalcemia and a history of recurring calcium stones in Phillips\u2019s kidneys and bladder. The judge found that Phillips became totally disabled from September 2, 1984, until June 8, 1988, as a result of hydrocortisone treatments, which were administered to combat the hypercalce-mia. The treatments caused periods of excessive weight gain, nervousness and an inability to concentrate. The judge found that Phillips was partially disabled after June 8, 1988, and continuing thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The judge ordered in relevant part that Arrow pay Phillips weekly temporary total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, for the period of September 2, 1984, to June 8, 1988, and temporary partial disability benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, from June 9, 1988, to date and continuing. Arrow appealed to the board on February 8, 1991, and filed its brief on July 19, 1991, contending, inter alia, that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 A, was inapplicable and asserting that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 35E and 41, barred Phillips\u2019s claim. Three years later, on August 31, 1994, the board affirmed the judge\u2019s decision to order compensation. However, the board did agree with Arrow that only \u00a7 35C, and not \u00a7 51 A, could be applied to Phillips\u2019s \u00a7 35 benefits; this resulted in the reduction of his \u00a7 35 compensation rate. The board declined to pass on Arrow\u2019s other arguments under \u00a7\u00a7 35E and 41 as they had not been raised before the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>Both parties contend that the board, in different respects, committed errors of law, but neither disputes the board\u2019s findings of fact. Where the board has committed an error of law, we may, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), modify its decision. <em>Lettich\u2019s Case, </em>403 Mass. 389, 395 (1988). <em>Larocque\u2019s </em>Case, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 658 (1991). We are to \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (as appearing in St. 1976, c. 411, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\"><em>Arrow\u2019s appeal. </em>The board declined to address Arrow\u2019s arguments that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 35E<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 41,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> barred Phillips\u2019s claim because Arrow failed to raise these issues at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>hearing before the judge. Arrow argues that the board\u2019s refusal to consider issues not raised at the hearing constitutes an error of law. Section 35E bars persons who receive social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>security or a pension from collecting workers\u2019 compensation benefits for partial, temporary disabilities unless the person can show that \u201cbut for\u201d the injury, he would have returned to work. Arrow argues that \u00a7 35E bars Phillips\u2019s claim because Phillips receives social security benefits and a pension and that, since the judge found that Phillips had no firm plans to return to work, Phillips had not satisfied the statutory requirement of showing that \u201cbut for\u201d the injury, he would have returned to work. Arrow also argues on appeal that Phillips failed to file his claim within six months of his injury, as required by \u00a7 41, and therefore did not satisfy the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Title 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11(3) (1988), of which we take judicial notice, see <em>Bagge\u2019s Case, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 839, 840 (1977),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cBefore the taking of testimony in a hearing before an administrative judge, the insurer shall state clearly the grounds on which the insurer . . . has declined to pay compensation . . . provided that such statements are based on grounds and factual basis reported by the insurer or based on newly discovered evidence within the provisions of [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]. On all other issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the employee\u2019s rights under G. L. c. 152 shall be deemed to have been established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">By virtue of this regulation, Phillips\u2019s rights under G. L. c. 152, were deemed established before the judge notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 35E. We note that Arrow neither sought to amend its defenses nor requested the board to order a rehearing based on newly discovered evidence. While the board may, if requested, order a rehearing on the grounds of newly discovered evidence, a rehearing is warranted only if such evidence is likely to have a material effect upon the result and if such evidence could not reasonably have been discovered prior to the hearing by the exercise of proper diligence. See <em>Vouniseas\u2019s Case, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 140 (1975). Under the circumstances here, a rehearing was not required, even if one had been requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In a workers\u2019 compensation case, the claimant shoulders the burden of proof as to all elements of the claim: employment within the coverage of the act, injury arising out of and in the course of employment, causal relation between injury and disability, extent of disability, and a timely claim. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 502 (2d ed. 1981). The Legislature has, however, placed the burden on insurers to inform claimants of the issues it will contest. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7. Section 7 goes so far as to provide, \u201cAny grounds and basis for noncompensability specified by the insurer shall be the sole basis of the insurer\u2019s defense on the issue of compensability in any subsequent proceeding, unless based upon newly discovered evidence.\u201d Arrow\u2019s burden was to raise the grounds on which it disclaimed liability for Phillips\u2019s injuries. The board committed no error of law in preventing Arrow from introducing issues which had not been raised before the judge and which were not based on newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">It is clear that the board, in its discretion, may pass on issues not previously argued before an administrative judge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>Casey\u2019s Case, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 860 (1978). <em>Maguire\u2019s Case, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 338-339 n.l (1983). See <em>Georgi-las\u2019s Case, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 872, 872-873 (1980). Nonetheless, nothing in these cases, or in any others of which we are aware, requires the board to decide issues not previously raised before the judge. The board neither abused its discretion nor erred as a matter of law in refusing to address issues not previously raised.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If supported by the evidence and not tainted by error of law, as here, a board\u2019s decision is final. <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 680 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><em>Phillips\u2019s appeal. </em>The board found that \u00a7 51A did not apply to Phillips\u2019s case and consequently reduced his benefits as calculated by the judge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 51A allows workers\u2019 compensation benefits to be calculated as of the date of the final decision in a contested case, where the insurer, prior to the date of decision, denied the claimant compensation. Phillips argues that, since Arrow refused to pay throughout the proceedings, his compensation rate should be as calculated by the judge pursuant to \u00a7 51 A. Section 51 A, however, was added by St. 1969, c. 833, \u00a7 1, and, by \u00a7 2, made applicable only to injuries occurring on or after November 25, 1969. Phillips\u2019s disability stems from his gradual exposure to beryl-hum oxide in 1941-1942. The date of injury in such a case is the date of last exposure to the foreign matter, not the date of disability. See <em>Squillante\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass, at 397. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>remains true even where the disability arises long after employment has ceased. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Phillips argues that \u00a7 35C permits \u00a7 51A to be applied to his case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 35C allows a claimant\u2019s compensation rate to be calculated as of the date of disability rather than as of the date of injury, where a period of five years or more has elapsed between the injury and the onset of disability. Section 35C applies to Phillips because his injury occurred in 1942, but his disability did not arise until 42 years later. Phillips argues that, insofar as \u00a7 35C applies to ah cases regardless of the date of injury,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it authorizes \u00a7 51A to be applied in cases where \u00a7 35C applies. The language used by the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 51 A, however, is explicit; it applies only to injuries occurring after November 25, 1969. Phillips\u2019s injuries occurred in 1942. Further, \u00a7 35C states that it may apply to benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 31, 34, 34A, 34B, 35 and 35F, but makes no mention of \u00a7 51 A. Because \u00a7 51A has no application to Phillips, the board did not err in reducing Phillips\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-14\"> Arrow is the insurer for Phillips\u2019s then employer, Sylvania Electric Products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Arrow also contends that Phillips\u2019s claim is barred by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 49, as in effect at the time of Phillips\u2019s injury, which concerned itself with prejudice to an employer by the untimely filing of an employee\u2019s claim. Because Arrow raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we do not consider it. <em>Casey\u2019s Case, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 860 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 34, provides for compensation for injuries resulting in a temporary, total incapacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Sections 13 and 30 deal with the rate of payment and compensation for medical expenses related to the contested injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Section 36 authorizes compensation for specific permanent injuries. Phillips never claimed compensation under \u00a7 36, and the judge did not order compensation under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">At the time that Arrow appealed to the board on February 8, 1991, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E (added by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 45), read in relevant part, \u201cAny person receiving old age benefits pursuant to federal social security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>law or receiving pension benefits paid in part or entirely by an employer shall not be entitled to benefits under section thirty-five, unless such employee can establish that but for the injury, such employee would have remained active in the labor market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Although \u00a7 35E did not exist at the time of Phillips\u2019s injury, the section applies to his case. Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A, a statute which the Legislature did not in any way indicate should be deemed substantive will instead be considered procedural and will apply retroactively. Section 2A (added by St. 1946, c. 386, \u00a7 3) instructs,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cEvery act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which increases the amount or amounts of compensation payable to an injured employee or his dependents shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act, unless otherwise expressly provided. Every act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which is not deemed to be substantive in character within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to be procedural or remedial only, in character, and shall have application to personal injuries irrespective of the date of their occurrence, unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Section 2A was amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 16.
