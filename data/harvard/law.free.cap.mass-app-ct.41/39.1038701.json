L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, for the period of March 6, 1990, \u201cto date and continuing,\u201d and for the payment of medical expenses under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30. National Union Fire Insurance Company (National Union), the workers\u2019 compensation insurer for LFE Corporation, denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">On April 22, 1991, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, a conference was held on the claim. The claim was denied and Gonzalez filed an appeal for a de novo hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 10A(3) and 11. After that hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>administrative judge made the following findings. Gonzalez sustained an industrial injury to his left shoulder on or about March 5, 1990. However, because Gonzalez failed to offer any evidence from treating physicians, the judge found that Gonzalez did not demonstrate that his period of absence from work in March, 1990, was related to the industrial injury. Further, the judge found that the continuing period of absence following May 25, 1990 (the last day he worked for LFE Corporation), was related to his termination from employment because of excessive absenteeism and not related to the injury. The judge also ruled that Gonzalez\u2019s claim was defective because (1) it covered the period between March 14 and May 25, when Gonzalez was actually working and receiving wages and (2) it covered a further period when Gonzalez was collecting unemployment compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Although the judge found that Gonzalez had suffered an industrial injury, he did not order compensation because Gonzalez did not lose any benefits as a result of the accident. In addition, the judge did not order the payment of medical expenses under \u00a7 13 and \u00a7 30 because Gonzalez did not offer any unpaid medical bills. The judge also did not order the payment of attorney fees. The judge did, however, order that Gonzalez\u2019s rights under \u00a7\u00a7 13, 30, and 36 be reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Gonzalez appealed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to the Reviewing Board (board) on the sole ground that he was entitled to the payment of his attorney\u2019s fees. Applying the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions then in effect, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(3), and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1988), the board ruled that Gonzalez was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. As to such fees, generally, see <em>Alliy </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 688 (1996). The board\u2019s decision was based on the ground that Gonzalez did not prevail at the hearing because he did not receive an award of benefits nor was a discontinuance of benefits prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">On appeal, Gonzalez claims that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because the judge\u2019s finding that he sustained an industrial injury means he prevailed at the hearing, regardless of whether or not benefits were ordered. National Union argues that Gonzalez did not prevail because no benefits were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">This case turns on an interpretation of the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>contained in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(3), and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of the hearing, \u00a7 13A(3) provided that \u201c[wjhenever an insurer files a complaint or contests a claim for benefits and then . . .(ii) the employee prevails at such hearing, the insurer shall pay an attorney\u2019s fee sufficient to defray the reasonable costs of counsel retained by the employee.\u201d 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) states, in pertinent part, \u201cIn any proceeding before the division of dispute resolution, the claimant shall be deemed to have prevailed, for purposes of M.G.L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(l)-(3), when compensation is ordered or is not discontinued at such proceeding . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u201cOrdinarily an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976). \u201cA court will overturn such an agency interpretation only if it is \u2018arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the plain terms of the rule itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 782 (1980), quoting from <em>Finkelstein, supra. </em>See also <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>364 Mass. 762, 764 (1974) (findings and decisions of the board \u201cmust be accepted as final unless wholly lacking evidential support or tainted by error of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The statutory language ties the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the concept of \u201cprevail.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The language of 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) establishes that, except when an insurer is ordered to pay benefits or an employee defeats the insurer\u2019s effort to discontinue benefits, statutory attorney\u2019s fees are not owed. Thus, Gonzalez did not prevail within the meaning of \u00a7 1.19(4) and G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Gonzalez asserts that his case is analogous to Federal civil rights claims. A plaintiff is a prevailing party for purposes of the Federal civil rights statute \u201cif they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 453 (1981), cert, denied, 456 U.S. 947 (1982), quoting from <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978). Gonzalez claims that he prevailed at the hearing because the administrative judge found that an industrial accident did occur and that his rights were reserved. Gonzalez contends that the finding of an industrial injury is the most significant aspect of the case and that this determines if the plaintiff prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the most significant aspect of a claim is the payment of compensation. We decline to interpret the statute as providing attorney\u2019s fees in cases where no workers\u2019 compensation has been ordered at any stage of the statutory proceedings. Compare <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, ante </em>35, 37-38 (1996). To do so would be in contravention of the purpose of the entire workers\u2019 compensation scheme. \u201cThe purpose of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act is to replace <em>wages </em>lost by reason of an employee\u2019s inability to work because of an injury\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Chartier\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 9 n.4 (1984), quoting from <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 469 (1982). Here, Gonzalez continued to work (with any time missed after the accident not proven to be attributable to the injury), and he collected, at first, his normal wages, and after he was fired, he collected unemployment benefits. Because Gonzalez did not lose any wages as a result of his injury, there was nothing to compensate. The fact that the administrative judge found that the insurer <em>would have been liable </em>to Gonzalez if he had lost wages, does not mean that he prevailed. Therefore, the board\u2019s decision not to award Gonzalez any benefits means that Gonzalez did not prevail and is not entitled to any statutory attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\">A party may not receive disability payments and unemployment benefits at the same time.
