She received workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, from April 6, 1986, until April 6, 1991, as a result of her injuries. On March 31, 1995, the plaintiff filed this action in Superior Court seeking assault pay benefits under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 58, inserted by St. 1955, c. 602. Paragraph 4 of that section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">\u201can employee who, while in the performance of duty, receives bodily injuries resulting from acts of violence of patients or prisoners in his custody, and who as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of such injury would be entitled to benefits under said chapter one hundred and fifty-two, shall be paid the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which he would be entitled under said chapter one hundred and fifty-two and his regular salary. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The purpose of this statute is to compensate employees of the Commonwealth \u201cfor the added hazards to which . . . employees of a correctional or mental institution are exposed when their duties entail the care or custody of mental patien[t]s or prisoners.\u201d Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 at 72-73 (1988), quoting from Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 at 134 (1967). The statute does not contain a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), on the ground that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The plaintiff claims in her brief that the statute of limitations was tolled pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 50, which provides in paragraph 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u201cThe payment of compensation for any injury pursuant to this chapter or the filing of a claim for compensation as provided in this chapter shall toll the statute of limitations for any benefits due pursuant to this chapter for such injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">We reject that claim; the tolling provisions under \u00a7 41 apply only to claims for benefits under c. 152 and not to claims under c. 30. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the six-year statute of limitations for contract actions in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, is appropriate and since the plaintiffs action was not brought within six years of the injury, that statute bars this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">We agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiffs action is one under an employment contract. The statutory payments under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 58, as well as the wages of a public employee, are incidents of the plaintiffs employment. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249, 260 (1978) (payments to a police officer under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, payable \u201cat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>same times and in the same manner as . . . the regular compensation of such police officer\u201d are incidents of his employment). Thus, the appropriate statute of limitations is six years. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Med. Center, </em>417 Mass. 104, 106 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Section 58 requires that an injured employee be paid the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which he is entitled under c. 152 and his regular salary. This is a continuing contractual obligation. The plaintiff\u2019s injury, once proved, establishes her right to additional payments and therefore the only portion of the contract remaining executory is that imposed on the public employer. The payments are \u201cseparate and independent of each other and [are] not otherwise connected except as to [their statutory] origin.\u201d <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Shawprint, Inc., </em>328 Mass. 352, 357 (1952). As in that case, the contract here did not call for the acceleration of payments in the event of a default in the payment of installments. In these circumstances, we consider each alleged violation of the continuing weekly payment obligation a new claim for statute of limitations purposes, \u201cas with any contract calling for continuous separate performances over a period of time or for payment of money in separate installments.\u201d <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 427 (1991) (dealing with claim preclusion regarding continuing monthly payment obligation under divorce judgment). Cf. <em>Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 515 (1990) (six-month filing limitation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, not applicable where unlawful conduct continuing violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Since the payments here are a continuing obligation, the statute of limitations has not run as to the benefits, if any, which should have been paid to the plaintiff during the six years prior to the date of the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, that is, March 31, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
