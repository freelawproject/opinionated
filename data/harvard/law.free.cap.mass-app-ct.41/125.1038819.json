(Cherick), following a jury trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>plaintiffs claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with advantageous relationships, and violation of G. L. c. 93A. The complaint arises from Polar\u2019s termination of the plaintiffs exclusive distributorship agreement for the delivery of Polar beverages in certain areas of Massachusetts and Connecticut. On appeal, Polar contends that evidence was lacking to support the jury verdicts in Cherick\u2019s favor on the three claims, and that Polar\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were improperly denied. Polar also challenges the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury and the judge\u2019s computation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">A motion for a directed verdict or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be granted only when the evidence construed most favorably to the plaintiff is insufficient to support the verdict in its favor. <em>Alholm </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>371 Mass. 621, 627 (1976). The familiar standard is \u201cwhether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). A reasonable inference is one that is based on probabilities and not the result of \u201cmere speculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>Power Serv. Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>E. W. Wiggins Airways, Inc., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 122, 127 (1980). Consistent with this standard, we address the defendants\u2019 arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">1. <em>Breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. </em>The evidence revealed that Polar terminated its unwritten distributorship agreement with Cherick upon discovering that Cherick\u2019s president, Richard Corey, had written a letter to other Polar distributors urging them to attend a meeting to discuss the possibility of forming an association to negotiate with Polar. As its reason for termination, Polar initially cited Cherick\u2019s expired letter of credit, which had expired a year and one-half earlier. However, Polar\u2019s vice president admitted that the letter of credit issue was a pretext. The termination of Cherick\u2019s contract was to take effect upon only four days\u2019 notice, on the eve of the distributors\u2019 scheduled meeting. On appeal, Polar counters that it was within its rights to terminate the at-will distributorship agreement at any time and for any reason, and that Cherick failed to prove that it could have found another beverage supplier even with a longer notice period.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201c[T]he rule is clear in Massachusetts that every contract is subject to an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 473 (1991). Good faith and fair dealing in a distributorship agreement may be construed, by analogy, with reference to the Uniform Commercial Code. See <em>Zapatha </em>v. <em>Dairy Mart, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 284, 291 (1980). General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 2-309(3), provides that a contract which is terminable at the will of either party requires reasonable termination notice. See <em>Teitelbaum </em>v. <em>Hallmark Cards, Inc., 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 555, 560 (1988) (applying G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-309[3], to an at-will contract for the periodic supply of inventory to the plaintiffs\u2019 greeting card store). Whether the four-day termination notice constituted reasonable notice under commercial standards of good faith and fair dealing was a question properly put to the jury in this case. Compare <em>Teitelbaum </em>v. <em>Hallmark Cards, Inc., supra </em>at 560-561 (no jury question because the plaintiff procured another supplier before the notice period had expired).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The jury could have found that the abrupt termination of Cherick\u2019s distributorship agreement, coinciding as it did with the planned meeting of Polar distributors, was calculated to put Cherick out of business and thereby discourage other distributors from meeting. By the same token, the jury could have rejected Polar\u2019s assertion that the short notice period was for the purpose of protecting Polar\u2019s customers. The evidence indicated that the four-day notice left Cherick with no time to secure another supplier, make adjustments in its equipment and warehouse, and maintain its staff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, there was adequate support for the jury\u2019s finding that four days\u2019 notice was unreasonable and that it constituted a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">2. <em>Tortious interference with advantageous relationships. </em>Cherick claimed that Polar\u2019s abrupt termination of the distributorship agreement wrongfully interfered with Cherick\u2019s relationships with Polar customers. On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Polar asserts that there was no evidence that it interfered through improper motives or improper means, and that, in any event, it was free to terminate Cherick at any time and for any reason, rendering Polar\u2019s means and motive immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">On the contrary, the jury found that the unreasonably short termination notice was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As such, the means used to effect the termination, and concomitant interference, could be found to be wrongful, not because Polar was prohibited from terminating the contract, but because it did so on unreasonably short notice. Moreover, the jury could infer that Polar\u2019s opportunistic timing, with the termination to take effect on the eve of the distributors\u2019 meeting, was more than mere coincidence. Compare <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, </em>406 Mass. 811, 817 (1990)(insufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant\u2019s real motive was to hurt the plaintiff). These considerations do become relevant in an action for tortious interference. It was then up to the defendant to prove that its actions were justified. See <em>Draghetti </em>v. <em>Chmielewski, </em>416 Mass. 808, 818 (1994). Polar\u2019s attempts at justification fell flat.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">3. <em>General Laws c. 93A. </em>Polar makes much of the evidence suggesting that Corey was not deceived by Polar\u2019s fabricated excuse for terminating the contract, namely Cherick\u2019s expired letter of credit. However, deception is only one prong of the prohibited conduct under G. L. c. 93A. The same evidence that supported the jury\u2019s findings of a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and tortious interference with advantageous relationships also supported the jury\u2019s finding that Polar\u2019s conduct amounted to an unfair or deceptive act under G. L. c. 93A. See, e.g., <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass, at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">4. <em>Evidence of damages. </em>The jury awarded Cherick $25,000 in lost profits for Polar\u2019s wrongful interference with Cherick\u2019s advantageous relationships, and $50,000 to compensate for the loss of Cherick\u2019s business caused by Polar\u2019s breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Polar maintains that there was no evidence of lost profits, nor could profits be inferred, because Cherick had lost money each year from its inception in 1987. However, the jury heard expert testimony that profits in a closed corporation may be subsumed in salaries and benefits to its shareholder employees. In addition, Polar\u2019s own controller testified that Polar made a pretax profit of between $24,000 and $33,000 in 1993, from its distribution of Polar beverages in Cherick\u2019s former territory after the termination. Viewing the evidence in the plaintiffs favor, the jury\u2019s award of $25,000 in lost profits finds support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As to Cherick\u2019s value as a going concern, Corey testified that a beverage distributorship business would be valued at one dollar per number of cases delivered annually. Based on the uncontroverted testimony that Cherick\u2019s territory yielded an annual distribution of 228,000 cases at the time of termination, the jury\u2019s award of $50,000 for the loss of business value would appear reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">5. <em>Jury instructions. </em>On appeal, Polar advances numerous points of law that were omitted from the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. To begin with, we question whether Polar preserved its objections. We have previously cautioned that merely referencing or reciting proposed instructions, without informing the judge of the grounds for the objection, is unproductive in assisting the judge at trial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coast Vending Co., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 846, 850 (1981); <em>Mac-Cuish </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk A.G., 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 380, 397 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 1003 (1987). The record here demonstrates our point. Moreover, most of the defendant\u2019s proposed instructions do not accurately reflect Massachusetts law. In any event, the judge\u2019s charge addressed the essential elements of the claims and defenses in accordance with the applicable law, and we detect no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">6. <em>Computation of damages. </em>It was appropriate that the judge attempted to harmonize the jury verdicts which, though consistent with respect to the substantive findings, failed to conform to the judge\u2019s instructions on damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the verdicts should be construed in light of the instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>and the applicable law. See, e.g., <em>Charles River Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirksey, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 343-344 (1985). See also <em>Shamrock, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Co., 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 162, 169 (1994). The jury were repeatedly instructed that the damages under G. L. c. 93A would be the combined total of the damages awarded under the two common law counts. As there was no independent c. 93 A claim apart from that derived from the same conduct that formed the basis of the common law claims, the award of any additional amount constituted cumulative damages for the same wrong. In these circumstances, the judge should have entered judgment under c. 93A in the amount of $75,000. See <em>Charles River Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirksey, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 343-344 (the judge properly ordered the c. 93A damages subsumed in the contract damages, disregarding the jury\u2019s notation on the special verdict form that the G. L. c. 93A damages were not to be included in the award for contractual damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judge further compounded the error by using the sum of the awards on all three counts, which was $175,000, as the amount to be multiplied for the willful and knowing violation of G. L. c. 93A. The proper amount to be trebled would be the damages derived from all claims arising out of the same and underlying transaction, which, in this case, was $75,000, the total of the two common law counts. This amount should be trebled, pursuant to the judge\u2019s c. 93 A findings, which are not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The judgment is modified to reduce the amount of damages on the G. L. c. 93A claim to $225,000, plus interest. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of judgment as modified.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Corey testified that it took ninety days to line up another beverage supplier, by which time he had lost most of his employees. The business ultimately failed. We decline to read <em>Teitelbaum </em>v. <em>Hallmark Cards, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 561, as requiring the plaintiff in these circumstances to establish that it could have procured an equivalent exclusive distributorship contract had it been given a longer notice period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Polar made no attempt to persuade the jury that the four-day termination notice was justified because Polar\u2019s business was being threatened by the distributors\u2019 scheduled meeting. Rather, Polar\u2019s defense focused on Cherick\u2019s expired letter of credit and on the need to maintain continuity of service to its customers \u2014 a defense the jury obviously found unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Adding the verdicts on all three counts, the jury awarded a total of $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The plaintiff argues that Polar waived its objection to the G. L. c. 93A damages by failing to object before the jury were discharged. Unlike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>cases relied upon by the plaintiff, Polar does not contend that the special verdicts were made upon inconsistent findings of fact. Rather, Polar challenges the manner in which the judge attempted to reconcile the c. 93A damages with those awarded pursuant to the common law counts. See, e.g., <em>Charles River Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirksey, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 342-344 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">We decline to consider the arguments raised in the defendant\u2019s May 14, 1996, letter, which was filed after the oral argument in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
