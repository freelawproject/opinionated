In making its ruling, the trial court relied on <em>M &amp; I Marshall &amp; Ilsley Bank v. Mueller, </em>228 Ariz. 478, 268 P.3d 1135 (App.2011), and concluded the Rudgears\u2019 intent to build a home on the Property protected them from a deficiency judgment under Arizona Revised Statute (\u201cA.R.S.\u201d) section 33-814(G) (Supp.2012).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we find that A.R.S. \u00a7 33-814(G) does not apply to vacant land, we reverse and remand to the trial court for entry of partial summary judgment in favor of BMO.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b145-18\">\u00b6 2 In March 2006, Wildwood obtained a $296,200 loan (\u201cthe Loan\u201d) through BMO\u2019s predecessor in interest, M &amp; I Marshall and Ilsley Bank. The Loan was secured by a deed of trust on an unimproved, vacant lot (\u201cthe Property\u201d). The Rudgears personally signed the mortgage note, apparently on behalf of Wildwood, a limited liability company of which they are the sole members. The Rudgears also personally guaranteed the Loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-19\">\u00b6 3 The Loan was renewed in 2009, extending its maturity date to 2011. However, in April 2011, both Wildwood and the Rudgears defaulted on their obligations. BMO foreclosed on the Property through a trustee\u2019s sale and thereafter sued Wildwood and the Rudgears to obtain a deficiency judgment in the amount of the unpaid balance of the Loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-20\">\u00b6 4 Significantly, at no time was there any construction on the Property; it remained vacant throughout the term of the Loan until the time of the trustee\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-21\">\u00b6 5 The parties cross-moved for partial summary judgment on all issues relating to the Rudgears\u2019 deficiency liability. The Rudgears argued that as a matter of law BMO was precluded from recovering the deficiency because they intended to build a single one-family dwelling on the Property. The Rudgears submitted affidavits avowing it was their intent to build a home on the Property and occupy it as their primary residence. In response, BMO offered evidence that the Rudgears owned three separate parcels, each of which they purportedly intended to use as their \u201cprimary residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-22\">\u00b6 6 The trial court granted summary judgment for Appellants. Relying on <em>Mueller, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the court determined that no material evidence contradicted the Rudgears\u2019 affidavits, and that summary judgment was appropriate because the affidavits showed that the Rudgears intended to utilize the vacant Property as a single one-family dwelling. BMO timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and AR.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1) (Supp.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b6 7 Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and \u201cview[] the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Blake, </em>205 Ariz. 236, 240, \u00b6\u00b6 11,12, 69 P.3d 7, 11 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b6 8 This case involves construction of AR.S. \u00a7 33-814(G), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">If trust property of two and one-half acres or less <em>which is limited to and utilized for either a single one-family or a single two-family dwelling </em>is sold pursuant to the trustee\u2019s power of sale, no action may be maintained to recover any difference between the amount obtained by the sale and the amount of the indebtedness and any interest, costs and expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">(Emphasis added.) Under the terms of the statute, a party seeking protection from a deficiency judgment must prove the following: (1) the property was encumbered by a deed of trust; (2) the property consists of two and one-half acres or less; (3) the property is limited to and utilized for a single one-family dwelling or a single two-family dwelling; and (4) the property was sold at a trustee\u2019s sale. A.R.S. \u00a7 33-814(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u00b6 9 Here, there is no dispute that the Property was encumbered by a deed of trust, is less than two and one-half acres, and was sold at a trustee\u2019s sale. The sole issue is whether the Property was limited to and utilized for a one-or two-family dwelling within the meaning of AR.S. \u00a7 33-814(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">\u00b6 10 In looking at the plain language of the statute, we conclude the protection for \u201cdwellings\u201d under A.R.S. \u00a7 33-814(G) does not apply to vacant land. \u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, courts must generally follow the text as written.\u201d <em>Mid Kansas Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n of Wichita v. Dynamic Dev. Corp., </em>167 Ariz. 122, 128, 804 P.2d 1310, 1316 (1991). To interpret the word \u201cdwelling,\u201d we must give the word its ordinary meaning, \u201cunless a specific definition is given or the context clearly indicates a special meaning was intended.\u201d <em>Mein ex rel. Mein v. Cook, </em>219 Ariz. 96, 99 n. 2, \u00b6 12, 193 P.3d 790, 793 n. 2 (App.2008). As recognized by our supreme court, \u201c[t]he word \u2018dwelling\u2019 is susceptible to several interpretations, depending on the context of its use.\u201d <em>Mid Kansas, </em>167 Ariz. at 128, 804 P.2d at 1316 (citation omitted). \u201cHowever, the principal element in all such definitions is the \u2018purpose or use of a building for human abode,\u2019 meaning that the structure is wholly or partially occupied by persons lodging therein at night or <em>intended </em>for such use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, this court has described a dwelling as \u201ca shelter ... in which people live.\u201d <em>Indep. Mortg. Co. v. Alaburda, </em>230 Ariz. 181, 183, \u00b6 8, 281 P.3d 1049, 1051 (App. 2012). Given these definitions, it is clear that unimproved, vacant land cannot be properly characterized as a \u201cdwelling.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">\u00b6 11 Here, it is undisputed that the Property is unimproved, vacant land. It was never used as a dwelling prior to the trustee\u2019s sale, and therefore was not utilized as a \u201cdwelling\u201d under \u00a7 33-814(G). <em>See PAM Transp. v. Freightliner Corp., </em>182 Ariz. 132, 133, 893 P.2d 1295, 1296 (1995) (\u201c[I]f a statute specifies under what conditions it is effective, we can ordinarily infer that it excludes all others.\u201d). As a result, under the facts of this case the Rudgears\u2019 professed intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>construct a home on the Property is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b6 12 Accordingly, we conclude as a matter of law the Rudgears are not entitled to invoke the protection of A.R.S. \u00a7 33-814(G) because the Property consisted of vacant land and was not utilized as a dwelling. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment, and remand to the trial court for an entry of partial summary judgment in favor of BMO.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-15\">. We cite to the current versions of statutes unless they have been materially amended since the proceedings below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\">. Unlike <em>Mueller, </em>which addressed a situation where construction of a dwelling had commenced on a lot, the Property here was vacant and there was no construction. <em>Mueller, </em>228 Ariz. at 480, \u00b6 11, 268 P.3d at 1137. We conclude, therefore, that <em>Mueller </em>is not applicable to the facts of this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b147-6\">KESSLER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Amx\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b6 13 I concur with the majority that when a trustee\u2019s sale occurs on a parcel of land on which no construction of a dwelling has begun, the prohibition of a deficiency judgment under Arizona Revised Statutes (\u201cA.R.S.\u201d) section 33-814(G) (Supp.2013) does not apply. However, I write separately because the decision today leaves our superior courts in a quandary. If construction has begun, when does <em>M &amp; I Marshall &amp; Ilsley Bank v. Mueller, </em>228 Ariz. 478, 268 P.3d 1135 (App. 2011), apply? Put another way, where should the courts draw the line between the lack of any construction and an almost completed dwelling to determine if the trustor is protected by \u00a7 33-814(G)? Should the debt- or who cannot avoid default until shortly after a foundation is laid be excluded from anti-deficiency protection, but the debtor who defaults after the frame is up be entitled to protection? To avoid arbitrary line-drawing and comport with our prior cases and the policy behind the anti-deficiency statutes, I conclude that once any construction has begun, a court should determine whether the debtor is protected from a deficiency judgment based on a totality of the circumstances to see if the debtor intended the structure under construction to be utilized as his or her dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b6 14 The anti-deficiency statutes do not expressly address whether a debtor\u2019s intent to use the structure as his or her dwelling controls application of the statute. Prior judicial opinions, in seeking to effectuate the legislature\u2019s purpose, have looked to a party\u2019s intent to utilize the structure, or partially-constructed structure, as his or her home. Thus, in <em>Mid Kansas Federal Savings and Loan Association of Wichita v. Dynamic Development Corporation, </em>167 Ariz. 122, 804 P.2d 1310 (1991), after determining that commercial residential developers are not excluded from anti-deficiency protection, <em>id. </em>at 129, 804 P.2d at 1317, the court held that \u201cproperty is not utilized as a dwelling when it is unfinished, has never been lived in, and is being held for sale to its first occupant <em>by an owner who has no intent to ever occupy the property. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">\u00b6 15 In <em>Mueller, </em>this Court expanded on the intent analysis of <em>Mid Kansas. </em>The Muellers purchased a vacant lot and borrowed money from the bank to construct a single one-family home on the property for their own use. <em>Mueller, </em>228 Ariz. at 479, \u00b6 2, 268 P.3d at 1136. Before the home was complete, the Muellers abandoned construction and defaulted on the note. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. The bank held a trustee\u2019s sale and sued to recover the deficiency. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. The bank argued that the anti-deficiency statute did not apply because a home was never constructed on the property. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7. We disagreed, explaining that the result in <em>Mid Kansas </em>would have been the same even if the homes were finished because the debtor there intended to sell rather than occupy them. <em>Id. </em>at 480, \u00b6 9, 268 P.3d at 1137. Unlike <em>Mid Kansas, </em>the Muellers intended to personally utilize the property as a dwelling upon completion and thus were entitled to protection from a deficiency judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\u00b6 16 <em>Mueller </em>is consistent with the statute\u2019s primary purpose of \u201cproteet[ing] certain homeowners from the financial disaster of losing their homes to foreclosure plus all their other nonexempt property on execution of a [deficiency] judgment.\u201d <em>Baker v. Gardner, </em>160 Ariz. 98, 101, 770 P.2d 766, 769 (1988). As we explained in <em>Mueller, </em>a rule that defines utilization by present occupancy would undermine this purpose and lead to absurd results:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">An individual facing the possibility of foreclosure may camp out in the unfinished home, claiming to be \u201cutilizing\u201d the dwelling. Additionally, a person who lived in a new home for a day would be entitled to anti-deficiency protection, whereas some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>one who had not yet moved into a newly constructed home would not be entitled to such protections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><em>Mueller, </em>228 Ariz. at 480, \u00b6 10, 268 P.3d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b6 17 <em>Mueller </em>instructs that present occupancy and the level of construction are not dispositive of whether property is intended to be utilized as the debtor\u2019s dwelling, at least when some construction has begun.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[The] argument that a person has to physically inhabit the dwelling would create a blurry and artificial line.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b6 18 Similarly, a rule based on the level of construction that has already begun would require courts to \u201ccreate ... blurry and artificial line[s]\u201d based on whether foundation was laid, walls erected, or plumbing connected. Further, such an arbitrary rule would protect only those borrowers who managed to stay solvent long enough to achieve some yet undetermined level of construction, while leaving unprotected those whose economic misfortunes prevented them from doing more than breaking ground. Consequently, a borrower who takes any number of pre-construction steps toward building a dwelling the borrower intends to occupy, but who defaults just after putting shovel to dirt, would be left unprotected. Meanwhile, a borrower who takes all the same pre-construction steps but manages to stay solvent long enough to reach an undefined level of construction would receive anti-deficiency proteetion. Such an outcome would undermine the purpose of \u00a7 33-814(G) and our reasoning in <em>Mueller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u00b6 19 That does not mean that the level of construction is irrelevant to determining the borrower\u2019s intent. Rather, in determining a borrower\u2019s intent at the time the debt was incurred,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we should look to the totality of circumstances then and thereafter to determine if the borrower intended to occupy the planned building as a dwelling. Without limitation, long delays in signing contracts to build, the purchase of other lots in the same area to also build the borrower\u2019s alleged residence, and the stated intent in any loan documents all go to whether the borrower intends to build a dwelling in which to personally live. Thus, the level of construction alone is not determinative, but the type, manner, and extent of development are probative of the borrower\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u00b6 20 This conclusion is consistent with the stated public policy underlying the anti-deficiency statutes. As we recently noted in <em>Parkway Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Zivkovic:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">The statutes were intended to \u201cprotect [ ] consumers from financial ruin\u201d and \u201celiminat[e]\u201d... hardships resulting to consumers who, when purchasing a home, fail to realize the extent to which they are subjecting assets besides the home to legal process.\u201d The anti-deficiency statutes \u201callocate the risk of inadequate security\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>lenders, \u201cthereby discouraging overvaluation of the collateral.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[i]f inadequacy of the security results, not from overvaluing, but from a decline in property values during a general or local depression, [the anti-deficiency statutes] prevent the aggravation of the downturn that would result if defaulting purchasers were burdened with large personal liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">232 Ariz. 286, 290, \u00b6 16, 304 P.3d 1109, 1113 (App.2013) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b6 21 Recognizing the fact that this case deals with vacant land, there are, nonetheless, some facts present here that are instructive in determining whether a borrower intends to use a dwelling as his or her house. <em>See Mueller, </em>228 Ariz. at 479, \u00b6 4, 480, \u00b6 11, 268 P.3d at 1136, 1137 (applying anti-deficiency protections to the Muellers because they intended to build a dwelling on the property at the time that they acquired the loan, despite the fact that they admittedly abandoned that intent by the time of foreclosure). First, in the loan renewal documents the Rudgears listed the primary purpose of the Loan as \u201cBusiness (including Real Estate Investment)\u201d and the specific purpose as \u201cRENEWAL \u2014 vacant land investment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Second, the Rudgears also purchased several contiguous lots and made plans to develop them simultaneously, undermining their purported intent on summary judgment that any building on this particular lot was to be their home because it suggests that they might have been engaged in speculative development rather than personal homebuilding. Third, the Rudgears\u2019 representations in other deeds of trust that they intended to utilize different parcels in the area as their residence undermines their purported intentions. Although \u00a7 33-814(G) does not require the borrower to use the property as a <em>primary </em>residence, <em>Indep. Mortg. Co. v. Alaburda, </em>230 Ariz. 181, 184, \u00b6 10, 281 P.3d 1049, 1052 (App.2012), the fact that the Rudgears represented that they simultaneously were going to utilize three different properties in the same area as their primary residence raises doubts about whether they truly intended to occupy <em>any </em>of these lots as them own residence. Ultimately, however, it is unnecessary for us to balanee such factors in this case because no construction had begun on the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u00b6 22 Thus, I agree with the majority that given the language of \u00a7 33-814(G), the statute does not apply to a loan secured by property on which no construction has begun. However, once some development has begun, a court should look to the totality of the circumstances, and not an arbitrary level of construction, to determine if the debtor truly intended to use the property as his or her dwelling and be protected from deficiency judgments. This is consistent with <em>Mueller </em>and with the policy underlying the anti-deficiency statutes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">. Our legislature also appears to have rejected a present occupancy requirement when it repealed a short-lived amendment to A.R.S. \u00a7 33-814 that required the trustor/borrower to prove that he utilized the property as a dwelling for at least six consecutive months. <em>Compare </em>2009 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 68 (1st Reg.Sess.), <em>with </em>A.R.S. \u00a7 33-814(G). Furthermore, the introduced version of the bill that repealed the 2009 amendment had proposed a replacement provision that excluded \"speculative construction project[s]\u201d from anti-deficiency protection. S.B. 1004, 49th Leg., 4th Spec. Sess. (Ariz.2009) (introduced version). The proposed revision defined \"speculative construction project\u201d as \"construction commenced with the intention of selling the trust property on completion to a third party\u201d and stated that property \"not occupied as a residence for four consecutive months immediately following completion is presumed to be a speculative construction project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This proposed revision did not become law. <em>Compare id. with </em>A.R.S. \u00a7 33-814(G). Thus, our legislature twice rejected provisions defining utilization in terms of present occupancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b148-13\">. We should look to the borrower's intent at the time the loan is secured consistent with the underlying purpose of the anti-deficiency statutes. This protects consumers when they contract the debt for the property from subjecting their other assets to legal process and to protect them from financial ruin when contracting to incur the debt. <em>Parkway Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Zivkovic, </em>232 Ariz. 286, 290, \u00b6 16, 304 P.3d 1109, 1113 (App. 2013). Additionally, looking back at the time of incurring the debt is only fair to the lender, which should be able to assess the risk of whether it will be precluded from seeking a deficiency judgment in case of a default. <em>See Helvetica Servicing, Inc. v. Pasquan, 229 </em>Ariz. 493, 500, \u00b6 30, 277 P.3d 198, 205 (App.2012) (noting that the anti-deficiency statutes allocate the risk of inadequate security to the lenders).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
