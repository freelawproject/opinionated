The circuit court of Lake County dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The appellate court reversed and remanded, holding that the one-year statute of limitations contained in section 8 \u2014 101 of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (the Tort Immunity Act or Act) (745 ILCS 10/8 \u2014 101 (West 2000)) did not apply to the present cause of action. 335 Ill. App. 3d 317. The Village argues for reversal of the appellate court because: (1) the statute of limitation of the Act (745 ILCS 10/8 \u2014 101 (West 2002)) bars all but one of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, (2) plaintiffs lack standing to assert the sole claim that is not time-barred, and (3) the appellate court erred in remanding the matter to a different trial judge. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p> <p id=\"b264-3\" pgmap=\"264\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b264-4\" pgmap=\"264\">Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on March 26, 1998, and their amended complaint on July 14, 2000. The amended complaint alleged that plaintiffs entered into several contracts to build homes in the Village from February 1993 to August 1997. As a condition of these contracts, plaintiffs were required to apply for and obtain building permits from the Village and were required to pay all impact fees for the issuance of the building permits. From June 26, 1996, through February 1998, section 4 \u2014 1\u20144(B) of the village code required the payment of impact fees, setting forth that \u201cas a condition of the issuance of a building permit for the construction of a dwelling unit, the building permit applicant shall be required to donate monies to the Village.\u201d Long Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 4 \u2014 1\u20144(B) (amended June 25, 1996). The impact fees, which totaled $7,300 for each building permit, were for the benefit of the school district and for the acquisition, maintenance, preservation, and operation of open space in the Village. Long Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 4 \u2014 1\u20144(B) (amended June 25, 1996). Between June 26, 1996, and February 21, 1997, plaintiffs paid the required impact fees to obtain building permits for 11 lots. On February 20, 1998, plaintiffs applied for and obtained a twelfth permit for an additional lot, designated Lot 8.</p> <p id=\"b265-2\" pgmap=\"265\">The amended complaint sought a declaration that the required impact fees exceeded the Village\u2019s statutory and constitutional authority and a \u201crefund\u201d of all monies plaintiffs paid to the Village as impact fees. The Village filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2 \u2014 619(a)(5) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619(a)(5) (West 2000)), asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations contained in section 8 \u2014 101 of the Tort Immunity Act (745 ILCS 10/8 \u2014 101 (West 2000)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to Lot 8, the Village alleged that plaintiffs had no standing to assert a claim for that lot because the lot owner, not plaintiffs, paid the impact fees.</p> <p id=\"b265-3\" pgmap=\"265\">The trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint with prejudice. The appellate court reversed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that the Act applied only to actions sounding in tort, and remanded the matter to a different judge. 335 Ill. App. 3d at 321. The appellate court did not address the Village\u2019s argument regarding standing. See 335 Ill. App. 3d at 321. We allowed the Village\u2019s petition for leave to appeal (177 Ill. 2d R. 315(a)), and also allowed the Village of Kildeer, the City of Chicago and the Illinois Municipal League to file amicus curiae briefs in support of the Village (155 Ill. 2d R. 345).</p> <p id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b265-5\" pgmap=\"265(18) 266(148)\">The Village first requests this court to reverse the appellate court and uphold the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under section 2 \u2014 619(a)(5) of the Code. Under section 2 \u2014 619(a)(5), a defendant is entitled to a dismissal if the \u201caction was not commenced within the time limited by law.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619(a)(5) (West 2002). An appeal from a section 2 \u2014 619 dismissal is similar to an appeal following a grant of summary judgment, and both are subject to de novo review. Carroll v. Paddock, 199 Ill. 2d 16, 22 (2002); Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 116 (1993). In both cases, the reviewing court must determine whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether the dismissal is proper as a matter of law. Carroll, 199 Ill. 2d at 22; Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc., 156 Ill. 2d at 116-17.</p> <p id=\"b266-3\" pgmap=\"266\">The Village argues that section 8 \u2014 101 of the Tort Immunity Act unambiguously provides that any \u201ccivil action\u201d filed against a municipality, other than those actions specifically excluded by section 2 \u2014 101 of the Act (745 ILCS 10/2 \u2014 101 (West 2002)), must be filed within one year from the date the cause of action accrues. As a civil action for damages, the Village asserts, plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is barred by the Act. Section 8 \u2014 101 provides as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b266-4\" pgmap=\"266\">\u201cNo civil action may be commenced in any court against a local entity or any of its employees for any injury unless it is commenced within one year from the date that the injury was received or the cause of action accrued. For purposes of this Article, the term \u2018civil action\u2019 includes any action, whether based upon the common law or statutes or Constitution of this State.\u201d 745 ILCS 10/8 \u2014 101 (West 2000).</blockquote> <p id=\"b266-5\" pgmap=\"266\">The enumerated exceptions to which the Village refers are listed in section 2 \u2014 101, which provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b266-6\" pgmap=\"266\">\u201cNothing in this Act affects the right to obtain relief other than damages against a local public entity or public employee. Nothing in this Act affects the liability, if any, of a local public entity or public employee, based on:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b267-2\" pgmap=\"267\">a) . Contract;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b267-3\" pgmap=\"267\">b) .

The \u2018Illinois Uniform Conviction Information Act\u2019, enacted by the 85th General Assembly, as heretofore or hereafter amended.\u201d 745 ILCS 10/2 \u2014 101 (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b267-8\" pgmap=\"267\">If the Act were interpreted to apply only to torts, the Village argues, it would render section 2 \u2014 101 meaningless, as there would be no need for that section to carve out exceptions to the Act for liability based on nontort actions such as contract actions.</p> <p id=\"b267-9\" pgmap=\"267\">Plaintiffs respond that the Village\u2019s argument mischaracterizes the relief they seek. Plaintiffs maintain that they request a declaration that the Village does not have the statutory authority to require plaintiffs to pay the impact fees, and they also seek a refund of those fees. The amended complaint does not seek \u201cdamages,\u201d and, as such, plaintiffs argue, their cause of action is excluded by the plain meaning of the Act. We agree with plaintiffs that section 8 \u2014 101 of the Tort Immunity Act does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action.</p> <p id=\"b267-10\" pgmap=\"267(86) 268(78)\">In construing section 8 \u2014 101 of the Tort Immunity Act, our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature. Michigan Avenue National Bank v. County of Cook, 191 Ill. 2d 493, 503-04 (2000). When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court must give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language without resort to other tools of statutory construction. Michigan Avenue National Bank, 191 Ill. 2d at 504. \u201cOne of the fundamental principles of statutory construction is to view all provisions of an enactment as a whole. Words and phrases should not be construed in isolation, but must be interpreted in light of other relevant provisions of the statute.\u201d Michigan Avenue National Bank, 191 Ill. 2d at 504. We must construe the statute so that each word, clause or sentence is given reasonable meaning and not deemed superfluous or void. People v. Glisson, 202 Ill. 2d 499, 505 (2002).</p> <p id=\"b268-3\" pgmap=\"268(250) 269(31)\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is an action which seeks \u201crelief other than damages,\u201d as set forth in the first sentence of section 2 \u2014 101, and is, therefore, excluded from the Act. 735 ILCS 10/2 \u2014 101 (West 2002); see also In re Consolidated Objections to Tax Levies of School District No. 205, 193 Ill. 2d 490, 500-01 (2000) (stating that the Act includes actions seeking damages remedies while excluding actions seeking injunctive remedies). Plaintiffs request nothing more than a declaration that the ordinance is unlawful and a return of the impact fees collected pursuant to the ordinance. We therefore reject the Village\u2019s mislabeling of plaintiffs\u2019 relief as compensation for a wrong done, or \u201cdamages\u201d due from a duty, breach, and causation. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 393 (7th ed. 1999) (defining damages as \u201c[m]oney claimed by, or ordered to be paid to, a person as compensation for loss or injury\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 571 (1993) (defining damages as \u201cthe estimated reparation in money for detriment or injury sustained: compensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong or injury caused by a violation of a legal right\u201d). Rather, the relief sought is correctly viewed as a refund: the return of money to a person who overpaid because the original payment was in violation of the law. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1285 (7th ed. 1999) (defining refund as \u201c[t]he return of money to a person who overpaid, such as a taxpayer who overestimated tax liability or whose employer withheld too much tax from earnings\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1910 (1993) (defining refund as \u201cto return (money) in restitution, repayment, or balancing of accounts\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b269-3\" pgmap=\"269\">Stated another way, plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief of a refund may be properly designated as seeking an award of restitution. While restitution may be available in both cases at law and in equity (Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212-13, 151 L. Ed. 2d 635, 644, 122 S. Ct. 708, 714 (2002); 1 D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a7 4.1(3) at 564-65 (2d ed. 1993)), \u201c[t]he concepts of restitution and damages are quite distinct, but sometimes courts use the term damages when they mean restitution.\u201d 1 D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a7 3.1, at 280 (2d ed. 1993). As Professor Dobbs states in his 1993 revision of his Treatise on Remedies:</p> <blockquote id=\"b269-4\" pgmap=\"269\">\u201cThe damages award is not the only money award courts make. Courts may also award restitution in money; they may also order money payments in the exercise of equity powers. Damages differs from restitution in that damages is measured by the plaintiff\u2019s loss; restitution is measured by the defendant\u2019s unjust gain.\u201d 1 D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a7 3.1, at 278 (2d ed. 1993).</blockquote> <p id=\"b269-5\" pgmap=\"269\">Here, should the court declare that the ordinance exceeds the Village\u2019s statutory or constitutional authority, the lawsuit seeks an award of restitution because it seeks the restoration of the sum of money in the possession of the Village which in good conscience belongs to the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs do not allege that an employee\u2019s collection of the fees breached a duty as a predicate for the liability of the Village. Plaintiffs seek the return of their monies paid to the Village, and no more. They do not seek compensation for the loss of capital which they could have devoted to other investments, such as earnings from investing in the construction of another residence. Thus, if the lawsuit is ultimately successful, the amount of the award will be measured by the Village\u2019s unjust gain, rather than the plaintiffs\u2019 loss.</p> <blockquote id=\"b270-2\" pgmap=\"270\">Professor Dobbs explains that:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b270-3\" pgmap=\"270\">\u201cWhen restitution and damages would produce the same award, it is often unimportant to characterize the claim at all. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b270-4\" pgmap=\"270\">On the other hand, if the plaintiff has no substantive claim grounded in tort, contract, or statute, then if the plaintiffs claim is viable at all, it must be one for restitution to prevent unjust enrichment. That is so because restitutionary ideals form the only substantive basis for the claim. In that case, the recovery will force disgorgement of the defendant\u2019s gains (restitution) and also provide the equivalent of compensation (damages). Even so, if unjust enrichment is the only substantive basis for that recovery, the claim is for restitution.\u201d (Emphases in original.) 1 D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a7 4.1(1), 555-56 (2d ed. 1993).</blockquote> <p id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">Here, plaintiffs have no substantive claim grounded in tort, contract, or statute; therefore, the only substantive basis for the claim is restitution to prevent unjust enrichment. Hence, plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief is more properly characterized as restitution rather than damages. Plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, therefore, is excluded from the Tort Immunity Act by the first sentence of section 2 \u2014 101 (745 ILCS 10/2 \u2014 101 (West 2002)).</p> <p id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270(135) 271(28)\">Because plaintiffs seek the refund of an impact fee, and not damages, the Village\u2019s reliance on Village of Bloomingdale v. CDG Enterprises, Inc., 196 Ill. 2d 484 (2001), is also misplaced. In Village of Bloomingdale, CDG petitioned the Village of Bloomingdale to annex certain parcels of land and to rezone them so that CDG could build a subdivision. Village of Bloomingdale officials told CDG that the project would be approved. In its counterclaim, CDG alleged that the Village of Bloomingdale secretly sought to acquire and develop a golf course on the property and pressured planning commission members to vote against CDG\u2019s petition. After the petition failed, CDG sought its projected gross profits from the project in the amount of $4.8 million. Village of Bloomingdale, 196 Ill. 2d at 488. Whether CDG\u2019s claim was for damages was not in dispute. CDG did not seek the return of any costs or fees which may have been lost when the petition was denied.</p> <p id=\"b271-3\" pgmap=\"271\">While the Village correctly asserts that Village of Bloomingdale may have implicitly found that the Act applied to some nontort actions specifically at issue in that case, such a holding does not imply that the Act applies to all nontort actions against a government, including impact fee refund actions. Village of Bloomingdale did not affect section 2 \u2014 101\u2019s provision that \u201c[n]othing in this Act affects the right to obtain relief other than damages against a local public entity or public employee\u201d (745 ILCS 10/2 \u2014 101 (West 2002)), because CDG sought only damages in the form of its projected gross profits. Because the plaintiffs at bar do not seek damages, Village of Bloomingdale does not control.</p> <p id=\"b271-4\" pgmap=\"271\">The Village\u2019s characterization of the refund of impact fees as \u201cdamages\u201d also cannot be reconciled with our decision in Sundance Homes, Inc. v. County of Du Page, 195 Ill. 2d 257 (2001), where we discussed the nature of impact fees and statutes of limitations. In Sundance Homes, the plaintiff filed a complaint on February 8, 1996, seeking relief, including a count for declaratory judgment, for the return of all road impact fees paid between November 22, 1998, and July 25, 1990. The county argued that the plaintiffs complaint was time-barred by section 13 \u2014 205 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which imposes a five-year limitation period on \u201call civil actions not otherwise provided for.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/13 \u2014 205 (West 1996). Alternatively, the county argued that the plaintiffs complaint should be barred under the doctrine of laches.</p> <p id=\"b271-5\" pgmap=\"271(38) 272(244)\">In ruling for the county, we noted that \u201c[although an impact fee is not a tax [citation], the similarities between payment of a tax, and payment of an impact fee, are sufficient to render instructive tax cases addressing the issue of accrual\u201d of a cause of action. Sundance Homes, 195 Ill. 2d at 266. We then thoroughly discussed statutes of limitations and the doctrine of laches as they relate to claims for tax refunds. Sundance Homes, 195 Ill. 2d at 266-74. After examining the cause of action alleged in plaintiffs complaint \u2014 which sought mandamus, declaratory judgment, restitution, assumpsit, unjust enrichment and recovery of payments \u2014 we found the basis of liability was sufficiently legal in nature to circumscribe the reach of the equitable defense of laches in favor of the statute of limitations, a legal defense. Sundance Homes, 195 Ill. 2d at 282. However, the issue of whether the award the plaintiffs sought, a refund of impact fees, constituted \u201cdamages\u201d within section 2 \u2014 101 of the Tort Immunity Act (745 ILCS 10/2 \u2014 101 (West 2002)) was not raised by the parties. We deemed \u201crefund actions such as the one before us \u2018civil actions,\u2019 subject to the statute of limitation set forth in section 13 \u2014 205 of the Code, irrespective of any artful pleading designed to cloak the cause in the attire of equity.\u201d Sundance Homes, 195 Ill. 2d at 282. We further stated that \u201c[w]e believe the legislature intended that a uniform and harmonious system of law apply to refund cases, and the maintenance of two time-bar standards for simple refund cases is inconsistent with that intent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Sundance Homes, 195 Ill. 2d at 284.</p> <p id=\"b272-3\" pgmap=\"272(96) 273(73)\">Here, to impose a time-bar contained in the Tort Immunity Act, as the Village urges, would disregard the uniform and harmonious system of law intended by the legislature as reflected by section 13 \u2014 205 of the Code. See Sundance Homes, 195 Ill. 2d at 284; 735 ILCS 5/13\u2014 205 (West 2002). Such an imposition would also be a hazard for litigants who, if the Village\u2019s interpretation were to be adopted, must be counterintuitively aware that the statute of limitation for an impact fee refund case is found within the Tort Immunity Act. This imposition could also conceivably extend to tax refund cases, due to the \u201csimilarities between payment of a tax, and payment of an impact fee.\u201d Sundance Homes, 195 Ill. 2d at 266. However, the creation of another time-bar standard within the Tort Immunity Act is unnecessary because when plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is properly characterized as one for the refund of impact fees, it is evident that the Tort Immunity Act does not apply.</p> <p id=\"b273-3\" pgmap=\"273\">Thus, while we do not adopt or approve of the appellate court\u2019s reasoning that the Tort Immunity Act categorically excludes actions that do not sound in tort (335 Ill. App. 3d at 320), this court can affirm the appellate court on any basis present in the record. In re Application of the Cook County Treasurer, 185 Ill. 2d 428, 436 (1998). We affirm on the grounds that the plain meaning of section 2 \u2014 201 of the Tort Immunity Act excludes the type of cause of action at issue here, namely, an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Village\u2019s impact fee ordinance exceeded statutory authority and a refund of all monies plaintiffs paid to the Village pursuant to that ordinance. 745 ILCS 10/2 \u2014 201 (West 2002). Accordingly, we hold that section 8 \u2014 101 of the Tort Immunity Act does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. 745 ILCS 10/8 \u2014 101 (West 2002).</p> <p id=\"b273-4\" pgmap=\"273(109) 274(17)\">We next address the Village\u2019s contention that plaintiffs lack standing to bring a claim in connection with Lot 8. In the Village\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, the Village alleged that plaintiffs lacked standing to raise a claim with respect to Lot 8 because plaintiffs did not pay the impact fees for that lot. In support of its motion, the Village attached the evidence deposition of Edward Brown, the president of both plaintiff companies. In his deposition, Brown acknowledged that the impact fees for Lot 8 were passed on to the lot owners by increasing the purchase contract price by $7,300. Plaintiffs did not file a counteraffidavit nor did they dispute that the fees were actually paid by the lot owner and not plaintiffs.</p> <p id=\"b274-3\" pgmap=\"274\">Lack of standing is an affirmative matter that may be raised as a ground for dismissal under a section 2 \u2014 619 motion to dismiss. Glisson v. City of Marion, 188 Ill. 2d 211, 220 (1999). The doctrine of standing is designed to preclude persons who have no interest in a controversy from bringing suit. Glisson, 188 Ill. 2d at 221.</p> <p id=\"b274-4\" pgmap=\"274\">In ruling on a motion to dismiss under section 2 \u2014 619, the trial court may consider pleadings, depositions, and affidavits. Zedella v. Gibson, 165 Ill. 2d 181, 185 (1995). When supporting affidavits have not been challenged or contradicted by counteraffidavits or other appropriate means, the facts stated therein are deemed admitted. Zedella, 165 Ill. 2d at 185. In the absence of supporting affidavits, discovery depositions may be used for any purpose for which affidavits may be used. Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc., 156 Ill. 2d at 116, citing Sierens v. Clausen, 60 Ill. 2d 585, 588 (1975).</p> <p id=\"b274-5\" pgmap=\"274\">Plaintiffs made no attempt before the trial court to contradict Brown\u2019s sworn testimony and they did not dispute that the contract price between the lot owner and plaintiffs reflected an increase in the total purchase price to include $7,300 for impact fees. Plaintiffs also did not allege any other injury pertaining to Lot 8. Thus, under the circumstances, we find that plaintiffs lack standing to assert a cause of action based on the landowner\u2019s payment of the impact fees for Lot 8. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted the Village\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for Lot 8.</p> <p id=\"b274-6\" pgmap=\"274(51) 275(175)\">We finally turn to the appellate court\u2019s remand of the matter to a different trial judge. Under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 366(a)(5) (155 Ill. 2d R. 366(a)(5)), the appellate court has the power to make any order that ought to have been made and make other further orders that the case may require. Eychaner v. Gross, 202 Ill. 2d 228, 279 (2002). Such powers includes the authority to reassign a matter to a new judge on remand. Eychaner, 202 Ill. 2d at 279. A trial judge is presumed to be impartial, and the burden of overcoming this presumption rests on the party making the charge of prejudice. Eychaner, 202 Ill. 2d at 280. \u201cAllegedly erroneous findings and rulings by the trial court are insufficient reasons to believe that the court has a personal bias for or against a litigant.\u201d Eychaner, 202 Ill. 2d at 280. Here, plaintiff did not request this relief before the appellate court, and the appellate court made its ruling without discussing any bias on the part of the trial judge. Plaintiffs now request this court to uphold the reassignment. We find, however, that the plaintiffs have not met their burden because the only grounds alleged are the trial judge\u2019s prior adverse rulings against them. Therefore, we reverse the appellate court\u2019s reassignment of the matter to a different trial judge.</p> <p id=\"b275-5\" pgmap=\"275\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b275-6\" pgmap=\"275\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court reversing the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint based on section 8 \u2014 101 of the Tort Immunity Act. We also affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint pertaining to Lot 8 based on standing and reverse the judgment of the appellate court remanding the matter to a different trial judge.</p> <p id=\"b275-7\" pgmap=\"275\">Appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part; circuit court affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p> <p id=\"b275-8\" pgmap=\"275\">JUSTICE THOMAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b265-6\" pgmap=\"265\">The trial court, before granting the motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations issue and standing, struck certain paragraphs of plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint because they did not contain well-pleaded allegations of fact pursuant to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under section 2 \u2014 615 of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 615 (West 2000)). The appellate court affirmed this specific ruling. 335 Ill. App. 3d at 321. Plaintiffs do not appeal this issue, and we do not address it here.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
