Lovingston, and on November 15,1901, there was born of said marriage a child, named Margaret Caroline Metzen.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\" pgmap=\"279(126) 280(359)\">\"The defendants to the bill below, who are appellees here, were the children and grandchildren of Caroline Schopp, the testator\u2019s step-daughter, and the children of Mathilda Hoffman, also his step-daughter, and Leopold Uhrig, his step-son, and the children of Leopold Uhrig. The bill then describes the improved and unimproved real estate left by the testator, the value of the former being stated to be \u00a764,820.00, and the value of the latter, \u00a770,600.00, making an aggregate value of \u00a7135,420.00, all of said real estate being situated in East St. Louis. The bill also avers that there is an indebtedness against said real estate for street improvements, and other indebtedness, for about \u00a711,840.00; that the legacies are a lien upon the whole estate, and complainants below, appellants here, cannot sell any of the real estate on account of the objection made that the legacies are a lien, and that any piece of the real estate sought to be sold might be subject to the payment of the legacies, and, that for this reason, purchasers refuse to buy except at prices less than the real value of the property; that the city of East St. Louis contemplates making street improvements, some of which would be in front of said vacant property, and entail an additional expense against it; that the income, derived from the improved real estate, is not sufficient to pay the indebtedness, keep the buildings in repair, pay the taxes and insurance, and permit of the payment of $30.00 per month to Caroline Uhrig, and leave enough to support Caroline Metzen; that the indebtedness now due by the estate must be paid by a sale of real estate, and that full value of the property cannot be obtained by sale, as long as the legacies remain a lien upon the entire property; that, if the legacies amounting to $11,000.00, were made a specific lien upon the improved property, and the lien divested or taken from the unimproved real estate, the unimprov\u00e9d real estate could be managed and sold to advantage, so as to obtain its fair and full value. The prayer of the bill asks that a guardian ad litem be appointed for the minors, and that, upon a hearing, the court will decree that John Peter Metzen is the owner in fee simple of all the real estate of the testator, subject only to the life estate of Caroline Metzen and the payment of the legacies mentioned in the will, and that item 4 is of no legal effect, and that the lien of the legacies, mentioned in clause 3 of the will, which rests upon all the real estate, be kept upon the improved real estate, but be divested and taken from the unimproved real estate, so as to enable complainants to dispose of the unimproved real estate to pay the debts and charges upon the estate.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\" pgmap=\"280(18) 281(44)\">Demurrers were filed by the adult defendants, and also by the guardian ad litem of the minor defendants. The demurrers to the bill were sustained. The complainants below, appellants here, elected to stand by their bill of complaint, and decree was entered dismissing the bill for want of equity.

Under section 13 of the Conveyance act, \u201cthe court can only inquire whether an estate less than a fee is limited by express words or granted, conveyed or devised by construction or operation of law where words, theretofore necessary to transfer an estate of inheritance, are not used. Where an estate is devised to A, without the use of the words \u2018heirs and assigns,\u2019 A will take a fee simple estate of inheritance, unless the will, or instrument of conveyance, reduces the estate to an estate less than a fee by express words, or by construction or operation of law.\u2014 Wolfer v. Hemmer, 144 Ill. 554; Saeger v. Bode, 181 id. 514; Smith v. Kimbell, 153 id. 368.\u201d (Turner v. Hause, 199 Ill. 464). The fee of the residue of the estate, devised to John Peter Metzer, \u201cmay be limited by construction or by express words in a subsequent part of the will, because words, necessary to transfer an estate of inheritance, are not used in the devise of such fee. Hence, the fee, devised to\u201d John Peter Metzen, \u201cmaybe reduced to a less estate by the words used subsequently in the\u201d second \u201cclause, to-wit:\u201d \u201cI hereby give, devise and bequeath to him, the said John Peter Metzen,\u2019 my son aforesaid, all said residue of my estate, all of the real and personal property and effects, to him and his heirs of his body forever, under the herein mentioned conditions and restrictions, and such devise being made and subject to the bequests and legacies to be paid, as herein provided.\u201d There being nothing in the character of the devise of the residue of the estate to John Peter Metzen, which prevents a limitation thereof by subsequent words used in the second clause, the question arises what estate less than a fee was devised to John Peter Metzen by that clause. It must be said here, as it was said in Turner v. Hause, supra: \u201cThere can be no other answer to this question, under the decisions of this court, than that\u201d John Peter Metzen \u201ctook a life estate only, with remainder in fee to the heirs of his body.\u201d (Blair v. Vanblarcum,, 71 Ill. 290; Lewis v. Pleasants, 143 id. 271; Frazer v. Supervisors, 74 id. 282; Cooper v. Cooper, 76 id. 57; Lehndorf v. Cope, 122 id. 317; Dinwiddie v. Self, 145 id. 290; Kyner v. Boll, 182 id. 171; Saeger v. Bode, 181 id. 514; Welliver v. Jones, 166 id. 80). We are, therefore, of the opinion that, by the terms of clause 2 of the will, the appellant, John Peter Metzen, was to take, upon the death of Caroline Metzen, a life estate only in the residue of the estate therein mention\u00e9d, subject to the conditions and restrictions and the\u2019 payment of the bequests and legacies mentioned in the will.</p> <p id=\"b285-5\" pgmap=\"285\">It is, however, contended by the appellants that, even if John P. Metzen was given only a life estate in the property by the provisions of clause 2, yet that, by the terms of clause 5 of the will, he was empowered to sell the real estate after he became twenty-five years of age, and that, for this reason, it was the intention of the testator to give John Peter Metzen the fee simple estate in the residue of the property. This contention is based upon the use in clause 5 of the will of the following words \u201cI further direct * * * that my son and heir, John Peter Metzen, shall not be permitted to sell or encumber any improved property, devised hereunder, until he shall be twenty-five years of age.\u201d It is true, as a general rule, that \u201cwhere by the terms of a will, there is given to one an unlimited power of selling or otherwise disposing of an estate in such manner as the devisee may think fit, a limitation over is inoperative and void by reason of its-repugnance to the principal devise.\u201d (Welsch v. Belleville Savings Bank, 94 Ill. 203). In the case at bar, however, the words, above quoted from clause 5 of the will, do not confer a power of sale, but they amount to a restriction. and limitation on the power of sale. They were meant to-prevent the son from selling or mortgaging his interest.</p> <p id=\"b285-6\" pgmap=\"285(63) 286(63)\">It has been held by this court in a number of cases that, \u201cwhere a power of disposal accompanies a bequest or devise of a life estate, the power of disposal is only co-extensive with the estate which the devisee takes under the will, and means such disposal as a tenant for life could make, unless there are other words clearly indieating that a larger power was intended.\u201d (Henderson v. Blackburn, 104 Ill. 227; In re Estate of Cashman, 134 id. 88). In the will here under consideration, there are no other words besides those devising the estate, which clearly indicate that a larger power of sale was intended to be, conferred than such power of sale as a tenant for life could exercise.</p> <p id=\"b286-5\" pgmap=\"286\">In Welsch v. Belleville Savings Bank, supra, we said (p. 204): \u201cIt may be laid down as a general rule, that in all cases where, by the terms of a will, there has been an express limitation of an estate to the first taker for life, and a limitation over, any general expression, * * * apparently giving the tenant for life an unlimited power over the estate, but which do not in express terms do so must be regarded as referring to the life estate only, and therefore as limited by such interest.\u201d Here, the words, above quoted from clause 5 of the will, cannot be said to give the tenant for life an unlimited power of sale in express terms. If the words referred to can be regarded as anything else than a restriction or limitation upon the power of sale, they can only be construed as a general expression which apparently gives the tenant for life a power of sale. We are of the opinion that there is nothing in the language, used in clause 5, which raises the interest given to the appellant, John Peter Metzen, in clause 2 from an interest- as tenant for life to an absolute fee title to the residue of the estate.</p> <p id=\"b286-6\" pgmap=\"286(108) 287(18)\">We do not regard the following words in clause 4 of the will, to-wit, \u201cin case of the death of my son, John Peter Metzen, without leaving issue,\u201d as importing an indefinite failure of issue, and therefore it cannot be said that clause 4 is void for remoteness. The words, \u201cwithout leaving issue,\u201d as used in clause 4, mean \u201cwithout leaving issue\u201d at the time of the death of the devisee, and not at the time of the death of the devisor. Such words, as are here used, create a definite failure of issue, that is to say, the failure of issue living at the time of the death of John Peter Metzen. (Smith v. Kimbell, 153 Ill. 368; Strain v. Sweeny, 163 id. 603).</p> <p id=\"b287-5\" pgmap=\"287\">In our opinion the circuit court committed no error in sustaining the demurrer to the bill, and dismissing the same for want of equity. Accordingly, the decree of the circuit court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"A7U\" pgmap=\"287\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
