This court, pointing out in its opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the case was essentially a fact case and that it could not be properly determined without a full hearing on the issues tendered by the complaint and answer, sent the case back specifically for such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">Tried again, this time on the facts, each \u2022 side being afforded full opportunity to offer, and offering, many witnesses and much documentary evidence, there was again a judgment for defendants based on a careful opinion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> followed by full and complete findings of fact and conclusions of law. These fully exonerated defendants of the charges of deliberate and intentional pirating of plaintiffs\u2019 trade-mark, and of unfair competition of any kind. They also found that there was no basis in the evidence for the claim that substantial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> confusion or damage had resulted, or would result, from the complained of use by defendants of the name Bama in the sale of their wine, and that no case for equitable relief had been made out. From the judgment denying \u25a0plaintiffs the relief prayed for by them, plaintiffs have appealed, while defendants have appealed from so much of it as denied their counter claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">Here each side presenting its argument in a fashion calculated to generate more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>heat than light, sounds its trumpet furiously on both fact and law, and, like a very Orlando Furioso advances to the fray as though the very thought that it might be wrong, the other side right, was a betrayal of right reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">This is an unreasonable view. The law is not in confusion. The many cases each side puts forward can in the main be reconciled. In addition, the law of this case was settled on the first appeal, and we have no disposition to depart from or question the holding there made, that the case was not one to be determined on summary judgment and as matter of law, but to be heard as a fact case and determined by the trier upon and after hearing the facts. The law for this case having been thus settled by and in this court, it will serve no useful purpose for us to discuss and analyze the cited cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or to enter upon a general disquisition as to the applicable law, especially since we find ourselves in general agreement with the statement of it made by the district judge in his opinion. Now that, under the law of the case as laid down in this court on the former appeal, the case has been tried by the district judge and he has made findings, our function, and our sole function, is to carefully examine the record, the findings, and the attacks made upon them, and, in the light of that examination, determine whether, as claimed by appellants, the findings are, or as claimed by appellees, they are not, clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">We have made such a study of the findings and record, and, as a result thereof, we are of the clear opinion that the findings may not be set aside as clearly erroneous. Indeed, we are in no doubt that while there is evidence which would support findings to the contrary of those made, the record furnishes ample support for the findings and conclusions on which the judgment is based. We are of the opinion, though, that, in the interest of making assurance doubly sure that no confusion resulting in injury to plaintiffs will occur from the use of the name \u201cBama\u201d, the judgment should be modified by adding a requirement that defendants strike from their labels, wherever it appears, and cease and desist from the use of, the word \u201cBrand\u201d. As so modified, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">.

Lack of competition \u2014 plaintiffs being in the food-product business and defendants in the wine business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">2.

Equity sits for substance, and not for shadow, and no chancellor could ever justify the issuance of its most gracious writ because of the testimony that in some instances confusion had resulted in the initial calling for a paper published in a different state under a different date line, having - in every way a distinctive make-up, especially where the paper complaining was claiming a right to exclude another from a field which it had itself had not occupied. These incidents are the very straws, and straws are chaff, and while, in the popular adage, straws may \u2018show the way the wind blows,\u2019 equity has never yet issued its writ to protect either a straw man or a house of straw, for equity saves the wheat and fans the straw.\u201d Affirmed 11 F.2d 834, 836.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b889-6\">.

A visual comparison of the two labels confirms their tendency to confuse.The ordinary shopper identifies a product by the color and general appearance of its label, as well as by prominent words, symbols or pictures thereon, not by the fine print at the bottom of the label. Such a shopper would be easily misled by appel-lees\u2019 label into thinking he was buying appellants\u2019 product. He would not only see the word \u201cBama\u201d prominently displayed on both, but the style of lettering, the coloring and general appearance of the two labels are too similar to be the result of mere coincidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Thus, appellees not only confuse the public, but unjustifiably appropriate to themselves a share of appellants\u2019 good will and reputation, built up over years of dealing with the public. They also gain an unjust advantage from the thousands of dollars of advertising money spent by appellants in acquainting the public, not only with the trade-mark \u201cBama,\u201d but also with the general appearance of their label as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">While I agree that the trade-mark \u201cBama\u201d is perhaps a weak one, even when registered, I also think that a clear case of unfair competition is made out by this evidence, and that for the benefit of both the public and appellants, appellees should be enjoined from the use of their present label, which is clearly confusing. Even if appellees are entitled to use \u201cBama\u201d on their blackberry wine, they could, and should, devise a label more readily distinguishable from that used by appellants on their blackberry jams and jellies, which use long antedated appellees\u2019 label.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">I therefore concur in the order of modification, but dissent from the judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Rehearing denied; STRUM, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
