Further, if Respondent were right, it would avail it nothing for the evidence shows occurrences of unfair labor practices within six months of January 4th, sufficient to support the Board\u2019s findings and order.</p>\n<p id=\"az7-dedup-0\">No ground for setting aside the Board\u2019s order being made to appear, and the evidence appearing fairly to support it, the Board\u2019s order will be enforced as entered,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\">. 92 N.
