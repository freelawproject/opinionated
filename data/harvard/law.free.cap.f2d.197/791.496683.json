HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">The opinion of the District Court is reported in 98 F.Supp. 412, and contains a very full statement of the issues involved, the facts found and the supporting evidence; we shall assume an acquaintance with it in what we say, and we do not think it necessary to repeat its substance. Moreover, we shall confine our discussion to only one of the issues decided below, for, even though we should hold with the plaintiff on all other issues, the judgment would have to be affirmed, if, as we believe, the claims in suit are invalid because they are not for any patentable ad-vanee over the prior art. Hence we shall not consider the question with which so much of the argument has been concerned: <em>i. e. </em>how much may an application change its disclosure and still be for the \u201csame invention\u201d? We shall take February 21, 1939 as the date of Van der Horst\u2019s invention, that being the date of filing of his second British \u201cProvisional Specifications\u201d; but we shall ignore the first \u201cProvisional Specifications,\u201d filed September 3, 1938, because these concededly described the invention too indefinitely to identify it with the eventual patent. Before considering the prior art, we should say how we read all but Claim, 4 of the claims in suit. In Claims 6, 22, 26 and 27 the \u201cwearing member\u201d is to contain \u201csmall depressions\u201d' whose \u201cbottoms\u201d shall not be smooth: <em>i. e. </em>shall contain \u201cirregularities\u201d or \u201cprojections\u201d; and we shall speak of these as the \u201cValley Claims.\u201d Of them Claim 27 is the only possibly important variant; it prescribes a maximum \u201cpit\u201d depth of \u201cabout\u201d .003 of an inch; and since Cleveland\u2019s minimum \u201cpit\u201d depth is .002 of an inch, it overlaps Cleveland; and a patent claim cannot be good in part and bad in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claims 9, 13, 23, 24 and 25 are for the surface dimensions &lt;of the \u201cpits,\u201d and we shall speak of them as the \u201cArea Claims.\u201d Claim 13 makes the \u201cpit\u201d depth of these an added feature; but, since it adds nothing to Claim 8, \u2014 itself an \u201cArea Claim,\u201d\u2014 except that the \u201cpits\u201d shall be more than .0002 of an inch in depth, we may disregard it, because, as we have just said, Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpits\u201d were all at least .002 in depth. The \u201cArea Claims\u201d are, however, all distinguished from Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpress-roll\u201d by the fact that they require the presence of \u201csome\u201d \u201cpits\u201d which are less than .004 of an inch in width; and none of Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpits\u201d are less than .005 of an inch.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">With this preliminary we may proceed to the effect as prior art of Cleveland\u2019s Patent No. 2,114,072 issued April 12, 1938. it was not for a \u201cwearing member * * * to operate in frictional contact with an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>other wearing member\u201d; on the contrary it was for a \u201cpress-roll\u201d \u2014 a chromium faced cylinder, which should squeeze the water out of paper pulp between itself and a felt cylinder. It is extremely doubtful whether we may read the phrase, \u201cto operate in frictional contact with another wearing member,\u201d to include the second \u201cwearing member\u201d as one element of a patented combination. However, conceivably that may be proper, especially in view of the passage in lines 20-25 of column 3 of the specifications; and at any rate, we shall assume <em>arguendo </em>that the phrase does not merely describe how the first \u201cwearing member\u201d may be used, but is for a combination of it with a cooperating \u201cwearing member.\u201d If so, the claims are not for a new use of Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpress-roll.\u201d On that assumption they could be valid for two reasons: (1) because of the physical differences between them and Cleveland; (2) because it demanded invention to conceive of combining the \u201cpress-roll\u201d with a second \u201cwearing member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">After what we have already said about the \u201cValley Claims,\u201d it is clear that their only physical differences from the \u201cpress-roll\u201d lie in the fact that they assume that, when the chromium is eaten away by reversing the electrolytic current, the bottom of the \u201cpits\u201d will not be smooth, but corrugated, or \u201cirregular\u201d as the specifications describe them. It is very strange that these corrugations should have ever been made an element of any claims whatever, for Van der Horst himself swore that he did not \u201cbelieve they have any purpose or usefulness,\u201d but \u201cwould form some slight danger\u201d; indeed, he spoke of them as \u201ca necessary evil.\u201d Not only did they contribute nothing to the claims in which they appear, but, if they had, there is no reason to suppose that \u201cpits\u201d produced by sandblasting do not have bottom surfaces as \u201cirregular\u201d as those of \u201cpits\u201d produced by reversing the current. Cylinders which the defendant made in 1946 and 1948 by sandblasting were not \u201cperfectly smooth at the bottom,\u201d and if that was the result of sandblasting then, it must have been the result of sandblasting ten years earlier. Hence the \u201cValley Claims\u201d can only depend upon a combination of Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpress-roll\u201d with a second \u201cwearing member\u201d as <em>per se </em>patentable. As we have said, the \u201cArea Claims\u201d do have a physical difference from Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpits\u201d because the lower limit of the diameter of all Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpits\u201d \u2014 \u201cindentions\u201d <em>(sic) </em>\u2014was .005 of an inch, and \u201csome\u201d of Van der Horst\u2019s \u201cpits\u201d must be of a diameter \u201cless than about .004 inch.\u201d However, although it would not be true to say that Cleveland\u2019s claims overlap Van der Horst\u2019s, there is no justification for a patent, based upon the condition that \u201csome\u201d of the \u201cpits\u201d must be .001 of an inch narrower than any of Cleveland\u2019s. The record does not contain any evidence that the presence of some \u201cpits\u201d of .004 of an inch makes the \u201cwearing member\u201d operate better than if they were .005 of an inch; and in any event the judge found that the sandblasting process of Cleveland will in practice produce \u201cpits\u201d of less than .005 of an inch. At most all that can be said for this physical difference is that Van der Horst perceived that some \u201cpits\u201d of less than .005 of an inch might be an advantage. One cannot get a patent for that unless one can attribute some industrial benefit to the change.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, like the \u201cValley Claims,\u201d if they are to survive, it must be because it required invention to' make a self-lubricating engine cylinder by combining Cleveland\u2019s \u201cpress-roll\u201d with a second \u201cwearing member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We need not say, if the art had not already disclosed such a combination, that to conceive it could not have supported the claims. Perhaps it could; but the trouble is that the combination had been already invented by Stokes, whose \u201cProvisional Specifications\u201d \u2014 which eventually appeared in British Patent No. 521,572 of 1940 \u2014 were filed on November 22, 1938, earlier than Van der Horst\u2019s earliest date. These were letter for letter the same as \u00a1Stokes\u2019s \u201cComplete Specifications\u201d with the single exception of lines 62-65 of page three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>which are irrelevant. Under the doctrine of Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Boumonville Co., 270 U.S. 390, 46 S.Ct. 324, 70 L.Ed. 651, the pendency of an earlier application in a patent office makes the applicant a \u201cprior inventor\u201d under the Patent Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; moreover, the application is itself for all purposes the equivalent of a printed publication: that is to say, its anticipatory effect is not confined to the very letter of the disclosure, any more than is that of a printed publication.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are therefore to judge the validity of the claims in suit \u2014 even though we follow our assumption that they are combination claims \u2014 as though Stokes\u2019s British Patent had been published in November, 1938. If so, the claims are anticipated by the following passage from Stokes\u2019s specifications \u2014 page three, lines 76-82 \u2014 : \u201cThe smoothed surface is then artificially de-smoothed by shot blasting, or, alternatively knurling, followed up if necessary by further honing until the depressions * * * have been reduced in depth to the order of two to three thousandths of an inch.\u201d On this \u201cde-smoothed\u201d surface the chromium is then electrolytically deposited, and the surface of the chromium layer \u201cis characterized by a number of minute depressions which act as oil reservoirs\u201d \u2014 page three, lines 92, 93. Here was everything but the precise details of the \u201cpits\u2019 \u201d areas, and these Cleveland had disclosed with the approximations that we have already discussed. Incidentally, the art had to wait less than four months for a substantially literal anticipation of the claims, as appears from Patent No. 2,248,530 to Granger and Cleveland which was applied for on June 5, 1939. Such a quick sequence forbids any inference that, even though we were to ignore Stokes, the hypothetical combination was not ready for immediate birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">There remains Claim 4 which, however, needs no extended discussion. It is even more difficult than in the case of the other claims to construe this as a combination claim; it would do great violence to the phrase, \u201ca member having a surface to engage in moving contact with another member,\u201d to read it as describing the combination of the pitted member with \u201canother member.\u201d If so, we do not have the problem whether the combination demanded patentable ingenuity, which our hypothetical interpretation of the other claims has raised, for, unless read as a combination claim, Claim 4 would be invalid as a patent for a new use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Besides, even though we were to read it as a combination claim, Claim 4 would not serve the plaintiff\u2019s purpose, for it is for an article which shall be the same as the product of the process patent (though it need not be the product of the process). As such, it reduplicates the later claims, so far as these are descriptions of the product of the process; and, so far as the particulars which they interpolated added any new elements as conditions, Claim 4 is broader, and a broader claim must necessarily fail if a more limited claim has failed. From the foregoing discussion it appears that all the claims are invalid because, as we said at the outset, any advance \u2014 if it can be so described \u2014 \u2019which they made over the art as it stood in February, 1939, consisted of no more than trifling variants of what had already been invented. We do not mean to intimate that the claims are not also invalid because of the public use of the product for more than a year before February 22, 1943, but we welcome the escape from the fog that surrounds any answer to the question as to when a changed disclosure is for the same, and when it is for a different, invention. Whether that comes up over reissues or amendments in the Patent Office, it always results in periphrases to which we are not disposed to add.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-14\">. \u00a7 65, Title 35, U.S.C.A.; Miller v.
