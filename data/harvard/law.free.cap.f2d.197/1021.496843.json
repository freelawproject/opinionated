We think that the cease and desist portion of the order, except as it relates to discharges, is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole and should be enforced. There is ample evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings to the effect that the company in its dealings with its employees engaged in a program of interrogation, threats and coercion designed to discourage union membership and activities in violation of section 8 (a) (1) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158 (a) (1). We do not think, however, that the portions of the order relating to discharges are so supported. On the contrary, we think it clear from the record considered as a whole that the employees Pope and Clarke were not discharged because of union membership or activities but because of their junior status on the jobs they held when a reduction of working force was effected. The employee Beane was discharged because he absented himself from his job without notice to his employer. It appears also that, when other employment was offered him by the company shortly afterward, he failed to report for it and the company was notified that he had gone to work elsewhere. The Board\u2019s order will be modified by eliminating therefrom the provisions relating to discharge, restoration and back pay (being subsection (a) of paragraph 1 and subsections (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 of the order); and as so modified the order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">Modified and enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
