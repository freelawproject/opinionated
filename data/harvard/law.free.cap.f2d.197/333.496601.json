This appeal is from the order denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">We think that appellant\u2019s contention is without merit. Former Section 709a of Title 18, U.S.Code, on which was .based the present statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568, did not deprive the court of its power to impose consecutive sentences. Eyler v.
