Mindful. also that reasonableness is in the first-instance for the district judge to determine, we are of the opinion that the record furnishes us no basis for disregarding his finding and conclusion on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-21\">The order appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"aap-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-10\">. \u201cOrder</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">\u201cFiled January 18, 1952.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-12\">\u201cOn this, the 18th day of January, 1952, came on to be heard the above entitled and numbered cause, same being a petition asking that an inventory be furnished of the property involved, that Mr. D.
