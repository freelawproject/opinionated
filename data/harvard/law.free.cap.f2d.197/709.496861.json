The alleged ground for the relief prayed for was that each of said orders was entered \u201cunder circumstances tantamount to fraud effected and committed by said Long Island Lighting Company upon the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Court below and this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-23\"> Undoubtedly this court has jurisdiction to set aside its judgment if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>judgment was induced by fraud upon the court practiced by a party to the litigation. But the facts alleged in the petition do not show that fraud was practiced upon the Commission, the District Court or this court. Before each of these tribunals it appeared that Long Island Lighting 'Company did not believe that its depreciation reserves were short $10,263,969, 'but that it had set aside this sum in an account entitled \u201cUnearned Surplus \u2014 Special,\u201d \u201cto be available for transfer to reserves for depreciation or for other charges which may be approved 'by appropriate regulatory authorities.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 4, 1951 the New York Public Service Commission determined that the former alleged deficiency in depreciation was excessive by $3,219,-453.31. The charge of fraud appears to be based on failure of the Company to disclose that it had employed an independent consulting engineer and commenced work to reduce the alleged deficiency in depreciation \u201csubstantially more than a year\u201d before July 3, 1951. The petitioners argue that had this fact been disclosed this court \u201cwould undoubtedly have reversed\u201d the district court\u2019s order approving the plan of reorganization-. We do not agree. The report of the Company\u2019s consulting engineer, whatever it disclosed before July 5, 1950, was merely an expert\u2019s opinion. No one could predict what the Public Service Commission would determine until it acted. The Committee\u2019s expert, Mr. Davis, had testified that the sum reserved for depreciation was \u201cwholly unreasonable and unrealistic,\u201d but his opinion had not convinced the S. E. C., the District Court or this court that the plan should not be approved. We see no evidence of fraud upon the court in failing to disclose that the Company had employed an expert whose opinion, assuming that he had made his report 'before July 5, 1950, agreed with the Committee\u2019s expert that the reserve was excessive. The Securities and Exchange Commission and both courts as well as all the interested parties were sufficiently apprised of the possibility .that the New York Public Service Commission might subsequently hold the alleged depreciation deficiency excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The petition for reargument complains that our order of May 21, 1952 \u201cleaves counsel completely in the dark as to whether in the opinion of this Court, petitioners have a right to proceed by independent action under Rule 60(b) [Fed.Rules Civ. Proc. 28 U.S.C.A.] vice by bill of review abolished thereby.\u201d Our order denied the relief prayed for, alternative prayer (c) as well as prayers (a) and (b). Whether petitioners have a right to proceed by motion or independent action in the District Court without obtaining leave of this court is a matter upon which we express no opinion. See S. C.
