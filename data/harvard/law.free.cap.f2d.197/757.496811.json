The complaint sought (1) a declaration that three patents issued to the defendant are invalid and were not infringed, (2) a declaration that neither of the plaintiffs has violated any other rights of the defendant, including rights based upon any alleged disclosure of any of the subject matter of' the patents, and (3) an injunction against the bringing of suit by the defendant charging infringement of the patents, or charging that other rights of the defendant have been violated by the plaintiffs. Federal jurisdiction with respect to the patents was founded on 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 1338(a) and with respect to the other claim on \u00a7 1338(b). The order on appeal struck from the complaint all matter relating to the defendant\u2019s non-patent rights and dismissed the claim set forth in. the matter so stricken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The patents in suit relate to flashing light alarm clocks and clock controlled switches. Litigation between the parties was initiated by the patentee, Parissi. In November 1950 he sued General Electric Company in the Supreme Court of Albany County, New York. His complaint alleged that before applying for the patents later issued to him, he had disclosed his invention to General Electric Company in confidence, that it had thereafter wrongfully appropriated his invention and realized profits therefrom to which he was justly entitled and for which he sought an accounting. After removing this suit to the federal court, General Electric and Telechron brought the present declaratory judgment action against Parissi. He promptly moved to dimiss it and also moved to remand the removed action. Both motions were argued before-Judge Brennan, who granted the motion to remand, 97 F.Supp. 333 and denied the motion to dismiss, 97 F.Supp. 35'5. Thereafter on the first day of the trial of the declaratory judgment action, which came on before Judge Foley, Parissi made the motion to strike on which was entered the order now before us on appeal. Ruling on the motion was deferred until the plaintiffs rested their case. It was then granted in an oral opinion in which Judge Foley concluded that Judge Brennan\u2019s prior opinions had decided that the court lacked jurisdiction of the non-patent claim and also that Judge Brennan had exercised his discretion not to take jurisdiction over that part of the complaint \u201cinvolving the confidential disclosure and unjust enrichment.\u201d Judge Foley added that in the exercise of his own discretion, if he had discretion, he would exercise it in favor of the defendant Parissi. Hence the questions presented on appeal are (1) whether the district court has jurisdiction of the non-patent claim, and (2) if it has, whether discretion was abused in refusing to hear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Before discussing the merits we must pass upon the appellee\u2019s contention, made in reliance upon this court\u2019s decision in Flegenheimer v. General Mills, 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 237, that the order is interlocutory and non-appealable, despite inclusion in the order of the express determination specified in Rule 54(b), Fed.Rules Civ. Proc. 28 U.S.C.A. Judge Clark is of opinion that the Flegenheimer case should be overruled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But, all else aside, a majority of the court thinks the case at bar does not present the necessity of reconsidering the question there decided. Section 1292 (1) of Title 28 allows an appeal from interlocutory orders refusing injunctions. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint prayed that the defendant be enjoined from bringing suit against them \u201ccharging that said flashing light alarm clocks, clock controlled switches, or clock controlled radios embody any invention to which rights are owned by defendant or have been made or sold in violation of defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d Striking the quoted words and dismissing the complaint in so far as it related to the non-patent claim was refusal of an injunction, and consequently appealable even if the order be regarded as interlocutory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, the first question for consideration is the jurisdiction of the district court. The complaint is set forth in the margin, the words in italics being the matter which the court ordered stricken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>court referred to the complaint as alleging a patent claim and a non-patent claim, close examination of the complaint discloses, we think, that in reality three claims are averred as to which the plaintiffs sought declarations of rights and injunc-tive relief: (1) a claim that the patents are invalid and have not been infringed ;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>(2) a claim that the alleged inventions were not disclosed to the plaintiffs in confidence;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) a claim that the alleged inventions were not disclosed subject to any understanding, express or implied, that compensation would be paid therefor to defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The second and third claims involve common law rights and, since diversity of citizenship is lacking, jurisdiction must depend upon the applicability of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1338(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court has recently considered the problem of dependent jurisdiction in Kleinman v. Betty Dain Creations, 2 Cir., 189 F.2d 546 and Schreyer v. Casco Products Corp., 2 Cir., 190 F.2d 921, certiorari denied 342 U.S. 913, 72 S.Ct. 360. In the former two causes of action were asserted, one for patent infringement, the other for breach of contract to pay for use of the patented article. It was held, Judge Clark dissenting, that a failure to make payments under a licensing agreement does not constitute the tort of unfair competition and therefore the claim for breach of contract was not within the dependent jurisdiction of \u00a7 1338(b). In the Schreyer case the complaint charged both infringement of a patent and unfair competition consisting in the use of information which had been confidentially disclosed to the defendants during negotiations concerning the granting of a license to them. We held that the use of confidentially disclosed information to invade the plaintiff\u2019s market was unfair competition and that jurisdiction existed under \u00a7 1338(b). In the case at bar, the non-patent claim referred to above as claim (2) falls squarely within the Schreyer decision, and the claim referred to as claim (3) within the Betty Dain decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">In differentiating Betty Dain in the later Schreyer case, the court said, 190 F.2d at page 924: \u201cUnlike the situation in Kleinman v. Betty Dain Creations, Inc., 2 Cir., 189 F.2d 546, 548, this dependent cause of action does not \u2018sound primarily in contract.\u2019 \u201d The difference between the two cases as we read them is that the duty in one rested on a contract based on a consensual undertaking, while the duty in the other depended on a contract implied in law because the relations between the parties were such that it would be unjust for the recipient of the information to use it to the detriment of the person who imparted it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Why this difference in the nature of the obligation should be important in determining whether the violator of the obligation has engaged in \u201cunfair competition\u201d within the meaning of section 1338(b) is not expounded in the Schreyer case, and is not apparent to the court as now constituted. Whether the obligation is a fictional contract implied in law or a consensual contract not to use confidential information to invade the plaintiff\u2019s market of a patented device to which the information related, the wrong done is the same, and the claim asserting it would seem as truly a \u201cclaim of unfair competition\u201d in the one case as the other. In our opinion the Betty Dain case was in substance overruled by the Schreyer decision, since the attempted distinction between them cannot logically be supported. We follow the later case and hold that the district court had dependent jurisdiction of both non-patent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number> The district court also rested dismissal of the non-patent claims on the exercise of his discretion, if he had power to exercise discretion. This brings us to the question whether discretion was abused in not retaining jurisdiction of these claims. The appellants concede that in actions for declaratory judgment the court has wide discretion in refusing to exercise jurisdiction where another adequate remedy is available.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The reasons which moved the court to exercise discretion in favor of the state court action are stated in his opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The primary reason appears to be the priority in point of time of Parissi\u2019s state court action. As this court recognized in Hammett v. Warner Bros. Pictures, 2 Cir., 176 F.2d 145, 150, the determination of priorities between pending cases on the basis of dates of filing is' not to be applied in a mechanical way-regardless of other considerations. See also Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 342 U.S. 180, 72 S.Ct. 219.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state court cannot deal with Parissi\u2019s patent claim;' the federal court can dispose of that as well as the non-patent' claims. In other words, it can terminate the litigation completely. The case had' been on trial for 16 days before the court-rendered its decision granting the motion-to dismiss the non-patent claims. The evidence is not before us but the appellants\u2019 brief states that \u201cProofs covering every aspect of the confidential disclosure case-had been presented by the appellants and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>to the extent that Parissi wished, by him.\u201d Under the circumstances it would seem to conserve judicial effort and save expense to the parties to dispose of the entire controversy in the federal court rather than to send the non-patent claims to the state court where the same evidence would have to be again presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Accordingly the order is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-22\">.

I give that institution of the first action much credit and realize it should be honored as far as I am concerned personally. The state action was instituted November 6, 1950, was removed to the federal court December 5, 1950, and the action by General Electric and Telechron was instituted December 22, 1950. In giving credit to the priority of the Pa-rissi action in the state court I am applying the same reasoning, which is applied in the priority of federal actions within district courts and that reasoning is indicated in Grosley Corporation v. Westinghouse [Electric &amp; Mfg. Co., 3 Cir.], 130 F.2d 474, and in Cresta Blanca Wine Company v. Eastern Wine Corporation [2 Cir.], 143 F.2d 1012. In my judgment the relief in the state action will be more expeditiously and effectively afforded than here. The answer by the defendant seems to be in the nature of a demurrer. There is no denial, or form of denial, that runs counter to the allegations of the complaint of the unjust enrichment and confidential disclosure idea. The answer or denial in that respect, as. I remember, just states that those issues should be tried in the state Supreme Court. They form in my mind not a. proper issue under the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">\u201cI also in the exercise of my discretion believe that the unjust enrichment or unfair competition and confidential' disclosure action should not be tried here-because there is no request by the defendant Parissi in this Court for the-computation of any damages. We do not have here a little side -issue, as we have-had indicated in some of the defenses in, the previous cases that involve this jurisdictional opinion but we have the side-issue which no matter what it may be worth has been termed by the plaintiff in the state action as an action for a million two hundred fifty thousand dollars.' I also do not think we have a defendant here doubly harassed. We have a reversal of the parties. We have a different plaintiff than we would have in the state court. For those reasons, particularly because of the priority in the federal court solely because the state court has large calendars in the Third Judicial District which are crowded, I feel it is only fair that the unjust enrichment action stay in the state Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b812-13\">.
