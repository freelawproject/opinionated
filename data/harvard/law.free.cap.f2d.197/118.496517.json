The facts and the opposing arguments are stated in the opinions below, 17 T.C. 124, and need not be here repeated. We see nothing to distinguish the case from this court\u2019s recent decisions in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Arrowsmith, 2 Cir., 193 F.2d 734, and Milliken v. C. I. R., 2 Cir., 195 F.2d 135. On the authority of those cases the decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
