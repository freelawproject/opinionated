Kenworthy\u2019s Sons, of which the male petitioners are members, to Oscar A. Fow, a former partner, in connection with his assignment to the remaining partners of his interest in the partnership, was a capital expenditure. The petitioners\u2019 contention is that $70,000 of this amount was a business expense and deductible as such from their gross income for tax purposes. We think that the question whether under the circumstances of this case the $70,000 in controversy was paid to protect and preserve the partnership business from injury by an intemperate partner, as the petitioners contend or to purchase that partner\u2019s interest in the name and good'will of the partnership, as the Government urges, is one of fact. The Tax Court resolved this question in favor of the Government. On this record we cannot say that the court\u2019s findings in this regard were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Accordingly the decisions of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
