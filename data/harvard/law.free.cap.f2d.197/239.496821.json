In March 1947 the appellant was convicted under two indictments, on one of which he was sentenced to three years imprisonment and fined $10,000 and on the other received a shorter prison sentence, to be served concurrently with the three year term, and an additional $10,000 fine. Each sentence directed that he stand committed until the fine be paid or otherwise discharged according to law. After serving part of his sentence in the Federal Corree-tional Institution at Danbury, Connecticut, he was released on parole on April 25, 1949. The order of the Parole Board required \u201cthat said prisoner remain within the limits of Southern District of New York until April 24, 1951; or in the event of a committed fine or a committed fine and costs, until the same have been paid or he has been discharged under the provisions of Section 641, Chapter 19, Title 18, U.S. Code, or until other action may be taken by the said United States Board of Parole. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant was also required to sign the \u201cStatement of-the Conditions under which this Parole is granted\u201d and thereby subjected himself to supervision and restrictions customarily imposed upon paroled prisoners. Together with his Certificate of Paro e e receive Parole Form No. 11, which named April 24, 1951 as the minimum date and stated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avb\">\u201cThe fact that you have a committed fine requires you to serve thirty days extra on parole unless your fine is paid. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af0\">\u201cIf you cannot pay the fine now you should apply to the nearest United States Commissioner to take the Poor Convicts Oath. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASY\">\u201cYou should continue regular month- . ly reports until your committed fine is satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQN\">By letter dated April 26, 1951 the Probation Officers notified him that his parole period had not expired because of the committed fines and \u201cwould run at least until May 24th * * * \u201d Only a small part of the fines having been paid, on July 24, 1951, the United States Attorney, without notice to the appellant obtained an <em>ex parte </em>order that a warrant issue for his arrest and that he be surrendered to the United States marshal to complete the sentences previously imposed. Thereupon he moved to vacate said order, his affidavit stating that he is eligible to take the poor convict\u2019s oath and is about to make applicatiofi to do so. This motion the court denied, reaffirming its former order but staying execution thereof pending appeal on condition that the appellant post bail, which he did. His brief states that he has continued on parole,</p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">Section 3569 of Title 18 of the Code provides that \u201cWhen a poor convict, sentenced * * * to be imprisoned and pay a gne&gt; * * * has been confined jn prjSOn thirty days, solely for the nonpayment of such fine,\u201d he may make application a Umted States commissioner \u201cin the district where he is imprisoned\u201d to take a paUper\u2019s 0ath; and upon taking it he gjjgjj be discharged, and the commissioner \u201eshall file with the institution in which ^ conyict ^ confined\u201e a certificate setting f()rth thg facK The United States Board Qf paro]e q\u00a3 ^ Department of Justice hag for many years construed this section ag permjtring a paroled prisoner who was sentenced t0 both a prison term and a committed fine&gt; to serve on parole the thirty days additional necessary to qualify . him ^.0 ^ake ^he p00r convict\u2019s oath. In the case at bar the United States attorney has challenged this construction of the statute and taken the position that during the additional thirty days the poor convict must be actually \u201cconfined in prison.\u201d The district judge agreed with the United States Attorney. This court does not.</p>\n<p id=\"ALz\">Section 3569 is derived from, and is substantially a copy of, section 1042 of the Revised Statutes with respect to the words above quoted. No doubt as originally enacted, the words \u201cconfined in prison thirty days soley for the nonpayment of such fine\u201d contemplated, actual confine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ment within prison walls, since parole of federal prisoners was then unknown. The system of parolling federal prisoners was introduced by the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 819. In construing that Act, as amended, the Supreme Court said in Anderson v. Corail, 263 U.S. 193, 196, 44 S.Ct. 43, 44, 68 L.Ed. 247:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201c * * * The parole authorized by the statute does not suspend service or operate to shorten the term. While on parole the convict is bound to remain in the legal custody and under the control of the warden until the expiration of the term, less allowance, if any, for good conduct. While this is an amelioration of punishment, it is in legal effect, imprisonment. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">This case was cited with approval in Zerbst v. Kidwell, 304 U.S. 359, 361, 58 S.Ct. 872, 82 L.Ed. 1399. See also United States ex rel. Gutterson v. Thompson, D.C., 47 F.Supp. 150, 151, affirmed, 2 Cir., 135 F.2d 626, certiorari denied 320 U.S. 755, 64 S.Ct. 62, 88 L.Ed. 450; United States ex rel. Carapa v. Curran, 2 Cir., 297 F. 946, 950, 36 A.L.R. 877. While on parole the appellant was constrained to remain within the southern district of New York and subjected to various duties, such as making monthly reports, refraining from the use of intoxicating liquors, and obtaining permission from a probation officer before changing employment. Parole enlarged the confines of his prison but still left him within the legal custody and under the control of the Attorney General.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such being his status, we believe that he was \u201cconfined in prison\u201d within the meaning of section 3569 construed, as it should be, in connection with the Parole Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The appellee questions the Parole Board\u2019s power to parole the appellant for any period extending beyond the three year sentence which expired on April 24, 1951. The argument relies on 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4203 and 4205. The former declares that a parolee remains, while on parole, in the legal custody of the Attorney General \u201cuntil the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.\u201d The latter section provides that a warrant for the retaking of a paroled prisoner may be issued only \u201cwithin the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.\u201d The argument is grounded on the assumption that the appellant\u2019s three year sentence is his \u201cmaximum term.\u201d We cannot agree with this assumption. The appellant\u2019s maximum term was three years plus any further period until the fine is paid or otherwise discharged according to law. Parole Form No. 11, quoted above in the statement of facts, shows that such is the Parole Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s long standing interpretation of this provision of a statute which it administers is, at the least, entitled to great respect. See Bellefield Co. v. Heiner, 3 Cir., 25 F.2d 560, 563. We agree with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Orders reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AU0\">.
