Each, pointing out that the facts are not in dispute and insisting that there is little room for construction or difference of opinion, urges upon us that he, and not the other, has the right of it. In addition, the collector, citing G. M. A. C. v. Higgins, 2 Cir., 161 F.2d 593, and Commercial Credit Co. v. Hofferbert, 93 F.Supp. 562, affirmed per curiam, 4 Cir., 188 F.2d 574, claims that he has the support of authority. Not to be outdone, the taxpayer, citing the later, and as it claims the better reasoned, case of Belden Mfg. Co. v. Jarecki, 7 Cir., 192 F.2d 211, insists that this case is, the other cases are not, in point on the facts and that, in point of both reason and authority, its cause is the better.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\"> We agree. Standing out in this case, great beacons lighting the way that we should go, are: (1) the fact that, under the undisputed facts, the taxability of the instrument is not free from, indeed at the best for the government, is shrouded in, doubt; and (2) the principle that taxes may not he exacted unless clearly due, and in case there is doubt, the taxpayer must be given the benefit of it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">In addition, we find the Belden case in point and most persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">The district judge, in his findings of fact and conclusions of law, reported at D.C., 99 F.Supp. 104, correctly, and with sufficient fullness, set out the facts and, with equal correctness, stated the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">Upon the basis of the facts there found and the reasons there given, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">. \u201cSec. 1801 [as amended by Sec. 521(a) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1941, c. 412, 55 Stat. 087] Corporate Securities.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u201cOn all bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation, and all instruments, however termed, issued by any corporation with interest coupons or in registered form,' known generally as corporate securities, on each \u00a7100 of face value or fraction thereof, 11 cents: * * 20 TJ.S.G. 1916 ed. \u00a7 1801.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-12\">. \u201cTreasury Regulations 71 (1941 ed):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">\u201cSec. 113.50.

IssUe Subject to Tax.\u2014 Ordinarily, a corporate instrument styled a bond, debenture, or certificate of indebtedness is subject to the tax. However, the taxability of an instrument is not determined by the name alone but depends upon all the circumstances, such as the name, form, and terms of the instrument, etc. Hence, an instrument, however designated, having all the essential characteristics of a bond, debenture, or certificate of indebtedness is taxable as such. Similarly, an instrument issued with interest coupons, or with provisions for registration, and coming within the class known generally as corporate securities will be held subject to the tax regardless of the name by which it may be called.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-22\">.
