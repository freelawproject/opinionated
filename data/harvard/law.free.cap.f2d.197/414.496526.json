Brown, Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Employees\u2019 Compensation rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claim for disability compensation under the Act, having resulted in a judgment in the District Court dismissing the suit, plaintiff appeals. The . employer, Metcalfe-Hamilton Kansas City Bridge Company and its insurer, The Travelers Insurance Company, were also made defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">The parties agree that our review is limited to a determination of whether the findings of the Deputy Commissioner are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a, whole. O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., 340 U.S. 504, 508, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483; Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456; Folds v.

Brown, 7 Cir., 185 F.2d 37, 39, that such is the scope of review of a Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order , under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See also Wheeling Corrugating Co. v. McManigal, 4 Cir., 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>F.2d 593; Southern Stevedoring Co. v. Voris, 5 Cir., 190 F.2d 275. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act govern. O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, 340 U.S. 504, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483. The only question presented, therefore, is whether the \u00e9vidence before the Deputy Commissioner was of such substantial character, considered on the record as a whole, as to justify the finding and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">There is little dispute in the evidence, which consisted of the testimony of plaintiff and one of his fellow-workmen and the reports of various physicians. According \u25a0to plaintiff\u2019s undisputed testimony he went to work in Iceland for the Bridge Company engaged in construction work for the United States Government on that island, in July 1947, after a medical examination. He was then in good health except for a slight deafness in one ear. He continued in the employment until April 9, 1948, when, after increasing physical discomfort for several weeks, he became ill and was taken to the hospital. He was an electrician and worked in a small battery room, which was a part of a hangar, a large building. The latter was heated with stoves, \u2014 double drum oil burners, the- exhaust pipes of which extended some four or five feet above the drums, so that the unburned fumes escaped into the building. The evidence, in the final analysis, is undisputed that there was no ventilation in the roof of the hangar and no outlet to conduct the fumes outside as they escaped from the stoves. The heating season started in October and continued until after plaintiff left the employment; during the cold weather all outside hangar doors were kept closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The battery room was enclosed with wooden planks. In his work within it, plaintiff was subjected to the fumes of sulphuric acid which could escape only through the door leading to the. hangar. There was no mechanical equipment serving to draw the fumes away. Only plaintiff usually and regularly worked in the battery room.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">About <em>2/% </em>months prior to his injury plaintiff began to have dizzy spells. He experienced loss of sleep and of appetite and, finally, after this condition had persisted for sometime, he reported to Dr. Shuman, attending physician. On the 19th of April he arose about 9:30 A. M., expecting to report to the hospital and there see the doctor. He became ill, fainted and remained unconscious until 12 o\u2019clock when, upon regaining consciousness, he found himself lying on the floor with \u201cquite a bit of blood\u201d about him. He was then taken to the hospital where he stayed until he left Iceland on April 24 for his home in America.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Plaintiff was corroborated in certain particulars by William Love, who likewise worked in the hangar, and who testified that there was no ventilation in the roof of the building, no opening of any sort and no chimneys except those extending above the oil drums.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">After returning home plaintiff was under the care of physicians for several months, gradually improved and had made a practically complete recovery by the fall of 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Dr. Engstrand reported that he first saw plaintiff on April 29, 1948, directly after his return from Iceland; that after \u201ccomplete examination no organic lesions\u201d were found; that the patient\u2019s \u201cblood examination\u201d was \u201crelatively within normal limits,\u201d showing \u201csome evidence of lowered resistance\u201d ; that, assuming that he \u201chad worked in an area where sulphuric acid fumes were present, this case was undoubtedly the result of toxic poisoning producing dizziness and fainting\u201d and that x-rays showed a fracture of the left jaw. The doctor reported as of June 14, 1948, that, after \u201cconsiderable laboratory examination, no unusual pathology could be found\u201d which was \u201cnot explained on a toxic basis,\u201d resulting from the patient\u2019s employment requiring him \u201cto work where oil fumes and other fumes were present in large amounts\u201d; that, under tonic, anti-acid and mineral oil treatment, he had \u201cimproved rapidly\u201d but that \u201cthe pain in his jaw persisted\u201d ; that x-ray pictures of both jaws taken May 20, 1948 showed \u201cthat the left side was lapping near the head of the left maxilla,\u201d but that \u201cit was thought just as well to leave the fracture in the position in which it was\u201d; that on June 8, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>jaw had improved and the patient was feeling \u201cvery good.\u201d The same physician reported, under date of October 29, 1948, that under medication and treatment recommended, Mattison had \u201cgradually improved\u201d; that complete recovery had not yet been achieved, as there was still \u201ctenderness over the fractured jaw,\u201d and that the patient should make complete recovery within \u201ca few months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Under date of September 8, 1948, Dr. Kirkhof reported that, with the exception of tenderness on the left side of the face, including \u201cpressure over the left mastoid process\u201d producing pain, the head, heart, blood count and pressure, heart tones, chest, abdomen, rectum, trunk, extremities, urinalysis and hemoglobin of the patient were all negative, i. e. without positive indication of pathological or other abnormal characteristics; that, though the patient could have received a fracture in April, he found no present evidence of such injury; that he could find \u201cno evidence of any disease,\u201d except the possibility of some previous \u201ccoronary disease\u201d; and that it is \u201centirely possible\u201d that the man had \u201csufficient carbon monoxide\u201d within him to cause him to \u201cbecome faint and fall,\u201d but that he could not say whether claimant \u201cfell by reason of any illness of his own or by reason of the situation where he worked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The report of Dr. Kearing, who attended plaintiff in Iceland after he was taken to the hospital, reported in August, 1948, that on April 3, 1948, he found plaintiff affiicted with \u201ccerebral and secondary anemia\u201d; that on April 19, Matti-son was returned to the hospital to receive \u201ctreatment for facial injuries which he sustained from a fall after fainting.\u201d This physician did not offer any opinion as to what had caused plaintiff\u2019s condition or how long it had existed, or would continue, except to say that for 2% months the patient \u201chas had a poor appetite\u201d and has not been \u201cable to sleep\u201d and has had \"dizzy spells.\u201d Obviously this report does not controvert the testimony of plaintiff or that of the other 'physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The foregoing includes in substance all the evidence, both oral and documentary, submitted to the acting commissioner. We have recounted it somewhat in detail, for it is our duty to determine whether it furnishes any rational basis for the finding that \u201cthe evidence herein does not establish that claimant\u2019s illness resulted from said conditions, or arose out of his employment.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The record is devoid of the slightest bit of evidence that the hangar had \u201cventilation at the top\u201d; indeed the positive, undisputed testimony is quite the contrary. It is undisputed that plaintiff and other employees were subjected to sulphuric acid fumes in the battery room, without ventilation other than that of an open door into the hangar, unaided by drafts, fans or other means of ventilation, and to gas and oil fumes found elsewhere in. the hangar; that he became ill, fainted, fell, was unconscious for two or three hours, and was sent back to the United States; that no physician in Iceland even attempted to determine the cause of his illness; that the doctors at home found no evidence of permanent pathology and no explanation for his illness other than his working conditions; that when- he was removed from such environment and given proper tonic and stomach medication, he improved and was soon on the road to complete recovery. There is no evidence whatever to controvert any of these facts. It must be concluded, therefore, that, in view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>absence of any pathology at the time he began work, of its presence after some months of work, his continued and constant subjection to carbon monoxide and sulphuric acid fumes, his improvement and recovery after ceasing work and the other facts and circumstances in the record, his illness could have been caused only by his, employment and arose out of the same. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In view of our conclusion, the trial court, on the record submitted, should not have entered judgment for defendant. The judgment is reversed with directions to vacate and set aside the findings and order entered by the Deputy Commissioner and to remand the cause to the latter with instructions to proceed in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion and in accord with law. The costs of -this appeal will be assessed against the defendant-respondents, The Metcalfe-Hamilton Kansas City Bridge Company, a corporation, and The Travelers Insurance Company.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">. The pertinent part of the finding is: \u201cOn said date, while ill in quarters, he fainted and fell on the floor, suffering a fracture of the left lower jaw, rupture of the left ear drum and bruises about the face. * * * he asserts his illness resulted from inhalation of fumes of sulphuric acid in the battery charging room, and fumes from improvised oil heaters in the hangar where he worked, the stovepipes of which extended only eight feet high while the hangar was 100x200 feet and the roof about 40 feet high with ventilation at the- top. The battery charging room was- about 10x12 feet with an 8-foot ceiling, with ventilation through an open doorway; * * * he spent two or three hours a day out in the hangar; * * * the evidence herein does not establish that claimant\u2019s, illness resulted from said conditions, or arose out of his employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
