On or about November 15, 1944, they filed a joint declaration of estimated tax showing no tax to be estimated. On or about September 15, 1945, they filed a joint amended estimate showing an estimated tax of $70,-<em>000.00. On </em>or about November 15, 1945, they filed individual returns showing a total tax from both of them in the sum of $86,939.10. No payments were made on the amended estimate filed on or about September 15, 1945 nor on the final returns filed on or about November 15, 1945, until March 13, 1946. On that date the taxpayers paid the sum of $10,000.00 and thereafter in monthly installments, the last installment being paid September 16, 1946, they paid the remainder of the total taxes of $86,-939.10.'</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">Since the taxpayers failed to pay the estimated tax, the Commissioner added a 5% penalty and an additional 1% each month thereafter until the maximum penalty of 10%, amounting to a total of $7,-000.00, had been reached. The taxpayers filed the petitions with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the resulting deficiency asserting that the 1% monthly additions to the tax, as provided by Section 294(d) (1) (B) for the failure to pay installments of estimated tax declared, were discontinued by the filing of the final income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-25\">Section 294(d) (1) (B) must be construed in connection with other parts of said Section 294, particularly Section 294 (a) (1). For convenience, these two subsections of Section 294 are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number> Section 294(d) (1) (B), like other penal statutes, is to be interpreted liberally in favor of the taxpayer and strictly against the Government. See 50 Am.Jur., Statutes, Section 407, et seq. We can see no reason why the word \u201cunpaid\u201d as used in sub-paragraph (B) should be given any different construction than the words \u201cdue but unpaid\u201d used throughout the preceding sub-paragraph A and also in the final sentence of subparagraph (B). To say that an installment of the estimated tax remains unpaid presupposes a continuing duty to pay such installment. The declaration of estimated tax had served its function when the final return was filed. There was then no longer any uncertainty, and the tax should thereafter be paid on the basis of the final return rather than as estimated. It follows that installments of the estimated tax were then no longer due.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Statutes should be so construed as to be applicable under all conditions and factual situations. As an illustration of their position that the final tax replaces and nullifies any effect of the estimated tax, the taxpayers present a hypothetical situation in which the final return would show no tax due and argue that it would then be patently unreasonable for the Commissioner to continue to add monthly penalties of 1% of the estimated tax.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think the taxpayers\u2019 position is sound and that the penalty for failure to pay installments of estimated tax declared did not continue to increase monthly after the filing of the final return. The decision of the Tax Court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ARX\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 294(d) (1) (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aqeh\">. \u201c294.
