The case was heard by Circuit Judge Kalodner, specially assigned to the district court, who in a careful opinion discussed the evidence at length and concluded that it was not sufficient to support a finding of negligence on the part of the respondent and that the libel should, therefore, be dismissed. 101 F.Supp. 486. We are in full accord with the conclusions of the district court for the reasons well stated by Judge Kalodner in his opinion. We, therefore, cannot hold his findings to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
