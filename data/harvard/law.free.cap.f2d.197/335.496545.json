Here, putting forward four specifications of error, appellant insists that they are well taken, and, because they are, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-25\">We cannot agree. Indeed, we think it plain that, varying in degree from the inexcusably frivolous claim of point A of the first specification, that the proof fails to show that the so-called victim was a woman, to the little less frivolous one, that the woman could not, because of the claimed marriage to defendant, testify against him in the case, all of the claims of error are wanting in substance and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
