The motion was filed five months after appellant\u2019s conviction of assault with intent to commit robbery (D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 22-501) and unauthorized use of automobile (D.GCode (1940) \u00a7 22-2204).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-19\">The alleged newly discovered evidence was designed to show that appellant may have been suffering from a psychiatric condition (psychoneurosis associated with emotional instability) at the time of the offenses of which he was convicted. From our examination of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial. The facts which appellant advanced as newly discovered evidence were within the knowledge of appellant at the time of his trial, and consideration of the various statements and affidavits leaves us unconvinced that in a new trial acquittal would probably result. See Thompson v. United States, 1951, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 235, 188 F.2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
