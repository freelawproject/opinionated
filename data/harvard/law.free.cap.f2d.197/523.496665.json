We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion in this regard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the reasons well stated in the opinion filed by Judge Bard, 93 F.Supp. 115, to which we need add nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
