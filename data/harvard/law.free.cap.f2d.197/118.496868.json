The relator had been indicted in said district for violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1461, 3237. After his arrest in the Eastern District of New York, the relator was brought before a United States Commissioner and upon a hearing was identified as the person indicted in the Alabama court. The Commissioner found probable cause for holding the relator for removal. Immediately thereafter, the latter petitioned the District Court for the Eastern District for a writ of habeas corpus, which was allowed. On November 16, 1951, a hearing was held on the return to the writ which was continued on November 23, 1951. On the latter date the District Court entered an order dismissing the writ. From that order this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">The appeal must be dismissed because of the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253 which reads: \u201cThere shall be no right of appeal from such an order in a proceeding to test the validity of a warrant to remove, to another district or place for commitment or trial, a person charged with a criminal offense against the United States * * See United States ex rel. Hagan v. Kelly, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 1022; Hartman v. Sloan, 3 Cir., 99 F.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
