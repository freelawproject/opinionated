This appeal is from the denial of his petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>in which petition he asserted the same grounds as had been asserted in his motion to vacate the sentence which was denied by the sentencing court</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\"><em> </em>The criminal information in question charged appellant with stealing from a mail box a letter containing a charge-a-plate of a value in excess of $100. Appellant contends that the charge-a-plate was, in fact, of a value less than $100, and that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708, a sentence in excess of one year may not be imposed when the value of the thing taken is less than $100. He alleged that he has completed over one year of imprisonment, and asked that he be released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">By his plea of guilty, appellant admitted the facts alleged in the information. Lindsay v. U. S., 10 Cir., 134 F.2d 960, 962. He cannot now avail himself of a denial of those facts in an effort to secure his release, and the order appealed from is affirmed. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
