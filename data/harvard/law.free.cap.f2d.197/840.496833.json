The plaintiff filed his affidavit which, in the form of a brief, presented plaintiff\u2019s theories of fact and law in opposition thereto, and the matter was fully heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">Thereafter, the district judge, in a lengthy opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> canvassing the facts as they were shown without dispute by the documents filed, summarizing and construing those documents, including the compromise agreement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and dealing fully with the respective theories of plaintiff and defendant, concluded: that there was no genuine issue of fact to be tried; and that on the record made defendant was entitled to judgment for the reason that the claim of the suit had been settled by the compromise and release. So concluding, he gave judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">Appealing from that judgment, plaintiff is here urging, and supporting his urging with a brief of more than 60 pages, that the judgment was wrong and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The appellee in a much briefer brief, insists that the judgment should be affirmed for the reason given by the district judge, and for the added reasons: (1) that the contract on which plaintiff relies for his claim that he was wrongfully discharged expressly excludes him from its coverage; and (2) that the suit was barred by the one, three, and ten year prescriptions, Articles 3534, 3538, and 3544 of the Louisiana Statutes Annotated Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Agreeing, as we do, with the views of the district judge that appellant is prevented by the settlement he made nearly ten years ago from now reurging his claim, we find it unnecessary to consider the other grounds for affirmance put forward by ap-pellee except to say; that the long delay in suing seems inexcusable, except upon the theory that plaintiff knew he had fully settled his claim; and that on the issues of prescription of three and ten years, there is a great deal to be said in favor of ap-pellee\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The judgment was right and it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">. These were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">\u201c(a) The fact that the claim presented hy Plaintiff for adjudication has been definitely and finally settled by a Compromise Agreement entered into by and between the Plaintiff and Defendant herein in the month of December, 1942, in settlement of suit No. 84,515 on the Docket of the First Judicial District Court in the Parish of Caddo, State of Louisiana, entitled Robert L.
