The appeal record has been docketed in this court and the case awaits briefs of the respective counsel. A motion made by appellant for the appointment of counsel on the appeal has caused the court to examine the \u2022 merits of his appeal to determine if the appointment of counsel is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">The gravamen of Garcia\u2019s motion in the district court and the chief issue on the appeal is whether he was coerced into pleading guilty to a charge of second degree murder. In the syndrome of this contention are allegations that his counsel, Goodwin, was negligent and ineffective since he helped to cajole Garcia into pleading guilty, that he was denied a jury trial, that he was insane and not legally responsible for his act, and that he was denied a hearing on the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">The district judge found that Garcia had pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of second-degree murder on the agreement of the United States Attorney not to ask for conviction on the indictment which charged first-degree murder. The court accepted the plea of guilty on June 4, 1951, but not until the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-23\">\u201cThe Court: Have you discussed fully with the Defendant the rights and consequences of his entering such a plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-24\">\u201cMr. Goodwin: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-25\">I have discussed that very fully with him, and advised him of the consequences and what he might expect if he does enter such a plea. I have given him to understand that the Court has the power and would undoubtedly \u2014 I can\u2019t speak for the Court, of course, and he knows that \u2014 that the Court has the power to sentence him to life imprisonment under second degree murder, and, under circumstances, I advised him that the Court would sentence him to the maximum. I am not speaking for the Court, but I have so advised him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-26\">\u201cThe Court: I ask the Defendant, do you understand what your counsel just said'?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-27\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABiX\">\u201cThe Court: You understand that if you plead guilty to this indictment that the Court can impose just as severe a penalty and sentence, and judgment of sentence, upon you as if you stood trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>on a not guilty plea before a jury of twelve jurors, duly impaneled, to try your case and were, by such jury in consideration of the evidence introduced before the jury and in light of the Court\u2019s instructions, found guilty. Do you .understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">\u201cThe Court: In other words, your plea of guilty dispenses with all further trial proceedings except a hearing for the purpose of imposition of judgment and sentence, just the same as if you had already stood trial, and had been convicted by a jury? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201cThe Court: If you should plead guilty, the results that may follow from such a plea of guilty have the same effect and carries with it judgment and sentence just as severe as if you had plead not guilty and had been convicted by a jury after trial before a jury. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Hon- or * * <em>*\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Sentencing was then put over until June 19, when the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">\u201cThe Court: My understanding is that this cause comes now before the Court pursuant to the plea of guilty to second degree murder previously entered by this Defendant in this case, for the purpose of having the Court now impose the judgment of sentence of the Court. Is that the understanding of Plaintiff\u2019s counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\">\u201cMr. Sager: It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-12\">\u201cThe Court: Does the Defendant understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-14\">\u201cThe Court: Are you personally willing now that the Court so proceed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Hon- or * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-16\">\u201cThe Court: It is lawful for the Court to impose a sentence in this case for any term of years or for life of the defendant. Is that the understanding of each side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-17\">\u201cMr. Sager: It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-18\">\u201cMr. Goodwin: That is the understanding of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-19\">\u201cThe Court: Does the Defendant understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-20\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Hon- or * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-21\">At the time of accepting the plea of guilty, the court also had before it a report by a neuropsychiatrist, Otto Schaefer, M.D., who concluded that Garcia was sane at the time of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">Appellant also alleges that he was denied his right to testify in the motion proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. There is not an unqualified right to appear in a motion proceeding. If the records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court need not take any action other than a denial of the motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-23\">Since the record shows so indisputably that Garcia\u2019s contentions lack merit, his appeal is ordered dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
