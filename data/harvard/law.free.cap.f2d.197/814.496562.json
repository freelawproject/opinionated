The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 90 N.L.R.B. 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-23\">With commendable candor respondent's counsel has stated its position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-24\"><em>\u201cWe </em>have controverted the findings of fact of the Board in our Response,, but in all fairness to this Court we are constrained to admit that there is sufficient evidence, even though disputed, upon which to base the Board\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-25\">\u201cOur Contention, therefore, is that the Board\u2019s order should not be enforced by this Court, <em>not because of the insufficiency of evidence, but because the order has been obeyed in all of its provisions and, because of changed conditions not attributable to Respondent\u2019s conduct, the Union does not now represent a majority in this small unit and Respondent should not be required to bargain further with it.\" </em>(Emphasis the respondent\u2019s.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-26\">The Supreme Court has expressly ruled that compliance with an order of the Board does not affect the Board\u2019s right to enforcement, pointing out that the legislative history of the Act indicates that the framers of the Act contemplated \u201cthat there be \u2018immediately available to the Board an existing court decree to serve as a basis for contempt proceedings,\u2019 in the event a renewal of the unfair practice occurs after the enforcement order.\u201d N.L.R.B. v.
