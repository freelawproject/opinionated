Both parties filed briefs and were represented at the hearing. The record reflects testimony of but one witness, he representing the opposer. Several exhibits were received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">Appellee, hereinafter referred to as the applicant, is a corporation doing business as the Empire Manufacturing Company, domiciled at Winder, Georgia. The appellant, hereinafter referred to as opposer, is a corporation doing business as Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx and domiciled at Chicago, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">Under date of September 16, 1947, applicant filed an application for registration of its trade-mark \u201cDixie Leader,\u201d serial No. 534,612, as applied to work clothes, namely, overalls, jumpers, dungarees and shirts. Applicant alleges the date of first use of its mark in interstate commerce as January 15, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">The opposer based its opposition on the ground of its ownership of the mark \u201cDixie Weave\u201d as applied to men\u2019s suits, comprising coats, vests and trousers. That mark was first registered September 5, 1916, and has been regularly renewed with the word \u201cWeave\u201d disclaimed except in connection with the word \u201cDixie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">The mark \u201cDixie Leader\u201d is composite in form. The involved words are in large letters and appear at the top of a rectangular label. Immediately beneath is the slogan \u201cA Sure Bet\u201d which is disclaimed, and below the slogan is a circle containing a picture of the head of a horse. In the background of the label is a scene depicting a race track showing four jockeys astride their horses with one horse several lengths in the lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">According to the specimens filed with the notice of opposition, the trade-mark \u201cDixie Weave\u201d is in smaller type than the words \u201cHart Schaffner &amp; Marx\u201d on the label used on the product manufactured by the opposer. The record also shows that the fabric used in the opposer\u2019s product is of a porous weave and light in weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">There is no dispute but that the opposer is the prior user and the only issue here, as was true before the tribunals of the Patent Office, is whether the mark sought to be registered by applicant bears such a resemblance to the mark of the opposer as to be likely, when applied to the involved goods, to cause confusion or deception of the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The Examiner of Interferences, in sustaining the opposition, held that in the composite mark the notation \u201cDixie Leader\u201d' was clearly the dominant feature of the applicant\u2019s mark and was the 'feature upon which purchasers would rely in identifying applicant\u2019s goods. He was also of the opinion that although there are specific differences between the articles of apparel involved herein, the similarity between \u201cDixie Leader\u201d and \u201cDixie Weave\" is such that the concurrent use by the parties of their marks is likely to cause confusion or deception as to the origin of the goods of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The commissioner, in reversing the decision of the examiner, held that the word \u201cDixie\u201d is not, as contended by counsel for the opposer, the dominant part of either mark; that although the goods of the respective parties belong to the same general class of merchandise, there is a well-recognized difference between the two. He further held that the involved marks should be considered in their entireties and that the meaning inherent in each should not be ignored. He thus concluded that confusion as to the origin of the goods of the parties would not be likely to arise in the mind of the average customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In its notice of appeal to this court, op-poser sets out eighteen assignments of error, each of which has been given careful consideration. The cases cited by counsel for both parties have also been examined but, in our opinion, none of them are applicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The only issue here, as below, is whether . concurrent use of the two marks upon the respective goods of the parties would be likely to cause confusion or deception as to origin in tile mind of the purchasing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">It is obvious, of course, that the word \u201cDixie\u201d is common to. both marks but, in our opinion, there the resemblance ceases. The word \u201cWeave\u201d certainly does not look like the word \u201cLeader\u201d; neither do the two words sound alike nor do they have the remotest similarity in meaning. Ostensibly, the opposer intended to describe the character of its material, whereas the applicant presumably attempted to give his product a laudatory description.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">While it is true the involved goods are in the same general category of merchandise, we believe there is a distinct difference between light-weight and porous weave coats, vests and trousers obviously designed for dress purposes and those clothes designed for work purposes, namely, overalls, jumpers, dungarees and shirts. Although the single witness stated that the opposer also sold shirts and jumpers, there is no evidence that such goods were ever sold under the mark \u201cDixie Weave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The opposer contends that since the word \u201cWeave\u201d has been disclaimed, it is thus left with only the word \u201cDixie\u201d and. therefore that to permit the registration of the mark \u201cDixie Leader\u201d would be injurious to opposer. Such contention is, in our opinion, untenable. The word \u201cDixie\u201d is certainly not susceptible of exclusive appropriation. It is a term generally used to indicate the southern part of the United States and as such belongs in the public domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Since we do not believe the involved marks look alike, sound alike, or have the same meaning, we are of the opinion that their concurrent use on the respective goods of the parties would not be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the purchasing public; therefore, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">O\u2019CONNELL, J., dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
