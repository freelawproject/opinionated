The appellant is confined in the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri, under a sentence of imprisonment imposed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on January 2, 1942. The appellant\u2019s petition for a writ failed to show that he had applied to the court which <em>sentenced </em>him for <em>the vacation </em>of his sentence, under \u00a7 2255, Title 28, U.S.C.A. It was upon that ground that his petition was denied by the District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The petition was properly denied, since by the provisions of \u00a7 2255 the District Court was without authority to entertain the petition. See Higgins v. Steele, 8 Cir., 195 F.2d 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-20\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
