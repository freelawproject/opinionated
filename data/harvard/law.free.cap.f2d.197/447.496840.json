L. R. B. v. Barrett Co., 7 Cir., 120 F.2d 583, 586, that it is \u201cthe Board\u2019s right (as well as its duty) to investigate, and in the course of its investigation, if need be, to issue subpoenas before it files a complaint\u201d. So pointing, it insists that the order appealed from finds no support in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">The appellee does not see the matter as the Board does. Taking no issue with the Board\u2019s position, that the district judge erred in holding that \u201csubpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>may not be issued by the Regional Director until after the filing of a complaint\u201d, appellee puts forward in support of the ruling below the claim that the procedure employed in the issuance of the subpoena violated Sec. 1002(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 1005(c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the- Administrative Procedure Act, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq. As appellee states it in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201cIt is submitted that the Board may create by appropriate regulation under the terms of the National Labor Relations Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, an informal pre-hear-ing or pre-trial procedure. It is submitted further that under certain circumstances it is conceivable that the Board may provide by regulation for the issuance of certain subpoenas in connection with such matters. Whatever the legal authority of the Board may be it may not exercise it until it has implemented the authority by valid and appropriate regulations promulgated in accordance with the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act. It has not done so. Insofar as the type of procedure involved in this appeal and use of subpoenas to implement it, the Board has not adopted such appropriate Rules and Regulations as would authorize either the procedure apparently here contemplated or the use of subpoenas implementing such procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cThe gravamen of the Appellant\u2019s position is that it implies from its present published regulations some inherent power to hold a pre-trial hearing; to require a prospective respondent in an unfair labor practice complaint to be subjected by subpoena, administratively issued by the prospective moving party in the unfair labor practice action, to submit himself to full questioning; to submit his records and books which in turn may be impounded; to permit full examination and disclosure of an ultimate position in litigation the issues of which have not been formulated. This apparent procedure is without the reservation of right of cross-examination, the right of representation by Counsel, or any of the other Constitutional rights contemplated by the Constitution of the United States and implemented by the Congress in adopting the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">We cannot agree with these views. Indeed, we find no basis for them in either the Administrative Procedure Act or the Labor Management Act. We cannot find, in the enforcement of subpoena process in investigatory proceedings, any basis for the imagined fears of appellee that Constitutional rights will thereby be invaded and trampled upon. Neither can we agree with appellee\u2019s view that the Rules and Regulations, on which the Board relies, do not provide for, or authorize the issuance of, the subpoena in question here. We are, on the contrary, of the clear opinion that, by the express terms of the Statute, supplemented by its Rules and Regulations, the Board was authorized to proceed, as it has done, and that, in holding as he did that the subpoena was not enforcible because issued without authority of law, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">This is not to say that the subpoena must be enforced precisely according to its terms and without modification. If it appears to the court that it is too broadly or oppressively drawn, or that it will be enforced capriciously or oppressively, or if, as claimed by appellee, the Board, because of non-compliance by the charging union, is prohibited from taking cognizance of its charges, the court will, of course, proceed as seems right and just. These questions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>however, go to, they affect the merits of, the subpoena. These, because of the action of the district judge, in denying enforcement for want of power in the Board to issue the subpoena, are not now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The order appealed from is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\">.
