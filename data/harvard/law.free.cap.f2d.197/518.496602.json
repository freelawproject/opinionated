The Tax Court held that, without further evidence, the taxpayers had failed to sustain the burden of proving that they furnished more than half of the amount expended for the support of those children. That holding is not inconsistent with the estimate of the Commissioner, approved by the Tax Court, that the taxpayers should be charged with $75.00 per week as cash withdrawals from the business for living expenses. Out of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>$75.00 per week had to come not only the living expenses of taxpayers, but also their contributions to the support of their two grandchildren. We cannot say that the Tax Court was clearly wrong in holding that such contributions were not proved to be more than half of the grandchildren\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The decision of the Tax Court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
