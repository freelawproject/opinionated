He has amassed significant evidence that Alabama's current lethal-injection protocol will result in intolerable and needless agony, and he has proposed an alternative-death by firing squad. The Court of Appeals, without considering any of the evidence regarding the risk posed by the current protocol, denied Arthur's claim because Alabama law does not expressly permit execution by firing squad, and so it cannot be a \"known and available\" alternative under\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   . Because this decision permits States to immunize their methods of execution-no matter how cruel or how unusual-from judicial review and thus permits state law to subvert the Federal Constitution, I would grant certiorari and reverse.

Only then did States turn to midazolam, the drug at the center of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Midazolam, like Valium and Xanax, belongs to a class of medicines known as benzodiazepines and has some anesthetic effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2782-2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). Generally, anesthetics can cause a level of sedation and depression of electrical brain activity sufficient to block\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   sensation, including pain. App. to Pet. for Cert. 283a-290a. But it is not clear that midazolam adequately serves this purpose. This is because midazolam, unlike barbiturates such as pentobarbital, has no analgesic-pain-relieving-effects.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 307a; see also\n   <em>\n    Glossip,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2782-2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). Thus, \"for midazolam to maintain unconsciousness through application of a particular stimulus, it would need to depress electrical activity\n   <em>\n    to a deeper level\n   </em>\n   than would be required of, for example, pentobarbital.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 307a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although it can be used to render individuals unconscious, midazolam is not used on its own to\n   <em>\n    maintain\n   </em>\n   anesthesia -complete obliviousness to physical sensation-in surgical procedures, and indeed, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved the drug for this purpose.\n   <em>\n    Glossip,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2782-2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Like the experts in\n   <em>\n    Glossip,\n   </em>\n   the experts in this case agree that midazolam is subject to a ceiling effect, which means that\n   there is a point at which increasing the dose of the drug does not result in any greater effect.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . The main dispute with respect to midazolam relates to how this ceiling effect operates-if the ceiling on midazolam's sedative effect is reached before complete unconsciousness can be achieved, it may be incapable of keeping individuals insensate to the extreme pain and discomfort associated with administration of the second and third drugs in lethal-injection protocols.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the horrific execution of Clayton Lockett, who, notwithstanding administration of midazolam, awoke during his execution and appeared to be in great pain, we agreed to hear the case of death row inmates seeking to avoid the same fate.

The State's capital punishment statute delegates the task of prescribing the drugs necessary to compound a lethal injection to the Department of Corrections. \u00a7 15-18-82.1(f). Consistent with the practice in other States following the national shortage of sodium thiopental and pentobarbital, the department has adopted a protocol involving the same three drugs considered in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   .

First, Arthur asserted a\n   <em>\n    facial\n   </em>\n   challenge, arguing that midazolam is generally incapable of performing as intended during Alabama's three-drug lethal-injection procedure. Second, Arthur asserted an\n   <em>\n    as-applied\n   </em>\n   challenge, arguing that because of his individual health attributes, midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain for him during the procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The District Court considered these two claims separately. With respect to the facial challenge, the District Court ordered bifurcated proceedings, with the first hearing limited to the availability of a feasible alternative method of execution. App. to Pet. for Cert\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   189a, and n. 2. Arthur's initial complaint proposed a single dose either of pentobarbital or sodium thiopental rather than a three-drug protocol, but the District Court found that those methods were unavailable given the elimination of both drugs from the domestic market.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 203a-205a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Arthur then moved to amend his complaint to allege the firing squad as an alternative method of execution. The District Court denied the motion, holding that \"execution by firing squad is not permitted by statute and, therefore, is not a method of execution that could be considered either feasible or readily implemented by Alabama at this time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 241a. Because Arthur's claim failed on this ground, the court never considered Arthur's evidence with respect to midazolam, despite later observing that it was \"impressive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 166a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In a separate order, the District Court considered Arthur's as-applied challenge. Arthur alleged, based on the expert opinion of Dr. Jack Strader, that \"his cardiovascular issues, combined with his age and emotional makeup, create a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain that will result in a violation of the Eighth Amendment if he is executed under the [midazolam] protocol.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 151a. Echoing its rationale with respect to Arthur's facial challenge, the District Court found that Arthur failed to prove the existence of a feasible, readily available alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court then turned to the question it had avoided in the facial challenge: whether Alabama's lethal-injection protocol created a risk of serious illness or needless suffering. But because the District Court considered the question as part of Arthur's as-applied challenge, it focused on the protocol as applied to Arthur's personal physical condition. The court rejected Dr. Strader's opinion that the dose of midazolam required by Alabama's protocol \"will likely induce a rapid and dangerous reduction in blood pressure more quickly than it results in sedation,\" and that during this time gap, Arthur-whom he believed to suffer from heart disease -would suffer a painful heart attack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 169a. Because Dr. Strader's experience was limited to\n   <em>\n    clinical\n   </em>\n   doses of midazolam, which typically range from 2 to 5 mg, the court concluded that he had no basis to extrapolate his experience to non-clinical,\n   <em>\n    lethal\n   </em>\n   doses, such as the 500-mg bolus required by Alabama's lethal-injection protocol.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 177a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The District Court expressly refused to consider the expert opinions that Arthur proffered as part of his facial challenge, noting that they \"are untested in court, due to Arthur's inability to provide a[n alternative] remedy in his facial, and now as-applied, challenges.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 167a, n. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The District Court therefore concluded that Arthur failed to meet the\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   standard and entered judgment in favor of the State. App. to Pet. for Cert. 238a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. In a 111-page slip opinion issued the day before Arthur's scheduled execution, the court first found that \"Arthur never showed Alabama's current lethal injection protocol,\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   or as applied to him, violates the Constitution.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n    840 F.3d, at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court based this finding on Arthur's failure to \"satisfy the first [\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ] prong as to midazolam\" as part of his as-applied challenge,\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   and the fact that this Court \"upheld the midazolam-based execution protocol\" in A\n   <em>\n    rthur,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175951\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1268/#p1272\">\n    840 F.3d, at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the District Court, the Eleventh Circuit\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   considered the evidence Arthur introduced in support of his facial challenge to the protocol.

The court used the District Court's finding that Arthur failed to meet this prong with respect to his\n   <em>\n    as-applied\n   </em>\n   challenge to hold that Arthur's\n   <em>\n    facial\n   </em>\n   challenge likewise failed. But it is undisputed that Arthur put forth \"impressive\" evidence to support his facial challenge that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals considered. This evidence included the expert testimony of Dr. Alan Kaye, chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences Center, who found the dose of midazolam prescribed in Alabama's protocol insufficient to \"cure ... the\n   <em>\n    fundamental unsuitability\n   </em>\n   of midazolam as the first drug in [Alabama's lethal-injection] protocol.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   App. to Pet. for Cert. 302a (emphasis added).

Sarat, Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America's Death Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) (calculating that while 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection between 1900 and 2010 were \"botched,\" none of the 34 executions by firing squad had been).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Chief Justice Warren famously wrote that \"[t]he basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man.\"\n   <em>\n    Trop,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161306\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/86/#p101\">\n    356 U.S., at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161306\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/86/#p101\">\n    78 S.Ct. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion). States have designed lethal-injection protocols with a view toward protecting their own dignity, but they should not be permitted to shield the true horror of executions from official and public view. Condemned prisoners, like Arthur, might find more dignity in an instantaneous death rather than prolonged torture on a medical gurney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To be clear, this is not a matter of permitting inmates to choose the manner of death that best suits their desires. It is a matter of permitting a death row inmate to make the showing\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   requires in order to prove that the Constitution demands something less cruel and less unusual than what the State has offered. Having met the challenge set forth in\n   <em>\n    Glossip,\n   </em>\n   Arthur deserves the opportunity to have his claim fairly reviewed in court.

If\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    of the specified methods-lethal injection\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    electrocution-is declared unconstitutional, the statute authorizes the State to execute prisoners by \"\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    constitutional method of execution.\" Ala.Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1(c) (2016) (emphasis added). The state statute thus permits exactly what the Court required in\n    <em>\n     Glossip\n    </em>\n    -if a condemned prisoner can prove that the lethal-injection protocol presents an unconstitutional risk of needless suffering, he may propose an alternative, constitutional means of execution, which may include the firing squad.
