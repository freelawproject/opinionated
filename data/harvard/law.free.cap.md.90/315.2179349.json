The question asked in the second bill of exceptions was as follows : \u201c Now I ask you, with this knowledge of this accident as thus narrated by this witness in your presence on the witness stand, was or was not this accident a sufficient or insufficient cause to produce any of these conditions that upon your examination on February 23rd, 1897, you discovered in the patient, and if yea, state whether or not the condition that you found this patient in on February 23rd, 1897,'was or was not a natural and probable result of the accident as you have heard it described ?\u201d The question asked in the fourth bill of exceptions was as follows : \u201c As a medical expert, can you state whether or not the deafness of -the plaintiff in his left ear, as testified to in this case in your presence, was or was not a natural and probable result of the accident?\u201d The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $3,000.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b356-5\">The cause was argued before McSherry, C.

Mr. Chitty, in his work on Pleading, vol. 1, page 147, says: \u201cIf the injury arises from the want of care or negligence of the servant, case is the remedy, but if it occurred as the necessary, probable or natural consequence of the act ordered by the master, then the act is the master\u2019s, and he should be sued in trespass (if the act were forcible and immediate\u201d). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>leading cases to which we have been referred also sustain this view. In <em>Sharrod </em>v. <em>The London and North Western Railway Company, 4 </em>Exchequer, 584, Baron Parke, thus states the rule : &lt;! Whenever the injury done to the plaintiff results from the immediate force of the defendant himself, whether intentionally or not, the plaintiff may bring an action of trespass ; on the other hand, that if the act be that of the servant and be negligent not wilful, case is the only remedy against the master, unless the act was done by his command.\u201d The following cases sustain this position: <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>18 Vt. 605 ; <em>McAllister v. Hammond, </em>6 Cowen, 342; <em>Broughton </em>v. <em>Whallin, </em>8 Wend. 474; <em>Mc-Manus </em>v. <em>Crickett, </em>1 East. 106; <em>Morly v. Gaisford, </em>2 H. Bl. 442 ; <em>Ogle v. Barnes, </em>8 Term Rep. 190; <em>Huggert </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>2 Bos. &amp; Pul. N. R. 446; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Sheppard, 1 </em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 797 ; 1 <em>Poe Pl. &amp; Pr., </em>161.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">It is quite certain, we think, that an action for a personal injury resulting from negligence or the want of due care, as the case at bar, is not of the same class as actions for \u201c assault, battery and wounding,\u201d and not therefore within that part of the statute prescribing one year as the period of limitation. The Supreme Court of Minnesota in passing upon the same question in the recent case of <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Great Northern Ry. Co., </em>70 Minn. 50 (72 N. W. Rep. 833), says in effect: It may be true that every personal inj ury committed through negligence, but unintentionally, is a battery, within the very broad common law definition. But it does not follow that the word \u201cbattery\u201d is to be construed so as to include \u201cpersonal injury\u201d actions or that it is to be defined according to the common law. Such a construction has never been suggested to our knowledge prior to this time. But the action for a battery, within the two years\u2019 limitation, mentioned in the Act, has admittedly been the action founded upon an intentionally administered injury to the person\u2014such an injury as could be made the basis of a criminal prosecution and not that which resulted from the want of due care. Personal injury, cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>are not of the same genus or class as the actions for a battery, as that action is provided for in section 8, and never have been. In no respect are they within the rule of <em>ejus-. dum generis </em>as applied to an action for a battery. There was no error, then, in sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the second and third pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">At the trial of the case, the appellant reserved seven exceptions ; six to the admissibility of evidence and one to the plaintiff\u2019s prayers. The prayers offered on both sides appear to have been granted. We will pass on the exceptions in their regular order, as they form the basis of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The first, second and third exceptions are substantially the same and relate to questions asked the medical witnesses as to whether the deafness of the plaintiff in the left ear was the natural and probable result of the accident. There was no dispute in this case as to the accident or that the injury was the result of the accident, but the contention was over the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The Supreme Court in <em>Scheffer </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>105 U. S. 249, in passing upon a case involving the question of proximate and the remote causes of a wrong, said : \u201c It is admitted that the rule is difficult. But it is generally held that in order to warrant a finding that negligence or an act not amounting to wanton w'rong is the proximate cause of an injury, it must appear that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of the negligence or wrongful act and that it ought to have been foreseen in the 'light of the attending circumstances.\u201d' <em>Milwaukee and St. Paul R. Co. </em>v. <em>Kellog, </em>94 U. S. 475 ; <em>Hoag </em>v. <em>Lake Shore R. Co., </em>85 Pa. St. 293 ; <em>B. C. P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>61 Md. 74\u201478 ; <em>Mayne on Damages, </em>15.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Nor do we find any serious objection to the form of the questions asked in these exceptions or the testimony given by the expert witnesses. In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>State, </em>38 Md. 41, this Court held, where an expert witness had heard the examining physician describe fully the nature and character of the injuries and had heard other witnesses describe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>construction and condition of the sink, it was competent for him to say whether such injuries were likely to have been occasioned by the accidentally falling into the sink. In <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Town of </em>Strafford, 50 Vt. 727, the Court said; \u201cWhere an expert hears or reads the evidence, there is no reason why he may not form as correct a judgment based upon such evidence, assuming it to be true, as if the same evidence was submitted to him in the form of hypothetical questions ; and it would seem to be an idle and useless ceremony to require evidence with which he is already familiar to be repeated to him in that form.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b360-10\">(Decided January 9th, 1900).</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In the case at bar, the experts simply based their opinions upon the facts given in evidence that were not disputed. This was competent evidence and clearly within the rule under the circumstances, 1 <em>Greenleaf Evidence, </em>400, 440 ; 1 <em>Wharton Evidence, </em>440; 1 <em>Phil. Evidence, </em>778; <em>Spring Co. </em>v. <em>Edgar, </em>99 U. S. 645 ; <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>121 Ill. 387 <em>; Tingley </em>v. <em>Cowgill, </em>48 Mo. 298 ; <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>126 Mass. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The ruling in the fourth exception was entirely correct. The cross-examination of Dr. Atkinson had been upon a matter wholly collateral and irrelevant to the issue and evidence was not afterwards admissible to contradict his testimony. <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>61 Md. 105 ; I <em>Greenleaf Evidence, </em>sec. 449; 2 <em>Poe Pl. &amp; Pr., </em>280. The case of <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>76 Md. 392, relied upon by the appellant has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The objection to the evidence offered in the fifth and sixth exceptions was also properly sustained. The questions had, in effect, been previously answered, and there was no necessity for repeating the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We have carefully examined all the exceptions and find no error which would justify a reversal of the judgment. We do not understand the law enunciated by the prayers to be questioned. Finding no reversible error, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
