By the return to the writ, it appears that the property replevied was appraised at six hundred and fifty dollars. The plaintiff filed his count or declaration ; to which the defendant pleaded property in himself and not in the plaintiff and issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was thereupon joined. On the trial the jury found for the plaintiff with six cents damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">Upon the return of the postea, <em>H. W.

Dig. </em>466. <em>art. </em>2; <em>Id. </em>540, <em>art. </em>21; 12 <em>Wend. </em>38 ; 18 <em>Id. </em>658.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The opinion of the Court, was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b118-8\">Hoknblower, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A72\">The first section of the act to prevent suits under a certain sum being brought in the Supreme Court, passed the 6th Nov. 1797, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>541, enacts, that if in any suit <em>instituted </em>in the Supreme Court, the plaintiff shall not recover above two hundred dollars, he shall not be entitled to costs; and by the second section of the act regulating actions of replevin, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>466, provision is made for prosecuting such suits in the court of Common Pleas. Hence it is argued, that as the plaintiff recovered only <em>six cents damages, </em>he can have no costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The New York decisions cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Green, 18 Wend. </em>654; <em>and Rogers </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>38, have no application to the question, as it arises under our statutes. The statutes of that state referred to in those cases, although they give no more <em>costs </em>than <em>damages, </em>provide, in case of a verdict for the plaintiff in replevin, that the jury shall assess the <em>value </em>of the goods or property in question, to the end that the court may know how to give judgment in relation to the matter of costs. Accordingly in one of those cases, in which the jury had found a verdict for the plaintiff with <em>six cents </em>damages, and assessed the value of the goods at a larger sum, the court said, the value of the goods as assessed by the jury, must be the criterion whether the plaintiff should have costs or not; and that the nominal damages for the trespass were not the <em>damages </em>intended by the legislature, as determining that question. We must therefore arrive at a decision in this case, by a just construction of our own statutes, considered in reference to this peculiar form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The first section of our act concerning costs, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>173, like the statute of Gloucester, gives costs in all the actions embraced therein, and the action of replevin is one of them, in case the plaintiff recovers, <em>damages, </em>without regard to the amount. Then clearly, by that statute, the plaintiff would be. entitled to his costs in this case. But then comes the act above cited, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>540, declaring, that a plaintiff in this court, shall not have costs, unless he recovers above two hundred dollars. The real question then is, what did the plaintiff recover in this case ? If he recovered only the <em>six cents </em>damages, he cannot have costs. But the action was not brought to recover damages merely j they were only incidental to the real matter in dispute. The writ was issued to recover the vessel, with her sails and rigging. By the writ the plaintiff got possession of the property, but he could not retain it, unless he established his right to it. The action then was really brought to recover his vessel. It was a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>and the question of costs under our statute, if we give it a fair and equitable construction, must depend on the value of the property. It is true, the statute speaks of <em>dollars </em>\u2014 the plaintiff must recover <em>above two hundred dollars; </em>but what, in reason and common sense, is the difference between two hundred dollars <em>in money, </em>and property of the same value <em>\u2022 qui hceret in litera, luBret in cor tice. </em>The object of the legislature was, to prevent trifling suits being brought into the Supreme Court. But if we adhere to the letter of the statute, we must deny costs to a plaintiff <em>in replevin, </em>unless in addition to the property, he recovers above two hundred dollars <em>damages, </em>for the taking &lt;fec. A plaintiff then, who seeks in this way to recover property worth five hundred or one thousand dollars or more, must go into an inferior court, or pay his own costs if he does not recover above two hundred dollars damages, for the taking &amp;c. an amount of damages that is seldom sustained in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In my opinion then, the question of costs must depend upon the value of the property in dispute. By the sheriff\u2019s return, which appears of record, the property was worth much more than two hundred dollars. But I do not consider this conclusive on the defendant. The value of the property may be inquired into here, for the purpose of settling the question of costs. But we must presume the sheriff\u2019s appraisal to be correct, until the contrary is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>shown ; and it is not pretended in this case, that the property was of less value than two hundred dollars. Let judgment therefore be entered for the plaintiff, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\n<em>Judgment ctccordihgly.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Cited <em>in Dickerson </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>4 <em>Vr. </em>362; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Chambers, 1 Zab. </em>622.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
