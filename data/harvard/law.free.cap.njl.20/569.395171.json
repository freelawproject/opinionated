Wright and William Potts, administrators of Edward W. Potts, deceased. A scire facias was subsequently issued, and an award of execution obtained. The present action is in debt upon the judgment, after award of execution. The declaration contains two counts. The first is in the ordinary form of debt upon judgment, with a suggestion of a <em>devastavit </em>by the administrators. The second, in like form, further sets out the issuing of a <em>fieri </em>facias, a return of <em>nulla bona </em>by the sheriff; and that the administrators had eloigned and wasted the goods of their intestate, and then likewise suggests a <em>devastavit </em>in the usual form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-12\">To, this declaration, <em>William Potts, </em>one of the defendants, pleaded several pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-13\">1st. <em>Actio non, </em>because he says, that he did not, nor did his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>co-administrator eloign, waste, convert or dispose of, to his own nse, or to the use of either of them, any of the goods and chattels of the said Edward W.

Wright) \u2014 made application to the Orphans\u2019 Court of the, county of Hunterdon, representing that the personal and real estate of the said deceased was insufficient to pay his debts, according to the 3d section of the act entitled \u201c an act concerning the estates of persons who die insolvent,\u201d passed the 12th June, 1820 ; and hath proceeded and is proceeding, according to the directions of said last mentioned act, in the fair and just settlement of the estate of the said intestate, without having eloigned, wasted or disposed of to his own use any of the goods and chattels of the said intestate which have come to the hands of this defendant, (or to tiie hands of his co-administrator while he remained administrator), to be administered, as in the. said declaration is alleged. The plea concludeswith a verification</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">3rd. Because he says, upon his application as administrator as aforesaid, made in duo form of law to the Orphans\u2019 Court of the county of Hunterdon, (the act to erect the county of Mercer not then having been passed), representing that the personal and real estate of the said deceased was insufficient to pay his debts, such proceedings were tlten and there had, that the said Orphans\u2019 Court, at (he term of February, 1837, did order and direct the defendant to give public notice to the creditors of the said intestate, to exhibit to this defendant under oath or affirmation their claims and demands against the said estate within six months; and the said defendant avers that lie gave public notice, pursuant \u00bfo the order of the said Orphans\u2019 Court; that the said plaintiff did not exhibit within the space of six months from the making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of the aforesaid order, nor hath she at any time exhibited to this defendant, her claim against the estate of the said <em>E.

It only relates to what came to the hands of William Potts, and does not apply to what may have come to the hands of his co-administrator. Also because it does not aver that they had fully administered; nor does it allege that they had not, at the time of the commencement of this suit, any goods and chattels, &amp;c. See <em>Story\u2019s Plead, </em>454, 425. 2 <em>Wms. Saund. R. </em>216, <em>note </em>1. Further, material facts are alleged without any statement of time or place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-8\">The <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>pleas are also defective. They do not aver that application was made to the Orphans\u2019 Court before judgment was recovered against the administrators. In both pleas material and new matter, on which the defence rests, is averred without any allegation of time or place. Though in the third plea, the time of making the order by the Orphans\u2019 Court is set out, yet in neither plea is there any averment of the time of making the application. Such application must be made before judgment, or it forms no defence. Elm. <em>Dig. </em>171, \u00a7 12. 1 <em>Spenc.

The <em>quo modo </em>must therefore be averred, in order that the court may judge of its sufficiency. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>4 <em>Day\u2019s Rep. </em>313, 322, 323. <em>Ridg</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>way </em>v. <em>Forsyth, 2 Halst. </em>98. <em>Phillips </em>v.

I am aware of the doubts lately thrown over this rule in England, by the learned note to the case of <em>Hinde </em>v. <em>Gray. </em>1 <em>Mann, &amp; Gran. </em>201, 39 <em>E. C. L. </em>416. See also the remarks of <em>Parke B. </em>in <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>10 <em>Mees. </em>&amp; <em>Welsb. </em>735, and of <em>Tindal C. J. </em>in <em>Corrigal </em>v. <em>London Railway, </em>5 <em>Mann. </em>&amp; <em>Gran. </em>244. Perhaps the rule is now too well setded to be readily disturbed. It is a point, however, not necessarily drawn in question in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s declaration contains two counts. The first sets out the former judgment, obtained by the plaintiff against the defendants as administrators, the award of execution, upon scire facias ; and then suggests a devastavit. In the second, |the plaintiff states the judgment, the award of execution, the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>and the return <em>nulla bona </em>of the sheriff, the further return that the defendants had eloigned, wasted, and converted to their own use the goods and chattels of the decedent; and then likewise as before, suggests a dqvastavit. As on demurrer the court will consider the whole record, and will go back to the first error in pleading, our attention has been called to the first count in the declaration as defective, in not showing any <em>fi. fa. </em>issued or any return <em>nulla bona </em>by the sheriff. But that count appears to have been drawn from established precedents, and I think it sufficient. This action may be brought on the judgment, upon a bare suggestion of a <em>devastavit, </em>without any writ of <em>fieri facias </em>first taken out upon the judgment. It was so brought and sustained in the case of <em>Wheatly v. Lane, </em>1 <em>Saund. R. </em>216. Although usual, and highly expedient, for the plaintiff to proceed upon a return by the sheriff, which, as will be seen presently, is <em>prima facie </em>proof of waste by an executor or administrator, yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>such mode of declaring is not indispensable. Probably, to sustain the first count, the plaintiff would be under the necessity of proving actual waste and conversion by the administrators; and the plaintiff, in that count, having put herself on matter <em>in pais, </em>I am inclined to believe such proof to be necessary, yet if she do so, the count and the proof will be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The plaintiff maintains that the first plea is not good in substance, because, as alleged, it is an attempt to put in issue matter not traversable ; matter of inference, which the defendants are not permitted to deny. That, the plaintiff having recovered a judgment against the defendants, in which there had been no plea of <em>plene. administrauil </em>either pleaded or sustained, the defendants are concluded by that judgment. That they cannot be permitted to set up a plea in this action, which, admitting the judgment, would go to discharge them of the liability so fastened upon them. It is true that the defendants are concluded by such judgment from denying assets. A judgment against an executor or administrator, whether by default or on demurrer, or upon any plea except <em>plene administravit, </em>or assets to a certain amount and <em>riens </em>ultra, is conclusive upon him that he has assets to satisfy such judgment. See Howell\u2019s, <em>adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Potts\u2019 adm\u2019rs. </em>1 <em>Spenc. 4. Haines </em>v. Price, <em>executor of Price, </em>1 <em>Ib. </em>480. Such executor or administrator will therefore be ultimately liable to discharge such judgment, and may be made personally liable, if assets of the decedent cannot be found and the debt thus satisfied. Having admitted assets in his possession, he cannot escape this ultimate liability. But it does not thence follow, that the suggestion or allegation, that the executor or administrator has eloigned and wasted the assets of the decedent, may not be traversed. The eioignrnent, waste and conversion of the assets are material allegations, by which the personal liability of the executor is to be fixed. Though the judgment is conclusive evidence of assets, yet it is by no means evidence, and much less conclusive evidence, of the alleged waste and conversion. The executor may be made personally liable, yet it is only on failure of the judgment creditor to obtain satisfaction from the assets of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Neither is the return of the sheriff conclusive. The return of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the sheriff\u2019 comes in the place of the <em>scire fieri </em>inquiry, and the executor or administrator may traverse the devastavit, whether it be found by the inquisition or returned by the sheriff. The traverse that may be taken to the inquisition found, and the defence which may be set up, in debt on judgment against an executor upon a <em>devastavit </em>returned by the sheriff, rest on the same ground. <em>Nil debet </em>or <em>not guilty </em>may be pleaded ; according to the well settled authorities on this subject, either is a good plea. 1\u2019t has been lately ruled in the Hudson Circuit Court, by the Chief Justice, on demurrer, that not guility is a good plea in debt on judgment suggesting a <em>devastavit. </em>The judgment is but inducement ; the matter of fact, viz : the devastavit, is the foundation of the action. <em>Coppin v. Carter, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>462. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Consatt, </em>2 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">An executor or administrator cannot in such case \u00a1dead any plea which puts the defence upon want of assets, for such plea would be contrary to what is admitted by the judgment; nor can his proof be inconsistent with such conclusive admission. He cannot plead <em>plene </em>adminisiravit, because assets are admitted by the previous judgment obtained against him ; but his persona! liability depending upon the truth of the suggestion, that lie has eloigned, wasted and converted to his own use the assets of the decedent, admitted to have been in his hands, that suggestion, whether founded on the sheriff\u2019s return, or resting simply on matter <em>in pais, </em>becomes material and may be controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">On the second count, which sets out the <em>fieri facias </em>and a <em>devastavit </em>returned by the sheriff, the judgment and return, says .Sergeant Williams, 1 <em>Wms. Saund. </em>337, <em>note </em>1, are almost conclusive evidence. In <em>Leonard v. Simpson, 2 f\u00edingh. </em>A. <em>C. </em>176. 29 <em>E. C. L. 297, </em>the production of (ho judgment and of a <em>testatum ji.fa.% </em>upon which the sheriff had returned <em>nulla bona testatoris </em>and a levy of costs, <em>de bonis pr opr ids, </em>was hold, being unanswered, sufficient evidence of a <em>devastavit. </em>:: In reason and good sense,\u201d says Chief Justice Tindai, in the case just cited., \" very little evidence ought to be necessary for that purpose. It is his, (the executor\u2019s), duty when called upon by notice, or by a writ of execution, either to satisfy the debt out of the moneys of the testator, or to show the assets to the sheriff, that he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>make the debt out of them; and accordingly, very slender evidence has at all times been held to be sufficient to prove the devastavit. The issuing of a writ of <em>fi. fa., </em>directed to the sheriff of the county where the action was laid, and a return <em>nulla bona </em>thereto, has, for a long time past, been deemed evidence enough.\u201d Whatever evidence, therefore, may be necessary <em>on </em>the part of the plaintiff, to sustain the first count in this action, on the second the above evidence would <em>prima facie </em>be sufficient, and entitle her to a verdict on a plea of not guilty to the devastavit, it is not necessary to say, what proof would be sufficient to rebut' such <em>prima facie </em>case made by the plaintiff, though it is said, \u201c if the sheriff should return, that there were no goods, the defendant may prove that there were, and that he showed them to the sheriff.\u201d 1 <em>Wms. Saund. </em>219, <em>C. note </em>7. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>cited <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">I have gone thus far into this subject, as necessary to a full understanding of this point, and to show on what ground a plea, denying the suggestion of a <em>devastavit, </em>is good and may be sustained. The plea in the present case, although it is not strictly speaking a plea of not guilty, yet directly denies and traverses (except so far as will be presently noted, and therein it is defective,) the suggestion of the plaintiff and is sufficient. It is in the nature of a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">It is hardly necessary to notice some of the causes of demurrer to this plea, assigned and urged on the part of the plaintiff. Although no time and place are alleged, yet his plea in this respect is sufficient. Being a mere negative averment,the general rule as to time and place does not apply; <em>per Buller J. </em>5 <em>T. R. </em>616 ; so that the plea does not aver that the defendants had fully administered, &amp;c.; and that the defendants had not, at the time of the commencement of this suit, any goods and chattels, &amp;c., which came, &amp;c., to be administered. Though such averments may be necessary in a plea of <em>plene administravit, </em>yet this is not such plea; neither can the defendants plead such plea in this suit. They are concluded by the former judgment, recovered against them, and cannot deny assets. But this first plea is obviously defective in one particular. The suggestion in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration is, that the defendants eloigned, wasted, &amp;c., the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>and chattels, which came to the hands of the defendants to be administered. The plea is, that they or either of them did not eloign, waste, &amp;c., the goods and chattels which came to the hands of the said <em>William Potts </em>to be administered. The plea is not broad enough; it relates only to what came to the hands of one administrator. It does not apply to what came to the hands of the co-administrator, and for this reason is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The second and third pleas are deficient, both in form and substance. They seem to have been intended to raise the defence, provided in certain cases, and to a certain extent, by the act concerning the estates of persons who die insolvent, passed the 12th of June, 1820. <em>Rev. L. </em>766. <em>Elm. Dig. </em>169. Both pleas are entirely insufficient, in not averring time and place in connection with material and traversable facts. The second plea contains no allegation of time and place, in connection with any fact averred therein. The third plea is in a similar respect insufficient, except that it alleges the time when the Orphans\u2019 Court, under the above act, made an order directing public notice to be given to the creditors of the above named Edward W. Potts deceased, to exhibit their claims against his estate under oath or affirmation. In neither plea is it shewn, when the application was made to the Orphans\u2019 Court, representing the insolvency of the estate of the intestate, upon which such order was made. The importance and necessity of showing the time of making such application is obvious from this consideration; that such proceedings form no bar to proceedings by a judgment creditor against the administrators, unless the said application was made before the recovery of the judgment against them. If the creditor of the decedent recover his judgment against the administrators before the application, their liability is fixed, and the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court form no defence in their behalf. It is only when the application is made <em>before action brought or pending the action </em>against an executor or administrator, that the statute provides that \u201cno execution shall in any case issue after the making of said application.\u201d <em>Elm. Dig. 171 pl. 35. </em>This point was fully settled, and I apprehend satisfactorily, in a prior decision pronounced between these very parties. 1 <em>Spenc. R. </em>1. Without further observation, I am of opinion, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the second and third pleas are insufficient, because they do not shew, that an application was made by the administrators to the Orphans\u2019 Court before the recovery of the judgment against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">So much under the assumption, that the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, under some circumstances, form a defence to the action, and that such defence can be raised by plea. In relation to the subject matter of the second plea, as I take it, the statute does not bar the action : it says the creditor may proceed to judgment, and simply provides that \u201c no execution shall in any case issue <em>after the making of said application ; </em>and the amount of such judgment when recovered, shall be the sum on which the creditor shall receive his rateable proportion, &amp;c.\u201d If within the provisions of the statute, the relief provided maybe obtained by motion, and is not the subject matter of a plea. <em>Spenc. R. 5.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In regard to the third plea, how can the defendants, after a judgment obtained against them <em>as </em>administrators, plead in an action on that judgment, that the creditor did not present his claim or demand under oath or affirmation ? If such matter can be pleaded with effect, it necessarily must form a defence to the first suit, and that opportunity waived or lost, such plea can form no defence to this subsequent action on the prior judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The demurrer must be sustained and judgment entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Whitehead and Randolph J. J., not having heard the argument, expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
