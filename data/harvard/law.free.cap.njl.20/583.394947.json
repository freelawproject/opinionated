The bond was dated the 14th day of March 1839; the tax warrant was delivered to the constable on the 27th day of December 1839. The declaration was in the usual form upon the penal part of the bond; to which the defendants, after craving oyer of the bond and condition, pleaded general performance. The bond and condition are in the form prescribed by the 58th section of the Small Cause act, <em>Elmer\u2019s Digest, </em>286. The plaintiffs below in the replication assigned for a breach of the condition of the bond, <em>\u201c </em>that a certain return of the taxable inhabitants of the said township of Camden, who had made default in the payment of then taxes for the year, 1839, was duly made to Josiah Atkinson, one of the justices, &amp;c.; which said return amounted to the sum of $&gt;H93.It; whereupon the said justice,then and there, on the 7th of December, 1839 aforesaid, issued his execution commonly. called a. tax warrant under his hand and seal against such persons so making default as aforesaid, amounting in the whole to the said sum of $1193.11 <em>\u2022 </em>and then and there delivered the said execution, called a tax-warrant, to the said William Hugg, to be executed according to law; and the said plaintiffs in fact say, that although the said William Hugg, as such constable as aforesaid, collected the said several sums of money, amounting in the whole to the said sum ol $1193.11, as aforesaid; yet the said William Hugg neglected and refused to pay over the said sum of money or any part thereof <em>to the said plaintiffs, </em>although often requested so to do, contrary to ihe form and effect of the said condition;\u201d concluding with a verification and prayer for judgment in the usual form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>To this replication there was a general demurrer and joinder. The demurrer was over-ruled by the Circuit Court, at. December term, 1842, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs, the amount of the damages being confessed by the defendant. A writ of error was thereupon brought to this court. By the state of the ease, any objection to the mode of entering the judgment, or to the amount thereof, was waived.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-5\"><em>Browning </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">I. The execution of this tax-warrant is not one of the duties of a constable, mentioned in the condition of this bond. The duties of constable are extensive. 1st, <em>Criminal </em>\u2014 consisting of various duties as a conservator of the peace. See 1 <em>Blac. Com. </em>856. 2d, <em>Civil </em>\u2014 being assigned in New Jersey by various acts of the legislature. See <em>Griff. Treat. </em>501. <em>N. J. Justice </em>199, where these civil duties of a constable are enumerated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-7\">These civil duties are of a two-fold character. 1st, As a ministerial officer of the court for the trial of small causes; and these duties bear somewhat the same relation to this court, that those of the sheriff do to other courts, of which he is the ministerial officer, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>276, \u00a7 3. 2d, Particular duties assigned by various acts of the legislature, collected in the treatises above referred to, viz : as an officer of the Orphans\u2019 Court to serve all process and orders directed to him; to extinguish fires in the woods; to summon and swear appraisers of goods distrained; to collect taxes upon warrants delivered to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-8\">The language of the condition of the bond is broad enough to embrace all these duties, not only civil, but even in relation to criminal matters. It will not be pretended that it extends to duties which relate to criminal matters; the remedy against a constable for failing in these duties is by indictment, and fine and imprisonment. 2 <em>Jac. Law Dict. tit. </em>\u201cConstable.\u201d This is a bond to secure redress for breaches of duties towards individuals, in regard to which damages can be estimated by money. It will not secure the payment of fines imposed upon him. For failure in the performance of his public duties, he would be liable to be indicted and fined; but this is not secured by the bond, although so general in its language. The general words used in \u00a1he condition of a bond, are then to be restricted in their import. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>How far restricted ? In construing any particular enactmen t the context and subject matter are to be looked to, together with the reason and spirit of the law. The bond here prescribed is in the \u201cact constituting courts for the trial of small causes;\u201d every section of which act relates to that court, unless this forms an exception. Many sections of this act prescribe the duties of constables in relation to this court, and speak of them as its ministerial officers. See <em>sections </em>3, 6, 19, 21, 24, <em>fyc. </em>It is in this statute and in this connection, that every constable is required to give bond, conditioned that he \u201cshall well and truly perform all the duties enjoined on him, as constable of said towuship.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-5\">The former act, 1798, <em>Pat. </em>323, required constables to give bond, conditioned \u201cfor the true and faithful performance of all the duties <em>enjoined on him, by that act.\u201d </em>This bond did not reach duties enjoined on the constables by the supplements to the small cause act, and therefore the alteration in phraseology of the condition of the bond. The duties pf constable in the collection of taxes being in no wise connected with the court for the trial o\u00ed small causes, a breach of these duties is not within the condition of this bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-6\">That this bond was intended to secure individuals for breaches of duty towards them, capable of being estimated in and redressed by money, and not to secure the township itself, will appear from the mode of prosecution prescribed. \u201c Prosecuted in every respect as sheriffs\u2019 bonds;\u201d that is to say, on application by a person aggrieved, and at his costs and charges. <em>Elm. Dig. 287, pl. </em>59; <em>Ib. 511, pl. </em>10. See also the late act of the 19th of February\u00bb 1840. <em>Harr. Pub. Laws. </em>385. Under either act a prosecutor Other than the nominal plaintiffs, is contemplated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-7\">The condition of the bond should be construed most favorably to the obligors. <em>Hurlstone on Bonds, </em>32. 9 <em>Law Lib. </em>2 <em>Shep. Touch by Preston, </em>375-377. 31 <em>Law Lib. </em>The contract of sureties is to be construed strictly. <em>Hurlstone </em>111. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>9 <em>Wheat. </em>680. 5 <em>Condensed Rep. 727.

But if the duties of a constable in executing a tax warrant, be within the condition of the bond, still the breach in this case has been defectively assigned. The breach must be assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>with certainty and particularity. <em>Hurlstone, </em>134. 1 <em>Chit. Plead. </em>365, 370. It must appear that the constable failed to perform some legal duty assigned him. It does not appear that a return, of the delinquents was made by the proper officer, at the proper time and under oath. <em>Elm. Dig. </em>554, <em>pl. </em>18, 20, 21. The act requires the constable to pay over the money collected to the township collector; the breach assigned is, that he did not pay over the same to <em>the plaintiffs, </em>that is to the \u201c inhabitants of the township.\u201d It is not alleged, that he neglected and refused to pay over the money within forty-five days after date of the warrant. See <em>Elm. Dig. </em>555. <em>pl. </em>25.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-5\"><em>W. N. Jeffers </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b599-7\">Carpenter J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG7\">I concur in the opinion pronounced by my brother Nevius, that the execution of a tax-warrant, delivered to a constable under the provisions of the act concerning taxes, is within the condition of his bond; that it is one of the duties of a constable, mentioned in the condition of his bond. The words of the condition are so broad, as fairly to embrace all the civil duties of a constable in his township ; at any rate in regard to the collection of moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"ASd\">As to some of the objections urged against the plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of breaches. The breach assigned in the replication is not for refusal or neglect,to receive the warrant, or to collect the moneys due thereon from the delinquents therein named. The breach alleged is, that having received the warrant atffi having collected a large sum of money under and by virtue thereof, the constable has neglected and refused to pay it over. Does it lie in the mouth of the constable, having so collected this money by virtue of this warrant, to say that the warrant is irregular, or has been irregularly issued, and that he ought not to be compelled to pay over the money ? Will such an answer from his sureties be satisfactory ? I apprehend not.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">As to the supposed irregularity in regard to time, viz: that the list of delinquents was not returned to the justice by the collector on the 20th of December. In this matter I suppose the statute to be merely directory. It is a general rule, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>when a statute requires an act to be done by an officer within a certain time for a public purpose, though he neglect his duty and allow the precise time to go by, yet if he afterwards perform, the public shall not suffer by the delay. <em>People </em>v. Allen, 6 <em>Wend. </em>486. <em>Ex parte Heath, 3 Hill </em>47. But in one respect, I apprehend, the replication is defective on general demurrer. The breach assigned must be some duty imposed <em>on </em>the constable by the statute. The duty is, that within a time specified he shall pay over the tax money collected by him to a particular officer of the township, to wit, the <em>township collector ; </em>the breach assigned is a refusal to pay it over to the inhabitants of the township generally. He was not required to pay it, as is supposed by this assignment of breaches, and the assignment is therefore defective. I regret to feel obliged to reverse the judgment on this point, especially as I have no reason to suppose injustice has been done. But I cannot doubt that if this assignment had been before us on general demurrer, we should have held the assignment bad. The judgment therefore must be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b600-4\">Nevius J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4O\">It is objected by the defendants in error, that the plaintiff is not entitled to his writ of error, inasmuch as by his confessing the damages, he has released or waived the errors, if any there are. This is not so. Error will lie from a judgment by confession or by default. <em>Bac. Ab. Tit. Error A. </em>So, a man may bring error upon a judgment in his own favor; or where judgment has been arrested after verdict, the plaintiff may move the court for judgment against himself, in order that he may bring his writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The main question in the case is, whether the Circuit Court were right in over-ruling the demurrer. It- is contended by the plaintiff in error, that the sureties upon a constable\u2019s bond are not- responsible for his default in the execution of a tax warrant; that this is a special duty assigned him under the act concerning taxes, and not within the meaning or purview of the act which requires the bond to be given. By the 52d sec. of the small cause act, passed in 1798, <em>Pat. </em>323, every constable was bound to give bond with sureties, if required to do so by the township committee, conditioned for the faithful performance of all the d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ties enjoined upon him by that act. Upon the revision of this act, in 1818, the legislature saw proper to change this provision, and make the condition of the bond much broader. It declares, that every constable <em>shall, </em>before he enters upon the execution of his office, give a bond conditioned for the true and faithful performance of all the duties of the said office of constable; and prescribes the form and substance of the condition, to wit: \u201cthat he shall truly and faithfully perform all the duties enjoined on him, as constable of said township.\u201d It is manifest that the legislature intended this alteration, and not at all improbable that it was de-. signed to meet the very case now before us. By the 17th sec of the \u201c act concerning taxes,\u201d <em>Elm. Dig. </em>555, it is made the duty of the justice, to whom a list of delinquent tax-payers is returned by the collector, to deliver to the constable a warrant requiring him to levy the tax so in arrear; and by the same section it is made the duly of the constable to pay the tax for which such warrant is issued, to the township collector. This act further points out the mode in which the constable is to proceed in the execution of such warrant; and subjects him to a penalty for neglect or refusal to execute it as directed, and to an action for the amount collected and not paid over. Here then is a duty most clearly enjoined upon him by law, as a constable of the township, and a duty of that character which would seem to be appropriately secured by bond, and is clearly within the terms of the condition of his bond. I cannot doubt but his sureties are legally responsible, upon his bond, for his neglect to perform the duties enjoined upon him by the act concerning taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">But it is further argued, that there is no lawful breach assigned in the replication. That it should appear, that a proper return was made to the justice at a proper time ; and that the justice proceeded according to law; that there was evidence before the justice, that the money had been demanded from the delinquents; that the warrant was issued within five days after the return made to him. That the replication ought also to have set forth what the constable was bound to do with the warrant, and that he had refused to pay over the moneys so collected by him to the township collector. For the want of these averments it is insisted, that the Circuit Court ought to have sustained the demurrer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>And it is further objected, that the replication is defective, in that it sets forth that a \u201c certain return of the taxable inhabitants of the township, who had made default in the payment of their taxes, was made,\u201d while it ought to have used the words <em>of the act and </em>stated, <em>that a \u201clist of the names of </em>delinquents\u201d was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">It must be borne in mind, that the demurrer filed in the court below was general; and whether these objections were <em>urged, </em>in the argument in the court below, does not appear. If they were, and if any one of them was good cause of general demurrer, I apprehend that that court would have permitted the plaintiffs upon terms to have amended their replication, and saved the parties the delay and expense of this writ. If they were not taken in that court, the plaintiff in error appears here with an ill grace to avail himself of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The distinction between a general and special demurrer is well settled; the former is to the substance, without assigning any particular cause; and the latter is to the form, where the pariicular imperfections are pointed out. Now I apprehend, that all the defects in this replication above mentioned, save one perhaps, are defects in the form, if they are defects at all. \u201c A return of the taxable inhabitants, who had made default in the payment of their taxes,\u201d is sufficiently explicit, and indeed more so, than if the replication has used the words of the statute, to wit: \u201c a list of the names of delinquents.\u201d The language in its connection is of the same import, and I know of no rule, by which the party is limited to the language of the act. When the replication states, that this return was duly made to the justice, it is necessarily implied that it was made by the proper officer, and at the proper time, and according to the directions of the act. But if there was irregularity in the return made to the justice; or if not made within the time prescribed by law; or if the warrant was not issued within five days after the return made, the defendants could not set up such irregularities as a defence in this action; no more than a constable could avoid his liability for money collected on an execution, irregularly issued out of a justice\u2019s court. The, statute is merely directory as to the time and manner, in which the collector is to make the return, and the time within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>which the justice is to issue his warrant. The averment that this warrant was delivered to the constable to be executed according to law, although not as full and precise as it might have been, is nevertheless.sufficient, and especially on a general demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The last objection presents more difficulty, viz: the averment that the constable refused to pay the moneys so collected to the plaintiffs, although requested so to do. The statute nliakes it the duty of the constable to pay the moneys to the township collector, but this is for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of the township. The collector is for that purpose their agent, and a payment to him would have been a good discharge, and the defendants might have rejoined that such payment was made. The replication is good upon its face, and its defect in this particular can only be shown by resorting to a matter extrinsic, and therefore it ought to have been particularly pointed out by special demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Upon the whole, I think the judgment of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Hornbeower C. J. concurred with Justice Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
