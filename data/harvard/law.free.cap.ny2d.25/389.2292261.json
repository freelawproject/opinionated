There was no consent as a matter of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sibron, </em>18 N Y 2d 603, 392 U. S. 40.) II. The trial court erroneously placed the burden of proof upon appellant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Malinsky, </em>15 N Y 2d 86; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>321 F. 2d 704; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>308 F. 2d 657.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-7\"><em>Eugene Gold, District Attorney (Harry Brodbar </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq-\">The facts clearly indicate the voluntary surrender of contraband on the part of appellant and since there had not actually been any true request or demand for the incriminating evidence, there is no issue of the voluntariness of consent for this court to determine. Appellant, therefore, has not sustained the ultimate burden of demonstrating an unlawful search or seizure, the true issue of this appeal. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>308 F. 2d 657, 372 U. S. 906; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rundle, </em>274 F. Supp. 364; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>370 F. 2d 477; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>364 F. 2d 45, 385 U.

Then, inside a store, defendant approached the officer, whom he recognized from a previous narcotics arrest. Upon seeing the detective, Whitehurst exclaimed, \u201c Oh no. Not you again.\u201d Whereupon Bryan, according to his testimony, replied, \u201c Yes, it\u2019s me. What have you got this time? \u201d On cross-examination the officer acknowledged that this question referred to narcotics. Apparently, the defendant also understood the officer\u2019s question, because he reached into his pocket, took out two glassine envelopes, placed them on the counter in front of Bryan and said, \u201c That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">During .the course of the suppression hearing a question arose as to the burden of proof when defendant\u2019s trial counsel asked for a stipulation from the assistant district attorney that the issue was one of consent and that, in that posture, the burden of proof was on the People. The court stated that consent was not involved, that in placing the contraband on the counter, defendant had acted voluntarily. The question thus presented is whether the hearing jurist improperly placed the burden of proof on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The trial court\u2019s response to the request for a stipulation demonstrates the confusion which prevails generally in the lower courts as to the several procedural variants at property suppression hearings (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 813-c <em>et seq.). </em>Initially, the defendant carries the burden of <em>proof </em>when he challenges the legality of a search and seizure (see, e.g., <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 308 U. S. 338, 342), but the People have the burden of <em>going forward </em>to show the legality of the police conduct in the first instance <em>(People </em>v. <em>Malinsky, </em>15 N Y 2d 86, 91, n. 2). When a search and seizure is based upon consent, however, the burden of proof rests heavily upon the People to establish the voluntariness of that waiver of a constitutional right. In <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(391 U. S. 543) the court stated: \u201cWhen a prosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given\u201d (p. 548).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>In the context of this case, as it developed from the mouth of the People\u2019s witness, we cannot say that the hearing court properly applied the burden of proof. When Detective Bryan stated that he asked, \u201cWhat have you got this time?\u201d he injected the issue of consent into the case. No matter the perspective from which the quoted words are viewed, they remain interrogative. They are couched in terms of a request, and an affirmative response by word or by deed would constitute a constitutional waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The People argue that defendant surrendered the contraband without the prompting of the request, but the record before us does not support that conclusion. Detective Bryan stated that he asked the question and admitted as well that he, Bryan, was referring to narcotics. Moreover, he testified that he knew defendant from a previous narcotics arrest. Finally; and perhaps most significantly, he testified that defendant did not place the glassine envelopes on the counter until after the question was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Under the circumstances the burden of proof was on the People. Therefore, the defendant ought to have the factual issue determined in accordance with constitutional standards, and a new suppression hearing should be held <em>(People </em>v. <em>Malinsky, </em>15 N Y 2d 86, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be reversed, and the case remanded to the Criminal Court for a new hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b432-8\">Scileppi, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ApH\">In our opinion there was no unlawful search and seizure in this case. We conclude that the Hearing Judge was correct in holding that there was no issue of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The purpose of a suppression hearing is to determine whether proposed evidence was obtained by the prosecution by means of an unlawful search and seizure (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 813-c <em>et seq.). </em>The Hearing Judge must make two determinations: (1) whether or not there was a search and seizure and (2) if so, whether the search and seizure was reasonable. Common sense tells us that the Hearing Judge must first find, expressly or implicitly, that there was a search and seizure before he can ascertain whether it was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">In the instant case the Hearing Judge found, as a fact, that the officer did not search the defendant since the defendant had, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of his own volition, turned the contraband over to him. The issue of consent was not reached since it was never established that there was ever a search. The only reviewable question is whether the Judge\u2019s factual determination that there was no search was proper. In our opinion it was (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Leonti, </em>18 N Y 2d 384).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Although it may be true that a search no longer necessitates a physical examination of a person or his property <em>(Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U. S. 41), it has never been held, at least in this jurisdiction, that a statement made by a police officer as innocuous as \u201c What have you got this time \u201d constitutes a search. We have held that a frisk is not a search even though it actually involves a physical intrusion <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>14 N Y 2d 441). Moreover, in the \u201c abandonment \u201d cases, this court has declared that there is no search and seizure where an officer retrieves contraband that is abandoned by the defendant since possession has voluntarily been relinquished <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>14 N Y 2d 885). It is our opinion that it cannot reasonably be held that an unsolicited relinquishment of possession of contraband is any more of a search than in an abandonment situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In a recent case involving the constitutional right of counsel and the right against self incrimination we held that a suspect\u2019s confession which he blurted out on a street in response to an accusation by a police officer was voluntary and admissible even though the officer was aware that the suspect\u2019s attorney had demanded that the police no longer question his client <em>(People </em>v. <em>McKie, </em>25 N Y 2d 19). Although it is true that <em>McKie </em>involved different constitutional safeguards, the reasoning in that case is applicable here. The voluntary act of the defendant in response to the officer\u2019s question, in the instant case, is quite similar to McKie\u2019s blurted out confession in response to the detective\u2019s accusation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The Hearing Judge, in the instant case, chose to believe the testimony of the arresting officer as to the circumstances surrounding the arrest and found that there had been no search. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>In onr opinion that testimony could be found to be credible by the trial court in its determination that there was no search.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Breitel and Gibson concur with Judge Burke; Judge Scileppi dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judges Bergan and Jasen concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Judgment reversed and case remitted to the Criminal Court of the City of New York for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\"> In <em>People </em>v. <em>McKie </em>(25 N Y 2d 19) the defendant, murder suspect, who had been under surveillance, approached the detective watching him and asked \u201cWhen are you guys going to stop bugging me?\u201d One of the officers replied \u201cYou weren\u2019t so brave when you killed that little old lady\u201d, whereupon the suspect said, \u201c Sure I did it, but you guys can\u2019t prove it\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
