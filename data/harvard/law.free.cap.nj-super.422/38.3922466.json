We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Daniel M. Waldman in his com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>prehensive and well-reasoned written opinions dated October 19, 2009 and January 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In their complaints, plaintiffs sought an order prohibiting defendants from refusing to pay claims for diminution in the value of their vehicles damaged as a result of vehicular mishaps; requiring defendants to notify their insureds of coverage for diminution-in-value claims and the appropriate procedures for processing such claims; and directing defendants, in the future, to honor and abide by their contractual obligations and New Jersey laws by paying diminution-in-value claims resulting from vehicular collisions or other accidental losses as presented by defendants\u2019 insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints also sought compensatory damages on behalf of those plaintiffs who presented first-party claims for diminution in value arising out of vehicular collisions or other accidental losses within six years of the filing of the underlying complaints, whose claimed theory of recovery was based upon the absence of such coverage in their policies, and defendants\u2019 refusals to advise plaintiffs that they have a right to recover for the diminished value of their vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In granting defendants\u2019 motions, Judge Waldman found that the language of the insureds\u2019 respective policies clearly and unambiguously limited defendants\u2019 liability to repairing damaged vehicles with \u201clike kind or parts\u201d or compensating insureds for the \u201cactual value of the vehicle before the loss occurred (less depreciation and deductible) at the option of the insurer.\u201d Additionally, the judge concluded that diminution-in-value claims were clearly excluded under the policies and that the reasonable expectation of the insureds, after reading the limits of liability clauses and diminution-in-value exclusions in their policies, would be that their damaged vehicles \u201cwould be restored to [their] pre-loss value, less any \u2018perceived loss in market or resale value.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Judge Waldman also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that diminution-in-value exclusions in policies were unconscionable and he found no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Likewise, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>judge concluded that given his finding that defendants did not breach their contractual obligations to plaintiffs, the complaints failed to assert viable claims under the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -20, or state a claim for relief based upon reformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration and included in their motion a request that the court grant plaintiffs leave to file amended complaints asserting claims for diminution-in-value damages in the context of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. The court denied reconsideration, finding that the motion did not satisfy the requirements for reconsideration. The court also denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaints, concluding their motions were not only untimely, but that reconsideration was not an appropriate procedure for seeking such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs raise the following points for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">THE LANGUAGE OF THE POLICIES IS AMBIGUOUS AND THUS MUST BE INTERPRETED AS AFFORDING COVERAGE FOR DIMINUTION IN VALUE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">A.

We view the allegations in the complaint with liberality and without concern for a plaintiffs ability to prove the facts alleged in the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31. We evaluate such a motion \u201cin light of the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>Donato v. Moldow, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475, 482, 865 A.2d 711 (App.Div.2005). A plaintiffs obligation on a motion to dismiss \u201cis not to prove the case but only to make allegations which, if proven, would constitute a valid cause of action.\u201d <em>Leon v. Rite Aid Corp., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 472, 774 A.2d 674 (App.Div.2001). Where, however, \u201ceven a generous reading of the allegations does not reveal a legal basis for recovery),]\u201d the motion should be granted. <em>Edwards v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas.

[c]olhsion only if the Declarations indicate that Collision Coverage is provided for that auto.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). It limits its liability for any loss to \u201cthe lesser of the: 1. Actual cash value of the stolen or damaged property; or 2. Amount necessary to repair or replace the property with other property of like kind and quality.\u201d The policy specifically excludes coverage for \u201c[l]oss to your covered auto or any non-owned auto due to diminution in value.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). The policy defines \u201cdiminution in value\u201d as \u201cthe actual or perceived loss in market or resale value which results from a direct and accidental loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The First Trenton policy provides: \u2018We will pay for loss to an insured car caused by collision with another object or vehicle, or by upset. We will pay for such loss minus the applicable deductible amount shown on the declarations pages.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). It limits its liability for losses to an insured\u2019s vehicle or any of its parts, to the \u201cactual cash value of either the vehicle or the parts at the time the loss occur[s]. This limit will also not exceed what it would then cost to repair or replace either the vehicle or the parts with others of like kind and quality.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). Exclusions under the policy include an amendatory endorsement expressly providing that the insurance policy \u201cdoes not cover loss to your car or any non-owned car due to diminution in value.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). The endorsement defines \u201cdiminution in value\u201d as \u201cthe actual or perceived loss in market or resale value which results from a direct and accidental loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The High Point policy provides coverage \u201cfor accidental loss of or damage\u201d to an insured\u2019s vehicle, \u201cincluding its equipment, if it is involved in a collision with another object ... except as shown under \u2018Losses We Will Not Pay For (Part 1).\u2019 \u201d It limits its liability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>We may pay for the loss, or repair or replace the damaged or stolen property----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">Under this part, the maximum amount we are responsible to you for is the actual cash value of the damaged or stolen property at the time of the loss (taking into account the fact that it may no longer be new) minus the amount of the deductibles shown on the Declarations for these coverages____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">If at our option, we pay for the cost to repair or replace the property or part, <em>our liability does not include any diminution of value, however measured, as a result of the loss, and/or repair or replacement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Finally, it specifically excludes from coverage payment \u201cfor any loss to your automobile or any non-owned automobile due to diminution [in] value as defined in this policy.\u201d It defines the term \u201cdiminution [in] value\u201d as \u201c[t]he actual or perceived loss in market or resale value which results from a loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">We discern no ambiguity in the language contained in any of the three policies. Where there is no ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy, it is not the function of the courts to \u201c \u2018write for the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 670, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999) (quoting <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Nor are we persuaded, as plaintiffs urge, that the varying interpretations courts have ascribed to terms such as \u201crepair,\u201d \u201creplace,\u201d and \u201clike kind and quality,\u201d constitute proof that such terms create an ambiguity in the language of the insurance policies sufficient to withstand dismissal of their complaints for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. As the Texas Court of Appeals stated in <em>Carlton v. Trinity Universal Insurance Co., 32 S.W.3d 454 </em>(Tex.App.2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-12\">In common usage, \u201crepair\u201d means \u201cto restore by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken\u201d or, stated slightly differently, \u201cto bring back to good or usable condition.\u201d There is no concept of \u201cvalue\u201d in the ordinary meaning of the word. Ascribing to the words \u201crepair or replace\u201d an obligation to compensate the insured for things which, by their very nature, cannot be \u201crepaired\u201d or \u201creplaced\u201d would violate the most fundamental rules of contract construction. If there is a single guiding principle that governs our interpretation of the insuring agreement, it is to give effect to the parties\u2019 intent as expressed in the plain language of the written policy. Therefore, we must conclude that the limit of liability provision means what it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>We hold that where an insurer has fully, completely, and adequately \u201crepaired or replaced the property with other of like kind and quality,\u201d any reduction in market value of the vehicle due to factors that are not subject to repair or replacement cannot be deemed a component part of the cost of repair or replacement. Under the \u201crepair or replace\u201d provision of the policy\u2019s limit of liability, the insurer\u2019s liability is capped at the cost of returning the damaged vehicle to substantially the same physical, operating, and mechanical condition as existed immediately before the loss. This obligation does not include liability for any inherent diminished value caused by conditions or defects that are not subject to repair or replacement, such as a stigma on resale resulting from \u201cmarket psychology\u201d that a vehicle that has been damaged and repaired is worth less than a similar one that has never been damaged. While the insured may well suffer this type of damage as a result of a direct or accidental loss, the plain language of the policy clearly and unambiguously limits the insurer\u2019s liability to \u201cthe amount necessary to repair or replace the property with other of like kind and quality.\u201d If the market value of the vehicle, after full, adequate, and complete repair or replacement, is diminished as a result of factors that are not subject to \u201crepair\u201d or \u201creplacement,\u201d the insurer has no obligation to pay the diminution in value. No other reasonable interpretation can be given to the parties\u2019 express agreement that the insurer\u2019s liability is capped at the amount necessary to \u201crepair or replace.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 464-65 (citations and footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Moreover, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that because the three policies here broadly define coverage afforded to their insureds, they are to be characterized as \u201call risk\u201d policies. The specificity of the exclusion provisions in each of the policies militates against any construction other than that claims based upon diminution in value are not covered. <em>See Victory Peach Grp., Inc. v. Greater N.Y. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>82, 87-88, 707 A.2d 1383 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Likewise, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon <em>Hintz v. Roberts, </em>98 <em>N.J.L. </em>768, 121 A. 711 (E. &amp; A.1923), and <em>Premier XXI Claims Management v. Rigstad, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>281, 885 A.2d 521 (App.Div.2005), is misplaced. In both cases, the plaintiffs sought to recover damages for the diminution in value to their vehicles. However, the theory of recovery was based upon application of common law tort principles to a third-party action by the injured property owner against the tortfeasor rather than a first-party action by an insured against the insurer premised upon a breach of contract theory of liability. 98 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 770, 121 A. 711, 381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 282-83, 885 A.2d 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Pickett v. Lloyd\u2019s, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>457, 621 A.2d 445 (1993), upon which plaintiffs also rely to assert they are entitled to recover in tort against defendants for failure to pay their diminution-in-value claims, is also inapplicable. In <em>Pickett, </em>the Court recognized that a cause of action exists for an insurer\u2019s bad faith failure to pay an insurance claim, but that the cause of action arises out of the insurer\u2019s \u201cbreach of the fiduciary obligation imposed by virtue of its policy\u201d and that compensation for such breach is not dependent upon \u201cwhat label we place on the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 621 A.2d 445. Thus, <em>Pickett </em>does not represent a separate and distinct theory of recovery based upon a claim of diminution in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Next, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to apply the principles we articulated in <em>Homesite Insurance Co. v. Hindman, </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 992 A.2d 804 (App.Div.2010), to their claims. In <em>Home-site, </em>we stated that when considering conflicting provisions in an insurance policy, we \u201cwill not read one policy provision in isolation when doing so would render another provision meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 992 A.2d 804. The provisions at issue in <em>Homesite </em>were conflicting in that one provision provided coverage for the claimed loss while another provision excluded coverage for the very same loss. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, however, both the limits of liability provisions and the exclusion provisions serve to defeat coverage. In addition, assuming one may characterize the language limiting liability in the three policies as general and therefore ambiguous, the exclusion provisions are more specific and therefore controlling. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 992 A.2d 804 (citing <em>Bauman v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>12, 22, 174 A.2d 585 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Because the language in the respective policies is unambiguous, plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the doctrine of reasonable expectations requires that coverage be afforded is without merit. The clear language of the policies limiting liability and excluding diminution-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>in-value damages provides no basis for defendants\u2019 insureds to expect otherwise. Nor do the policies contain language on the declaration pages that would lead the reasonable insured to expect coverage for diminution-in-value damages. Consequently, the policies here are distinguishable from the policy at issue in <em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 346-47, 638 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In <em>Lehrhoff, </em>the insurer denied coverage to the plaintiffs son because although he was listed as a driver on the declarations page, he was allegedly no longer a resident in the plaintiffs household at the time of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 638 A.2d 889. We stated that the question to be answered was \u201cwhether the typical automobile policyholder would understand and expect from the declarations page of [the] policy that each of the listed drivers was entitled to all of the coverages and all of the protections afforded by the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 638 A.2d 889. We answered the question in the affirmative based upon designation of the plaintiffs son as an additional driver on the declaration page. <em>Id. </em>at 348-49, 638 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Plaintiffs, relying upon <em>Rudbart v. North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>344, 355-56, 605 A.2d 681, <em>cert. denied sub nom., </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>871, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>203, 121 L.Ed.2d 145 (1992), contend that the diminution-in-value exclusions in defendants\u2019 policies are unenforceable because such provisions violate public policy. In support of this contention, plaintiffs argue that the contracts between plaintiffs and defendants are one-sided and vest defendants with supreme bargaining power over plaintiffs, who are economically compelled to acquire collision coverage. Additionally, plaintiffs urge that because their complaints allege the exclusions contained in the policies are unconscionable, a fact-sensitive analysis is required to resolve this contention. To that end, plaintiffs maintain the court erred in disposing of this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>through a motion to dismiss before evidence was presented. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Where a complaint states no basis for relief and discovery will not serve to provide a basis for relief, then dismissal is the appropriate remedy. <em>Banco Popular N. Am. v. Gandi, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>161, 166, 876 A.2d 253 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In <em>Rudbart, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">[I]n determining whether to enforce the terms of a contract of adhesion, courts have looked not only to the take-it-or-leave-it nature or the standardized form of the document but also to [ (1) 1 the subject matter of the contract, [ (2) ] the parties\u2019 relative bargaining positions, [ (3) ] the degree of economic compulsion motivating the \u201cadhering\u201d party, and [ (4) J the public interests affected by the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\"><em>[Rudbart, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 356, 605 A.2d 681.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">We agree the policies here are contracts of adhesion, but, as the Court observed in <em>Rudbart, </em>an acknowledgment that auto insurance policies are contracts of adhesion is \u201cthe beginning, not the end, of the inquiry!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354, 605 A.2d 681. The question is whether enforcement of provisions excluding claims based upon diminution in value should be rendered unenforceable as a matter of policy. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">While public policy mandates that those who operate vehicles across this state must have liability insurance, collision insurance is not mandated. <em>Universal Underwriters Grp. v. Heibel, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307, 319, 901 A.2d 398 (App.Div.2006). Therefore, provisions in a policy limiting the extent to which an insurer will compensate an insured for damages to an insured\u2019s vehicle and expressly excluding certain types of collision coverage do not contravene public policy. <em>N.J. Coal. of Health Care Prof'ls, Inc. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Banking &amp; Ins., Div. of Ins., </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 254-57, 732 A.2d 1063 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. 485, 744 </em>A.2d 1208 (1999). Policy exclusions are presumptively valid and will be enforced provided the provisions are \u201cspecific, plain, clear, prominent, and not contrary to public policy.\u201d <em>Doto v. Russo, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>544, 559, 659 A.2d 1371 (1995); <em>see also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 514 A.2d 832 (1986) (stating principle that \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>specific exclusion for intentional wrongful acts is valid and consistent with public policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">However, even in the absence of a statutory mandate to maintain collision insurance, most vehicle owners are economically compelled to maintain collision insurance, whether as a condition of a lease agreement or a financing agreement. <em>N.J. Coal. of Health Care Prof'ls, Inc., supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 256, 732 A.2d 1063. Thus, no fact-sensitive inquiry into the first three <em>Rudbart </em>factors is required. <em>Muhammad v. Cnty. Bank of Rehoboth Beach, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18, 912 A.2d 88 (2006) (\u201cThe first three factors of the <em>Rudbart </em>analysis require only brief attention.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 <em>U.S. </em>1338, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>2032, 167 L.Ed.2d 763 (2007). The key question before the motion judge was what, if any, \u201cpublic-interests\u201d are affected by the inclusion of these provisions in auto insurance policies. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 912 A.2d 88. As a consequence, there was no necessity to deny defendants\u2019 motion on the basis that it was not ripe for resolution without the benefit of the presentation of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">As previously discussed, the eases upon which plaintiffs rely to urge that the policies are contrary to public policy involve third-party actions against a tortfeasor rather than a first-party action by an insured seeking enforcement of an insurance contract against an insurer. Plaintiffs fail to point to any statutory, regulatory, or judicial decision requiring inclusion of diminution in value as part of an insured\u2019s collision coverage. Citing <em>Allen v. Commerical Casualty Insurance Co., </em>131 <em>N.J.L. </em>475, 477-78, 37 A.2d 37 (E. &amp; A.1944), plaintiffs properly note that public policy has been defined as \u201cthat principle of law which holds that \u2018no person can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public or against public good[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>They fail, however, to articulate what harm or injury to the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cpublic good\u201d results from a contractual provision which denies diminution-in-value coverage in an auto insurance policy. Moreover, plaintiffs are not left without a remedy for damages caused to their automobiles. <em>See, e.g., Muhammad, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 19-21, 912 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>A.2d 88 (holding class action waiver provision in payday loan agreement was unconscionable and noting that in the absence of the class action vehicle, most consumers with small claims would be disinclined to individually pursue consumer fraud claims); <em>see also Vasquez v. Glassboro Serv. Ass\u2019n, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>86, 99, 105, 415 A.2d 1156 (1980) (recognizing that our courts and Legislature \u201chave demonstrated a progressive attitude in providing legal protection for migrant farmworkers\u201d and finding failure of employment contract to provide a migrant farm worker, upon termination from employment, with a reasonable opportunity to find shelter before dispossession, contrary to public policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Here, defendants agreed to compensate plaintiffs maintaining collision insurance coverage for damage resulting from vehicular mishaps with the repair or replacement of the damaged vehicle or actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of the accident, but expressly excluded diminution in value, a loss which affects no public interests. Therefore, Judge Waldman properly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the limitation and exclusion provisions contained in the respective policies are contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments, including those related to the court\u2019s denial of their motions for reconsideration and amendment of their complaints, are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-12\"> The matter was not certified as a class action prior to dismissal of the complaint. <em>R. </em>4:32-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-21\"> <em>Rudbart </em>v. <em>N.
