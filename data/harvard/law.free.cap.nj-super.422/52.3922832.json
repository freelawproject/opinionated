The first order, issued January 18, 2008, found that neither I.S. nor E.S., the formerly-married biological parents of twin girls, N.S. and S.S. born in 1997, had the ability at that time to care for or meet the needs of their daughters. The order provided further that the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children necessitated their continued placement in the custody, care, and supervision of the Division of Youth and Family Services (Division). The order also included a provision directing the girls\u2019 continued placement in a residential facility. The second order, issued June 24, 2010, awarded custody of S.S. to E.S. as a result of the Family Part judge\u2019s conclusion that it would not be safe to return S.S. to I.S. and that it was in S.S.\u2019s best interest to remain in the custody of E.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We affirm both orders. We hold that a Family Part judge, conducting an abuse or neglect fact-finding hearing, may, without a finding of abuse or neglect, enter an order continuing the Division\u2019s care, supervision, and custody of a child, based upon its determination that the court\u2019s continued assistance is required pursuant to Title 9, N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21 to -8.73, or based upon a \u201cbest interests\u201d analysis under Tile 30, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11 to -14. We additionally hold that as long as appropriate procedural due process is satisfied and the requisite evidentiary standards and burdens of proof attendant to each statutory scheme are satisfied, hybrid proceedings, such as occurred here, will not be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Following their divorce, which was contentious, I.S. and E.S. continued to appear before the Family Part to resolve disputes primarily related to custody and parenting. The Division was familiar with the family through numerous referrals concerning the welfare of the twins. Upon investigation, the allegations were found to be unsubstantiated. Both girls were diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Anxiety and possibly Bipolar Disorder. They were being treated with a number of medications, which led defendant to suspect that the girls had become over-medicated. Additionally, both girls were placed, albeit separately, in special education classes, and individualized education plans were developed for them. School officials frequently contacted defendant regarding the twins\u2019 behavioral problems. Defendant, on her own initiative, attempted to secure assistance to address their behavioral issues, primarily working with the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD). She was not, however, successful in admitting the girls to any program.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On September 7, 2007, the in-home therapist reported to the Division that I.S. told her that N.S. had pulled out a knife and was walking around the house wielding it. I.S. also told the therapist that she had become overwhelmed by the girls\u2019 destructive behavior toward each other and toward their grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Several days later, the Division received another referral that the girls were wandering about the neighborhood unsupervised. On September 16, the Division received a referral <em>from </em>staff at Virtua Hospital that l.S. was there with the girls seeking their placement. A Division worker responded to the hospital and interviewed defendant, who indicated that DDD advised her to take the girls to the emergency room if she could not manage them and the girls would then be placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">As a result of the Division\u2019s investigation, it filed a complaint alleging abuse and neglect and seeking custody, care, and supervision of the children under Title 9 and Title 30. An Order to Show Cause (OTSC) hearing was conducted by the court on September 24. During the hearing, I.S., through her attorney, informed the court of her desire to have her daughters placed in a residential facility that could help them. She did not want them in a regular foster home, nor did she want the children separated. When the court advised that it could not make a finding of abuse or neglect because there had been no such allegations, the court inquired whether defendant was consenting to the Division\u2019s care, custody, and supervision of the children. The Division\u2019s attorney interjected that the complaint had also been brought under Title 30:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">And part of Title 30[,] one of the things is where a parent is either unwilling and also unable to provide the necessary care, maintenance, health and education, supervision of a minor child. And, I think, that\u2019s what the allegation, essentially'\u2014 as I understand the caseworker\u2019s testimony, that due to the children\u2019s extensive destructive behavior and the fact that mom might be overwhelmed with their care that, at least, at some point at this time, she\u2019s unable to provide for their proper protection and maintenance. That\u2019s not Title 9, that\u2019s not neglect and abuse. But it does allow and give the [c]ourt the authority and jurisdiction to be able to place the children in the custody of the Division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">In response to the court\u2019s inquiry, defendant\u2019s attorney represented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">My client, simply, wants help for her children. To the extent that the State would eome in and expedite those things that are necessary, she would have the [ejourt order Title 30 in on her behalf. But, to the extent that they will continue even past or should it develop that [DDD] actually goes ahead and does what\u2019s necessary, we would ask that DYFS, by order, step away and allow her \u2014 because she has all this time done everything, you know, in the way of petitioning and applying, and what have you, to have her children placed. She wishes to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>on her own, except that it\u2019s moving so slowly. And, in fact, there is an appeal because ... [the] A[ppellate] Division] has[ ] actually declined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">So, hopefully, DTPS can step in; do what\u2019s necessary; and step away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Later, defendant was given an opportunity to address the court and she explained in detail her frustration with the delay on the part of DDD in providing the needed services for her daughters. She told the court that she did not want her children taken away from her but instead wanted services for her children, the same kinds of services she, as a nurse, had observed other children receiving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">The thing is I asked for the services and the deal is you don\u2019t take kids away \u2014 the families who have sick children, they\u2019re getting services. They\u2019re getting a house, they\u2019re getting nurses coming into the house, they\u2019re getting therapy, multiple , therapy \u2014 it didn\u2019t happen to me. My kids were taken away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">I used to work with the kids, parents working, they have a nurse 24 hour's a day in their house provided by DYFS. Okay. Bayada nurses, they have therapy, they have respite care. They have all kinds of services. They just don\u2019t go \u2014 they are autistic kids to explain why my kids \u2014 they don\u2019t just take kids away. They place the help. They help them, so they place the person. And this is what I was asking about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Defendant\u2019s attorney requested a short return date, with the Division being directed to explore residential placement \u201cwith an. agreement in place that would allow [defendant] to be helped through some facility\u201d and also with the understanding that there would be \u201ca limited period in which [the Division] remained in her life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">The court entered its findings, under Title 30, that defendant was unable to keep the twins safe from each other and others safe from them, and ordered that the custody, care, and supervision of the twins be placed with the Division. The court instructed the Division to seek a residential treatment program as quickly as possible, and because defendant consented to a psychological evaluation, the order included a provision for defendant\u2019s psychological evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">When the matter was before the court the following month on October 29, the Division reported to the court that the twins had been accepted to the Holley House Center (Holley House), an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>eighteen to twenty-four-month residential treatment center. Defendant\u2019s attorney confirmed her client\u2019s approval of the placement. E.S. appeared at this hearing and, through counsel, requested that he be awarded custody of the children upon their discharge from the residential facility. The court indicated that it was not making any custody determination until the children completed their treatment in the residential facility. The court also learned that I.S. had undergone a psychological evaluation. Although the results were not available for the hearing, a report issued thereafter was essentially unremarkable except for test results of I.S.\u2019s stress level, which reportedly was \u201coff the charts.\u201d The twins were placed in Holley House on November 1, 2007. S.S. remained at the facility until early 2009 and N.S. remained until later that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The court conducted a fact-finding hearing on January 11, 2008, and rendered an oral decision on January 17, finding that \u201cunder Title 30 neither parent has the ability at this time to care for or meet the needs of both [of] these twins.\u201d The court expressly found that the evidence was insufficient to establish that either parent had abused or neglected the girls. The court continued the custody, care, and supervision of the children with the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In September 2008, the Division presented its first Title 30 permanency plan to the court. The plan recommended that S.S. be placed with E.S. and individual stabilization of N.S. upon completion of a residential program. The court accepted the permanency plan finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">[OJn the basis of the information that I have today[,] I am satisfied that the permanent plan for both girls, that being with [N.S.,] which is individual stabilization upon completion of a residential program[,] is appropriate and acceptable!,] and with [S.S.,] the reunification with [E.S.], again upon completion of the residential treatment program[,] is appropriate and acceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">I am satisfied that it is not and will not be safe to return the children home in the foreseeable future with respect to [N.S.] because she is in a program, is not making the necessary progress that would allow her to safely be returned to either one of her parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>With respect to [S.S.,] I\u2019m satisfied that the conditions or circumstances leading to the removal of [S.S.] are being corrected and that it will be safe within the time frames, because she will have completed her residential program, and [E.S.] will have been involved with her in therapy and that is where she wants to go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">I\u2019m satisfied the Division has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan and that includes psychological individual counseling, parenting skills for [I.S.], psychological \u2014 two psychological evaluations and family therapy for [E.S.] and a host of services for the girls including therapy, art therapy, and the Audrey Hepburn House and the psycho-social for [N.S.] Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">This is an exception to the requirement to file a termination of parental rights for the following compelling reasons which is that both girls have significant emotional problems and are currently in a residential facility and the plan is not termination of parental rights at this point but reunification with their parents at the appropriate time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Defendant objected to the plan to place S.S. with E.S. and also objected to having to travel to Pennsylvania to visit with S.S., although the court found she essentially traveled the same distance when visiting N.S. at the residential facility. S.S., in accordance with the permanency plan, was placed with E.S. in March 2009. On August 26, 2009, the court accepted the permanency plan for N.S. that called for her to be returned to her mother following her discharge from the residential treatment facility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">I\u2019m satisfied that the conditions or circumstances that led to the removal of the child are being corrected and that it will be safe to return the child home because she has received, meaning [N.S.] has \u2014 excuse me, received various psychological, psychiatric evaluations, sex abuse therapy, psycho/soeial evaluation and she has been receiving treatment at the Holley Center for quite a period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">In addition to that[,] the mother has received a psychological evaluation and she has followed through with parenting classes and there are services that will continue to be in place, will be provided through DDD and YCS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">I\u2019m satisfied also that reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan are appropriate as I have indicated the services that have been provided. This is an exception to the requirement to terminate parental rights in that [N.S.] is [eleven] years old, she does not wish to \u2014 for parental rights to be terminated and a transition is being implemented. She also has ... exhibited serious acting out and behavioral problems in the past which would not make her a good candidate for adoption at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">On October 29, 2009, the court conducted a compliance review hearing during which it advised that the litigation needed to be terminated at some point and that since \u201cone of the children has been placed with the parent from [whom] the child was not taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>from, we have to have a hearing.\u201d The court scheduled the hearing for January 8, 2010, and directed the parties to exchange discovery and to exchange their witness list one week prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The hearing commenced on January 27, rather than January 8. At the outset, the court advised the parties that it was going to \u201cset the parameters of what this hearing is about in accordance with G.M.\u201d:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">What this [cjourl must first determine is whether it is safe to return the children home and then, since there is a custody matter, determine whether there\u2019s ... been a substantial change in circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">If the answer to that is, \u201cyes,\u201d then we get into the custody hearing. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">So, just keep that in mind when everybody\u2019s asking their questions and trying to present because this [cjourt has to make specific findings with respect to the safety of the children to go home and the substantial change in circumstances from the time of the removal of the children to the present time, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">And, I\u2019m trying to think way back \u2014 substantial change in circumstances since September of '07.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The law guardian presented Dr. Ronald Gruen, a psychologist retained on behalf of the girls, who conducted a bonding evaluation between S.S. and E.S., and S.S. and I.S. Before Dr. Gruen commenced his testimony, however, defendant requested an adjournment of the matter in order to retain her own expert. Her attorney explained that defendant had just learned that the report was \u201cunfavorable\u201d and wanted an opportunity to retain a \u201cparental alienation syndrome expert.\u201d The court agreed to adjourn the matter but took Dr. Gruen\u2019s testimony at that time since the doctor was present and prepared to testify. Throughout Dr. Gruen\u2019s testimony, defendant repeatedly interrupted despite admonishments from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">In his testimony, Dr. Gruen expressed the opinion that it would be psychologically unsafe for S.S. to live with I.S. He reached this conclusion based upon the bonding evaluation he conducted, and described to the court the observations he made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Q Dr. Gruen, why would it be psychologically unsafe for [S.SJ to live with her mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">A Well, because I think right now there\u2019d be a lot of fighting between the two of them[,] [I.S. and S.S.] and behind closed doors[,] who\u2019s to know what\u2019s going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">I mean, I was a witness to what was ... argued about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Now, you know, Mom is in control of her own house. She closes the door, there\u2019s no witness to what\u2019s going on between her and [S.S.] And, you know, I ... just think that [S.S.] would be ... talking back and Mom would get very angry and it would escalate very quickly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">Q Dr. Gruen, would it be \u2014 would you say that when people come to see you for evaluations, they usually try to put their ... best forward?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">Q And, what does that say to you when ... [I.S.] came to see you[,3 that this is how she acted in front of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">A I would worry what\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m not there[,] when it\u2019s not\u2014 there\u2019s no witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">Q There\u2019s no psychologist sitting in the room with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">A Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">In Dr. Gruen\u2019s opinion, E.S. was in a much better position to address S.S.\u2019s needs than I.S. He expressed the view that I.S. \u201cwas more interested in being right and being heard and sort of overriding [S.S.] and what her feelings and her expressions were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">Upon completion of Dr. Gruen\u2019s testimony, the court adjourned the proceeding until March, but the hearing was rescheduled from that date because defendant retained new counsel and had not yet retained an expert. When the hearing resumed on June 24, defendant did not produce an expert witness. Kay Anderson, an investigator from the law guardian\u2019s office, testified regarding the home inspection she conducted of E.S.\u2019s residence, which she found to be appropriate. She also reported that S.S. was receiving specialized services through the school system. E.S. testified that S.S. was doing well and that he was receptive to all services that she would need. I.S. did not testify or produce any witnesses or other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court placed its decision orally on the record and focused upon two issues: (1) whether it would be safe to return S.S. to I.S.; and (2) whether it was in S.S.\u2019s best interest to be placed in I.S.\u2019s custody. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>concluded that it was neither \u201csafe to return S.S. to her mother\u2019s care nor to award custody of S.S. to I.S.\u201d In reaching its decision, the court credited Dr. Gruen\u2019s testimony and also noted its observations of I.S. throughout the course of the proceedings during which defendant repeatedly interrupted the hearings and appeared confrontational before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The court then engaged in a \u201cbest interest analysis,\u201d reviewing, for guidance, some of the statutory factors set forth under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(c) that courts must consider in rendering custody determinations. The court found that neither I.S. nor E.S. had the ability to agree, communicate or cooperate regarding S.S., but noted that E.S. made efforts to facilitate parenting time for defendant. The court also found that I.S. demonstrated she would not allow parenting time between E.S. and S.S. Additionally, the court noted that S.S. had substantially improved while in E.S.\u2019s care, and expressed her desire to live with E.S. rather than I.S., even if that meant she would not see N.S. The court noted further that S.S. had not had substantial contact with I.S. since her release from the residential treatment center, E.S. was a fit parent, and that I.S.\u2019s home environment would not benefit S.S. The court expressed that it had \u201cno doubt if [S.S.] were to go back with her mother, she would go back into a residential facility in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">After considering these factors, the court entered an order that S.S. \u201cremain in the legal and physical custody of E.S.\u201d and that N.S. remain in the \u201clegal and physical custody of I.S.\u201d The court made no order as to visitation. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">With respect to parenting time, and this is something that this [e]ourt maybe has done once before, and ... this [e]ourt does it with a heavy heart. I am not granting parenting time to either parent with the other child unless they agree to it amongst themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">I don\u2019t believe that [I.S. is I ever going to end this and think that with respect to [S.S.], it\u2019s just going to be harmful for her to continue to have contact with her mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">I\u2019m not forbidding any contact, and I want to make that clear. I am not forbidding any contact. I\u2019m just not establishing ... a parenting time order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s findings should be reversed and S.S. returned to [her] custody because, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-12 criteria, the Division did not prove that [she] was unable to provide the appropriate level of care to ensure the health and safety of her children.\u201d We reject this contention and conclude there was substantial credible evidence, clearly and convincingly demonstrating that returning S.S. to I.S. was not in S.S.\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">We begin by noting that- the facts in this matter are largely undisputed. The record amply demonstrates that I.S. was affirmatively engaged in seeking help for her daughters, but prior to the Division\u2019s involvement, she had been unsuccessful in her effort to have them placed in an appropriate residential facility where they could get the necessary help. It is also undisputed that the twins suffered from serious behavioral problems. I.S. acknowledged that she had been unable to prevent them from acting out. Many of the incidents of acting out occurred while I.S., a nurse, was at work and the twins were in the care of I.S.\u2019s parents, who were in their seventies at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u201cParents have a constitutionally protected right to maintain a relationship with their children.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.M., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>261, 279, 914 A.2d 1265 (2007). That right, however, is not absolute, and \u201cmust be balanced against the State\u2019s parens patriae responsibility to protect the welfare of children.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.L., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>596, 605, 926 A.2d 320 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-12 authorizes the Division to seek an order placing a child under its care and supervision or granting the Division custody of a child when a parent \u201cshall fail to ensure the health and safety of the child,\u201d and after an investigation, to be awarded care and supervision or custody of a child in order to \u201censure the health and safety of the child.\u201d I.S.\u2019s actions in taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the girls to the Virtua Hospital emergency room because she wanted them to get help, even if she did so based upon advice from DDD, supports the court\u2019s finding that defendant lacked the ability to care for S.S. and N.S. at the time they were removed from her custody. Defendant expressed her desire to have the children placed in a residential facility at the initial OTSC hearing conducted on September 24, 2007. At that time, the court found that defendant \u201cis unable to keep the children safe from each other and others safe from the children.\u201d The court also stated that it was not making a finding of abuse or neglect and expressed its belief that it appeared that defendant was \u201ctrying to get some help for her children.\u201d The following month, defendant\u2019s attorney reiterated to the court that it was defendant\u2019s desire to have the girls placed in a residential treatment facility, which occurred a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">When the court conducted its fact-finding hearing in January 2008, defendant\u2019s defense focused upon the absence of any evidence of abuse or neglect. The court agreed that the State failed to prove that defendant abused or neglected her daughters but did not dismiss the complaint, thereby \u201cinferentially concluding] that its assistance was required[.]\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.M., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>382, 401, 968 A.2d 698 (2009) (noting that \u201cbecause the trial court inferentially concluded that its assistance was required and also made a finding of abuse or neglect, dismissal was not appropriate.\u201d). In addition, beyond considering whether the State proved abuse and neglect under Title 9, the court, pursuant to Title 30, also considered whether I.S. and E.S. had the ability to care for or meet the needs of the twins and determined, by clear and convincing evidence that they could not. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. R.D., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>88, 113, 23 A.3d 352 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In essence, although designated as a fact-finding proceeding, the court presided over two statutorily similar but separate actions. The focus of proceedings initiated under Title 9 is assurance that \u201cthe lives of innocent children are immediately safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>guarded from further injury[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.8a. The focus of a proceeding brought pursuant to Title 30, however, is \u201cwhether or not it is in the child\u2019s best interest to preserve the family unit,\u201d with the child\u2019s health and safety being the paramount concern of our Legislature. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-1(a). Thus, a critical distinction between the two proceedings is the sense of urgency of proceedings commenced under Title 9, in contrast to proceedings commenced under Title 30, which may take place over a longer period of time in order to ensure the permanent safety and well-being of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Thus, a fact-finding hearing is a statutorily mandated proceeding under Title 9 to determine whether a child has been abused or neglected. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.44. At the fact-finding hearing, the State must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there has been an act of abuse or neglect committed by the parent or other person charged with a legal duty of care for the minor child. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46. \u201cIf facts sufficient to sustain the complaint under [Title 9] are not established, <em>or the court concludes that its assistance is not required on the record before it, </em>the court shall dismiss the complaint and shall state the grounds for the dismissal.\u201d N.J<em>.S.A. </em>9:6-8.50c (emphasis added). It is clear from this language that under Title 9, a court is not limited to a finding of abuse or neglect before exercising continuing jurisdiction over a proceeding instituted under Title 9. <em>G.M., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 399-400, 968 A.2d 698. However, in the absence of a finding of abuse or neglect, the court must be satisfied its assistance is still required before continuing to exercise jurisdiction over the matter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\"> On the other hand, a proceeding brought pursuant to Title 30 may arise out of myriad of circumstances that may be minimally intrusive, such as when the Division provides counseling and referral services to families in need; or, the Division\u2019s involvement may arise under more intrusive circumstances, such as when the Division effectuates an emergency removal or ultimately seeks guardianship and termination of parental rights. The latter pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>ceedings \u201cimplicate core constitutional rights ... governed by the clear and convincing evidence standard.\u201d <em>R.D., supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 113, 23 A.3d 352.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">As a practical matter, Title Nine and Title Thirty proceedings can be consolidated. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.24(e) (\u201cAny [abuse or neglect] hearing held before the Family Part may serve as a permanency hearing for the child to provide judicial review and approval of a permanency plan if all the [review and approval] requirements [under Title Thirty] are met.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 113, 23 A.3d 352.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Consequently, the court\u2019s jurisdiction here was appropriately grounded under two concurrent but separate statutory schemes. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. K.M., </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>546, 559-60 (1994). Although the Division\u2019s burden of proof at a fact-finding hearing is the preponderance of the evidence standard, the court applied the Title 30 clear and convincing standard in finding that neither parent had the ability to care for or meet the needs of the twins at that point. There was substantial credible evidence in the record to support this finding, which is entitled to our deference. Such an approach is consistent with our general recognition that \u201c[bjecause of the family courts\u2019 special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters, appellate courts should accord deference to family court factfinding,\u201d and the conclusions that flow logically from those findings of fact, rather than engaging in second-guessing. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 413, 713 A.2d 390 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">What followed after the fact-finding hearing was a series of proceedings mandated under Title 9 or Title 30, or both: (1) permanency hearings under Title 30; (2) dispositional hearings under Title 9; and (3) compliance review proceedings and custody determinations under both Title 9 and Title 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Just shy of one year following the twins\u2019 removal from I.S.\u2019s custody, the court conducted a permanency hearing and approved the recommended permanency plan for the twins. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-61.2. Additional permanency hearings were held thereafter, and on August 26, 2009, the court conducted another permanency hearing in anticipation of N.S.\u2019s release from the residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>treatment facility. Upon its conclusion, the court approved the recommendation that N.S. be returned to I.S.\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">On January 27, 2010, the court commenced what it characterized as a <em>\u201cGM </em>/custody/disposition\u201d hearing that it conducted over two non-consecutive days. The dispositional hearing, like a fact-finding hearing, finds its legitimacy under Title 9. Its purpose is to determine whether a child who has been in the care, supervision, and custody of the Division \u201cmay be safely returned to the custody of the parent from whom the child was removed.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. N.D., </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 107, 8 A.3d 809 (App.Div.2010) (citing <em>G.M., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 968 A.2d 698).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Following the dictates of <em>G.M., </em>the court first determined that it was not safe to return S.S. to I.S. When a court determines that a child may not be safely returned to the parent from whom the child has been removed, the court may proceed with a guardianship action and termination of parental rights. <em>R.D., supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 121-22, 23 A.3d 352. An exception to initiating such an action exists when \u201cthe child\u2019s needs for stability and attachment\u201d are met by the non-custodial parent or other relative. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A.W., </em>103 <em>N.J. 591, 609, </em>512 A.2d 438 (1986) (quotation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">This is precisely what occurred here. Dr. Gruen expressed the opinion that it was \u201cpsychologically unsafe\u201d to return S.S. to I.S. That opinion, which the court credited, did not lead the court to conclude that termination of parental rights should be initiated. Rather, the court expressly noted that S.S.\u2019s needs were being met by a non-custodial parent. <em>Ibid. </em>It was therefore appropriate for the court to then consider, as part of its \u201cbest interests\u201d analysis, those factors a court would typically consider in making any custody determination, as outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">In that regard, the court found that there was no ability between the parents to communicate with each other, notwithstanding that E.S. attempted to facilitate parenting time and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>communicate with I.S. since S.S. had been in his custody. The court found that the evidence indicated that S.S. had made great progress while living with E.S. The court specifically noted that S.S. had gone from being uncontrollable in the community and requiring residential placement, to being part of the community and doing well in school. Further, the court found that S.S. was not exhibiting any behavioral problems that E.S. could not handle. The court surmised that S.S. probably wanted contact with her sister, but that would require unwanted interaction with her mother. The court also noted that S.S. \u201chas made it absolutely clear\u201d that \u201c[n]ot only does she want to reside with her father, she does not wish to have contact with her mother.\u201d The court indicated that because S.S. was nearly thirteen years old, it would take her wishes into account. Finally, the court noted that I.S. had refused to travel to Pennsylvania to visit with S.S. since she was discharged from the residential facility and living with E.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We are satisfied the court\u2019s custody determination, informed by the court\u2019s consideration of S.S.\u2019s best interest, was also supported by substantial credible evidence in the record, and those findings are also entitled to our deference. <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 413, 713 A.2d 390. Nor did the proceedings suffer from any of the procedural infirmities that the Court, in <em>R.D., </em>found militated against according preclusive effect to a finding of abuse and neglect in a Title 9 proceeding for purposes of satisfying the first prong of a termination of parental rights proceeding under Title 30. <em>R.D., supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 110-11, 23 A.3d 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Defendant was on notice at the October 29, 2009 compliance review hearing that the court would be conducting a hearing to address the custody of S.S. because S.S. was not returned to defendant\u2019s custody upon her discharge from Holley House. When the hearing commenced on January 27, 2010, the court announced that the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether it was safe to return the children and, since \u201cthere is a custody matter, determine whether there\u2019s ... been a substantial change in circumstances.\u201d The court alerted the parties that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>conducting the proceedings, it would be guided by <em>G.M. </em>Then, at defendant\u2019s request, the court adjourned the hearing after Dr. Gruen completed his testimony. Despite having the benefit of Dr. Gruen\u2019s testimony and expert report, and what turned out to be an additional six months in which to retain an expert, defendant returned to court in June without having retained an expert to rebut any of Dr. Gruen\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">To summarize, we are satisfied that there were no procedural or due process infirmities resulting from the court simultaneously presiding over Title 9 and Title 30 proceedings throughout the course of the proceedings. Defendant was represented by counsel throughout the three years that the matter was pending before the Family Part. Defendant had ample notice of all proceedings and the nature of the proceedings to be conducted at each hearing. Defendant was afforded full discovery of reports and other documents upon which the Division relied in all proceedings before the court. The court applied the requisite evidentiary burden of proof standards and, at the fact-finding proceeding where the standard of proof is only by a \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d the court applied the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d burden of proof standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">While the Title 30 and Title 9 proceedings overlapped, the court carefully navigated through the proofs required to prove the allegations alleged under each statute, and applied the appropriate standard of proof in determining whether the Division satisfied its burden in connection with both actions. While we owe no special deference to the court\u2019s legal conclusions, we are in agreement with those conclusions. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). Once again, this case illustrates the parallel but not necessarily \u201ccongruent tracks of Title 9 and Title 30 proceedings[,]\u201d which prompted the Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion that the Legislature \u201ccombine both avenues of child advocacy under a single title[.]\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of G.S., III, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>168, 179, 644 A.2d 1088 (1994); <em>see also New Jersey Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A.P., </em>408 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 265, 974 A.2d 466 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied., </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>153, 988 A.2d 1176 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Although not separately addressed in point headings in accordance with <em>Rule </em>2:6-2, defendant contends the entry of a no visitation order is the equivalent of a \u201cde facto\u201d termination of her parental rights. The record clearly indicates that S.S. had no desire to visit with I.S., and N.S. had no desire to visit with E.S. Both girls held to this view, notwithstanding nearly two years of therapeutic treatment in a residential facility and continuing treatment on an outpatient basis. At the time of the June 24, 2010 hearing, the twins were nearly thirteen years old. The same judge who presided over the matter for a number of years determined that coerced visitation was not in the best interests of the children and declined to enter an order compelling visitation with either parent. The trial judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the case\u201d is entitled to our deference on this issue. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.P., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>88, 104, 952 A.2d 436 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Defendant also contends the court\u2019s findings should not have included its assessment of defendant\u2019s in-court behavior. Based upon our review of the record here, we are satisfied the court did not err in considering defendant\u2019s in-court behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Dr. Gruen testified that defendant exhibited confrontational behavior toward S.S. during the bonding evaluation, which led to his concern as to how defendant would act toward S.S. behind closed doors. There was also other evidence presented that defendant, on occasion, displayed similar qualities during her interactions with staff at the Holley House Center. In <em>State v. Adames, </em>409 <em>N.J.Super. </em>40, 60, 975 A.2d 1023 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>504, 983 A.2d 1112 (2009), we recognized \u201cthe impossibility of ehminating the jury\u2019s consideration of a non-testifying defendant\u2019s demeanor and behavior during trial[.]\u201d We emphasized this impossibility must not open the door to improper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ly considering a defendant\u2019s behavior or demeanor which occurs when the conduct is not an unsworn attempt to influence the jury. <em>Ibid. </em>These cautionary instructions apply to a trial judge when the judge is the trier of fact. The record here reveals that defendant, who was represented by counsel throughout most of the proceedings that occurred following the removal of the children from her custody, repeatedly ignored admonishments by the court and deliberately injected her unsworn comments into the various proceedings. During the fact-finding hearing, she interrupted witnesses and openly challenged their testimony. She also continuously voiced her disagreement with representations being made to the court by counsel. It is evident from the record that defendant\u2019s conduct was an \u201cunsworn attempt\u201d on her part \u201cto influence the [trier of fact].\u201d <em>State v. Rivera, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 604, 602 A.2d 775 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>12, 611 A.2d 650 (1992). The court\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s behavior under these particular circumstances, is understandable. Assuming, however, the court erred in considering defendant\u2019s unsworn conduct, the error was harmless. There was Dr. Gruen\u2019s testimony describing defendant\u2019s conduct during the bonding evaluation, which the court credited, and other evidence admitted, without objection, to support the court\u2019s findings. At best, the court\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s conduct merely corroborated the competent evidence already before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-12\"><em>N.J.
