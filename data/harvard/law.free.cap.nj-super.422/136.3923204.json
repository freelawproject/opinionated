(Mogul Express), an Indian restaurant, filled their order for vegetarian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>sarnosas with meat-filled sarnosas<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> causing spiritual injuries resulting in damages. Plaintiffs explain their injuries and damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">Hindu vegetarians believe that if they eat meat, they become involved in the sinful cycle of inflicting pain, injury and death on God\u2019s creatures, and that it affects the karma and dharma, or purity of the soul. Hindu scriptures teach that the souls of those who eat meat can never go to God after death, which is the ultimate goal for Hindus. The Hindu religion does not excuse accidental consumption of meat products. One who commits the religious violation of eating meat, knowingly or unknowingly, is required to participate in a religious ceremony at a site located along the Ganges River in Haridwar, Uttranchal, India, to purify himself. The damages sought by plaintiffs included compensation for the emotional distress they suffered, as well as economic damages they would incur by virtue of having to participate in the required religious cleansing ceremony in India.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that Moghul Express\u2019s motion for summary judgment was prematurely decided before discovery had commenced and that the motion judge legally erred in her decision dismissing each of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Viewed most favorably to plaintiffs, <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Rule </em>4:46-2(c), the motion record discloses the following. According to the certification of plaintiff Durgesh Gupta, filed in opposition to summary judgment, on August 10, 2009, he and plaintiff Sharad Agarwal placed an order for vegetarian sarnosas at Moghul Express, a restaurant located in Edison, New Jersey. At the time that the order was placed, Gupta and Agarwal advised Mogul Express\u2019s employee that they required vegetarian sarnosas, because they were being purchased for a group of individuals who were strict vegetarians. The two men were informed that they should not be concerned because the restaurant did not make meat-filled sarnosas. One-half hour later, the men returned to the restaurant to pick up their order and were handed a tray that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>written on its top \u201cVEG sarnosas,\u201d and they were again assured of the vegetarian nature of the food.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">After plaintiffs had consumed some of the sarnosas, some plaintiffs became concerned that the sarnosas might contain meat. They called Moghul Express to verily the food\u2019s content, and they were again assured that Moghul did not make meat-filled sarnosas. Although the plaintiffs continued eating for a time, eventually they determined to return the remaining sarnosas to Moghul Express to verity their content. Once there, Moghul Express\u2019s employee advised them that the sarnosas, indeed, contained meat. As a consequence of eating the meat-filled sarnosas, plaintiffs were spiritually injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In addition to the certification, the plaintiffs offered a copy of a Moghul Express menu that separately listed appetizers as \u201cVegetarian\u201d and as \u201cNon-Vegetarian.\u201d Chinese appetizers were similarly labeled as \u201c(Veg.)\u201d and \u201c(Non-Veg.),\u201d and the menu contained a separate category labeled \u201cVegetable Entr\u00e9e.\u201d A listing for \u201cVegetable Sarnosa\u201d appeared among the vegetarian appetizers; no listing for meat sarnosa was present among the non-vegetarian appetizers. Plaintiffs also offered an e-mail from the Director of the Edison Division of Health Food Services to plaintiff, Sachin Garg, stating that he had verified that Moghul Express maintained separate cooking facilities and utensils for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The record also contains the certification of Kamal Arora, a partner in defendant Asha Enterprises L.L.C. He stated that, on the day in question, Moghul Express received, at approximately the same time, the order by Sharad Agarwal for vegetable sarno-sas and an order from another customer for meat sarnosas. As directed, thirty minutes later, Agarwal picked up his order, fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>lowed by the other customer. However, the other customer decided to eat one of the sarnosas in his car, realized that he had been given a tray of vegetable sarnosas, and returned the order to Moghul Express. Upon determining that the two orders had been mixed up, Moghul Express prepared another order of vegetable sarnosas and delivered it to Agarwal, who accepted it without payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Plaintiffs do not dispute the acceptance of the second order of sarnosas, the fact that they were vegetable-filled, and that no payment for them was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">When presented with this evidence, the motion judge converted what initially had been a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) into a motion for summary judgment pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:46-2(c), determined that further discovery was not necessary to her decision, and granted the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In deciding this appeal, we employ the same standard applicable to the motion judge. <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>608, 713 A.2d 499 (1998). We focus first on plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on products liability. The New Jersey Products Liability Act (PLA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to -11, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">A manufacturer or seller of a product shall be liable in a product liability action only if the claimant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the product causing the harm was not reasonably fit, suitable or safe for its intended purpose because it: a. deviated from the design specifications, formulae, or performance standards of the manufacturer or from otherwise identical units manufactured to the same manufacturing specifications or formulae, or b. failed to contain adequate warnings or instructions, or c. was designed in a defective manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\"><em>[N.J.S.</em>A. 2A:58C-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c \u2018[w]ith passage of the Product Liability Act, ... there came to be one unified, statutorily defined theory of recovery for harm caused by a product, and that theory is, for the most part, identical to strict liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Lead Paint, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>405, 436, 924 A.2d 484 (2007) (quoting William A. Dreier, et al., <em>New Jersey Products Liability &amp; Tort Law, </em>\u00a7 1:2-1 (2007)). \u201cThe language chosen by the Legislature in enacting the PLA is both expansive and inclusive, encompassing virtually all possible causes of action relating to harms caused by consumer and other products. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1b(3) (defining \u201cproduct liability action\u201d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 924 A.2d 484. Indeed, the definition to which the Court referred provides: \u201c \u2018Product liability action\u2019 means any claim or action brought by a claimant for harm caused by a product, irrespective of the theory underlying the claim, except actions for harm caused by breach of an express warranty.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Thus, the Court has held that the PLA subsumes claims for a defective product under the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to-20, and that Act cannot provide an alternative remedy for injury. <em>Sinclair v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc., </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>51, 54, 948 A.2d 587 (2008). It similarly subsumes claims of defect sounding in negligence and breach of implied warranty. <em>Koruba v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 396 N.J.Super. </em>517, 531, 935 A.2d 787 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. denied, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>272, 944 A.2d 32 (2008). On this basis, we affirm the dismissal of the counts of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleging negligence, violations of the CFA and breach of implied warranty insofar as they are based upon product defect. We defer our discussion of plaintiffs\u2019 negligence and CFA claims that are not premised upon product defect until later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The PLA is applicable to food cooked and sold by restaurants. <em>See Koster v. Scotch </em>Assocs., 273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>102, 110, 640 A.2d 1225 (Law Div.1993); <em>see also </em>Senate Judiciary Committee, <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 2805 </em>(1987); <em>cf. McGuinness v. Wakefern Corp., </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>339, 341, 608 A.2d 447 (Law Div.1991) (action against grocery store by a family that had contracted salmonella poisoning after eating lasagna prepared from ingredients purchased from it); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-5c (barring award of punitive damages for defective food or food additive that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>was subject to premarket approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration). However, the PLA is inapplicable as grounds for recovery in the present case because plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not related to a defect in the sarnosas themselves, which were safe, edible and fit for human consumption, but rather to allegations that they were supplied the wrong product. As such, the present case is similar to <em>Universal Underwriters Insurance Group v. Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company, </em>103 F.Supp.2d 744 (D.N.J.2000), a ease in which an insurer\u2019s cause of action for products liability against a utility company following destruction of a building by fire caused by electricity was dismissed. In reaching the conclusion that dismissal of that claim was warranted, the judge reasoned that \u201cthe facts that Plaintiff cites in support of [its claim of product defect] focus not on any defect inherent in the product itself, but rather in PSE &amp; G\u2019s alleged failure to act promptly and efficiently in shutting off its electrical service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747. Similarly, here, plaintiffs\u2019 claims focus on the conduct of Moghul Express\u2019s employees in supplying the wrong order, not on any \u201cdefect\u201d in the sarnosas. Thus summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 claims of products liability and breach of implied warranty is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We turn next to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Moghul Express violated the CFA \u201cfor fraudulently and/or deceptively advertising the sale of vegetarian food to the Plaintiffs and instead, providing Plaintiffs with non-vegetarian food containing meat products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The CFA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing! 1 concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise ... whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>To make out a prima facie case under the CFA, private plaintiffs must present evidence of (1) \u201cunlawful conduct by defendant;\u201d (2) \u201can ascertainable loss by plaintiff;\u201d and (3) \u201ca causal relationship between the unlawful conduct and the ascertainable loss.\u201d <em>Bosland v. Warnock Dodge, Inc., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>543, 557, 964 A.2d 741 (2009) (citations omitted). We have held that unlawful conduct can consist of (1) \u201can affirmative misrepresentation, even if not made with knowledge of its falsity or with an intent to deceive;\u201d (2) \u201cthe knowing omission or concealment of a material fact, accompanied by an intent that others rely upon the omission or concealment;\u201d or (3) \u201ca violation of a specific regulation promulgated under the CFA.\u201d <em>Stoecker v. Echevarria, </em>408 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597, 623, 975 A.2d 975 (App.Div.) (citations omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>549, 985 A.2d 647 (2009); <em>see also Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs Local No. 68 Welfare Fund v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>372, 389, 929 A.2d 1076 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In contrast to a claim of an actionable omission, which requires a finding that the defendant acted knowingly, one who makes an affirmative misrepresentation is liable under the CFA even in the absence of knowledge of the falsity of the misrepresentation, negligence, or the intent to deceive. <em>Ji v. Palmer, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 461, 755 A.2d 1221 (App.Div.2000). Moreover, oral misrepresentations are covered by the CFA to the same extent as written misrepresentations. <em>Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>618, 641, 524 A.2d 841 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>148, 526 A.2d 209 (1987). A misrepresentation must be one that is material to the transaction and that is a statement of fact, found to be false, made to induce the buyer to make a purchase. <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, 148 N.J. </em>582, 607, 691 A.2d 350 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The CFA specifically enumerates \u201c[a]cts constituting misrepresentation of identity of food,\u201d providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">The identity of said food or food products shall be deemed misrepresented if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkT\">a. Its description is false or misleading in any particular;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>b. Its description omits information which by its omission renders the description false or misleading in any particular;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">c. It is served, sold, or distributed under the name of another food or food product;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">d. It purports to be or is represented as a food or food product for which a definition of identity and standard of quality has been established by custom and usage unless it conforms to such definition and standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2.10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We disagree with the determination of the motion judge that \u201cplaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts to establish an unlawful practice nor are there any facts that could be developed through discovery.\u201d We conclude that the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, together with their supporting evidence, provide prima facie evidence of misrepresentations by Moghul Express\u2019s employees under either <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2.10. In particular, we note plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that they were assured that Moghul Express did not make meat sarnosas, that they were repeatedly told that the sarnosas purchased by them were vegetarian, and that \u201cVEG Sarnosa\u201d was written on the container in which their order was packaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">However, we do not find any evidence of an ascertainable loss on plaintiffs\u2019 part. In that regard, the CFA provides that \u201c[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of moneys or property ... as the result of the use or employment by another person of any method, act, or practice declared unlawful under this act ... may bring an action\u201d based on the Act, and if successful, the court \u201cshall ... award threefold the damages sustained[,]\u201d and \u201cthe court shall also award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, filing fees and reasonable costs of suit.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Adequately alleging an ascertainable loss is a prerequisite for maintenance of a private action to remedy a violation of the CFA. <em>Weinberg v. Sprint Corp., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>233, 251, 801 A.2d 281 (2002); <em>Laufer v. U.S. Life Ins. Co., </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 186, 896 A.2d 1101 (App.Div.2006) (holding that the claim of loss is \u201cpurely a \u2018standing' requirement\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Act does not require a private plaintiffs claim of ascertainable loss to \u2018ultimately prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>successful.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). In the present matter, plaintiffs have not pled or provided evidence of any \u201closs of moneys or property.\u201d Indeed, it would be difficult for them to do so, since unrefuted evidence demonstrates that, following recognition by the restaurant of its mistake, Moghul Express furnished an order of conforming sarnosas to plaintiffs without cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Plaintiffs claim that they have sufficiently plead ascertainable loss by seeking damages in the amount of the cost of a trip to India to undergo a purification ritual. However, what they are seeking is the cost of cure for an alleged spiritual injury that cannot be categorized as either a loss of moneys or property. We recognize in this regard that in <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. 2, 22, </em>647 A.2d 454 (1994), the Supreme Court, in dictum, held that the projected costs of repair of improperly installed kitchen fixtures and wiring constituted an \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d However, the cost of cure in that circumstance was the result of the loss of the value of property that had been rendered unsafe and unsightly by the work of the contractor employed by Sears. Here, an underlying loss of the value of property cannot be demonstrated. Absent supporting precedent, we are unwilling to expand the definition of ascertainable loss to cover the injuries alleged by plaintiffs in this matter. Indeed, case law demonstrates that such a step would be improper. <em>See Gennari, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 612-13, 691 A.2d 350 (holding that non-economic losses are not recoverable under the CFA); <em>Cole v. Laughrey Funeral Home, </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 144-45, 869 A.2d 457 (App.Div.2005) (holding that damages for emotional distress are not recoverable as ascertainable losses under the CFA). Because plaintiffs are unable to present sufficient evidence of an ascertainable loss to survive a motion for summary judgment, <em>Laufer, supra, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 187, 896 A.2d 1101, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 CFA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">We next address plaintiffs\u2019 claims of negligence resulting in spiritual injury and negligent infliction of emotional distress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>which we regard as essentially equivalent in their import. Those claims were dismissed by the motion judge on the ground that plaintiffs could not establish a duty owed to them by Moghul Express that had been breached by it. The judge determined that she would \u201cnot create new laws that protect religious dietary concerns when there is no precedent for such an act.\u201d We affirm but on somewhat different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">A duty is an obligation imposed by law requiring one party \u201cto conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts: Lawyer\u2019s Edition </em>356 (W. Page Keeton ed., 5th ed. 1984). The recognition or establishment of a legal duty in tort law is generally a matter for the court to decide. <em>Clohesy v. Food Circus Supermarkets, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>496, 502, 694 A.2d 1017 (1997). The question of whether a duty exists is generally analyzed in light of considerations of fairness and public policy that \u201c \u2018involve[ ] identifying, weighing, and balancing several factors \u2014 the relationship of the parties, the nature of the attendant risk, the opportunity and ability to exercise care, and the public interest in the proposed solution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. EMAR Group, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>182, 194, 638 A.2d 1288 (1994) (quoting <em>Hopkins v. Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 439, 625 A.2d 1110 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The ability to foresee injury to a potential plaintiff does not in itself establish the existence of a duty. <em>Goldberg v. Housing Auth., </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583, 186 A.2d 291 (1962). However, foreseeability is a crucial element in determining whether imposition of a duty on an alleged tortfeasor is appropriate. <em>Carter, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 194, 638 A.2d 1288 (discussing \u201cforeseeability as a \u2018duty\u2019 determinant\u201d). \u201cSubsumed in the concept of foreseeability are many of the concerns we acknowledge as relevant to the imposition of a duty: the relationship between the plaintiff and the tortfeasor, the nature of the risk, and the ability and opportunity to exercise care.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>In a ease such as this in which negligent infliction of emotional distress is alleged \u201c \u2018[IJiability should depend on the defendant\u2019s foreseeing fright or shock severe enough to cause substantial injury in a person normally constituted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Decker v. Princeton Packet, Inc., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>418, 429, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989) (quoting <em>Caputzal v. The Lindsay Co., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>69, 76, 222 A.2d 513 (1966)). The Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">While the foreseeability of injurious consequences is a constituent element in a tort action, foreseeability of injury is particularly important in the tort of negligent infliction of emotional harm. This reflects the concern over the genuineness of an injury consisting of emotional distress without consequent physical injury. In these situations, there must be \u201can especial likelihood of genuine and serious mental distress, arising from special circumstances, which serves as a guarantee that the claim is not spurious.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 54 at 362. In emotional distress cases, there has been \u201ca constant concern about the genuineness of the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 429-30, 561 A.2d 1122 (quoting <em>Buckley v.

In <em>Falzone v. Busch, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>559, 569, 214 A.2d 12 (1965) the Court held that a plaintiff could recover for emotional injury, even if unaccompanied by physical impact, provided that the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct placed the plaintiff in \u201ca reasonable fear of immediate personal injury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[A]fter <em>Falzone, </em>courts considered emotional distress that- accrued to any plaintiff who was within the \u2018zone of risk\u2019 created by the negligent conduct to be a foreseeable damage arising from the negligent conduct, so long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>as substantial bodily injury or sickness also resulted from the fright.\u201d <em>Jablonowska v. Suther, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>91, 103, 948 A.2d 610 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">A cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress has also been recognized in \u201cbystander\u201d cases in which the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct caused death or serious bodily to one with whom the bystander shared a marital or intimate family relationship, the bystander contemporaneously observed the death or injury, and the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress. <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 97, 417 A.2d 521 (1980); <em>see also Carey v. Lovett, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>44, 62, 622 A.2d 1279 (1993) (recognizing claim of emotional distress arising out of injury to or death of a fetus). However, the Court has limited the independent tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress to these two basic fact patterns. <em>Jablonowska, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 948 A.2d 610. The claims of plaintiffs in this case fit into neither of these categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Further, in the case of a <em>Portee </em>claim, the plaintiff need not demonstrate that the emotional distress resulted in physical injury, but only that it resulted in severe mental or emotional harm, whereas a plaintiff asserting a Falzone-type claim must demonstrate that his or her emotional distress resulted in \u201csubstantial bodily injury or sickness.\u201d <em>Falzone, supra, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 569, 214 A.2d 12. <em>See also Abouzaid v.

Even if we were to find plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims cognizable, they have offered no proof in connection with Mogul Express\u2019s motion for summary judgment that would satisfy the relevant damages standard, despite the fact that such proof, if it exists, lies within their control and does not require the opportunity to conduct discovery. <em>Cf.
