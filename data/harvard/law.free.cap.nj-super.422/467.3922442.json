We conclude that such a contract does not constitute a \u201csale of merchandise\u201d as defined in the CFA and therefore cannot provide a basis for a CFA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">Plaintiff Princeton Health Care System (PHCS) is a nonprofit corporation that provides healthcare services. Defendant Nets-mart New York (Netsmart) is engaged in the business of provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ing computer software products and services to healthcare facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Sometime in 2003, PHCS decided to upgrade the computer and medical billing system at Princeton House Behavioral Health Facility (Princeton House), which is a PHCS satellite facility that provides healthcare services to patients suffering from mental illnesses and addictions. On January 28, 2004, Princeton House distributed a request for proposals for what it described as a \u201cBehavioral Health Information System\u201d to companies that provide the products and services required for such an upgrade in its computer system. This request, which PHCS\u2019s computer consultant, ACS Consultants, assisted Princeton House in preparing, contained detailed specifications any proposal was required to meet and an outline of the criteria Princeton House would use in selecting a company for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On February 25, 2004, Netsmart submitted a 149-page response to this request for proposals. Various other companies also submitted responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Princeton House subsequently engaged in a lengthy process of evaluation of these responses. During this process, representatives of Princeton House and Netsmart held meetings regarding Netsmart\u2019s proposal and representatives of Princeton House visited other healthcare facilities that use computer systems supplied by Netsmart. The parties also engaged in negotiations regarding the terms of a proposed contract, in which PHCS\u2019s computer consultant, ACS, and its legal counsel were active participants. In the course of those negotiations, the system Netsmart proposed was expanded to include a software application called eMar (Electronic Medication Administration Record), which was designed to allow nurses and other authorized staff to chart the administration of medication online.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">On December 21, 2006, nearly three years after Princeton House distributed the request for proposals to potential suppliers of an upgraded computer system for its facility, Princeton House selected Netsmart to provide this system. Consequently, Prince<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ton House entered into a contract with Netsmart that spelled out Netsmart\u2019s obligations with respect to the installation of its Avatar computer system and integration of that system into the existing computer system at Princeton House and Princeton House\u2019s obligations to work with Netsmart in implementing and testing the system and training Princeton House employees in its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">There were substantial delays in the implementation of the Netsmart system at the Princeton House facility. There are significant disagreements between the parties concerning responsibility for those delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The parties held a meeting on June 5, 2008 in an effort to resolve their differences and to move forward with performance under the contract, but Princeton House was not satisfied with Netsmart\u2019s responses to its concerns. Consequently, on July 8, 2008, Princeton House sent a letter to Netsmart stating that it \u201cdeemed Netsmart to be in default of its obligations\u201d and terminating the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Thereafter, PHCS brought this action against Netsmart. PHCS\u2019s complaint asserted claims for breach of contract; violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; rescission based on Netsmart\u2019s alleged fraud in inducing Princeton House to enter into the contract; and violation of the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Shortly after filing its answer and a counterclaim, Netsmart filed a motion for summary judgment, which was supported by certifications and a substantial quantity of exhibits. PHCS submitted certifications and exhibits in opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">On October 29, 2010, the trial court issued an oral opinion and order denying Netsmart\u2019s motion \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">However, Netsmart interpreted certain of the trial court\u2019s comments in denying its motion to dismiss PHCS\u2019s CFA claim as a dispositive ruling that PHCS had a viable CFA claim that it would be entitled to submit to the trier of fact, and sought clarification from the court. Specifically, Netsmart pointed to the court\u2019s statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>... [PHCS] is correct in pointing out that the services provided by [Netsmart] fall within the CFA\u2019s definition of goods and services as computer software and services. The computer software [Netsmart] sold to [PHCS] is available to the public at large and as a business entity the plaintiff is entitled to relief under the CFA if a jury were to determine such relief was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The trial court agreed with Netsmart\u2019s interpretation of its original opinion and entered an amended order on December 6, 2010, which not only denied Netsmart\u2019s motion for summary judgment but also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">... Partial summary judgment is hereby granted to plaintiff on the issue of its standing to sue under the Consumer Fraud Act as well as on the Act\u2019s applicability to the commercial subject matter of this lawsuit. Said rulings are based on the Court\u2019s express finding that the goods in issue are marketed and sold to the general public, as set forth on the record on November 19, 2010 and October 29, 2010, and the reasons expressed by the Court on those dates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Netsmart filed a motion for leave to appeal from this order, which we denied. Netsmart then filed a motion for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Court granted this motion and remanded the appeal to us \u201cto consider on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Initially, we note that Netsmart\u2019s interlocutory appeal is limited to those parts of the December 6, 2010 order that denied its motion to dismiss PHCS\u2019s CFA claim and granted PHCS partial summary judgment on that claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Netsmart does not appeal from the denial without prejudice of its motion to dismiss PHCS\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The primary operative section of the CFA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate, or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful prac-tice____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The CFA also provides that \u201c[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of any method, act or practice declared unlawful under [the CFA]\u201d may bring a private cause of action for that alleged CFA violation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19. A party who prevails in such an action is entitled to treble damages and reasonable attorneys fees. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The CFA defines a \u201cperson\u201d who may be a victim of a CFA violation as including \u201cany natural person or his legal representative, partnership, corporation, company, trust, business entity or association, ...\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1(d). We have previously held that under this definition of \u201cperson,\u201d a corporation may maintain an action for a violation of the CFA. <em>See, e.g., Coastal Grp., Inc. v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 179-80, 643 A.2d 649 (App.Div.1994); <em>Dreier Co. v. Unitronix Corp., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>260, 272-73, 527 A.2d 875 (App.Div.1986); <em>Hundred E. Credit Corp. v. Eric Schuster Corp., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 354\u201457, 515 A.2d 246 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>60-61, 526 A.2d 146 (1986); <em>D'Ercole Sales, Inc. v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 23-24, 501 A.2d 990 (App.Div.1985). As we explained in <em>Hundred E. Credit Corp., </em>\u201c[e]ven the most world-wise business entity can be inexperienced and uninformed in a given consumer transaction. Unlawful practices thus can victimize business entities as well as individual consumers.\u201d 212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 356-57, 515 A.2d 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>However, this does not mean that every contract entered into by a corporation may be the subject of a CFA claim. The CFA only applies to sales of \u201creal estate,\u201d which is obviously not involved in this case, and \u201csales of merchandise.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2. The CFA defines \u201cmerchandise\u201d as including \u201cany objects, wares, goods, commodities, services or anything offered, directly or indirectly <em>to the public </em>for sale.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1(c) (emphasis added). We have previously indicated that \u201cthe public,\u201d as used in this definition of \u201cmerchandise,\u201d refers to <em>\u201cthe </em>public at large.\u201d <em>Finderne Mgmt. Co. v. Barrett, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 570, 955 A.2d 940 (App.Div.2008); <em>Marascio v. Campanella, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 499, 689 A.2d 852 (App.Div.1997); <em>see also Kugler v. Romain, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>522, 536, 279 A.2d 640 (1971) (recognizing that the CFA is directed primarily at \u201cdeception, misrepresentation and unconscionable practices engaged in by professional sellers seeking mass distribution of many types of consumer goods\u201d); <em>539 Absecon Boulevard, L.L.C. v. Shan Enters. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 273-80, 967 A.2d 845 (App.Div.) (same), <em>certif. denied, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>541, 973 A.2d 945 (2009). Thus, \u201c[i]t is the character of the transaction, not the identity of the purchaser, which determines whether the CFA is applicable.\u201d <em>Finderne Mgmt. Co., supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570, 955 A.2d 940; <em>accord Papergraphics Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Correa, </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 13, 910 A.2d 625 (App.Div.2006) (\u201cCFA applicability hinges on the nature of the transaction, requiring a case by case analysis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The contract between Princeton House and Netsmart for the installation and implementation of a complex computer system at Princeton House did not constitute a simple purchase of computer software sold to the public at large. <em>Compare Dreier Co., supra, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273, 527 A.2d 875; <em>Hundred E. Credit Corp., supra, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 353-57, 515 A.2d 246. The contract resulted from a request for proposals for an upgrade in Princeton House\u2019s computer system, which Princeton House prepared with the assistance of PHCS\u2019s computer consultant. After Princeton House received Netsmart\u2019s response to this request, it engaged in a more than two-year process of evaluation of proposals, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>involved visiting other healthcare facilities that were already using computer systems similar to the one Netsmart proposed to install at Princeton House. The contract did not provide for simply the installation of a standardized computer software program but rather the design of a custom-made program to satisfy Princeton House\u2019s unique needs and Netsmart\u2019s active participation in implementation of this program. Moreover, before agreeing to award the contract to Netsmart, Princeton House, with the assistance of PHCS\u2019s computer consultant and legal counsel, engaged in lengthy negotiations over its terms with Netsmart. This kind of heavily negotiated contract between two sophisticated corporate entities does not constitute a \u201csale of merchandise\u201d within the intent of the CFA. <em>See Finderne Mgmt. Co., supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570-73, 955 A.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the parts of the December 6, 2010 order that granted partial summary judgment to PHCS and denied Netsmart\u2019s motion to dismiss PHCS\u2019s consumer fraud claim and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the other counts of PHCS\u2019s complaint and on Netsmart\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> PHCS has filed a motion to strike Netsmart's reply brief supported by a brief which argues that Netsmart's motions for leave to appeal related solely to the part of the December 6, 2010 order that granted PHCS's partial summary judgment and did not encompass the part of that order that denied Netsmart\u2019s motion 1o dismiss PHCS\u2019s CFA claim. However, Netsmart's motions expressly stated that Netsmart was seeking leave to appeal from the part of the December 6, 2010 order \u201cdenying [Netsmart\u2019s] motion for summary judgment on the issue\u201d of PHCS's \u201cstanding to sue under [the CFA],\u201d and Netsmart argued in its brief in support of the motions that \"controlling New Jersey appellate law ... warranted dismissal of [PHCS's] CFA claims.\u201d Therefore, we are satisfied that the interlocutory appeal the Supreme Court granted Netsmart leave to pursue includes the part of the December 6, 2010 order that denied Netsmart's motion to dismiss PHCS's CFA claim. Simultaneously with the filing of this opinion, we are filing an order denying PHCS's motion to strike Netsmart's reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
