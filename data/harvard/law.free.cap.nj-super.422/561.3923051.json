The Law Division granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Mindy Jacobson, who sued individually and on behalf of her daughter, S.J., for whom child support was awarded, ordering the federal government to pay them compensatory damages, prejudgment interest, and counsel fees and costs. We reverse and hold that plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by sovereign immunity under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The essential facts are not in dispute. On December 18, 1998, the Family Part ordered Steven Tetz to pay child support to plaintiff for the benefit of their minor daughter, S.J. That order, in turn, was enforced by an income withholding order entered against Tetz, which the New Jersey Department of Human Services, Office of Child Support (OCS), served upon him in August 2004. On August 10, 2004, the OCS also mailed a notice of the income garnishment order to the SSA pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.9 and <em>Rule </em>5:7-5, although the SSA has no record of the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Tetz fell behind on his child support payments. He died on March 13, 2008, in arrears on his child support payments in the amount of $79,546. Several months before, on December 17, 2007, the SSA had paid Tetz a retroactive award of Social Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>disability benefits totaling $58,947.60, and did not garnish any of this award to satisfy child support arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Consequently, plaintiff brought an action in federal district court against Tetz\u2019s estate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the United States of America (Government) to enforce the garnishment order entered in state court, alleging that, under 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 666(b)(6)(C),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Government, through the SSA, failed to comply with the garnishment order and is liable for the amount of money that should have been withheld to satisfy Tetz\u2019s child support arrears. The Government moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint, asserting principally that 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 659 \u2014 the provision of federal law subjecting disability benefits received under Title II of the Social Security Act to state \u201cwithholding\u201d requirements \u2014 does not waive the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity from a damages action. The district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint, concluding that section 659 \u201cneither provides [such] a cause of action, nor extends the jurisdiction of federal courts.\u201d The dismissal, however, was without prejudice to reinstatement of the action in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">As a result, plaintiff, individually and on behalf of S.J., brought this action in the Law Division, once again seeking damages as a result of the SSA\u2019s failure to comply with the Family Part\u2019s garnishment order to withhold money from Tetz\u2019s disability benefits payments. Although not referenced in her complaint, plaintiffs theory of liability was predicated on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.11, which provides that a \u201cpayor\u201d who fails to \u201cwithhold wages in accordance with the provisions of the [garnishment] notice\u201d shall be liable for \u201cany amount up to the accumulated amount the payor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>should have withheld from the obligor\u2019s income____\u201d The Government answered, but did not assert a sovereign immunity defense to the damages claim, relying instead on its asserted lack of notice of the garnishment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the Law Division found that the SSA was not protected by sovereign immunity,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had received proper notice of the garnishment order. As to the latter, the court reasoned that under the \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d proof that the order was sent by regular mail creates a rebuttable presumption of receipt that was not adequately refuted by the Government in this instance and that superseded any competing presumption of non-receipt based on the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d doctrine, which presumes that public officers have properly discharged their official duties. Finding no genuine issue of material fact, the court held the Government liable for the SSA\u2019s failure to withhold Tetz\u2019s benefits pursuant to the garnishment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">After the court\u2019s liability determination, plaintiff moved for summary judgment, including compensatory, pre-judgment interest, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which the Government opposed. Following argument, the court awarded plaintiff compensatory damages of $43,894.05; pre-judgment interest of $6,515.94 pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.11 and <em>Rule </em>4:42 \u2014 1 l(a)(iii); and attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ney\u2019s fees of $66,050.75, together with costs of $2,557.61, under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2412(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">On appeal, the Government primarily argues that plaintiff\u2019s claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.11 is barred by sovereign immunity, as Congress did not expressly allow for liability for monetary damages where a federal agency fails to withhold benefits in accordance with a state garnishment order. Because this issue was not raised below, plaintiff argues we should not consider it now. We disagree. While we generally decline to resolve questions or issues not properly presented in the trial court, an exception is made where \u201cthe questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern matters of great public interest.\u201d <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). Here, the question of the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity clearly and plainly goes to the jurisdiction of the trial court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>535, 538, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1349, 1351, 63 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>607, 613 (1980) (\u201c[T]he terms of [Congress\u2019s] consent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d); <em>Dep\u2019t of Army v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </em>56 F.3d 273, 275 (D.C.Cir.1995) (holding that the general proscription against considering issues for the first time on appeal \u201ccannot bar a belated claim of sovereign immunity\u201d; otherwise \u201ca federal official could effectively waive sovereign immunity and confer jurisdiction upon the court without an express authorization from the Congress.\u201d). Accordingly, we consider the claim of sovereign immunity even though raised for the first time on appeal and, for the following reasons, conclude that it precludes plaintiffs claim against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Garnishment is a legal proceeding brought by a creditor (garnishor) against a third party (garnishee) to obtain the debtor\u2019s property held by the garnishee, thereby satisfying the debt owed to the garnishor. <em>Harris v. Balk, </em>198 <em>U.S. </em>215, 226, 25 <em>S.Ct. </em>625, 628, 49 <em>L.Ed. </em>1023, 1028 (1905). Garnishment is purely a creature of state law. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 25 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 626, 49 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1026. In New Jersey, a parent who obtains a child support order against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>child\u2019s other parent is entitled to enforcement of the order by way of an income \"withholding or garnishment order as to any income owed the supporting parent. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.8. If the person or entity required to pay the supporting parent, defined in the statute as the \u201cpayor,\u201d fails to withhold payment, the payor is liable directly to the supporting parent for the amount that should have been withheld. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.11. Thus, since the SSA was a \u201cpayor\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.11, and relying on 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 659, which makes Social Security disability benefits subject to garnishment for the enforcement of a legal obligation to pay child support, plaintiff instituted the instant action seeking to hold the Government liable for the amount it failed to withhold.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">It is well-settled, however, that the federal government, as sovereign, is immune from suit in state courts absent the consent of Congress, <em>Block v. North Dakota, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>273, 287, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1811, 1819-20, 75 L.Ed.2d 840, 853 (1983), \u201cand the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>at 538, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1351, 63 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 613. This shield of sovereign immunity extends to the federal agencies. <em>FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>471, 475, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>996, 1000, 127 L.Ed.2d 308, 316 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Any waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressed unequivocally by Congress and cannot be implied. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>at 538, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1351, 63 L.Ed.2d at 613. Further, waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign and may not be enlarged beyond the explicit language of the statute. <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>680, 685-86, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3274, 3278, 77 L.Ed.2d 938, 944 (1983); <em>see also United States v. N.Y. Rayon Importing Co., </em>329 <em>U.S. </em>654, 659, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>601, 604, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>577, 582 (1947) (\u201c[T]here can be no consent by implication or by use of ambiguous language____The consent necessary to waive the traditional immunity must be express, and it must be strictly construed.\u201d). So measured, we conclude that 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 659, while allowing enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>garnishment orders issued by state courts, does not expressly waive the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity from damages liability for its failure to comply therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In 1974, Congress enacted the Child Support Enforcement Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 659, that waived the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity against garnishment proceedings for enforcement of state court-ordered child support and alimony. See <em>United States v. Morton, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>822, 826-27, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2769, 2772, 81 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>680, 687 (1984). Section 659 addressed concerns that recipients of federal benefits \u201cwere evading support obligations and thereby throwing children and divorced spouses on the public dole----\u201d <em>Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>572, 576, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>802, 805, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1, 7 (1979). At the time, federal employees\u2019 income had not been subject to attachment for purposes of enforcing support orders because of a finding by the courts that such attachment triggered the sovereign immunity of the United States. <em>Morrison v. Morrison, </em>408 <em>F.Supp. </em>315, 317 (N.D.Tex.1976). \u201cThe solution was to enact a statute that would waive such immunity; indeed, this waiver is the purpose and the effect of section 659.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also Morton, </em>supra, 467 <em>U.S. </em>at 833, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2775, 81 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 691 (\u201c[Section 659] was enacted to remedy the plight of persons left destitute because they had no speedy and efficacious means of ensuring that their child support and alimony would be paid.\u201d). Accordingly, while the provision does not confer jurisdiction upon the federal courts to entertain such actions, it removes the Government\u2019s immunity from a garnishment proceeding authorized under state law. <em>Morrison, supra, </em>408 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 317; <em>see also Stephens v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>589 <em>F.2d </em>783, 783 (4th Cir.1979) (holding that 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 659 \u201cmerely waives the defense of sovereign immunity to state proceedings, while not creating a federal cause of action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Thus, section 659 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">(a) Consent to support enforcement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... moneys (the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment) due from, or payable by, the United States ... (including any agency ... thereof) to any individual ... shall be subject, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>in like manner and to the same extent as if the United States ... were a private person, to withholding in accordance with State law enacted pursuant to section 666 of this title [governing child support enforcement] ... and to any other legal process brought by an individual obligee, to enforce the legal obligation of the individual to provide child support or alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">[42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 659(a).] <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Under section 659, moneys payable to an individual that are considered to be \u201cbased upon renumeration for employment\u201d include Social Security disability benefits such as those at issue in the ease at bar. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 659(h)(l)(A)(ii)(I). <em>See DeTienne v. DeTienne, </em>815 <em>F.Supp. </em>394, 396-97 (D.Kan.1993) (explaining how section 659 reaches Social Security Title II disability benefits that would otherwise have been exempt from execution under section 207 of the Social Security Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 407). \u201cLegal process\u201d is defined as \u201cany writ, order, summons, or other similar process in the nature of garnishment\u201d that is issued by a court \u201cof competent jurisdiction in any State\u201d and compels a \u201cgovernmental entity which holds moneys which are otherwise payable to an individual to make a payment from the moneys to another party in order to satisfy a legal obligation of the individual to provide child support or make alimony payments.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 659(i)(5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the plain language of section 659(a) expressly subjects the Government to state \u201cwithholding\u201d requirements for certain federal payments, and to legal process brought to enforce the legal obligation of an individual to provide child support, nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>statute creates a right of action for damages for failure to comply with a state child support garnishment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Congress also authorized the promulgation of regulations to implement the provisions of section 659. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 661(a); <em>see also Morton, supra, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>at 834, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2776, 81 L.Ed.2d at 691. The implementing regulations, promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 659(g), squarely address the question presented on this appeal, namely whether Congress waived immunity to the extent that a court may hold a federal entity liable for the same type of monetary awards that state law authorizes against a private employer when the entity fails to comply with a garnishment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The relevant regulation \u2014 5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305, titled \u201cHonoring legal process\u201d \u2014 was first promulgated in 1980. At that time, the regulation waived sovereign immunity and imposed liability for money damages on the United States for negligently failing to comply with a garnishment order. Specifically, the regulation stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">(d) Neither the United States, any disbursing officer, nor governmental entity shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due from, or payable by, the United States to any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this part. However, <em>where a governmental entity negligently fails to comply with legal process, the United States shall he liable for the amount that the governmental entity would have paid, if the legal process had been properly honored.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">[5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305(d) (1981) (emphasis added).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">While not expressly referencing 5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305(d) as the guiding authority for so acting, at least three federal courts have imposed liability on the United States for the funds it failed to withhold pursuant to proper support garnishment orders. <em>See Loftin v. Rush, </em>767 F.2d 800, 808-09 (11th Cir.1985); <em>DeTienne, supra, </em>815 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 398; <em>Young v. Young, </em>547 <em>F.Supp. </em>1, 5 (W.D.Tenn.1980). Significantly, however, these cases were all decided before the implementing regulation, 5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305, was amended in 1998 to specifically preclude damages liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>To that end, on June 11, 1997, the OPM proposed to amend the child support garnishment regulations to clarify that, while the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity is waived to allow for processing garnishment orders, this waiver is necessarily limited and does not extend to damages liability for failure to comply with legal process. 62 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>31763 (June 11, 1997). The supplementary information to the OPM\u2019s proposal stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">OPM also propose[s], in accordance with a request from the Justice Department, to amend section 581.305(e) to state the Government\u2019s similar absence of liability in the context of improperly effectuated support garnishment orders. It is the Federal Government\u2019s position that the support garnishment statute [42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 659] did not waive sovereign immunity in a manner that would make the Federal Government liable for damages as a result of failure to comply with legal process. <em>This amendment to the support garnishment regulations alters regulatory language that has been in effect since 1980. The current regulatory language is incorrect as a matter of law. </em>This amendment is in accordance with several important judicial decisions concerning sovereign immunity, including the decision recently announced by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Department of the Army v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>56 F.3d 273 (1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">[62 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>31763 (June 11, 1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Accordingly, 5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305 was amended to expressly provide that section 659 does not impose damages liability on the United States:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">Neither the United States, any disbursing officer, nor any governmental entity shall be liable under this part to pay money damages for failure to comply with legal process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">[5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305(e)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Nevertheless, plaintiff argues that the amended regulation plainly contravenes section 659 and, as such, is ultra vires and unenforceable. We disagree. Congress explicitly delegated authority to construe section 659 by regulation. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>659(g). Authority to promulgate such regulations, insofar as the section applies to moneys from the United States, is vested in the President or his designee. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 659(g)(1). The President, by executive order, delegated authority to the OPM to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>disseminate implementing regulations. Exec. Order No. 12,105, 43 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>59,465 (1973), <em>as amended by </em>Exec. Order No. 17107, 44 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>1,055 (1979). In accordance with this delegation of authority, the OPM promulgated regulations for processing child support orders. 5 <em>C.F.R. </em>Ch. 1 (1-1-96 Ed.). As the Supreme Court declared when interpreting section 659 in <em>Morton, supra, </em>\u201c[b]ecause Congress explicitly delegated authority to construe [section 659] by regulation, in this case we must give the regulations legislative and hence controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or plainly contrary to the statute.\u201d 467 <em>U.S. </em>at 834, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2776, 81 L.Ed.2d at 691. As noted, the OPM rejected its previous interpretation of \u00a7 659(a), authorizing damages liability on the United States, as \u201cincorrect as a matter of law\u201d and in 1998 amended 5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305(e)(2) to retain sovereign immunity against claims of liability for failure to comply with legal process. That Congress has not since amended \u00a7 659 to correct the OPM\u2019s interpretation only reinforces the conclusion that the 1998 amendment to 5 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 581.305 is consistent with and advances congressional intent. <em>Dep\u2019t of Children &amp; Families, Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. T.B., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>294, 307, 24 A.3d 290 (2011); <em>State v. Chapland, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>275, 291, 901 A.2d 351 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Such an intent is clearly evidenced in the plain language of section 659 itself, which effects only a partial waiver of sovereign immunity, limited to permitting state courts to order federal agencies to withhold money from the pay or benefits checks of their employees or beneficiaries for the purpose of effectuating court-ordered alimony and child support payments. <em>See Rose v. Rose, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>619, 635, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2029, 2038, 95 L.Ed.2d 599, 613 (1987) (\u201c[Section 659(a) ] was intended to create a limited waiver of sovereign immunity so that state courts could issue valid orders directed against agencies of the United States Government attaching funds in the possession of those agencies.... \u201d). There is nothing in the statutory provision to suggest, much less unequivocally state, that the scope of the waiver is sufficiently broad to encompass a cause of action against the Government for money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>damages, as plaintiff advocates here. Rather, section 659(a) simply authorizes federal agencies to honor state court garnishment orders providing for payment of child support and alimony. As the Eight Circuit in <em>Overman v. United States, </em>563 <em>F.2d </em>1287, 1291 (8th Cir.1977), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">The statute [42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 659] simply removed the bar of sovereign immunity to one narrow class of actions: enforcement of garnishment writs issued by state courts. Nothing in the statute or legislative history, however, indicates any congressional intent to expose the Government to wider liability. The language of \u00a7 659 waives Government immunity only from legal process \u201cbrought for the enforcement ... of [the] legal obligations to provide child support or make alimony payments.\u201d The statute patently does not waive governmental immunity to other lands of law-suits____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In other words, section 659 merely requires the Government to be treated the same as a private employer in receipt of a garnishment order. \u201cUnder \u00a7 659, the United States must respond to the garnishment to the same extent as a private person for similar legal process and only to that extent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In sum, we hold that the defense of sovereign immunity applies and operates to bar plaintiffs action against the Government for money damages. Plaintiffs complaint having stated no cause of action cognizable within the bounds authorized by section 659, the motion judge erred in granting judgment in her favor and denying summary relief to the Government. Accordingly, the judgment awarding compensatory damages, pre-judgment interest, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs is vacated and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of an order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In light of this disposition, we need not resolve the Government\u2019s alternative claim that the motion court erred in applying New Jersey\u2019s \u201cmailbox rule\u201d to find that the SSA had received the garnishment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> After various administrative expenses were paid, the Probate Part distributed the remaining balance of Tetz's estate \u2014 $25,053.55\u2014in trust for the minor child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\"> 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 666(b)(6)(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">The employer must be held liable to the State for any amount which such employer fails to withhold from income due an employee following receipt by such employer of proper notice under subparagraph (A), but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> Although not raised by the Government at the time, the judge nevertheless briefly addressed the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">As a threshold matter, this Court must briefly consider the issue of sovereign immunity. [Plaintiff], in anticipation of Social Security\u2019s potential oppositional argumentL] asserts that pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>[\u00a7] 659 and both its plain language and legislative history, Social Security is not protected from litigation by sovereign immunity in situations involving the garnishment of child support. [Plaintiff] provides compelling argument supported by legal precedent that is either binding or persuasive. Social Security does not dispute, even in passing, [plaintiff\u2019s] arguments regarding the inapplicability of sovereign immunity. Therefore, Social Security is not protected by sovereign immunity.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> In 1977, Congress added subparagraph (f) to \u00a7 659, which relieves the government of liability for compliance with the statute. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">(1) Neither the United States ... nor any disbursing officer shall be liable with respect to any payment made from moneys due or payable from the United States to any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face, if the payment is made in accordance with this section and the regulations issued to carry out this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">[42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 659(f)(1).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\"> Of note, \"[t]he fact that section 659(a) is applicable to particular moneys does not necessarily mean that those moneys will be subject to legal process. It means that the question of whether such moneys will be subject to legal process is to be determined in accordance with state law in like manner as if the United States were a private person.\" <em>DeTienne, supra, </em>815 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 397.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b600-11\"> We have uncovered no published authority since then applying the amended regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
