[t]he act is committed during the commission, or attempted commission . . of robbery, kidnapping, homicide, <em>aggravated assault on another, </em>burglary, arson or criminal escape....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-12\">[Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">We conclude that the proper interpretation of the phrase \u201con another\u201d in this section is that the aggravated assault must be on a third person, committed for the purpose of compelling the submission of the sexual assault victim. Elevation of the offense based on aggravated assault of the sexual assault victim is addressed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(6), discussed below. Because defendant was indicted and tried under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(3), and the record does not establish that he assaulted a third party during his sexual assault of the victim, we vacate his convictions based upon that statutory section.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">Defendant was indicted for first-degree aggravated sexual assault, N.J<em>.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(3) (count one); second-degree attempted aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1(a)(3) and 2C:14-2(a)(3) (count two); second-degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>2(c)(1)(count three); third-degree criminal restraint, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-2(b) (count four); second-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12\u20141(b)(1) (count five); and fourth-degree obstructing the administration of justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-1 (count six). The State dismissed count four prior to trial. Tried to a jury, defendant was convicted of all remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Defendant was sentenced to a term of twenty years subject to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.2 (NERA), on the first-degree aggravated sexual assault charge; a consecutive term of seven years on the second-degree aggravated assault charge; and a concurrent 365-day term on the fourth-degree obstruction charge; he was also sentenced to five years of parole supervision. The remaining charges were merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The trial evidence established that in the early morning hours of April 22, 2007, then-eighteen-year-old P.F. was walking home from a party, first with two girlfriends but then alone after her friends took a different route. As she walked, P.F. heard a man shouting at her from behind. She saw defendant approaching and began to run away. As defendant chased her, P.F. called 9-1-1 on her cell phone and was on with the dispatcher when defendant caught up with her. A tape of P.F.\u2019s 9-1-1 call was marked into evidence and the prosecutor played it for the jury during her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Defendant attacked P.F. from behind, repeatedly punching her in the head and face, causing her to fall and strike her head on the pavement. She continued to fight back while on the ground, punching defendant in the face. Defendant continued to strike her and finally, fearing for her life, P.F. stopped fighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">As P.F. lay motionless on the ground, defendant \u201cripped off [her] pants ... [and] started touching [her] vagina with his fingers.\u201d She then \u201chear[d] a belt come off and ... [h]e was taking off his pants.\u201d She felt what she thought was a penis touching the lips of her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">The police arrived at this point. Defendant \u201cgot up and tried putting his pants on and he ... ran, and then an officer came over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>to [her] and covered [her] with some blanket.\u201d P.F. was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Her head was pounding and she was bleeding from her nose. Photographs taken at the hospital showed that P.F.\u2019s lips and nose were swollen.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on count one based on the argument he has raised in his first point on appeal, namely that the term \u201caggravated assault on another\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(3) means an assault on a person other than the victim of the sexual assault. The judge denied the motion, concluding that \u201cthe statute is referring to acts upon the victim. It is an enhancement feature because it reflects an additional threat of physical harm to the victim that\u2019s over and above the act of penetration or the violent act.\u201d The judge noted further that defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal was based on a legal, not factual, argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">At the outset of the prosecutor\u2019s summation, she told the jury, \u201cLet\u2019s put the focus back where it belongs, on that man. That man chased, attacked, beat and, yes, raped [P.F.].\u201d Defendant immediately objected to use of the word \u201crape\u201d and, following a sidebar conference, the judge told the jury that they were the judges of the facts and would be charged as to the law \u201cus[ing] the language that\u2019s included in the statute ... and rape is not one of the words that\u2019s contained in the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">At another point, defendant lodged an objection that a photograph depicting P.F.\u2019s injuries had been on display to the jury throughout the prosecutor\u2019s summation. Defendant also objected to the prosecutor playing for the jury the tape of P.F.\u2019s 9-1-1 call. The judge ruled that the tape, which was in evidence, could be played but that the photograph \u201cshould come down, it\u2019s been up there for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury included the following with respect to defendant\u2019s election not to testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">Now the defendant has chosetnj not to be a witness in this case. It is his constitutional right to remain silent. I charge you that you are not to consider for any purpose or in any manner in arriving at your verdict, the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>defendant did not testify, nor should that fact enter into your deliberations or discussions in any manner, at any time. The defendant is entitled to have the jury consider all of the evidence and he is entitled to the presumption of innocence, <em>even if he does not testify as a witness.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Defendant did not object to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">At sentencing, the judge found aggravating factors one, three and nine applied, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(1), (3) and (9), and set forth his reasons for each factor. The judge found mitigating factor number seven applicable as defendant had no prior criminal history. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(b)(7). Noting that defendant was twenty years old at the time of the offenses, however, the judge concluded that \u201c[m]uch weight ... cannot be given to this mitigating factor____[He] has not really been a law abiding citizen for a substantial period of time before the commission of this offense. The lack of a formal criminal charge and conviction is not totally indicative of one\u2019s compliance with the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Concluding that \u201cthe aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factor[,]\u201d the judge sentenced defendant to a term of twenty years subject to NERA on the first-degree aggravated sexual assault charge. The judge also imposed a five-year term of parole supervision and the requirement that defendant \u201ccomply with registration and community notification laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">In imposing a consecutive seven-year term, subject to NERA, on the second-degree aggravated assault charge, the judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">The <em>Yarborough</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>[sic] criteria ha[ve] been considered. The crimes ... involved separate acts of violence and continuing threats of violence____The crimes and their objectives were independent. Namely, the offense of aggravated assault was to subdue the victim, render her somewhat immobile. The aggravated sexual assault was obviously for the defendant\u2019s self-gratification, but more importantly an act of sexual defilement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-14\">... [A]fter the ... mergers, three [convictions] still remain____[T]here can be no free crimes in a system for which punishment shall fit the crime. I therefore find that consecutive sentences are appropriate in relation to the aggravated sexual assault and the aggravated assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>On appeal, defendant raises the following contentions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">POINT I \u2014 THE TRIAL COURT MISAPPLIED ITS DISCRETION AND VIOLATED THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS BY DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL ON COUNT ONE BECAUSE THE TERM \u201cON ANOTHER\u201d IN <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(A)(3) MEANS \u201cOTHER THAN THE VICTIM\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">POINT II \u2014 THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WAS VIOLATED BY THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S OVERZEALOUSNESS IN SUMMATION POINT III \u2014 THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT WAS UNDERMINED BY THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S JURY CHARGE (NOT RAISED BELOW)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">POINT IV \u2014 THE AGGREGATE 27 YEAR BASE CUSTODIAL SENTENCE WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">(A)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">IMPOSITION OF SENTENCES IN EXCESS OF THE STATUTORILY AUTHORIZED MINIMUM 10 YEAR SENTENCE ON COUNT ONE AND MINIMUM 5 YEAR SENTENCE ON COUNT FIVE CANNOT BE SUPPORTED BY A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS PRESENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">(B)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">IMPOSITION OF A CONSECUTIVE TERM ON THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT ON COUNT FIVE WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-13\">(C)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-14\">THE TRIAL COURT MISAPPLIED ITS DISCRETION IN FAILING TO MERGE THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION ON COUNT FIVE INTO COUNT ONE</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-15\">Having reviewed these contentions in light of the record and the controlling legal principles, we find merit in defendant\u2019s first point and, therefore, reverse his convictions on counts one and two. We note that in this point defendant seeks reversal only of count one. Count two, however, charges an attempt to violate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(3); as such it suffers from the same deficiency we discuss below with respect to count one. Therefore, we exercise our original jurisdiction, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:10-5, and reverse on that count as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">Defendant\u2019s motion before the trial judge raised a question of law, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s characterization of that motion as one for a judgment of acquittal. \u201c[A] trial court\u2019s legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>conclusions are not afforded ... deference; appellate review of legal determinations is plenary.\u201d <em>State v.

Proof of a predicate offense in section (3) is sufficient to establish the absence of consent on the part of the victim. \u201cWe construe <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3) to be a legislative determination that proof of one or more of the predicate crimes identified therein is all that is necessary to establish the absence of \u2018affirmative and freely-given permission.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

We find merit to that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The phrase \u201con another\u201d modifies only one of the seven predicate offenses listed in section (3), namely \u201caggravated assault.\u201d We deem it reasonable and logical to construe that anomaly as defining the situation in which an actor commits an aggravated assault, or attempts to commit such an assault, upon a third person such as a spouse or child, in order to compel a victim to submit to a sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Such a form of third-party compulsion, sufficient to \u201cestablish the absence of \u2018affirmative and freely-given permission!,]\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, supra, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 187, 705 A.2d 805, (quoting <em>M.T.S., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 444, 609 A.2d 1266), is recognized by numerous other states\u2019 rape and sexual assault statutes. <em>See, e.g., Cal.Penal Code </em>\u00a7 261(a)(2) (Deering 2011) (defining rape as an act of sexual intercourse \u201caccomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person <em>or another </em>\u201d); <em>Conn. Gen.Stat. </em>\u00a7 53a-70(a) (2011) (elevating sexual assault to a first-degree felony where the defendant \u201ccompels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person <em>or a third person, </em>or by the threat of use of force against such other person <em>or against a third person </em>____\u201d); <em>Mont.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 45-5-501(l)(a)(i) (2010) (defining lack of consent as when \u201cthe victim is compelled to submit by force against the victim or <em>another\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>By contrast, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a), the circumstance in which compulsion consists of physical force or coercion against the sexual assault victim is addressed by section (6); that section raises the level of the offense to aggravated sexual assault when \u201c[t]he actor uses physical force or coercion and severe personal injury is sustained by the victim.\u201d Therefore, interpreting the reference to \u201caggravated assault on another\u201d in section (3) as encompassing an aggravated assault on the victim would render subsection (6) redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u201cWhen interpreting statutory language, the goal is to divine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>State v. Shelley, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>320, 323, 15 A.3d 818 (2011). In so doing, courts look first to \u201cthe language of the statute, giving the terms used therein their ordinary and accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c \u2018[I]f the meaning of the text is clear and unambiguous on its face, [the courts] enforce that meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Drury, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 209, 919 A.2d 813 (quoting <em>State v. Reiner, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>307, 311, 850 A.2d 1252 (2004)). Extrinsic evidence may be considered when the statutory language on its face is ambiguous and may \u201cyield[] \u2018more than one plausible interpretation.\u2019\u201d <em>Shelley, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 324, 15 A.3d 818 (quoting <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492-93, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Moreover, \u201c[w]hen interpreting penal statutes, the doctrines of strict construction and lenity also provide guidance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The doctrine of lenity \u201cholds that when interpreting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>criminal statute, ambiguities that cannot be resolved by either the statute\u2019s text or extrinsic aids must be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Gelman, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 950 A.2d 879 (2008) (citing <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>336, 348, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488, 497 (1971)). The doctrine of lenity is \u201cfounded on the long-standing and fundamental principle that a person facing a criminal charge is entitled to \u2018fair warning ... of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Bass, supra, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>at 347-48, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 522, 30 L.Ed.2d at 496) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">When interpreting a criminal statute, the rules of construction are \u201csubordinate to the goal of effectuating the legislative plan as it may be gathered from the enactment when read in the full light of its history, purpose and context.\u201d <em>State v. Lewis, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>363, 369, 886 A.2d 643 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). As for the history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(3), we note that the statute\u2019s current language was adopted with the enactment of the Criminal Code in 1979; at that time Chapter 14 was \u201ctotally revised by the Senate Judiciary Committee during its review of the Code.\u201d <em>Senate Judiciary Committee, Statement to S.7S6 </em>(May 15,1978). No legislative history is available, however, to shed light on the particular language at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Insofar as the \u201cpurpose!,]\u201d <em>Lewis, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 369, 886 A.2d 643, of the statute is to elevate the offense to aggravated sexual assault when the defendant uses physical force or coercion resulting in injury to the victim, that purpose appears to be served by section (6). Moreover, \u201cthe goal of effectuating the legislative plan!,]\u201d <em>ibid., </em>for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a) is hampered when section (3) is read in the \u201ccontext!,]\u201d <em>ibid., </em>of section (6). Clearly, the statute\u2019s inclusion of section (6) renders the phrase \u201con another\u201d in section (3) ambiguous, at best, thereby requiring resolution \u201cin favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Gelman, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 482, 950 A.2d 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u201c[A] court should strive to avoid statutory interpretations that \u2018lead to absurd or unreasonable results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>v. Gill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>441, 444, 221 A.2d 521 (1966)). We conclude that interpreting \u201caggravated assault on another\u201d in section (3) as referring to the victim of the sexual assault \u201clead[s] to [the] ... unreasonable result[,]\u201d <em>ibid., </em>of rendering section (6) superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Therefore, we conclude that defendant\u2019s convictions on counts one and two of the indictment cannot stand, as he was charged under an inapposite statute. \u201cThe State having failed to prove the essential elements of the crime charged, defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed and a judgment of acquittal entered.\u201d <em>State v.

We therefore need not address his sentencing contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Judgments of acquittal are entered on counts one and two; we affirm as to counts three, five and six but remand those counts for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-16\"> <em>State v.
