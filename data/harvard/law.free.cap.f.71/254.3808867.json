A jury was waived, and the ease submitted to the court, under the provisions of Rev. St. \u00a7\u00a7 649, 700. The court made a general finding in favor of plaintiff, in each case, and defendant brought error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-12\">Both parties claimed title under one James O. MeKown. MeKown was for a long time an agent of the Manhattan Life Insurance Company, and prior to March 10, 1893, had become largely indebted to it, for which indebtedness, at about that time, he gave his bond, with sureties. He was a brother-in-law of defendant O\u2019Neil, and on August 4, 1893, he gave the latter a deed of all his real property, including the pieces of property involved in these suits. ' The consideration was $2,000 in cash, paid to a third party, to cancel a debt due from MeKown. The insurance company, having obtained a judgment against MeKown on his bond in 1894, caused levies to be made upon the pieces of property now in question, and bought them in at the marshal\u2019s sales. After obtaining deeds from the marshal, the insurance company brought these actions of ejectment against O\u2019Neil, attacking the conveyances to him by MeKown on the ground of fraud. The evidence related to the bona fides of that transaction, the adequacy of the consideration paid, and the value of the property at the time.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Azf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Johns McCleave, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-4\">M.

The first of these sections provides that \u201cthe finding of the court upon facts * * * shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury\u201d; and the second provides that \u201cthe rulings of the court during the progress of the trial, if excepted to at the time * * * may be reviewed * * * upon writ of error or appeal, and when the finding is special the review may extend to the determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Here the finding was general, as follows: \u201cThe court finds in favor of the plaintiff, and against the defendant for the land described in the writ, with 64, cts. damages, and costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The plaintiff assigns this finding, alone, as error. The single question therefore is, does the evidence support the finding? We think it does. It is not important that the evidence might possibly justify a different finding; that was a proper consideration for the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
