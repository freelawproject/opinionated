(Webcor) was the general contractor for the rehabilitation of the California Memorial Football Stadium in Berkeley (the Project). Webcor hired ACCO Engineered Systems (ACCO) to perform ventilation and plumbing services on the Project. James Strouse, an ACCO employee, suffered a workplace injury when his leg fell into a 12-inch deep expansion joint after the plywood safety cover gave way. He sued Webcor for negligence, and Webcor filed a cross-complaint against ACCO for indemnity. A jury found Webcor 100 percent liable for Strouse's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Webcor contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury using CACI No. 1009B, which, in Webcor's view, does not accurately state the holding of\n   <em>\n    Hooker v. Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   (2002)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1103402\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/27/198/\">\n    27 Cal.4th 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20853\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20P.3d%201081\">\n    38 P.3d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Hooker\n   </em>\n   ). Webcor further contends the trial court erroneously instructed on negligence per se based on regulations promulgated under the California Occupational Safety and Health Act (Cal-OSHA). Finally, Webcor argues the trial court erred in granting ACCO's motion for attorney fees. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Webcor's Contract with the University of California and Subcontract with ACCO\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2009, Webcor entered into a contract with the University of California (UC) for the \"California Memorial Stadium Seismic Safety Improvements.\" Under the contract, Webcor was \"solely responsible for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety precautions and programs\n   in connection with the performance of the Contract.\" Webcor was required to take adequate precautions to prevent damage, injury, or loss to \"Employees involved in the Work and other persons who may be affected thereby.\" The contract also required Webcor to \"designate a responsible member of [its] organization at the Project site whose duty shall be the prevention of accidents.\" Webcor was further obligated to \"continuously require and follow up with Subcontractors about their job site maintenance and their conformance in providing a safe work place,\" \"enforce all safety-related requirements in the Contract Documents,\" and \"review, monitor and coordinate the implementation of individual Subcontractors' Safety Programs.\"\n   Webcor hired ACCO to perform ventilation and plumbing services on the Project. Under the subcontract, ACCO agreed to \"comply fully with all laws, orders, citations, rules, regulations, standards and statutes with respect to occupational health and safety [and] ... accident prevention,\" to \"conduct inspections to determine that safe working conditions and equipment exist of their work area,\" and to \"accept[ ] sole responsibility for providing a safe place to work for its employees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Webcor's Safety Manual was part of the contract documents that ACCO was required to follow. It required ACCO employees to report any unsafe practice or condition to their supervisor immediately, and also report unsafe conditions to Webcor. With regard to floor openings, the Webcor Safety Manual reminded ACCO to check that openings were covered and that covers were secured and identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Webcor's Expansion Joints and Safety Covers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   An expansion joint is a gap left between concrete sections of a structure to allow the sections to move independently in the event of an earthquake. As part of the seismic upgrade of the stadium, Webcor created and constructed 50 expansion joints that were placed throughout the structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before a permanent covering is installed over each expansion joint, there is a gap 12 inches wide and 12 inches deep in the concrete. The gaps must be covered or have guardrails around them. For the Project, Webcor's carpenters designed, constructed, and installed protective plywood covers for all of the expansion joints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It was undisputed at trial that Webcor was responsible for the Project's general access areas, which were described as areas like \"hallways\" used by \"everyone\" including subcontractors for making deliveries and accessing different areas of the stadium. Strouse's accident occurred at an expansion joint in line 53, a general access area near a loading dock used by ACCO and other subcontractors to make deliveries. Because this was a high-traffic area, the safety covers for the expansion joints had to withstand two times the maximum anticipated load, which would require either a metal plate or two layers of three-quarter inch plywood that were secured and labeled \"do not remove.\" Webcor's site safety manager, Joe Villela, instructed Webcor's carpenters to make sure the safety covers were secured and had smooth transitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Webcor's carpenter foreman, Victor Paz, testified that the safety covers were constructed with doubled-up three-quarter inch plywood, sized to cover the 12-inch gap. The wood was anchored with 16-penny nails, roto-hammered in place, and secured with pieces of tie wire. Webcor tested the\n   design of the safety covers by driving a scissor lift over them to ensure they were strong and stayed in place.\n   Villela testified Webcor was the sole entity that maintained the safety covers, and Webcor carpenters were the only ones allowed to repair them. This was a duty Webcor \"did not delegate to its subcontractors.\" ACCO did not perform any work on the safety covers and was not allowed to do any carpentry work on the Project. Subcontractors were told during weekly meetings to notify Webcor if they needed to remove a safety structure to perform their work, and Webcor would remove and replace it. Villela testified it was reasonable for ACCO employees to trust that Webcor had properly installed, secured, and inspected the safety covers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Reports of Unsecured Covers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to Strouse's accident, Webcor knew that the safety covers in the line 53 area had been damaged or had become unsecured due to subcontractors removing them without securing them back in place. ACCO's general foreman Chris Ensel testified that he brought up the condition of the safety covers to Villela and informed him that people were removing safety covers to perform work in the expansion joints. The condition of the safety covers was \"brought up more than a couple times\" by Ensel and other tradesmen in the weekly foreman meetings when Webcor was asking for input. Ensel felt his concerns were not being adequately addressed, and he was dissatisfied with the response he received from Villela. Eventually, however, Ensel became \"accustomed\" to the condition and stopped bringing it up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ensel did not contact ACCO's safety department about the safety covers as required by ACCO's mitigation escalation path. He was aware that ACCO's subcontract required it to provide its employees with a safe place to work, but he felt this was not a \"reachable goal\" because Webcor was not adequately supporting ACCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Webcor's Retained Control of Safety on the Jobsite\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Webcor's safety expert J. Robert Harrell testified that Webcor retained overall safety responsibility on the job site. Villela testified that he was responsible for conducting daily inspections of the jobsite to look for safety problems, as required by Webcor's contract with the UC, even on weekends if workers were present (as they were the weekend before Strouse's accident). Up to 12 superintendents and 12 foremen of Webcor were also required to perform daily inspections. Villela was responsible for documenting each of his daily inspections in an inspection report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The last documented inspections before Strouse's January 9, 2012, accident were conducted on January 3, 4, and 5, 2012. There was no documentation of\n   any inspection on January 6, 7, or 8, 2012, even though there were workers at the site on those days. Although Villela initially testified that he had performed, but simply failed to log, inspections on January 6, 7, and 8, he later testified that he did not conduct an inspection on January 7 or 8, and was not present at the jobsite on either of those days. He did not know if foremen or a superintendent present on those days performed the daily inspections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Villela further testified it was his job to ensure that safety conditions at the jobsite complied with applicable Cal-OSHA regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Webcor Safety Manual specifically\n   required Webcor to comply with section 1632. Both Strouse's safety expert, Gerald Fulghum, and Webcor's safety expert, Harrell, testified that Webcor, as the \"controlling employer,\" was responsible for compliance with section 1632 on the jobsite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The Accident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the morning of January 9, 2012, a crew of seven ACCO employees was unloading materials from an ACCO truck at an access point into the stadium. The ACCO crew made multiple trips across an expansion joint at line 53. The area around line 53 was covered with plywood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Walking immediately in front of Strouse was Alexander Osborne, a first-year ACCO apprentice. As he walked across the expansion joint, he felt the plywood move a sixteenth to an eighth of an inch. Crossing the expansion joint behind Osborne was Strouse, who was carrying a large section of spiral pipe on his shoulder. As Strouse crossed the expansion joint, the plywood gave way. One of Strouse's legs went down into the joint, causing injuries to his knee, hip, and sacroiliac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The safety cover involved in Strouse's accident appeared to have been modified from its original condition, as plywood had been pried up so that a cable could be run underneath. Strouse's safety expert, Fulghum, testified that the condition of the area around line 53, as depicted in the photographs, constituted a safety hazard. Even though two layers of plywood were used in some places, they appeared to be \"lapped,\" and there were gaps and holes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Webcor's safety expert, Harrell, also testified the photographs showed a safety cover that was not properly maintained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     The Instant Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2013, Strouse filed a complaint and first amended complaint against Webcor for general negligence. Webcor answered the first amended complaint and filed a cross-complaint against ACCO, seeking to enforce a contractual defense and indemnity provision against ACCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Trial commenced in March 2016. In April 2016, the jury rendered a special verdict finding that Webcor designed the safety cover where Strouse fell; Webcor retained control over the safety cover and safety conditions where Strouse fell; Webcor negligently exercised its retained control over safety conditions; and Webcor's negligence was a \"substantial factor\" in causing harm to Strouse. Finding that neither ACCO nor Strouse was negligent, the jury apportioned no fault to them and attributed 100 percent of the fault to Webcor. Judgment was entered in favor of Strouse in the amount of $ 2,626,750, and in favor of ACCO on Webcor's cross-complaint. Webcor moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and for a new trial. Both motions were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ACCO moved for attorney fees as the prevailing party in Webcor's cross-action. The motion was granted in the amount of $ 298,843.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Webcor appealed the judgment, as well as the post-judgment orders denying its motions for JNOV and a new trial and the order granting ACCO's motion for attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The\n    </em>\n    Privette\n    <em>\n     Doctrine and Exceptions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Webcor's contentions on appeal implicate the so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Privette\n   </em>\n   doctrine\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Privette v.

Villela also admitted Webcor was responsible for conducting daily safety inspections of the worksite, though there was no documentation\n   of inspections performed on the weekend before Strouse's Monday morning accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Additionally, the fact that the jury apportioned no fault to ACCO or Strouse and 100 percent fault to Webcor necessarily establishes its determination that Webcor's liability \"is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   ' \"in essence 'vicarious' or 'derivative' in the sense that it derives from the 'act or omission' of the hired contractor.\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    Hooker\n   </em>\n   , supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 212,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20853\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20P.3d%201081\">\n    38 P.3d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In other words, it cannot be said, for purposes of applying\n   <em>\n    Privette\n   </em>\n   's bar to liability, that the \"sole factual basis\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   for Webcor's liability was that it \"failed to exercise a general supervisory power to require [ACCO] to correct an unsafe procedure or condition of [ACCO's] own making\" or that \"there [was] no evidence that [Webcor's] conduct contributed in any way\" to the injury. (\n   <em>\n    Hooker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 210-211,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20853\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20P.3d%201081\">\n    38 P.3d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) On the contrary, Webcor's affirmative act of prohibiting subcontractors from maintaining or repairing the safety covers, combined with its retention of control over safety in the general access area and its act of conducting daily inspections, reasonably induced the subcontractors and their employees to rely on the presumed adequacy of the safety covers in the line 53 area. Thus, the state of the evidence and the record here is amply distinguishable from that in\n   <em>\n    Hooker\n   </em>\n   , where Caltrans merely permitted the unsafe practices of the crane operator to continue, but was not shown to have contributed to the accident either through affirmative conduct or by inducing reliance.

Webcor cites portions of the closing argument of Strouse's counsel in which he argued that CACI No. 1009B was \"the key instruction\" regarding Webcor's liability, and called the lack of inspections in the days before the accident \"a big deal in this case.\" But Strouse's counsel also argued that Webcor negligently exercised its retained control over safety conditions by failing to make sure the safety covers were safe and secure; that the accident took place in a general access area that Webcor controlled; and that Webcor built, maintained, and was the responsible party for the condition of the safety covers. Meanwhile, Webcor's counsel clarified in his closing argument that in order to find Webcor's conduct was a substantial factor in Strouse's injury, the jury had to find that Webcor provided \"a substantial contribution to the harm,\" which was more than simply \"preventing [the condition] from existing.\" Taken together, counsels' arguments properly directed the jury to determine whether Webcor affirmatively contributed to the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, there is no indication in the record of jury confusion. The jury requested no rereading of CACI No. 1009B, submitted no questions concerning the substantial factor standard,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and requested no readback of any testimony pertinent to it. The jury deliberated for less than 90 minutes and unanimously found Webcor to be fully liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   After an examination of the entire cause, we conclude Webcor has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that it would have obtained a more\n   favorable result in the\n   absence of the claimed instructional error.

Negligence Per Se\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court instructed the jury on negligence per se under CACI No. 418. The instruction first provided the text of Cal-OSHA section 1632(a) and (b) (see\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , fn. 1), and then stated: \"If you decide: [\u00b6] 1) That Webcor Construction violated this law, and [\u00b6] 2) That the violation was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to James Strouse, then you must find that Webcor Construction was negligent.

This argument lacks merit for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, the premise of Webcor's argument is that the negligence per se instruction was necessarily used in this case to establish Webcor's\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   of care. But Webcor provides no factual foundation for this claim of error, i.e., it provides no record cite indicating Strouse or ACCO relied on the Cal-OSHA requirements to establish an independent duty of care, as opposed to the relevant\n   <em>\n    standard\n   </em>\n   of care. Under Labor Code section 6304.5, \"[s]ections 452 and 669 of the Evidence Code shall apply to this division and to occupational safety and health standards adopted under this division in the same manner as any other statute, ordinance, or regulation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, \"Cal-OSHA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   provisions are to be treated like any other statute or regulation and may be admitted to establish a standard\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   duty of care in all negligence and wrongful death actions, including third party actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Elsner v.

Although the subcontract generally stated that ACCO was \"solely responsible\" for the safety of its own employees, other relevant evidence, including the testimony of Webcor site safety manager Villela and Webcor safety expert Harrell, explicitly established that Webcor did not delegate to its subcontractors the duty to maintain and repair the safety covers, and that Webcor was the controlling employer responsible for compliance with section 1632 on the Project. This distinguishes\n   <em>\n    SeaBright\n   </em>\n   , where the airline was found to have implicitly delegated to the contractor the responsibility of complying with Cal-OSHA safety regulations pertaining to the very work-related condition (lack of safety guards over conveyors) that led to the plaintiff's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Webcor further argues it was error to give a negligence per se instruction without first instructing the jury on affirmative contribution because, under\n   <em>\n    Millard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057577\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/156/1338/\">\n    156 Cal.App.4th 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20177\">\n    68 Cal.Rptr.3d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Cal-OSHA regulations have not abrogated the\n   <em>\n    Privette\n   </em>\n   doctrine, and the regulations are admissible only where other evidence establishes the general contractor affirmatively contributed to the employee's injuries. (See\n   <em>\n    Millard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 156 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1350-1351,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20177\">\n    68 Cal.Rptr.3d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) As we have already discussed, the undisputed evidence amply established that Webcor affirmatively contributed to Strouse's injuries, and the jury apportioned no fault to ACCO or Strouse while finding Webcor 100 percent at fault. Thus, the failure to instruct the jury regarding the precise language of \"affirmative contribution,\" even if erroneous, was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude the trial court did not err in giving a negligence per se instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     ACCO's Motion for Attorney Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    ***\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.
