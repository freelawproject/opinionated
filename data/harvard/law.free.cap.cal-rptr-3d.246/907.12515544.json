The allegedly unapproved rates were in the form of broker fees charged by Mercury agents, which should have been disclosed as premium. After prevailing at an administrative hearing, the Commissioner imposed civil penalties against Mercury in the sum of $ 27,593,550 for almost 184,000 unlawful acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mercury filed a petition for writ of mandate, which the court granted, reversing the Commissioner's decision. The court found the \"broker fees\" were not premium because they were charged for separate services. The court also rejected the Commissioner's interpretation of the term premium under the Insurance Code and regulations. In addition, the court ruled Mercury did not have proper notice it was subject to penalties, in violation of due process, and the action was barred by laches because CDI had unduly delayed in bringing the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Commissioner and intervener and appellant, Consumer Watchdog (CWD), appeal on several grounds. They assert the trial court did not use the proper standard of review, failed to give the Commissioner's findings a strong presumption of correctness and failed to put the burden of proof on Mercury to show the findings were against the weight of the evidence. They also argue the trial court's finding the fees were charged for separate services was precluded by collateral estoppel. In addition, they maintain Mercury received proper notice of the potential imposition of a penalty, and laches did not bar the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We agree with Commissioner and CWD the writ was issued in error and reverse the judgment. Because the substantial weight of the evidence supports the Commissioner's decision, remand for a new hearing would be an idle act and we therefore remand with directions for the court to deny the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a separate ground to affirm the judgment, Mercury argues its due process rights were violated by improper ex parte communications by the CDI, and the proceedings against it should be dismissed. We disagree. We also deny Mercury's motion to strike portions of CWD's brief on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, we grant intervener's unopposed motion for judicial notice of CDI's responses to initial public comments about proposed rules concerning the interpretation of the term premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the insurance industry, business is generated by producers, either agents or brokers.

After Proposition 103 passed in 1988, Mercury \"converted\" approximately 700 of its agents to \"brokers\" and notified the CDI their agency status was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Auto Insurance Specialists (AIS) which became Mercury's appointed agent in 1968, also entered into a \"broker's contract\" with Mercury in 1988 after the passage of Proposition 103. In executing the \"broker's contract\" AIS wrote, \"we understand that the relationship between Mercury and A.I.S. is not changed in any material fashion as a result of this change in title and understand that our ability to bind coverage and other essentials of our mutual business relationship including our ability to hold ourselves out as a representative of Mercury Insurance Group is not changed by the execution of this new agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mercury's \"brokers\" began charging \"broker fees\" on automobile insurance policies. Mercury's agents who provided the same service and coverage did not charge an extra fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1998 CDI conducted an examination of Mercury. In July 1999 CDI provided to Mercury a report (1998 Exam Report), which stated Mercury's \"brokers\" were actually de facto agents under section 1621. The 1998 Exam Report also stated the purported conversion to \"brokers\" violated at least three Insurance Code sections because 1) the \"brokers\" were charging fees for providing the same services as Mercury's agents ( \u00a7 1861.05, subd. (a) ); 2) Mercury's advertising misrepresented that consumers were dealing with agents and\n   failed to advise the \"brokers\" were charging fees (\u00a7 790.03, subd. (b)); and 3) Mercury had not filed notices of appointment, required for agents, for the \"brokers\" (\u00a7 1704, subd. (a)). The 1998 Exam Report stated the violations would be reported to CDI's legal division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   CDI met with Mercury in August 1999 and January 2000 to discuss the 1998 Exam Report. Prior to the 2000 meeting CDI sent Mercury a draft Notice of Noncompliance (Draft NNC). It stated Mercury was violating sections 1861.01 and 1861.05 by virtue of its agents charging \"unapproved 'broker fees.' \" It also stated Mercury was subject to civil penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the 2000 meeting, Mercury agreed to provide a response to the Draft NNC. CDI agreed once it received the response it would notify Mercury if \"other action needs to be taken.\" Mercury never submitted a response to the Draft NNC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mercury then proposed legislation (Assem. Bill No. 2639 (2000 Reg. Sess.) (AB 2639)) to amend the definition of a broker under section 1623 to provide a licensed broker submitting an insurance application to an insurance company is \"conclusive[ly] presume[d]\" to be a broker and to allow \"an insurer to authorize a broker to bind coverage\" on the insurer's behalf. CDI opposed AB 2639 because it would \" 'blur' the long-established legal distinctions between 'agents' and 'brokers' and would create confusion for the consumer and problems for ... enforcement.... [F]ees are commonly non-refundable, excessive, and charged on transactions when they should be included in the premium.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Legislature amended section 1623, but not as proposed by Mercury. Rather, it created a rebuttable presumption, for licensing purposes only, that the person is acting as an insurance broker.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A few weeks after amended section 1623 was enacted, in October 2000 CDI issued an addendum to the 1998 Exam Report (2000 Addendum). Among other things the 2000 Addendum explained CDI had contacted Mercury inquiring as to the whereabouts of Mercury's promised response to the Draft NNC. It also stated \"Mercury will contact CDI's Legal Division to discuss this matter further.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The next month Mercury sent a letter to CDI stating it believed passage of AB 2639 had resolved the improper broker fee issue (Mercury Letter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In December 2000 CDI filed the final version of the 1998 Exam Report, which repeated CDI's conclusion Mercury's \"broker fees\" were illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the meantime in June 2000 Robert Krumme, a consumer, filed suit against Mercury\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. alleging Mercury's \"brokers\" were actually de facto agents who were charging illegal \"broker fees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Krumme v. Mercury\n   </em>\n   (Super. Ct. S.F. City and County, 2000, No. 313367).) He also alleged the \"broker fees\" had not been disclosed to or approved by CDI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Following the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   trial in May 2003 the court issued lengthy findings of fact and conclusions of law (\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   Findings), ruling Mercury's \"brokers\" were de facto agents. It found Mercury's relationship with its \"brokers\" was \"functionally indistinguishable\" from Mercury's relationship with its agents. It further ruled the de facto agents were charging illegal \"broker fees,\" for which Mercury was vicariously liable. The court issued a permanent injunction barring Mercury from selling insurance through \"brokers\" who were actually de facto agents and also prohibited Mercury's de facto agents from charging \"broker fees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In February 2004 CDI filed a Notice of Noncompliance (NNC), incorporating a substantial portion of the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   Findings. Mercury obtained a stay while it appealed the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   judgment. In the appeal it did not challenge the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   Findings.

Rather, it made a legal argument that brokers could be \"dual agents\" representing both insureds and insurers and exercising the powers under sections 1621 and 1623 without being subject to the limits set out in those statutes. In affirming the judgment the Court of Appeal disagreed, explaining that such an interpretation would turn those statutes into \"dead letters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   , at p. 943,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20485\">\n    20 Cal.Rptr.3d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After the judgment became final and the stay expired, Mercury filed three motions to vacate the judgment, all of which were denied. After\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   became final in October 2004, the relationships Mercury had with its \"brokers\" and its agents continued to be \"indistinguishable.\" By about November 2005 most of Mercury's \"brokers\" had converted to agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This did not include AIS, which for the years 2002 through 2004 had collected approximately $ 6 million in \"broker fees\" and generated more than $ 300 million in premium annually. As the Commissioner found, \"Mercury's relationship with AIS its largest 'broker,' remained unchanged after the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   findings.\" In August 2005 Mercury advised Wall Street, \"We don't see our relationship with AIS changing. We are working very closely with them. They are our largest broker as you know.\" As of November 2005 Mercury had not made any changes required by\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   as to its relationship with its \"brokers.\" The business model with AIS acting as a Mercury \"broker\" continued until Mercury bought AIS in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Following the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   judgment, CDI commenced an administrative action against Mercury by filing and serving a notice of noncompliance, an accusation, and an order to show cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second Amended NNC (Final NNC), which sought imposition of civil penalties against Mercury, alleged Mercury charged rates not approved by the CDI, and which were unfairly discriminatory in violation of sections 1861.01, subdivision (c) and 1861.05, subdivision (b). Mercury and CDI stipulated to stay proceedings on the Final NNC pending Mercury's appeal of\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Prior to the administrative hearing on the Final NNC CDI filed a motion, based on collateral estoppel, to bar Mercury from relitigating several of the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   Findings, including that when Mercury's \"brokers\" charged \"broker fees\" they were \"act[ing] in the course and scope of their agency in transacting insurance as 'insurance\n   agents' on behalf of Mercury.\" Administrative Law Judge Michael A. Scarlett (ALJ Scarlett), assigned to hear the matter, granted the motion (Collateral Estoppel Ruling).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The administrative hearing was conducted over 15 days with more than a dozen witnesses testifying and almost 4,000 pages of exhibits admitted. The parties also filed multiple briefs on every disputed issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ALJ Scarlett issued a 62-page proposed decision subsequently adopted by the Commissioner (Commissioner's Decision). He found that after passage of Proposition 103, from 1989 through 2003 Mercury converted almost its entire force of insurance agents to \"brokers,\" such that about 90 percent of its producers were \"brokers.\" Mercury used the same contract for the \"brokers,\" changing only the word \"agent\" to \"producer,\" defined in the contract as \"broker.\" After 1989 all new producers were \"brokers.\" Mercury's \"brokers\" were \"indistinguishable\" from Mercury's agents\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Commissioner's Decision found that once the producers became brokers they began charging \"broker fees\" ranging from $ 50 to $ 150. \"On rare occasions\" a customer did not pay a \"broker fee.\" Actual agents who provided the same services and coverage did not charge any extra fees. As a result a person obtaining a Mercury policy through a \"broker\" paid more than someone purchasing the same policy from an agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Commissioner found Mercury's top agent, AIS, also became a \"broker\" and engaged in the same conduct. AIS collected \"broker fees\" on more than 99 percent of the policies it obtained for Mercury. In a five-year period between 1999 and 2004, AIS \"brokers\" charged almost $ 27.6 million in unapproved \"broker fees\" on behalf of Mercury in California. \"AIS continued transacting insurance on behalf of Mercury in its 'broker' status until January 1, 2009, when Mercury purchased AIS.\" AIS charged \"broker fees\" on insurance policies on behalf of Mercury until that purchase, at which time Mercury filed a notice of appointment showing AIS as a Mercury agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   According to the Commissioner's Decision, when filing its rate applications for approval with CDI, Mercury did not include the \"broker fees\" charged by its \"brokers.\" CDI did not approve the \"broker fees\" for at least the period 1989 through 2006. Based on\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   , Mercury was \"collaterally estopped from contesting that the 'broker fees' were not approved by the CDI.\" Further, based on the Collateral Estoppel Ruling, Mercury was estopped from arguing its \"brokers\" were not Mercury's de facto agents. In addition, there was sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that Mercury's \"brokers\" were in fact brokers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Commissioner found AB 2639 \"as enacted, did not provide support for Mercury's position that its 'brokers' were traditional brokers, and not de facto insurance agents acting on behalf of Mercury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Based on the language of the rate statutes and regulations, the purpose of Proposition 103, and Bulletin 80-6, the Commissioner's Decision held the \"broker fees\" were premium that were required to be approved after reported on a rate application. Therefore, \"from at least July 1, 1996 through 2006, Mercury violated sections 1861.01, subdivision (c), and 1861.05, subdivision (a), when it allowed its designated 'brokers' to charge and collect unapproved and unfairly discriminatory 'broker fees' to Mercury's policyholders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Commissioner found Mercury knew of Bulletin 80-6, which provided all fees an agent collects on behalf of an insurer are premium and must be reported. Mercury had notice since 1999 that CDI considered Mercury's conduct violated the Insurance\n   Code and could lead to CDI filing a notice of noncompliance. Although Mercury had actual notice of the violation, it willfully continued to charge the improper \"broker fees\" through the end of 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Commissioner's Decision found CDI's delay in filing the Final NNC while waiting for the conclusion of\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   was a proper exercise of judicial economy and conservation of state resources and did not result in an unreasonable delay in filing the Final NNC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Commissioner found Mercury was subject to a penalty for each unlawful fee it charged. It imposed a penalty of $ 150 for each violation from September 1999 to August 2004 for a total sum of $ 27,593,550 for 183,957 acts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Subsequently, Mercury filed the action seeking a writ of administrative mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 challenging the Commissioner's Decision. Consumer Watchdog intervened in opposition to the petition. Thereafter, the court granted the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the minute order setting out the decision (Minute Order), the court did not dispute the findings in the Commissioner's Decision as to collateral estoppel, that Mercury's \"brokers\" were de facto agents, or that AIS \"brokers\" were de facto agents throughout the penalty period. It acknowledged Mercury did not dispute that AIS brokers were its de facto agents. Nevertheless, the court found the \"broker fees\" were not premium because charged for a separate service. It further rejected the Commissioner's interpretation of \"premium\" under the Insurance Code and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court also ruled the penalty violated due process because Mercury did not have \"fair notice that it could be subjected to penalties.\" Further, the court found CDI had \"unduly delayed in issuing the NNC,\" giving rise to the bar of laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Additional facts are set out in the discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    1.

The Commissioner found the \"broker fees\" were premium, not payment for separate services. The Commissioner cited to evidence that \"broker fees\" were charged by Mercury's \"brokers,\" i.e., de facto agents, in the course of their agency on behalf of Mercury. The \"broker fees\" were not fees charged for services on behalf of the insured. Rather, the Commissioner found, the \"broker fees\" are actually agent fees, which are part of premium and must be included in a rate application for prior approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The court's finding that \"broker fees\" were proper is based on an erroneous assumption the \"brokers\" were acting in that capacity, not as agents, as found by\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   . Further, the finding that \"broker fees\" were for a separate service cannot be reconciled under the circumstances of the case. If the \"brokers\" were in fact agents acting within their agency on behalf of\n   Mercury, they could not also have been acting as brokers and providing separate services on behalf of customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Acknowledging 10 CCR section 2189.3 prohibits an agent from charging a broker fee, the court opined \"that does not make such a fee into a 'premium' under the rate statutes.\" There is no legal basis for such a conclusion.

Further, under 10 CCR section 2360.0(c), premium includes \"fees\" and \"all other items which change the amount the insurer charges to the insured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   After setting out applicable law, the Commissioner's Decision stated Mercury's \"brokers,\" as de facto agents, collected \"broker fees\" while transacting insurance business on behalf of Mercury and thus the fees could not be deemed to be \"traditional 'broker' [fees] for services.\" Rather, they had to be \"deemed agent fees,\" which, under Bulletin 80-6 and 10 CCR section 2360.0(c), are premium and \"and must be reported in a rate application for prior approval.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The trial court found 10 CCR section 2360.0(c) was not applicable based on its conclusion \"broker fees\" charged here were for separate services.

Such is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In our case there was no policy change. Rather, at all applicable times section 1861.01, subdivision (c) specifically barred charging unapproved rates and section 1861.05, subdivision (a) likewise prohibited unfairly discriminatory rates. The Commissioner's Decision found Mercury did not dispute that. Further, as stated above, at all relevant times section 1858.07, subdivision (a) expressly authorized the Commissioner to impose penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In addition in 1980 CDI promulgated Bulletin 80-6, which stated all payments made by an insured, including fees, are premium, which must be reported to CDI as such and are governed by antidiscrimination statutes. The Commissioner's Decision found Mercury knew of Bulletin 80-6. This finding is uncontroverted, and it was uncontested by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Further, the Commissioner found CDI \"consistently advised\" Mercury the conduct of Mercury's \"brokers\" charging \"broker fees\" was a violation of the rate statutes subjecting Mercury to penalties. It found Mercury was on notice as early as February 1999 when CDI sent the 1998 Exam Report to Mercury. It found Mercury also had notice from the Draft NNC sent to Mercury in January 2000, where CDI stated the \"brokers\" were not acting consistent with the definition of a broker; all payments by an insured which are part of the cost of insurance, including payments to an agent, are premium; and fees the \"brokers\" were charging \"were not part of an approved rate application\" as required by the Insurance Code\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Additional notice was given during \"frequent communications\" between CDI and Mercury about the Exam Report and the Draft NNC between August 1999 and October 2000; from the filing of the 1998 Exam Report in December 2000; and from the filing of\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   , and rendering of the\n   <em>\n    Krumme\n   </em>\n   opinion. In addition, Mercury points to no evidence CDI ever approved \"broker fees\" charged by Mercury's agents or indicated they complied with Proposition 103. None of these findings were contested in the Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Instead, the court found the law \"generally [was] unclear\" before the Draft NNC was issued. It based this on statements in the 1997 Tomashoff Letter that \"fees could be charged by agents that would not be deemed premium if provided for services outside the scope of the agency.\" This does not contradict CDI's position because the \"broker fees\" at issue were not actually broker fees but were charged by Mercury's de facto agents acting within the scope of their agency for Mercury, and thus were premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Further, the Commissioner found the Tomashoff Letter was not sent to Mercury nor was it addressing Mercury's practices. Moreover, even if Mercury initially could have relied on the Tomashoff Letter, it could not continue to do so after CDI sent the 1998 Exam Report in February 1999. The court failed to address this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The court also apparently relied on a statement made by Tomashoff in a 1999 public hearing that the distinction between a broker and an agent was sometimes ambiguous. But as the Commissioner found, this was a general statement, not made to or about Mercury. In fact, there is no evidence Mercury attended the meeting or knew of the comments. Further, although there might sometimes be ambiguity, there was no ambiguity under the specific facts of this case. And in any event Mercury cannot claim to rely on statements made in 1997 and 1999 after receiving notice at least three times in 2000 that its conduct was violating the statute and subjecting it to penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In addition, as the Commissioner found, in September 1999 Mercury published a bulletin to its producers, which stated, \"We believe that the Insurance Department may take the position that all Mercury and Cal Auto producers are acting as agents and represent the company even if the producer's contract is a broker contract.... Under these proposed regulations no broker fee could be charged on any Mercury or Cal Auto personal lines business.\" Therefore, its own bulletin confirms Mercury knew there was an issue about its practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Mercury relies on the trial court's factual findings to support its argument it did not have fair notice. But as discussed above, in making the findings, the court did not give the proper weight to the findings in the Commissioner's Decision. Consequently, the trial court's findings do not withstand scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   First, the trial court pointed out that CDI did not respond to the Mercury Letter sent in November 2000 in which Mercury stated it believed AB 2639 had resolved the improper \"broker fees\" issue. But the Commissioner's Decision specifically rejected this claim, stating, \"Given CDI's opposition to A.B. 2639, and the language in the final version of the bill that was enacted, Mercury cannot reasonably assert that it believed A.B. 2639 resolved the issues in CDI's 1998 Exam Report and Draft Notice.\" Further, the trial court did not explain how AB 2639 as adopted, and different than what Mercury proposed, in fact did resolve the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Additionally, only a few weeks after the Mercury Letter was sent, CDI issued the final version of the 1998 Exam Report reiterating that Mercury's practices were unlawful. The Commissioner found this \"further placed Mercury on notice that CDI did not consider\" the issue was resolved and Mercury's assertion it believed AB 2639 had resolved the issue was \"disingenuous.\" Although the trial court may \"substitute its own credibility determinations,\" \"it cannot ignore its statutory obligation to defer to the Commission's considered credibility findings in doing so. In our view, the superior court's decision-which is silent as to the Commission's thoughtful reasoning and analysis as to the witnesses'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   credibility-did not afford the respect due those findings.\" (\n   <em>\n    San Diego Unified School Dist. v.

It failed to note or dispute, however, the Commissioner's finding the issue had already been referred to the legal division for enforcement. In addition, the 2002 exam report stated, \"Failure to identify, comment on, or criticize non-compliant activities does not constitute acceptance of such activities.\" Further, the Final NNC was filed six weeks before the 2002 exam report issued. Subsequent silence in the 2002 exam report cannot disaffirm that prior notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Finally, the Minute Order relied on CDI's approval of Mercury's rate applications, which did not include \"broker fees.\" But the Commissioner found the applications were incomplete and \"Mercury cannot assert that it relied on CDI's approval of its rate applications to conclude that its designated 'broker's' 'broker fees' were not unlawful when the 'broker fees' were actually omitted and never approved by CDI.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Mercury argues section 1858.07, subdivision (b), a safe harbor statute, should apply. It prohibits imposition of a penalty where the Commissioner has approved a rate. The trial court correctly ruled this statute did not apply because Mercury did not provide complete information. We are not persuaded by Mercury's claim CDI did not charge it with providing false information. The weight of the evidence controverts Mercury's claim it should be afforded safe harbor protection because it \"had no idea\" it should have included \"broker fees\" in its rate applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Neither\n   <em>\n    MacKay v.

Due Process - First Administrative Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Mercury seeks affirmance of the judgment on a wholly separate argument rejected by the trial court. During the administrative proceedings a dispute arose as to the requirements of California Code of Regulations, title 10, former section 2614.13 ( 10 CCR \u00a7 2614.13 ) dealing with \"prepared direct testimony\" (PDT) of witnesses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   which required testimony to be in writing and submitted 40 business days before the hearing. CDI and CWD argued the regulation did not apply to adverse witnesses. The Administrative Law Judge, Steven C. Owyang (ALJ Owyang), ruled to the contrary. (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1.) ALJ Owyang refused CDI and CWD's request to certify the question of whether former 10 CCR section 2614.13 applied to adverse witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1,\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Subsequently the Commissioner (at the time Steve Poizner) issued a notice of a proposed change to 10 CCR section 2614.13 making it applicable to only party-affiliated witnesses or their experts. (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1.) Mercury filed comments and spoke at the hearing in opposition to the rule change. After 10 CCR section 2614.13 was amended as proposed, ALJ Owyang ruled the amended regulation would not apply in the hearing. He also ordered CDI's general counsel, Adam M. Cole, to disclose any ex parte communications between the Commissioner and the CDI about the rule change. (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   , at p. 2.) Cole disclosed that he had initiated the rule change to fix what CDI believed\n   was an erroneous interpretation of former 10 CCR section 2614.13 and spoke with former Commissioner Poizner's chief of staff and special counsel about it. (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1,\n   </em>\n   at p. 2 )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   ALJ Owyang then issued a proposed decision to dismiss the administrative proceeding for several reasons, including that the ex parte communications between the CDI and the Commissioner's office violated due process. The Commissioner rejected the recommendation (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   , at p. 2 ) and ordered a hearing on the merits. Mercury filed a writ petition to require the Commissioner to adopt the proposed decision. (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1.) When Mercury appealed the trial court's order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the court of appeal affirmed. (\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   , at p. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The administrative proceeding was then assigned to ALJ Scarlett. He ruled former 10 CCR section 2614.13 would apply but if PDT's for adverse witnesses could not be obtained, after unsigned PDT's for those witnesses were served on the opposing party, those witnesses could be subpoenaed to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The issue was litigated at the administrative hearing and ALJ Scarlett found the ex parte communications did not violate due process and Commissioner Poizner was no longer in office, thereby effectively disqualifying the decisions maker. Further, Mercury had a full hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   When Mercury raised this issue in the writ proceeding, the trial court rejected Mercury's claim the proceeding should be dismissed, finding Mercury had received a fair hearing. It further found no evidence Commissioner Jones was a party to any improper communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Mercury again argues in this appeal that the only remedy for the due process violations is dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Cases on which Mercury relies are distinguishable.

Nothing comparable occurred here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   We also reject Mercury's argument the hearing in front of ALJ Scarlett was tainted. Mercury complains ALJ Scarlett deviated from ALJ Owyang's ruling because he allowed adverse witnesses to testify pursuant to subpoena. But ALJ Owyang never ruled out the possibility of allowing noncooperating witnesses to testify. Further, Mercury cites no authority that ALJ Scarlett was required to follow ALJ Owyang's procedural decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The fact the Commissioner rejected ALJ's Owyang's proposed order and\n   adopted the proposed decision of ALJ Scarlett does not show the hearing was unfair. The trial court did not agree with Mercury's contention that Commissioner Jones was \"infected\" because he retained Commissioner Poizner's prosecutors and senior advisors, noting there was no evidence. Mercury does not cite to any evidence in the respondent's brief either. There is no basis to dismiss the proceedings against Mercury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Mercury filed a motion to strike a portion of CWD's reply brief addressing this issue, claiming CWD did not properly explain the decision in\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   and failed to disclose the findings of the trial court here, which, Mercury claims, rejected CWD's argument. We deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   We do not decide the substance of Mercury's motion but note we did not rely on any improper or incomplete argument in CWD's reply brief. Our summary of the facts was taken from\n   <em>\n    Mercury 1\n   </em>\n   , and our analysis of the trial court's ruling was based on our independent review of the Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <em>\n    6. Remand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Based on the trial court's failure to apply the proper standard of review one option would be for us to reverse and remand for the trial court to properly exercise its independent judgment. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Fukuda, supra\n   </em>\n   , 20 Cal.4th at p. 825,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20696\">\n    85 Cal.Rptr.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20P.2d%20693\">\n    977 P.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) However, a proper application of the standard of review, i.e., according a strong presumption of correctness to the findings, leads to only one conclusion, i.e., Mercury did not meet its burden to prove the findings in the Commissioner's Decision were not supported by the evidence. As stated above, the court did not reject the evidence, nor did it contest the findings in the Commissioner's Decision. In addition, several of the issues presented were questions of law, subject to our de novo review. On that basis, it would be an \"idle act\" to remand for a new hearing.
