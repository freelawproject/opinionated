Colette and the Waystation demurred to the complaint, arguing Summers, who as a director had standing to bring this action when she filed it, lost standing when the Waystation board of directors later removed her as a director. The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that Summers did not lose standing to maintain this action when the Waystation removed her as a director and that the trial court erred in not granting Summers leave to amend to add the Attorney General as an indispensable party. Therefore, we reverse and remand with directions to overrule the demurrers based on lack of standing and allow Summers to add the Attorney General as a party to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    After Summers Files This Action, the Waystation Removes Her as a Director\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Summers filed this action against Colette and the Waystation to assert \"claims\n   ... as a director on behalf of the ... Waystation.\" Summers alleged that, while serving on the Waystation's board of directors, she learned Colette, a director who \"treated the Waystation as her own personal fiefdom,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   had engaged in numerous acts of self-dealing and breaches of fiduciary duty. Summers alleged that, after she confronted Colette about this misconduct, Colette orchestrated a vote to remove Summers from the board of directors, but that the vote was unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Summers alleged causes of\n   action for \"breach of fiduciary duty (self-dealing),\" \"breach of fiduciary duty (due care),\" breach of charitable trust, wrongful removal, unjust enrichment, declaratory relief, and conversion. She sought damages on behalf of the Waystation caused by Colette's misconduct, removal of Colette as a director, a declaration Summers was a director, and a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining the Waystation from removing her as a director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After issuing a temporary restraining order, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Colette and the Waystation from conducting further board meetings without providing notice to Summers and allowing her to participate as a director. At a subsequent Waystation board meeting of which Summers had proper notice and at which she participated, the board again voted to remove Summers as a director. Conceding her cause of action for wrongful removal was \"now[ ] unnecessary,\" Summers filed a first amended complaint without that cause of action. She also added a cause of action for an accounting and alleged she brought the \"claims in this action as a director at the time of the filing of [the] original complaint on behalf of the ... Waystation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Trial Court Sustains Demurrers by the Waystation and Colette\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Waystation demurred to all causes of action in the first amended complaint on the ground Summers \"is not the real party in interest and therefore lacks standing to sue.\" The Waystation also demurred to the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty by self-dealing on the grounds Summers had failed to join the Attorney General as an indispensable party and to allege she notified the Attorney General of the action before filing it. The Waystation similarly demurred to the cause of action for breach of charitable trust on the ground Summers did not give the Attorney General notice of the action. Colette demurred to the entire complaint on the ground Summers had \"no standing to bring this action\" because she was not a director or a member of the Waystation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In opposing the demurrers, Summers argued three statutes gave her standing to bring this action: Corporations Code section 5233, subdivision (c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides\n   that a director of a nonprofit corporation may \"bring an action\" to address self-dealing by another director; section 5142, subdivision (a), which provides that a director of a nonprofit corporation may \"bring an action to ... remedy a breach of a charitable trust\"; and section 5223, subdivision (a), which authorizes the superior court, \"at the suit of a director\"\n   of a nonprofit corporation, to remove another director for, among other things, fraud, dishonesty, or gross abuse of authority. Summers contended that, because she was a director when she filed the action, she continued to have standing under these statutes. She argued that allowing the Waystation and Colette to deprive her of standing by removing her after she filed this action would \"render[ ] the statute[s] meaningless\" and would be \"contrary to public policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regarding the Waystation's arguments about her failure to notify the Attorney General, Summers contended she did not have to allege such notification or notify the Attorney General before filing the complaint. She also submitted evidence she notified the Attorney General of the action in writing shortly after filing the complaint. Summers conceded her cause of action for self-dealing required her to join the Attorney General as an indispensable party, and she requested leave to amend to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also requested that, in the event the trial court sustained the demurrer for failure to notify or join the Attorney General, the court grant her leave to amend to cure those defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend. The court ruled \" Code of Civil Procedure Section 367 provides that cases must be prosecuted by real parties in interest. [Summers], whatever her standing or interest at the outset of this case, no longer has any standing or interest, and the current Board of Directors and officers, the present 'real parties in interest,' have no interest in pursuing the action.\" The court also ruled section 5233, subdivision (c), required the Attorney General \"to be joined and notified ... before the Complaint was filed, something that could not be cured retroactively.\" The court denied Summer's request for leave to amend to cure defects regarding joining or notifying the Attorney General on the ground Summers no longer had \"the status required to file anything.\" The court entered judgment dismissing the action with prejudice, and Summers timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Summers argues the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers. She contends that she continues to have standing under the statutes that authorized her to bring the action and that the trial court misapplied the statutory requirements for notifying the Attorney General of the action. She also contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying her leave to amend to join the Attorney General as an indispensable party. All three contentions have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standards of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \" ' \" 'On appeal from an order of dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer, our standard of review is de novo, i.e., we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.' \" [Citation.] In reviewing the complaint, \"we must assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded\n   by the plaintiffs, as well as those that are judicially noticeable.\" [Citation.] We may affirm on any basis stated in the demurrer, regardless of the ground on which the trial court based its ruling.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

As in the trial court, however, she cites three statutes she contends give her standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, section 5233, subdivisions (c) and (h), provides that the Attorney General or, if the Attorney General is joined as an indispensable party, a director of a nonprofit corporation \"may bring an action\" to remedy impermissible self-dealing by another director. Second, section 5142, subdivision (a)(3), provides that a director of a nonprofit corporation \"may bring an action to enjoin, correct, obtain damages for or to otherwise remedy a breach of a charitable trust.\" Finally, section 5223, subdivision (a), authorizes the\n   superior court, \"at the suit of a director\" of a nonprofit corporation, to remove another director for, among other things, fraudulent or dishonest acts, gross abuse of authority, or breach of duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties do not dispute that these statutes give a director standing to institute an action such as this one. They dispute whether, under these statutes, removing a director who has instituted the action deprives the director of standing to continue to pursue it. The parties refer to this as a question whether these statutes impose a \"continuous directorship\" requirement. Colette and the Waystation interpret the statutes as containing that requirement, Summers interprets them otherwise, and no California case appears to have addressed the issue. Summers, however, has the better argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \" ' \"When we interpret a statute, '[o]ur fundamental task ... is to determine the Legislature's intent so as to effectuate the law's purpose.

If the language is\n   clear, courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the Legislature did not intend.

The statutes provide a director \"may bring\" the action, but they do not say whether, having brought the action, the plaintiff must continue to be a director to continue to have standing. The Legislature, however, enacted section 5223, section 5142, and former section 5233 (which is identical in all relevant respects to the current version of section 5233 ) in 1978 as part of a new statutory scheme governing nonprofit corporations. (Stats. 1978, ch. 567, \u00a7 5, pp. 1755, 1762, 1764-1766; see Assem. Select Com. on the Revision of the Nonprofit Corp. Code, Summary of AB 2180 and AB 2181, July 27, 1978, at p. 1.) And considered in\n   the context of that statutory framework, the statutory language at issue suggests there is no continuous directorship requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In particular, Summers cites section 5710, which the Legislature enacted as part of that same framework (Stats. 1978, ch. 567, \u00a7 5, p. 1787) and which concerns actions brought on behalf of nonprofit corporations by members, as opposed to directors. Section 5710 provides that \"[n]o action may be instituted\n   <em>\n    or maintained\n   </em>\n   in the right of any corporation by any member\" unless the plaintiff alleges, among other things, he or she \"was a member at the time of the transaction or any part thereof of which plaintiff complains.\" (\u00a7 5710, subd. (b), italics added.)

After further reviewing the language and history of the statute, the Supreme Court concluded that, \"while section 800(b) seems to point to a continuous ownership requirement, the 'instituted or maintained' language does not clearly impose it.

But the court in\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   emphasized that the \"narrow\" issue before it involved the proper application of section 1602, which provides \"[e]very director shall have the absolute right ... to inspect\" a corporation's records. Because the court's\n   decision turned on its analysis of a director's right of inspection (\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 908, 915-919,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20850\">\n    110 Cal.Rptr.3d 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the decision offers little assistance in interpreting the statutes at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Waystation also quotes the statement in\n   <em>\n    Californians for Disability Rights v.

This correctly states the law, but it does not help answer the question whether, in fact, Summers continues to have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, Summers had standing under sections 5233, 5142, and 5223 at the time she instituted this action, and her subsequent removal as director did not deprive her of standing. In the absence of contrary legislative direction, we decline to read into these statutes a continuous directorship requirement. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's order sustaining the demurrers\n   to Summers's first amended complaint based on lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Trial Court Erred in Sustaining the Demurrer Without Leave To Amend for Failing To Join the Attorney General as an Indispensable Party and Notify the Attorney General of the Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Summers concedes section 5233 required her to join the Attorney General as an indispensable party, but contends the trial court erred in sustaining the Waystation's demurrer without leave to amend and dismissing her action with prejudice on that ground. She is correct. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 389, subds. (a), (b) [if an indispensable party has not been joined, \"the court shall order that he be made a party\" or, if that person \"cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed without prejudice\"];\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 61 Cal.2d at pp. 760-761,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20244\">\n    40 Cal.Rptr. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=394%20P.2d%20932\">\n    394 P.2d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [plaintiffs were entitled to leave to amend to join an indispensable party];\n   <em>\n    Irwin v.

On remand, the trial court must give Summers an opportunity to amend to join the Attorney General as an indispensable party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Summers also argues the trial court erred in sustaining the Waystation's demurrer for failure to notify the Attorney General of the action prior to filing it. Summers is correct again. The only relevant statute that requires notice of the action to the Attorney General, section 5142, does not state when the plaintiff must give that notice. (See \u00a7 5142, subd. (a) [\"[t]he\n   Attorney General shall be given notice of any action brought by [a director] and may intervene\"]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11, \u00a7 999.2(e) [notice to the Attorney General pursuant to section 5142 must include, among other things, \"the time, date and place at which the action or proceeding will occur,\n   <em>\n    or has occurred\n   </em>\n   ,\" italics added]; cf. \u00a7 5233, subd. (e) [an action by a director must be filed within two years of written notice to the Attorney General or, \"if no such notice is filed,\" within three years of the transaction at issue].) There is no question the Attorney General, having filed an amicus brief in support of Summers on appeal, has now received notice of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the matter remanded with directions for the trial court to vacate its order sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend and to enter a new order (1) overruling the demurrers on the grounds of lack of standing and failure to give the Attorney General notice of the action and (2) sustaining the demurrer by the Waystation with leave to amend to add the Attorney General as an indispensable party. The Attorney General's motion for judicial notice is denied as unnecessary to our decision. (\n   <em>\n    City of Grass Valley v.
