Summons case in <em>assumpsit. </em>Plea, <em>non assumpsit infra sex annos. </em>The cause of action did not accrue within six years; and to avoid this difficulty the plaintiff gave in evidence the will of Thomas Hamilton by which he made Thomas jVrConnell residuary legatee of his estate, and appointed him and the present defendant the executors. He also proved that Thomas M\u2019Connell, one of the executors, in his lifetime promised to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>debt claimed in this suit, and did actually pay 200 dollars on account of it. The question was, whether this proof was a sufficient answer to the defendant\u2019s plea. The court below (White, President) was of opinion that it was not, and directed a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-6\"><em>Brown </em>and <em>Buffington, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0oG\">cited, 17 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>347; 1 <em>Whart.

According to Fritz <em>v. </em>Thomas, 1 <em>Whart. Rep. </em>66, the executor\u2019s own promise would not do so. As the old promise is not revived but superseded by the new one, the consideration of a moral obligation would be wanting to make him personally liable; and though the residuary legatee may possibly be under a moral obligation to pay the testator\u2019s debts, though that is by no means clear, his promise to do so could bind no one but himself. The direction was therefore right.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
