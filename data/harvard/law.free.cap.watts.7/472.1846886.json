The defendant gave in evidence an assessment of taxes upon the whole tract for the year 1831 of 10 dollars 25 cents, and a sale of it by the treasurer to John Lepch for 473 dollars, a deed from the treasurer to John Leech, and from him lo his son Joseph Leech the defendant. The bond given by John Leech to the treasurer for the surplus purchase money was in the following form :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-10\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that I, John Leech, of Mercer county and commonwealth of Pennsylvania, am held and firmly bound unto D. T. Porter, treasurer of Mercer county in the commonwealth aforesaid, in the sum of 899 dollars 76 cents, the same to be paid to the said D. T. Porter, his certain attorney, executors, administrators or assigns. To which payment well and truly to be made, I do bind myself, my heirs, executors and administrators firmly by these presents, sealed with my seal, dated the 11th day of June in the year of our Lord 1832. The condition of this obligation is such, that if the above bouuden John Leech, his heirs, executors, administrators or any of them, do well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto the above named D. T. Porter, his certain attorney, executors, administrators or assigns, the just and full sum of 449 dollars 88 cents, when thereunto required by the owner or owners at the time of sale made by the said treasurer of Mercer county, his, her or their heirs, assigns or legal representatives, without any fraud or further delay than that which the law provides in such cases, then the above obligation to be void, or else to be and remain in full force and virtue. And I the aforesaid John Leech do hereby authorize and empower J. J. Pearson, Esq., or any other attorney of any court of record in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania or elsewhere, to appear for me in any such court in any suit or action brought or to be brought on the above obligation, and after one or more declarations filed for the above penalty, thereupon to appear for me and confess judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>or judgments to the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such suit or action, as of any term, with costs of suit and release of errors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">\u201cJohn Leech, [l. s.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">Indorsement, \u201cJohn Leech, for the purchase of lot No. 92, in the fifth district, of five hundred acres.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">The plaintiff then proved that John Leech had been an agent of captain Bartholemew, the father of the plaintiff, in taking care of the land and paying the taxes, and gave in evidence his account against the estate for taxes paid by him for the land from 1813 to 1828 amounting to 128 dollars including commissions, credit for 94 dollars, and a receipt for the balance 34 dollars dated the 15th of January 1829, signed \u201cJohn Leech, agent.\u201d John Leech was then called as a witness, and said \u201cthat the account was in his hand writing and that he gave it to John Bartholemew ; that when the land was advertized for sale, he wrote to John, and inclosed the letter to a member of the legislature from his county, informing him that it was sold, that he had no funds in his hands, and did not buy it in trust for them but for himself; that he had had a conversation with Mr Holstein, who said he would attend to it, that they were acquaintances of his.\u201d The defendant was acquainted with his father\u2019s agency. The defendant had cleared forty acres of the land, built a large barn and saw mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-9\">The plaintiff requested the court to charge the jury that the relation of principal and agent which had subsisted between the plaintiff\u2019s father and John Leech had not been so explicitly renounced as to enable him to become a purchaser, and that if it had, the surplus bond was so defective in not describing the land sold as to vitiate the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-10\">The court below charged the jury against the plaintiff on both these points and directed the jury to find for the defendant.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQs\">It is not denied that the defendant\u2019s father had been the plaintiff\u2019s agent and curator of the land. The father himself testified that his agency had expired before the sale; but that is not enough. To capacitate him as a purchaser' on his own account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>he must have explicitly resigned his trust. The most open, ingenuous and disinterested dealing is required of a confidential agent while he consents to act as such; and there must be an unambiguous relinquishment of his agency before he can acquire a personal interest in the subject of it. To leave a doubt of his position in this respect is to turn himself into a trustee. It is unnecessary to recur to authority for a principle so familiar or so accordant with common honesty. The agent was employed in this instance expressly to preserve the land from being sold ; and taking his agency to have been left unclosed by the absence of an explicit renunciation of it, neither Leisenring <em>v. </em>Black, 5 <em>Watts </em>303, nor Riddle <em>v. </em>Murphy, 7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>230, presented a stronger case to restrain the agent from purchasing for himself. Within the three preceding years he had been reimbursed his expenses and paid for his services; but that was not a dissolution of the previous relation; and it is not pretended that there was any other evidence of it. On the contrary, the fact that he gave intelligence of the sale to a co-tenant of the plaintiff, as well as to a friend of the family, evinces a consciousness that his duties as a fiduciary were not entirely closed. He. is therefore to be treated as having been a trustee.- But did the defendant purchase of him with notice <em>1 </em>Knowing, as he probably did, of the former existence of the agency, he would be bound to inquire into the duration of it; and he would stand affected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">There is, however, an objection to the treasurer\u2019s sale which goes to the root of it. The surplus bond contains no specification of the land ; and being referable to nothing in particular, it could neither create a lien nor give notice of one. As any thing but a common bond for the payment of money it was insensible and incurably vicious. Nor is it helped by the treasurer\u2019s subsequent indorsement of the district and number of the tract. That was an indorsement for the officer\u2019s convenience, but .no part of the instrument. In an action on it to reach the land (he terre-tenant might urge, with irresistible force, that the purchaser had not given the treasurer power to pledge it; and in looking into the bond, which alone is the purchaser\u2019s act, it would not be discovered that the purchaser had pledged it himself. The indorsement was a memorandum for the convenience of filing, which might have been made with equal propriety by the prothonolary\u2019s clerk. To whom, then, is the misprision to be charged <em>% </em>In White <em>v. </em>Willard, 1 <em>Watts </em>42, and Fager <em>v. </em>Campbell, 5 <em>Watts </em>247, the title was not prejudiced by the treasurer\u2019s omission to have the bond put on file ; but it had been held otherwise where'the purchaser had given no bond at all: and the instrument in the present case is certainly not the bond directed by the statute. But it is insisted that, as the purchaser does not furnish the instrument, his title is not to be avoided by a blunder in the preparation of it. The treasurer is certainly charged with the business of preparation ; but he is bound to perform it under the direction of the purchaser, who is bound, on the other hand, to know the of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>his title and to point out errors in the concoction of it. When the bond is delivered, his participation ends, and the exclusive business of the treasurer begins. That the purchaser previously acts at the peril of his title is shown by Connelly <em>v. </em>Nedrow, 6 <em>Watts </em>451, where a deposit of the surplus money was not allowed to be an equivalent for the statutory security. The defect is fatal, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire clenovo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
