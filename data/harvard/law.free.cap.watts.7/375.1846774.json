G. Clark and William Rodgers, on the 1st of September 1836, took the books out of our office. I forbid them. When the books were sold, Mr Jack forbid the sale; said the books were his. There was no money paid by Mr Jack to L. B. Durham only what I paid for him. I paid it for C. J. Durham and myself: he and I gave a note for <em>45 </em>dollars, and I gave him a note on Robert P. Barr for 103 dollars, 4 or <em>5 </em>dollars over 100 dollars; L. B. Durham took the note; Barr was to settle 100 dollars, and was.to pay me the balance over 100 dollars. I got the books in L. B. Durham &amp; Heath\u2019s office. They had them there from a former sale; Mr Jack never had possession of the books; Mr Jack got Mr Fullerton to assist me in bringing up the books from L. B. Durham &amp; Heath\u2019s office. We retained the possession there till levied upon by the sheriff. C. J. Durham and I in partnership; by me paying this money I got in partnership. Mr Jack had not the possession of the books after they came to our office till levied upon. When Jesse Clark took the books I told him to take a schedule, and stood by while he took it. The next day after the agreement of the 4th of June 1836 we took the books up to our office; two or three persons assisted in carrying books up. .Mr Jack scolded me for not beating the officers off; they came in when the office was open.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">The plaintiff then called Mr Buffington, who proved the value of the books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">The defendants gave in evidence a judgment of William Rodgers against C.

Properly speakings; there was not a sale, but a contract to sell at a future day ; and th| delivery in the meantime was a loan subject to be turned into- a sal^ by compliance with certain conditions. The plaintiff had received the possession as a purchaser, and it cannot be denied that the property had been vested in him. The consideration of his contract to sell to his bailees was their assumption, as principals, to pay his debt contracted for the purchase money. He had, in fact, purchased for their accommodation. That, however, was an arrangement to which his own vendor was not a party, and did not extinguish the original liability to him. The plaintiff continued to be debtor as to his vendor, and why not owner as to his bailees and their creditors. He was so by his contract of purchase; and by his contract to sell he was to cease to be so only at a time named. There was no touch of fraud in this; and the title must be taken to have been according to the ostensible purport of the contract. The transaction was all bailment with a contingent contract to sell, on the principle of Myers <em>v. </em>Harvey, 2 <em>Penns. Rep. </em>481. The plaintiff was, therefore, entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
