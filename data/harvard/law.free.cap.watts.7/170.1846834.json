The court below was of opinion that there should be a contribution by all; and rendered a judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-9\"><em>Evans </em>and <em>Mayer, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQE\">cited, 2 <em>Watts </em>332.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-10\"><em>Earnitz, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AZx\">The costs of an issue <em>devisavit vel non </em>must be borne by the parties, as they litigated for their individual interests and not for the benefit of the estate. The plaintiffs contended for their legacies under a supposititious will, and are no more entitled, as distributees, to contribution to the costs of litigation, than would a devisee, in the like circumstances, be entitled to the costs of an ejectment against the intestate\u2019s heirs. It is a species of litigation of which the fund is not to bear the burthen.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Judgment below reversed, and judgment for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
