The parties, having cross demands, agreed to the institution of an action and reference\u2014.judgment to be entered for him who should succeed; and this was obviously done to settle all by one operation. But to do that it was necessary that somebody should be plaintiff; and it is a matter of accident and small consequence that the loser has been found to have been arranged as such. Both were actors, and each in the attitude of a plaintiff; and as such the defendant was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Order to set aside the execution reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
