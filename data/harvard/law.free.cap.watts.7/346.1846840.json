And the plaintiff alleges that she, putting confidence in the promises and undertakings of the defendants as aforesaid, made at the time and place aforesaid, sold '-and delivered the property aforesaid to the defendants, and that the property was worth 500 dollars; and that afterwards, to wit at the day and year aforesaid, she demanded and required the defendants to pay to her the said sum of 500 dollars after deducting the said amounts due from the said Abel and David to the defendants. Yet the defendants, not in the least regarding their said promise and undertaking so as aforesaid made, but intending to defraud and injure the plaintiff, have never paid the same, but neglect and refuse so to do, to the damage of the plaintiff, as she says, 700 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The cause was referred to arbitrators, who awarded for the plaintiff 51 dollars 9 cents.

The plaintiff\u2019s father and brother were indebted to the defendants in several sums of money for merchandize sold t.o them by the defendants, the amount of which was unliquidated. The plaintiff afterwards sold to the defendants cattle and other articles, for which they agreed to pay her a sum considerably exceeding 100 dollars, deducting the amount due to them from the plaintiff\u2019s father and brother. Under this contract it was the duty of the defendants to ascertain the amount due to the father and brother, and to pay the balance to the plaintiff. After deducting that amount, they were to be the actors; it was their duty to be ready to pay the plaintiff when required; and being the creditors of the father and brother, they had the means of ascertaining and determining their debts; whereas the plaintiff was a stranger to the accounts between the parties, and had no power to liquidate them. Nor could she give the defendants a credit for any certain amount before such liquidation took place, without risk. She was therefore under a necessity of suing for the whole sum, in order that the amount to be deducted should be ascertained by legal course; and the case falls within the principle settled in cases of set off.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
