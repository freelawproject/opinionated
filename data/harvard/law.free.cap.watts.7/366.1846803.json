The prisoner was indicted at May sessions 1838, but had obtained a continuance for the absence of witnesses. He had been brought up again for trial at the June sessions, but was found to be labouring under small pox. Though convalescent, his aspect was so loathsome as to spread a general panic; and on the testimony of the physician of the prison that he might still communicate infection, he Was remanded, though insisting on being tried.
