These respondents also declare and say that they cannot settle any account of their proceedings in the premises, from recollection, after so long a time has elapsed. These respondents deny that Christian Mylin has any right whatever to apply for said citation according to the acts of assembly and the circumstances of this case; and these respondents further deny, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>most explicitly declare and say, that they have no money or estate whatever in their hands, of the said Christian Mylin, under the said deed of assignment, since the 5th day of March 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">That in the district court for the city and county of Lancaster, these respondents were attached for refusing to settle an account on the estate of said Christian Mylin, and after full argument on the 20th and 21st days of October 1835, they were discharged, &amp;c.

The court below refused to grant the attachment, and made absolute the rule on behalf of the respondents to show cause'why they should not be discharged front the citation,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-9\"><em>Norris, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7Z\">cited, 1 <em>Madd.

The presumption is, that every thing has been fairly and honestly done ; and such releases and settlements are fa-, voured by the courts, because they tend, to repose and quietness, But it is said, that relief against a release is given by courts of law and equity, in the same manner, as against other contracts, under particular circumstances; as where it was obtained by fraud, or misrepresentation, or has been executed by one ignorant of his rights, and not in a situation to inform himself. So, where undue advantage is taken of the weakness or necessities qf the party, or when there exists a confidential personal relation, as if obtained by a guardian from his ward shortly after coming of age, or by an attorney from his client, or by a trustee from his <em>cestui trust. </em>The exceptions are undoubtedly as well founded as the rule itself. The confidential relation spoken of certainly exists ; and if it appeared that there was fraud, or imposition, or a gross mistake, we should feel bound to decree an account. But having already allowed Christian Mylin the 1500 dollars, in the account against the executors of John Mylin, it does not clearly appear that theye has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>been either fraud, imposition, or a gross mistake. Taking the sales of the real and personal estate to amount to 13,835 dollars, and the payments to 12,802 dollars, there remains a balance of 1032 dollars. From this we must deduct the costs, charges and commissions for settling the estate, also the debts by simple contracts, which doubtless existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">After these deductions are made, we cannot say that such a clear case has been exhibited, as would justify us in disturbing a settlement, after such a lapse of time. Fraud is not to be presumed; and no evidence has been given that can induce us to suppose, that in this transaction there has been any unfair dealing or practice. The settlement was made in the lifetime of the father, with his knowledge and assent. He, without doubt, would see justice done to his unfortunate son Christian. As, under all the circumstances, we think it would be a dangerous precedent to interfere with the settlements, it is ordered that the decree of the common pleas be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
