Walker. Appeal from the judgment of a justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">By the transcript of the justice it appeared that he rendered a judgment in trespass for the defendant for costs, <em>22 </em>dollars and 36 cents, on the 1st of N\u00f3vember 1837, and that, the plaintiff entered an appeal. The transcript was filed the 27th November 1837. It did not appear what was the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, nor when the appeal was entered before the justice. A motion was made by the defendant to strike off the appeal. After this the plaintiff procured and filed the following certificates of the justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-12\">\u201cI certify that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in this case was 20 dollars for the price of a cow, and that they produced proof that the properly was worth from 13 to 15 dollars in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-13\">\u201cWitness my hand this 1st day of December 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-14\">\u201cJ.

It purported not to be such, but a certificate of facts within the justice\u2019s recollection and not entered by him in his minutes; and it would be more proper to call it an alteration of his docket, than an amendment of the transcript of it. It is an alteration however, that he dare not actually make; for it would be not only against, all rule, but exceedingly dangerous to suffer him to add to his docket to suit the varying fortunes of the parties in the contest before the court. His certificate became not a part of the record; and for purposes of adjudication, it was worth no more than the written assertion of any other individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
