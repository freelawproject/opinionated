There were three houses standing on the lots, two of frame and one of brick, occupied by him at the time of his death and since by his widow, the respondent, as a family residence. She has received the rents of the two frame houses and paid taxes, interest, water rates and other annual charges and expenses of the premises. The bill was filed by William H. Spinning, one of the children, for a partition of this real estate- among the heirs-at-law, the seven children of the said Charles Spinning, deceased, and for an account of the rents, issues and profits. The only contention before the court of chancery was whether the respondent should be charged, in her accounting, with taxes, water rents, ordinary repairs of the mansion-house and a proportion of the interest on the mortgage. The court below having decreed that the widow was not chargeable with these items, the complainant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-4\"><em>Mr. Franklin M.

The <em>dictum </em>of Justice Gould, quoted in Halsted, was afterwards retracted, and the decision of the court was put upon grounds entirely at variance-with this first position of Justice Gould.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">Chancellor Kent, <em>4, Com. *62, </em>says that this position, in <em>Den </em>v. <em>Dodd, \u201c </em>is opposed to the decided weight of all English and American authorities,\u201d but approves of it on the ground of our statute; he evidently, though erroneously, supposing that our statute had been passed prior to the decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\"><em>2 Scrib. on Dower ch. 3 </em>\u00a7 <em>21, </em>in alluding to <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-9\"><em>\u201c </em>But this <em>dictum </em>is opposed to the clear weight of authority, and Lord Chief-Justice DeGrey, in subsequently delivering the opinion of the whole court, placed the decision upon grounds entirely at variance with the hastily expressed opinion of Mr.. Justice Gould;\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-10\">So, in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Webb, 1 Yeates 424 </em>\u201cThe words of Mr.. Justice Gould, in <em>3 Wilson, </em>have been relied on. These were his expressions on the first, opening of the case, but however humane the sentiment was, we find he afterwards relinquished the position as untenable, for Lord Chief-Justice DeGrey, in delivering the sentiment of the whole court-, says : (If the mother had entered for her dower when it was not assigned to her it would have been a disseizin.\u2019 And the very ground of the plaintiff\u2019s recovering as heir-at-law of the infant son was that the possession of the mother and daughters was the possession of the daughters, and when -the son was born the estate was divested out of the daughters, and not before; then the son was in absolute possession and seizin of the premises by his mother, who had a right to the possession, being his guardian by law, though not seizin as such.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-11\">In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donaghy, 7 Johns. 247, </em>the court, per Justice \"Van Ness, say: \u201c The privilege of a widow to tarry in the chief house of her husband for forty days, or until dower be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>assigned her, does not protect her from an action of ejectment by the heir or any person deriving title from him after the forty days have elapsed. There is some difference between' the words \u25a0of our statute and Magna Charta. In the former the expression is that \u2018 the widow shall tarry forty days or until/ and the latter \u2018 within which time.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-4\">\u201c It is supposed that under our statute the widow has a right to quarantine until her dower be assigned. If this had been the intention of the legislature, then a limitation of it to forty days would be useless. The construction of our statute and Magna Charta must be the same, and that of the latter appears to be well settled. After the expiration of forty days the heir can \u25a0expel her and put her to a suit. <em>Co. Litt. 31\u00a1, b.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\"><em>\u201c </em>In a case reported in <em>Jenkyn\u2019s Century 184 </em>case <em>16, </em>it was ruled by all the judges that a widow may live in the chief house \u2022of her husband forty days and no longer. The true construction of our statute and the provision of the Magna Charta appears to be that the widow shall enjoy her quarantine for forty days, unless, within that time, dower be assigned. The only instance which has fallen under my observation in which this construction of Magna Charta has been questioned is a <em>dictum </em>of Justice Gould, in the case of <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Newman, 3 Wils. 519, </em>where he said that \u2018 a court would not turn her out until her \u2022dower was assigned/ but he was undoubtedly mistaken.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">As to the common law right being for more than forty days, <em>Den </em>v. <em>Dodd </em>is therefore clearly wrong, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">II. The estate granted by our New Jersey act\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">(1) Is not' merely a right to <em>\u201c </em>t\u00e1rry \u201d for forty days, but to remain in, and to hold and enjoy.\u201d See <em>Rev. p. 380 </em>\u00a7 <em>8, </em>first \u2022used in Paterson\u2019s dower act; January 31st, 1799.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-11\">(2) 'Is not for a limited time, but'until dower be assigned. The heir cannot put her out, and put her to her suit for dower, \u2022but she can occupy until he takes 'steps to assign dower. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-14\">(3) Her estate continues notwithstanding her remarriage. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-15\">(4) It is a right to live on the land and to enjoy its rents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>issues and profits, and to have the produce as crops. <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Wilson, Pen. 281; Merchant\u2019s Case, 12 Stew. Eq. 506.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">(5) It is a right, not only for the widow to live on the land herself, but she can rent to another and receive the rents herself. <em>Craige </em>v. <em>Morris, 10 C. E. Gr. 467.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">(6) It is such a right as enables her to maintain trespass. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Potter, 3 Vr. 78.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-8\">(7) Its object is not simply to provide a temporary home for the widow during a short period of her extreme grief, but to provide for her until the heir does his legal duty by taking the legal steps to assign her her dower. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, 7 C. E. Gr. 569.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-9\">(8) The words \u201c and to hold and enjoy,\u201d added by Judge Paterson, in our act, to the \u201c <em>maneat \u201d </em>or \u201c tarrie \u201d of Magna Charta, show conclusively that something more was intended than merely to enlarge the time of common law quarantine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-10\">The addition of these words could have had but one object, and that to change the mere personal privilege of the common law to a substantial estate in the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-11\">(9) Lord Mansfield, as counsel in the case of <em>Fountain </em>v. <em>Pellid, 1 Ves. Jr. 339, </em>says of similar words: \u201c'To have, hold, use, occupy and enjoy/ are the very words of a legal estate for life.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-12\">(10) It is true that the cases in New Jersey sometimes speak of this right as a privilege, as did the vice-chancellor in the case of <em>Bleecker </em>v. <em>Hennion, 8 C. E. Gr. 123, </em>but, while so speaking of it, none of these cases say that it is not an estate. In fact the only inference from all of them is that it is an estate; and it is so expressly styled in <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Shelp, 3 Hal. 129 </em>and <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Hiler, 3 Dutch. 43, 53, </em>and by Chancellor Runyon in <em>Craige </em>v. <em>Morris, 10 C. E. Gr. 467; Colgan </em>v. <em>Pellens, 19 Vr. 27, 32.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-13\">The case of <em>Bleecker </em>v. <em>Hennion </em>only holds that it is not such a particular estate as under the act of 1858 <em>(Rev. p. 80\u00a3 </em>\u00a7 <em>30), </em>\u2022requires a consent before a partition can be made; but that it is a part of the dower estate, and' is, therefore, so far as partition is concerned, controlled by the act of 1855. <em>Rev. p. 1046 </em>\u00a7 <em>18.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-14\">But the court distinctly recognizes it as an estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>So, in <em>Smallwood </em>v. <em>Bilderback, 1 Harr. 497, </em>it is held that, if a widow voluntarily gives up her quarantine by leaving the mansion-house, she cannot re-enter; but it by no means follows from this that her right is not an estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-4\">Quarantine is therefore an estate liable to be defeated either by assignment of dower or by voluntary surrender.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-5\"><em>Second. </em>Quarantine in New Jersey is not an estate at will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">It differs from it in the three points which chiefly characterize an estate at will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-7\">I. It arises by operation of law and not by lease, by contract or by act of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\">An estate at will always arises by mere contract. <em>Littleton\u2019s Tenures b. I. c. 8 </em>\u00a7 <em>68; 1 Black. Com. *145; 1 Washb. on Real Prop. *370; Challis on Real Prop. *46.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-9\">II. Tenancy at will confers no right or interest that is assignable. <em>Wms. on Real Prop. *339; 1 Washb. on Real Prop. *370.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-10\">III. Tenancy at will is determinable at will of either party <em>\u25a0 </em>quarantine at will of the widow only, or by legal assignment of dower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-11\"><em>Third. </em>Quarantine being therefore an estate, and not an estate at will, it can'only be an estate for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-12\">I. Consider the ordinary classification of legal estates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-13\">Quarantine is not, of course, an estate in fee for years, or at sufferance; and, not being an estate at will, it must be classed as a life estate, as shown below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-15\">II. Quarantine is \u201can estate for some uncertain period which may by possibility last for life.\u201d <em>Prof. T. W. Dwight's MS. Lectures.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-16\">It belongs, therefore, to a well recognized branch of life estates, and comes within the definition given by all elementary writers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-17\">As said by Coke in <em>Co. Litt. 44 B, 42 A: \u201c </em>If a man grant an estate to a woman <em>dum sola fuit, </em>or <em>durante viduitate, </em>or <em>quamdiu se bene gesserit, </em>or to a man and woman during coverture, or as long as the grantee dwell in such a house, or so long as he pay xl. <em>&amp;c., </em>or until the grantee be promoted to a benefice, or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>any like uncertain time, which time, as Bracton saith, is <em>tempus indeterminatum </em>\u2014 in all these cases, if it be of lands and tenements, the lessee hath, in the judgment of the law, an estate for life determinable if livery be made; and if it be of rents, advowsons, or any other thing that lie in grant, he hath a like estate for life by the delivery of the deed, and in count or pleading he shall allege the lease and conclude that by force thereof he was seized generally for the term of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">\u201c There are now some estates which may not even last a lifetime, but are yet considered in law as life estates, and are estates of freehold.\u201d <em>Wins, on Real Prop. </em>\u00a7</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-7\">\u201c This is rather a class of estates and embraces all freeholds which are not of inheritance, including estates held by the tenant for the term of his own life or for the life or lives of one or more other persons, or for an indefinite period, which may endure for the life or lives of persons in being, and not beyond the period of a life.\u201d <em>1 Washb. on Real Prop. (4th ed.) book I. ch. 5 p. 114- </em>\u00a7 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-8\">\u201cThese may be created by the act of some party, as by-a deed or devise, or by act of the law, as in case of dower and curtesy, as being incident to relations like that of marriage, which are created by law.\u201d <em>Id. p. 115.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-9\">\u201c It matters not how. contingent or uncertain the duration of the estate may be, or how probable is its determination in a limited number of years; if it is capable of enduring for the term of a life, it is within the category of estates for life.\u201d <em>Id. p. 116.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-11\">Again: \u201c A man may have an estate for the term of life determinable at will; as if the king doth grant an office to one at will and grant a rent to him for the exercise of his office for the term of his life. This is determinable upon the termination of the office.\u201d <em>Co. Litt. p. 142 A.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-12\">III. Precedents support the view that such is a life estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-13\">(1) Precedents in other states:</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-14\"><em>Roseboom </em>v. <em>Van Vechten, 5 Den. 409, 424. </em>By the court: \u201c Under the will of Jacob Roseboom, his widow acquired an estate during widowhood in this lot of land. That was an estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>for life, determinable on her ceasing to be such widow, and during its continuance was a freehold.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\">So, in Massachusetts, the court held that the estate given by the homestead exemption act (which is the same as under our homestead act, <em>Rev. p. 1055) </em>is a life estate. <em>Kerley </em>v. <em>Kerley, 13 Allen 286. </em>\u201c A right of homestead is a new species of estate</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">created by statute and not known to the common law. But it seems to have all the incidents of a freehold estate, and to come within the definition given by elementary writers. It is an estate indeterminate in its duration, and which may continue for the joint lives of the purchaser and his wife.

The following rules are applicable: Expression of one thing means the exclusion of other. The act alters the common law and is in derogation of the right of the heir, and according to <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, 7 C. E. Gr. 509, </em>it is also in the nature of a penalty 021 the heir to compel him to assign dower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-14\">(d) Inconsistencies and incongruities arising from construing this word \u201crent\u201d in our statute so as to make it include all charges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-15\"><em>First. </em>Such a construction would lead to this result: the widow need not pay interest on a mortgage, although she joined in it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The statute gives her the right to remain in and hold and enjoy till her dower be assigned. The heir does not- pay the interest, yet the mortgagee cannot eject <em>her; </em>and if he foreclose, the purchaser on foreclosure sale cannot enter until her quarantine cease. She can remain and take the produce, or collect the rents, and the mortgagee is powerless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-4\">Again, under such a construction, she need not pay taxes. How, then, can the city or state sell the land so as to affect her right ? If the construction of the act be as held by the court below, then the quarantine right is an estate far superior to dower. It is a right to hold and enjoy land free of all claims and demands whatsoever, and even the state itself cannot collect its revenue except subject to this right. Her signing a mortgage is then of no avail against this right. She bars her dower, to be sure, but can still enjoy her quarantine as fully as if she had not. Surely a construction which would lead to such results should not be put upon a statute when its plain, natural meaning by no means warrants it. If this be so only as between the widow and the heir, but her right is subject to encumbrancers\u2019 rights, it would follow that she could pay interest to save her possession, be subrogated to the mortgagee\u2019s rights as respects such interest, and bring suit to subject the property to the lien of her claim against the heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\"><em>Second. </em>Quarantine can only be had in estates of which the widow is dowable. So all the books agree. <em>2 Scrib. on Dower (2d ed.) 57 \u00a7 5; 1 Washb. on Real Prop. *222; Morgan </em>v. <em>Titus, 2 Gr. Ch. 201, 204.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">In case of a mortgage in which a widow joins she has dower in the equity of redemption only. Can she then have quarantine in anything but such equity ? The decree appealed from gives respondent quarantine in the entire estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\"><em>Third. </em>As to water rent or water tax. It would certainly seem that in equity the widow should pay this charge. She uses the water. In no way is the heir benefited. So far as he is concerned, the water could be shut off. And yet, by the decision of the court of chancery, she can use the water and compel the heir to pay for it, and thus so far furnish her maintenance during her quarantine. Though not so evident, the same reasoning applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>to all taxes.

Being entitled to use and occupy the same without accounting for the profits and gains made from it, no one would say that she should not, in justice and equity, pay the taxes and keep the premises in repair. We are aware of no principle of law or equity that would impose the duty on the heirs to pay the taxes and keep up the repairs of the farm, for the use of the widow, when she is in receipt of all the rents and profits. Nor had she the right, at the expense of the heirs, to erect the stable and clear the land.

Pennington, Jr., </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-13\">The issues in this case raise the question whether the respondent, the widow of Charles Spinning, deceased, and who,' after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>death and without assignment to her of her dower, remained in the chief dwelling-house of her husband, according to law under the provisions of the statute of this state, was, during such occupancy, bound to keep down the interest on encumbrances, to pay ordinary taxes, and should be charged with the necessary repairs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\">The insistment of the appellant, her son and one of the seven heirs-at-law of the decedent, that the respondent is so liable for annual charges on the mansion-house and premises would seem to rest upon the applicability to the present case of the rule embodied in the maxim that the person who derives the advantage ought to sustain the burden.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-7\">It is unquestioned that this rule applies to the case of every owner of a life estate, every tenant by the curtesy, every tenant in dower \u2014 that is to say, every widow after assignment to her of her dower, in respect of the land so set off to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-8\">The vice-chancellor, in his opinion in this case, aptly observes that other tenants, such as tenants for years, from year to year, and at will, are not, in the absence of a contract to that effect, subject to such burden. But, as there are some exceptions which detract from the universality of this principle (see <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Blount, 11 Ired. 624; Hughes </em>v. <em>Young, 5 Gill &amp; Johns. 67), </em>and as such tenancies are usually founded on express contract reserving a fixed rent, it may be objected that it is the express contract which supersedes any such liability as might otherwise arise, <em>expressum faeit cessare taoitum, </em>and that the contract would control and limit the duty of the tenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-9\">It would seem, therefore, that the non-liability of the respondent for annual charges during such occupancy of the mansion-house of her deceased husband may be more firmly and securely rested on the peculiar and somewhat anomalous nature of her right now under consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-10\">The vice-chancellor, in his opinion, describes this right of the widow as a privilege in the nature of a tenancy at will, and probably such designation is sufficiently descriptive; but however it may be most accurately defined, it is clearly a legal right which equity will recognize and follow, and which, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>agreeable with natural .justice, is founded in the common law as recognized and extended by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">Before the Conquest, in England, we are told its d\u00faration was one entire year (Co. <em>Litt. 32 b); </em>by the Great Charter, it was limited to forty days, within which time dower must be assigned, whence its usual designation, \u201cwidowis quarantine.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">By our statute it is provided \u201c that until dower be assigned to her, it shall be lawful for her to remain in and to hold and enjoy the mansion-house'of her husband and the messuage or plantation thereto belonging, without being liable to pay any rent for the same.\u201d <em>Rev. p. 320 </em>\u00a7 <em>2.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">It seems almost needless to remark that in attempting a construction of such a statutory provision, not creating a new right, but adopting and amplifying an ancient privilege of the widow under common law, regard must be had, not to the words of the act alone, but especially to the nature and incidents of the right as it previously existed, and as it continues to exist, except so far as clearly altered by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">. The statute, moreover, does not appear to have been intended as an innovation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-9\">In <em>Den </em>v. <em>Dodd, 1 Hal. 367, </em>where it was held on common law that though the widow could not enter upon the land until dower had been assigned, yet, being in possession, she could not be ousted by the owner of the fee, unless her dower was assigned her. This case was so decided in the year 1797, and while Chancellor Kent refers to this decision as being against the decided weight of English and American authority <em>(4. Kent Com. *62), </em>yet, in 1799, two years later, the law was enacted substantially adopting the rule of this decision (see <em>Pat. 343), </em>and continues unaltered on our statute book to this day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-10\">That the widow\u2019s quarantine is a mere personal privilege, incident to a right of dower unassigned, and not an estate in the land, sufficiently appears from the following considerations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-11\">In <em>Smallwood </em>v. <em>Bilderback, 1 Harr. 506 </em>(per Ford, J.), it is said to be a privilege, personal to the widow herself, and if once she move out voluntarily and depart, it is gone forever, and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>dower is reduced to a naked right, only to he recovered by action at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">In the language of the present chief-justice, speaking generally of the right of dower before assignment: \u201cIt is clear that' she cannot, at this stage of her right, enter upon the estate or maintain ejectment, nor can her interest be seized on execution, nor can she transfer it at law, except by release to the terre-tenant by way of extinguishment.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Potter, 3 Vr. 78, 84.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">Notwithstanding, if she did not depart voluntarily, but was evicted by the heir or terre-tenant, she was, at common law, entitled to the writ <em>de quarantina habenda, </em>as given by Fitzherbert. <em>Nat. Brev. 162.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\"><em>. </em>If her quarantine was properly an estate in land, the widow? being out of possession, should have at least a right of entry upon the premises, but this, it is clear, she does not have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-9\">Again, in <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, 7 C. E. Gr. 606, </em>in giving the opinion of this court, the chief-justice speaks of the right in question as a privilege, and of our statute as but an \u2019 amplification of the provisions of Magna Charta, beneficially extending the term of the widow, and decides that occupancy under such right or privilege furnishes no counter claim or set-off to damages for detention of dower in other lands of her husband, and that to hold otherwise would be, in effect, to charge the widow with rent, and to expunge the statutory provision.

This case of <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Shelp </em>is considered in the opinion of the vice-chancellor, and requires no further reference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">The widow, during such occupancy by her of the mansion-house, is in no legal sense a tenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">She was not a tenant in the lifetime of her husband, though with her husband she was an occupant, and at and after his death she has the right to continue to occupy by virtue of the common law and the statute. But occupancy is not tenancy; and while the phrase employed in the act is <em>\u201c </em>remain in, hold and enjoy the mansion-house,\u201d it is clear the word \u201c hold \u201d cannot here be used in any technical sense, that is, to have an estate on condition of paying rent or performing service, or to be tenant to another, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>because the statute provides that the widow shall hold without rent, nor does it define of whom she is to hold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\">A dowress, after assignment of dower, does not hold as tenant under the heir who sets it out to her, but under her deceased husband, or rather by appointment of law, nor is there any privity of estate between the dowress and the reversioner of her lands. The freehold is vested in the dowress by virtue and in continuance of. her husband\u2019s seizin. It is only in respect of certain obsolete feudal relations that she is sometimes said to be <em>quasi </em>tenant under the heir. See a full discussion of this subject in <em>1 Washb. on Real Prop. *254 </em>and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">Since, therefore, quarantine is but a right incident to dower unassigned, the widow, during her occupancy under this right, cannot be said to hold under or be tenant of the heir. The words of the statute referred to must then be but a paraphrase of the expression <em>\u201c </em>remain in \u201d <em>(maneat) </em>of Magna Charta, defining more fully the intent of the common law privilege so recognized and extended, and do not create a tenancy ; and the further words of the statute, <em>\u201c </em>without being liable to pay any rent,\u201d properly speaking, cannot be a denial of rent to any supposed landlord out of her holding, but are only an equivalent to a provision that she shall not be liable in any wise in respect of her privilege, and shall occupy free of charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">All general and undefined tenancies, as well such as are created by grant or contract as those which arise by implication, entitle the tenant to the usual notice to quit. See <em>Den </em>v. <em>Drake, 2 Gr. 521, 531. </em>The right of the widow being but a permissive right, terminable at the option of the heir, on his setting off to her her dower, it would border on the absurd to suggest that she is entitled to such notice to quit as in case of a tenancy of uncertain duration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">It cannot be urged, therefore, that the widow\u2019s right of occupancy is an estate or tenancy in any proper legal sense, so as to subject her to any liability of a tenant for life (or for years) in regard to annual charges on the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">From these negative considerations we turn now to the more positive reasons for the widow\u2019s exemption from such duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The widow is entitled to be endowed immediately after her husband\u2019s death, and no prior demand by her is necessary to her right to have dower assigned to her, or to her claim of damages for its detention, and so pressing and compulsory is the obligation resting upon the heir that he cannot, in this state, plead <em>tout temps prist </em>to the claim of the demandant. <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Hopper, 2 Zab. 715, 724.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-4\">Her right of occupancy before assignment of dower is, in law, therefore, most temporary and evanescent, being thus dependent upon the continuing wrong or neglect of the heir or reversioner. This consideration was entirely overlooked hi <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Dawson, 63 Ill. 54, </em>as observed by the vice-chancellor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">The widow, during her quarantine, is entitled, at common law, and as incident to the right in question, to be supported out of her husband\u2019s personal estate <em>(de bonis viri). 1 Rop. on Husb. &amp; Wife *388 </em>and authorities cited; <em>1 Washb. on Real Prop. *222. </em>But see <em>Fitzherbert Nat. Brev. 162 </em>(in margin), where it is denied that she is entitled to meat and drink, for it is said the statute does not extend to it, though it is queried whether she may not kill anything if there be not meat in the house. The right to support, at common law, does not appear to be otherwise limited or qualified. <em>2 Scrib. on Dower 51.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">The widow is also entitled to estovers for repair of buildings, fences and instruments of husbandry, and this right is not the same enjoyed by a dowress and every other life tenant, that is, the right to her reasonable estovers out of the particular land so held, but something more extensive \u2014 a right to common of <em>estovers </em>\u2014 estoverium <em>de oommuni, </em>in the words of the Great Charter (chapter 7) \u2014 that is, to be taken from off another\u2019s estate in common, or, as applied to the present matter, from the estate of her husband other than the part so occupied by her under right of quarantine. This distinction is clearly pointed out in <em>Chitty\u2019s note, 2 Bl. Com. *35, </em>where the two are shown to be essentially different. See, also, <em>Steph.

A certain tract and buildings were apportioned to the widow as dower, not in the mode prescribed by statute, but by a conveyance or deed of settlement of the parties in-interest, and the buildings had not been kept in tenantable <em>repair. </em>\u2014 Held, on demurrer, by the whole court, afterwards affirmed by the supreme court of errors, that the statutory provisions compelling a tenant in dower to repair extend only to dower assigned in the manner the statute requires; that here was no dower, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>widow, whatever she had in the land in question, took by purchase without other limitations or conditions than such as were specially provided in the grant or settlement.

Eq. 30.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">Moreover, .a mortgage debt is a personal liability of the husband, and is a general charge on his estate, as has been held in a series of cases in this state. <em>Keen </em>v. <em>Munn, 1 C. E. Gr. 398; McLenahan </em>v. <em>McLenahan, 3 Id. 101; Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell, 3 Stew. Eq. 415.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">But the case shows that the husband did not leave any personal assets to satisfy either principal or interest on the mortgage, so that resort must be had, in the next place, to the heirs-at-law, who, subject to the widow\u2019s right of dower unassigned, succeeded to their father\u2019s legal title and estate, and in respect thereof became the debtors to the mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-9\">And- as these several items of annual expense \u2014 interest, insurance, repairs, taxes \u2014 are properly chargeable upon <em>thefruetus </em>of the estate, they would seem rightly to have been paid out of the rent of the houses let to tenants for the benefit of the entire property, and in relief of the part lawfully occupied by the respondent under the terms of the statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b273-11\">Soudder, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">The single question presented for our determination is whether the respondent, in stating her account of rents received, and expenditures for the three houses, shall be credited with the taxes, proportion of interest and repairs of the dwelling-house occupied by her since the death of her husband. As widow, she is entitled to dower in all of these lands, of which her husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>died seized, and the value of that dower right will be paid to her from the proceeds of the sale of the premises in these proceedings. But, as her dower was not assigned to her, it was, by the statute, lawful for her to remain in and to hold and enjoy the mansion-house of her husband, without being liable to pay any rent for the same, until such dower be assigned to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The derivation of this statute from the widow\u2019s quarantine, by the law of England, has been recognized in every construction and application that has been given to it and like statutes. It is important to notice this historic derivation of our law in determining the kind of interest which the widow has in the mansion-house of her husband before the assignment of her dower. As, at the death of the ancestor, the descent of land was east on his heir, it was needful that some immediate provision should be made for his widow\u2019s shelter and support before her dower was assigned. <em>Co. Litt. SB, </em>says: \u201cSome have said that by the ancient law of England the woman should continue a whole year in her husband\u2019s house, within which time, if dower were not assigned, she might recover it, and this was certainly the law of England before the Conquest. By the statute of Magna Charta (chapter 7) she shall tarry in the chief house of her husband but by the space of forty days after the death of her husband, within which time the dower shall be assigned unto her.\u201d See <em>Bac. Abr. tit. \u201cDower </em>\u201d <em>(b); Jac. Law Dic. \u201c Quarantine;\u201d 4. Kent Com. 61; 2 Scrib. on Dower 49; 1 Washb. on Real Prop. 186, 189, 271, 272.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">This provision of quarantine for the widow in her emergency was carefully distinguished from her right of dower before it was assigned to her, and when the assignment had been made her estate in dower related to the date of her husband\u2019s death, as a continuance of his estate in the lands. The widow\u2019s quarantine is called, in the books above cited, \u201ca privilege,\u201d \u201ca benefit,\u201d \u201ca right,\u201d but not a freehold estate in land. The interest given to her was temporary and fugitive in its purpose, and not designed for continuance beyond a brief time, and as a means of constraining the heir to assign her dower without unreasonable delay. But it is said that our statute, passed January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>31st, 1779, drawn by Mr. Paterson, a most active and thorough lawyer, manifests a different intention, and confers on the widow a higher title in the mansion-house of her husband than a mere quarantine right. This is shown, it is claimed, by the change of time from the exact term of forty days to the indefinite period \u201c until such dower be assigned to her,\u201d and by the addition of the words \u201cto hold and enjoy\u201d to the word <em>\u201cmaneat\u201d</em>(to remain in), found in the original charter or law. But as by the old law the widow was required to quit the possession of the chief house if her dower was not assigned in forty days, and there was a question whether she was entitled during quarantine to have her reasonable estovers and subsistence out of the estate, as appears in <em>Co. on Litt. 38, </em>it may well be said that the change in the statute was to make a more liberal and certain allowance for her comfort and support without altering the nature of her interest. In addition to the mere right of remaining in the mansion-house and messuage or plantation thereto belonging, she was also given, by our statute, the greater benefit of holding and enjoying the premises and the profits without payment of .rent to the heir and until her dower was assigned her. This was intended to be a more generous extension of her privilege of quarantine. It is also noticeable that in 1797, two years before the passage of our statute, the right of the heir to dispossess the widow by ejectment before dower was assigned had been discussed in <em>Den </em>v. <em>Dodd, 1 Hal. 367. </em>This statute, following so soon after this case, confirmed her possession in the homestead until the assignment of dower, and made that certain which before was considered doubtful. As this law gives the possession and profits of lands for an uncertain period, which may continue for the life of the widow, it is argued that it confers an estate for life; and if an estate for life is granted, then the widow, like other tenants of life estates, must pay taxes, keep down encumbrances, and make reasonable repairs until the term be ended. There are cases in our own courts which give countenance to this inference by expressions used descriptive of this act. <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Shelp, 3 Hal. 125; Budd </em>v. <em>Hiler, 3 Dutch. 43; Craige </em>v. <em>Morris, 10 C. E. Gr. 467. </em>It cannot be denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>that, as thus defined, the right of the widow under our statute has some of the incidents of a freehold estate for life; but it is equally certain that it has also some features of an estate at will, though it arises by operation of law, and not by lease, by contract or by the act of the parties, for it may be ended at any time by the release of her dower by the widow, or at the will of either party by application to the orphans court for the assignment of dower <em>(Rev. p. 383 </em>\u00a7 <em>17), </em>or by the act of the heir or devisee in making such assignment, or she may give up the possession voluntarily at any time and thereby end her quarantine, as in <em>Smallwood </em>v. <em>Bilderback, 1 Harr. 497</em>\u2014506.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">It is difficult and often misleading to attempt to define statutory rights by terms of the law applicable to other conditions and conformed to rules of the common law, and some confusion has been caused in thus attempting to construe this statute and like statutes in other states. It is better to make the statute its own interpreter, and to construe it according to the ordinary rules of construction. The vice-chancellor, in his opinion in this case, says that the right given to the widow under our statute is not a life estate, but may bo accurately described as a privilege in the nature of a tenaucy at will. In <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, 7 C. E. Gr. 505, 510, </em>the chief-justice says that \u201c it is but an amplification of the provision of Magna Charta, beneficially extending the term of the widow and expressly declaring that she shall hold the premises free of rent.\u201d Vice-Chancellor Dodd, in <em>Bleecker </em>v. <em>Hennion, 8 C. E. Gr. 123, 125, </em>says: \u201cThe widow\u2019s possession or quarantine is an incident only to her dower, belonging to that right and inseparable from it. It is a privilege preceding but in no wise preventing or impeding the assignment or disposal of dower.\u201d In neither case is an attempt made to define the act by any terms known in the law, but to construe and apply its words according to their evident intention to the facts in hand. \"Was it then the intention of the legislature, as expressed in this act, that the widow, during her possession, before the assignment of dower, should pay taxes, keep down encumbrances and make repairs of the house of her husband ? The statute puts no such burden upon her; it says she is not liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>to pay any rent; the old law gave her a quarantine without charge, and if her home be all that is left to her, to pay taxes, keep down encumbrances and make repairs during her uncertain term, might be a loss instead of a benefit to her and thwart the very purpose of the act. If her possession be continued for years, as in this case, and is profitable to her, such is not the design of the act, and it should be left to some arrangement with the heir or devisee, who has it in his power, at any time, to assign her dower, or to further legislation. In <em>Cronley v. Cronley, 13 Stew. Eq. 30, </em>the chancellor held that the possession of the widow, under this statute, did not devolve on her the duty of paying the interest upon a mortgage, and this judgment is now approved as a proper construction of the statute which does not burden her with the discharge of liens on the land while she has but a temporary possession awaiting the assignment of her dower. The ease of <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Houston, 13 Stew. Eq. 146, </em>is distinguishable, as continued possession was not held by the widow. <em>Holcombe </em>v. <em>Holcombe, 13 C. E. Gr. 473, S. C., 2 Stew. Eq. 597, </em>requiring the life tenant of a fund in the hands of executors to pay the annual taxes assessed thereon, is applicable to a tenant for life of land, and therefore to a tenant in dower, but \u2022 does not control the present case, where the dower has never been assigned. The different views that have been taken by courts of other states having like statutes, have been examined, and may be seen by reference to <em>Strawn </em>v. <em>Strawn, 50 Ill. 256; Wheeler </em>v. <em>Dawson, 63 Ill. 54; Burk </em>v. <em>Osborn, 9 B. Mon. 579; Shelton </em>v. <em>Carrol, 16 Ala. 148; Conger </em>v. <em>Atwood, 28 Ohio St. 137; Moore </em>v. <em>White, 61 Mo. 442; Branson </em>v. <em>Yancy, 1 Dev. Eq. 77; Simmes </em>v. <em>Lyle, 33 Gratt. 752. </em>The last-named case, decided in 1880, has a very able and instructive opinion of the court, reaching substantially the same conclusion which has been above expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The maxim <em>\u201cQui sentit commodum sentir\u00e9 debet et onus\u201d </em>which has been sometimes quoted in this connection, is not applicable to cases which are regulated by statute law, and has therefore no efficiency in the present case, where the widow\u2019s right is purely statutory and limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>What has been said has reference to taxes, mortgage interest and repairs, which are clearly liens and charges on the real estate; the water rates are part of the personal expenses of the occupant of the mansion-house and should be charged against her; but as the case does not show that any water rates are due or are made on account of this house occupied by the widow, separate from the others, the decree should not, for this cause,, be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The decree will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>Decree unanimously affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
