We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court incorrectly allow William to represent himself pro se after it had appointed William a guardian ad litem due to mental health concerns?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court improperly distribute Civil Service Retirement System </em>benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court improperly distribute appreciation on William\u2019s inherited property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">\u00b66 Celest and William married on January 26,1980. They have two adult children who are capable of self-support. William worked as a Revenue Agent for the U.S. Treasury until his disability and retirement on March 1, 2008. Celest holds an accounting degree and works as an accountant in Billings, Montana. Celest petitioned for dissolution of marriage on April 22, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">\u00b67 William initially retained attorney Connie Camino to represent him in the dissolution. Camino filed a petition to appoint a guardian ad litem on June 15, 2009. Camino had learned from William\u2019s psychologist, Dr. William Bredehoft, that William suffered from organic affective disorder. Bredehoft advised Camino that William had been seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Kelso, and had been taking psychiatric medication. Bredehoft opined that William could not represent himself competently in stressful situations such as being in a court setting. The District Court appointed William\u2019s sister, Colleen Kirven, as guardian ad litem on June 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u00b68 Camino served Celest with William\u2019s preliminary asset and liability disclosure and conducted initial discovery. Camino withdrew as counsel on February 8,2010. The record discloses only that Camino withdrew for good cause and without objection. Camino asked in her motion to withdraw that the court give William enough time to retain new counsel. Camino mailed the case file to Colleen on February 10, 2010. In her letter, Camino advised Colleen to seek an independent evaluation of the value of William\u2019s Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) disability pension and expressed her hope that William had retained new counsel. Camino copied William on the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b69 William chose not to retain another attorney. William filed an entry of appearance pro se on February 25, 2010. The record does not contain evidence of Colleen\u2019s involvement in William\u2019s choice to represent himself pro se. The court held a trial on the morning of May 28, 2010. Colleen accompanied William throughout the trial. William informed the court at the beginning of the trial that he would represent himself pro se and that Colleen\u2019s husband, a Wyoming attorney, would sit with him through the trial. Both William and Celest testified and offered exhibits during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b610 The marital estate consisted of approximately $1.5 million worth of assets. William\u2019s CSRS disability benefit comprised the largest asset of the marital estate with a present value of $860,201. William selected 100% survivor benefits payable to Celest when he retired. Celest testified that it was not feasible for William to pay one half of his disability to her. The court found that William could not meet his monthly expenses if Celest received one-half of his CSRS benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"AIo\">\u00b611 Legal Economic Evaluations had valued William\u2019s CSRS benefit for Celest. William\u2019s CSRS benefit represented both his pension and any payments that he would receive from Social Security. The court concluded that the pension amount of the CSRS benefit could not be divided from the Social Security amount. The court recognized that the pension amount, but not the Social Security amount, was subject to distribution. The court concluded that the fairest resolution required it to calculate both William\u2019s and Celest\u2019s retirement income streams and equally apportion the amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b612 The parties also contested the distribution of $253,744 that William had inherited from his mother\u2019s estate in 2003. William had invested these funds in Schwab and Scottrade accounts and had purchased personal property used by Celest and William. The District Court concluded that the inheritance funds should be set over to William and not be included in the distributable marital estate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>extent the funds could be traced to William\u2019s inheritance. An issue remained regarding entitlement to appreciation on the investment accounts. William claimed that the appreciation should be set aside separately to him. William did not provide evidence of appreciation. William did not provide an allocation of appreciation in the accounts that could be traced to the inheritance funds as opposed to appreciation in the accounts that could be traced to marital property that had been deposited into the accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b613 The court did not rule at the close of the trial, but decided to consider further the evidence of the disputed accounts. The court requested that the parties file post-trial amended proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, including the value of their accounts as of May 28,2010. The court issued a written order directing the parties to provide documentation to verify the value of their accounts as of May 28, 2010. The court\u2019s order required the parties to submit account balance verifications by July 2, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b614 The court issued a finding of fact that Celest had provided her account documentation on June 9,2010. Celest also filed her post-trial proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and final decree on July 6, 2010. William did not make a similar filing and did not provide the court with account balances information. William did submit other information after the deadline. The court rejected these submissions for untimeliness and because they constituted new evidence. The court divided equally the value of William\u2019s investment accounts in the absence of any account balance information from William.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b615 This Court will not set aside a district court's findings of fact regarding the division of marital property unless they are clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the opportunity of the court to judge the credibility of witnesses. <em>In re Marriage of Williams, </em>2009 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 352 Mont. 198, 217 P.3d 67. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Id. </em>Absent a clearly erroneous finding of fact, we affirm a district court\u2019s distribution of property unless the district court has abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court incorrectly allow William to represent himself pro se after it had appointed William a guardian ad litem due to mental health concerns?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b617 William argues that the court should not have allowed him to represent himself in the dissolution proceedings. William argues that the trial record demonstrates that he failed to represent himself competently. Celest responds that William failed to preserve the issue for appeal. Celest also contends that the District Court did not have a duty to appoint counsel for William in this dissolution proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"And\">\u00b618 William cites the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, the Canons of Judicial Ethics, and <em>In re Marriage of Rolfe, </em>216 Mont. 39, 699 P.2d 79 (1985), in support of his proposition that the court should appoint counsel or stand-by counsel whenever it appoints a guardian ad litem. No legal authority or argument supports applying the Canons of Judicial Ethics to the District Court\u2019s decision to allow William to represent himself. Moreover, this Court replaced the Canons of Judicial Ethics with the Code of Judicial Conduct in 2008. The Code of Judicial Conduct explains that it does not provide \u201cthe basis for litigants to seek to change a judge\u2019s decision\u201d or \u201cto obtain tactical advantages in proceedings before a court.\u201d 2008 Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b619  The District Court also did not violate M. R. Civ. P. 17(c) by allowing William to represent himself. M. R. Civ. P. 17(c) requires the appointment of a guardian ad litem for an incompetent person or \u201csuch other order as it deems proper for the protection\u201d of the incompetent person. The District Court appointed Colleen as William\u2019s guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u00b620 M. R. Civ. P. 17(c) does not require that an attorney be appointed in addition to a guardian ad litem. Nothing in the record indicates that Colleen sought to obtain counsel, but was unable to obtain counsel for any reason. In fact, Colleen\u2019s husband is an attorney licensed in Wyoming. Both Colleen and her husband accompanied William throughout the trial. They did not object or assert to the District Court that William\u2019s interests had not been protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b621  William did not request that an attorney be provided to him during pretrial or at trial. He did not indicate to the District Court that he could not proceed without court-appointed counsel. He did not indicate that he could not afford an attorney. William cites <em>In re Marriage of Rolfs, </em>but that case has no application here. The Court specifically limited that case\u2019s applicability to \u201ccourt-appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>representation of a child in a custody dispute arising out of a divorce.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Rolfs, </em>216 Mont, at 50, 699 P.2d at 85. The District Court did not incorrectly allow William to represent himself pro se after having appointed Colleen as his guardian ad litem. The District Court also did not fail to \u201cmake such other order\u201d as proper for William\u2019s protection. M. R. Civ. P. 17(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court improperly distribute Civil Service Retirement System benefits?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b623 Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, controls a district court\u2019s division of property in a marital dissolution. The court shall \u201cequitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title... is in the name of the husband or wife or both.\u201d Section 40-4-202(1), MCA. The district court must consider many factors in its apportionment, including the duration of the marriage; the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties; whether the apportionment is in lieu of or in addition to maintenance; and the opportunity of each party for future acquisition of capital assets and income. <em>In re Marriage of Williams, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b624 William argues that the court erroneously adopted the valuation of William\u2019s CSRS disability benefit because the valuation did not consider William\u2019s shortened life expectancy due to his mental illness. The court found William\u2019s CSRS benefit to have a present value of $860,201. The court based this finding on Celest\u2019s trial Exhibit 2, an evaluation of the CSRS benefit compiled by Legal Economic Evaluations. William had notice of the Legal Economic Evaluation since at least February 2010, when Connie Camino referenced the evaluation in her withdrawal letter to William and Colleen and advised them to seek a second evaluation. William apparently did not seek a second evaluation and did not object to the exhibit\u2019s admission at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b625 William raises the issue of his life expectancy for the first time on appeal. William cites <em>In re Marriage of Bowman, </em>226 Mont. 99, 734 P.2d 197 (1987), for the rule that a court must use sound, reliable life expectancy calculations in determining the present value of a pension benefit. William overlooks the fact that the parties in that case both presented evidence and disputed the calculations before the district court. <em>In re Marriage of Bowman, </em>226 Mont, at 109, 734 P.2d at 203. The Court reversed in <em>In re Marriage of Bowman </em>because the district court had made an arbitrary calculation of life expectancy that had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>foundation in the evidence presented. <em>Id., </em>734 P.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b626 William did not present evidence on the value of the CSRS benefit. William did not contest the accuracy of the valuation provided by Legal Economic Evaluations. William did not object to the normal life expectancy assumption underlying the valuation completed by Legal Economic Evaluations. William did not put on any evidence that he suffered a mental illness and that his mental illness lessened his life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b627  This Court generally will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>In re T. C., </em>2008 MT 335, \u00b6 20, 346 Mont. 200, 194 P.3d 653. We repeatedly have held that the complaining party must make a timely objection and state the specific grounds for objection in order to preserve an objection for purposes of appeal. <em>In re Bower, </em>2010 MT 19, \u00b6 20, 355 Mont. 108, 225 P.3d 784. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by not reducing the CSRS valuation for reduced life expectancy when the parties presented no evidence that William\u2019s mental illness reduced his life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b628 <em>Did the District Court improperly distribute appreciation on William\u2019s inherited property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b629 William and Celest agreed that the $253,744 that William had inherited from his mother\u2019s estate belonged solely to William. William had invested some of the inheritance in several investment accounts and had used some to purchase personal items, like vehicles and a trailer. Both parties submitted spreadsheets identifying the marital assets, including the investment accounts. The court granted to William the amount in each account that he claimed as traceable to the inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b630 The investment accounts also may have included amounts attributable to the marital estate and to appreciation. William argued that appreciation on the amounts traceable to inheritance belonged solely to him. William failed to present legal authority for this argument. William also failed to present accurate account balances. He claimed that market fluctuations prevented him from providing that information. The court ordered the parties to submit post-trial documentation that verified the balances of the accounts. William failed to provide this information and the court decided that the accounts, after subtracting the traceable inheritance amounts, would be divided equally between the parties without adjustments for traceable appreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u00b631 William argues that Celest contributed nothing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>appreciation of the inheritance funds. William and Celest agree that appreciation on the assets traceable to one spouse\u2019s inheritance may be allocated solely to the inheriting spouse. <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>2002 MT 309, 313 Mont. 74, 60 P.3d 441; <em>In re Marriage of Grendy, </em>2004 MT 36, 320 Mont. 38, 85 P.3d 788. Celest responds, however, that William failed to preserve the issue for appeal, that William waived this argument by not complying with the court\u2019s order to provide updated account balances, and that the accounts likely accrued no appreciable value, as most all investment accounts of this type suffered large losses between the time of inheritance in 2003 and the time of trial in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b632 We conclude that William preserved this argument for appeal by arguing to the District Court that appreciation on the accounts should be attributed solely to him. The court\u2019s findings of fact reflect that William presented the court with this argument. Even though William preserved the legal argument for appeal, however, William failed to submit substantial, credible evidence that appreciation on the accounts actually existed. William\u2019s refusal or neglect to provide the court with evidence of the account balances left the court without evidence of appreciation in the accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b633  William could have attempted to prove that appreciation existed, either at the time of trial or pursuant to the court\u2019s order to supplement the record with verification of the account balances. By refusing or failing to provide the court with this evidence, William failed to prove that any appreciation actually existed. The court divided the investment accounts by first setting aside to William the asserted inheritance amounts that had been allegedly deposited into those accounts. The court then equally divided the remainder of the accounts\u2019 balances. The equitable resolution crafted by the court protected Celest\u2019s one-half interest in any amounts of marital property that had been deposited into the investment accounts. We conclude that the court did not distribute incorrectly the investment accounts when it equally distributed them after setting aside the asserted inheritance amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
