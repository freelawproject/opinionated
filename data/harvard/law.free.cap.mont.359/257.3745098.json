Norquay, Jr. (Norquay) guilty of deliberate homicide, \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA, and tampering with physical evidence, \u00a7 45-7-207(l)(a), MCA. Norquay appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">\u00b63 1. <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s admission of the State\u2019s expert DNA witness through a videotaped deposition violated Norquay\u2019s right to confront the witness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">\u00b64 2. <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s Alien-instruction given to a deadlocked jury constituted an improperly coercive instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">\u00b65 3. <em>Whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments at trial constituted prosecutorial misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">\u00b66 Nathan Oats (Oats) and Georgetta Oats (Georgetta) found Lloyd Kvelstad (Kvelstad) unconscious and severely beaten at about 1:30 a.m. on November 25,2006. Oats testified that he found Kvelstad lying on a couch with his pants down around his legs at Melissa Snow\u2019s (Snow) house. Kvelstad\u2019s face was beaten beyond recognition and he had a black string around his neck. Oats told Georgetta to call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">\u00b67 Kvelstad, Norquay, James Main Jr. (Main), Billy the Boy (Billy), Jason Skidmore (Skidmore), Joseph Red Elk (Red Elk), and Thomas Anderson (Anderson) had gathered at Snow\u2019s house to drink alcohol earlier that night. Norquay, Main, Snow, and Billy were still at the house when Oats arrived and found Kvelstad. Georgetta announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>that the police were coming and Main attempted to leave. Oats restrained Main and held him until the police arrived. Norquay fled out a side door. Paramedics determined that Kvelstad was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b68 The State charged Norquay with deliberate homicide on the theory that Norquay had participated in the commission of an aggravated assault of Kvelstad. The State also charged Norquay with tampering with physical evidence based upon a witness\u2019s statement that Norquay had wiped blood off his shoe. Norquay had an eight-day jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b69 Red Elk testified to the events leading up to Kvelstad\u2019s death. Red Elk testified that several of the men had verbally and physically assaulted Kvelstad. Red Elk watched Main and Skidmore put Kvelstad into several choke holds that caused Kvelstad to lose consciousness. Skidmore pulled up Kvelstad\u2019s underwear until they ripped off. Red Elk testified that Norquay slapped Kvelstad\u2019s face and would not allow Kvelstad to sit down. He also testified that Norquay took his belt off, unbuttoned, and unzipped his pants, attempted to pull down Kvelstad\u2019s pants, and announced that he was going to \u201cfuck\u201d Kvelstad. Another of the revelers forced Norquay to stop. Red Elk also testified that he had heard Norquay talking with Main about whether the two of them should kill Kvelstad.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b610 Kvelstad eventually passed out from intoxication. Red Elk watched Snow and Skidmore put Kvelstad in a bed. Red Elk left Snow\u2019s house with Skidmore shortly thereafter. Red Elk testified that Kvelstad was still breathing and was not bloody when he last saw him. Snow testified to a similar version of the night\u2019s events. She also testified that she saw Norquay remove the string from his sweatshirt. Another witness testified that Norquay told her that he had strangled Kvelstad using a string from his sweatshirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b611 Several other witnesses testified that Norquay had made incriminating statements after Kvelstad\u2019s death. One witness testified that she overheard Norquay brag to someone on the phone, \u201cDid you hear I\u2019m a murderer?\u201d Norquay voluntarily met with police. Norquay denied kicking, beating, or strangling Kvelstad. Norquay claimed that Kvelstad had passed out from drinking too much. The Deputy State Medical Examiner testified that Kvelstad had likely died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head and probable ligature strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"Aai\">\u00b612 One of the State\u2019s experts testified that the tread on Norquay\u2019s shoes corresponded with a bloody shoe impression left on Kvelstad\u2019s sweatshirt. Norquay\u2019s expert refuted this testimony. The State also provided testimony from a DNA expert with the Montana Crime Lab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>through a videotaped deposition. Norquay originally requested the DNA evidence from the State Crime Lab. The DNA expert provided both potentially exculpatory and potentially inculpatory testimony. Both parties relied on portions of the DNA expert\u2019s testimony to their advantage. The jury convicted Norquay on all counts. Norquay appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b613 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>In re T.J.B., </em>2010 MT 116, \u00b6 14, 356 Mont. 342, 233 P.3d 341. Norquay argues that the Court\u2019s decision to allow the State\u2019s videotaped deposition violated his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. A district court has no discretion in the correct interpretation of the Constitution. <em>State v. Parker, </em>2006 MT 258, \u00b6 11, 334 Mont. 129, 144 P.3d 831. This Court reviews de novo a court\u2019s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment. <em>In re T.J.B., </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b614 We review jury instructions to determine whether, as a whole, they fully and fairly provide instruction on the applicable law. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16. A district court\u2019s discretion in formulating instructions is reversible only if the instructions prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>The Court conducts plenary review of discretionary rulings when the court bases the discretionary ruling upon an interpretation of the Constitution. <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 26, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b615 1. <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s admission of the State\u2019s expert DNA witness through a videotaped deposition violated Norquay\u2019s right to confront the witness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b616 Officers arrested Norquay in July 2007 and the court originally scheduled Norquay\u2019s trial for May 2008. The court granted several continuances to accommodate witness availability and attempted to set the trial date for January 5, 2009, more than two years after Kvelstad\u2019s death. The parties agreed to reschedule again to accommodate the DNA expert, Megan Ashton (Ashton), who was expecting a baby in mid-December 2008 and would be on maternity leave in January 2009. The court moved up the trial date to November 12, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u00b617 Ashton informed defense counsel in October 2008, that her doctor had prohibited her from traveling from her home in Missoula to Havre for the November trial. Norquay filed another motion to continue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>trial until January 2009. The State unsuccessfully attempted to replace Ashton with another DNA expert. The State opposed the motion to continue. The State moved instead for an order to use a videotaped deposition of Ashton at trial in place of her live testimony. Norquay opposed the videotaped deposition. The court granted the State\u2019s motion to depose Ashton and denied Norquay\u2019s motion to continue the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b618 The court provided several reasons for its decision to allow the videotaped deposition. The court recognized the difficulty in trying to accommodate the schedule of approximately 50 other witnesses. The court cited the fact that two years had elapsed since the victim\u2019s death and the effect that this delay could have on witnesses\u2019 memories. The court further reasoned that Ashton was not a witness with personal knowledge of the facts giving rise to the events. Finally, the court discussed its need to accommodate schedules for the two judicial districts over which it presided. The court concluded that another continuance likely would postpone the trial significantly. The videotaped deposition took place six days before trial. Counsel for both parties were present. Norquay cross-examined Ashton.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b619 Norquay argues that the court\u2019s admission of Ashton\u2019s videotaped testimony violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. He contends that the State failed to establish that Ashton was unavailable because the State had not made a good faith effort to present the witness at trial. The court deemed Ashton unavailable and concluded that Norquay\u2019s confrontation rights could be protected adequately through a videotaped deposition with all parties present.</p>\n<p id=\"ATS\">\u00b620  Both the federal and Montana constitutions provide defendants with the right to confront witnesses against them. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. The ability to cross-examine a witness represents the cornerstone of a defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him. <em>In re </em>\u00b6 18. The Confrontation Clause also normally requires that a witness testify in court. <em>State v. Hart, </em>2009 MT 268, \u00b6 23, 352 Mont. 92, 214 P.3d 1273. The court may allow recorded witness testimony at trial under limited circumstances. The court first must deem the witness unavailable for trial. <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Crawford v. Wash., </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1374 (2004)); \u00a7\u00a7 46-15-201, -204, MCA; M. R. Evid. 804. The court also must determine that the defendant has had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness in some forum. <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b621 The State satisfied the second element here. Norquay cross-examined Ashton at her deposition. Norquay challenges only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>court\u2019s determination that Ashton was unavailable for trial. A court may deem a witness unavailable if a physical illness renders the witness unable to testify. M. R. Evid. 804(a)(4). The proponent of the testimony of an unavailable witness in a criminal case bears the burden of demonstrating that it made a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to secure the witness\u2019s attendance at trial. <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>Barber v. Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 724-25, 88 S. Ct. 1318, 1322 (1968)). The court applies a reasonableness standard to the question of whether the State made a good faith effort to procure a witness, based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b622 This Court has not yet decided an unavailability case involving a pregnant witness for Confrontation Clause purposes. We have considered whether the State made a good faith effort to procure a witness in a criminal trial for Confrontation Clause purposes under other circumstances. <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-26; <em>State v. Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. 341, 351-54,950 P.2d 1383, 1389-90 (1997). We concluded <em>in Hart </em>that the court properly had admitted videotaped testimony of a material witness who had fled Montana, had eluded police officers, and had refused to testify. <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6 26. The State deposed the witness five days before trial and counsel for the defendant had cross-examined the reluctant witness. <em>Id. </em>The State had not made a good faith effort to procure the witness in <em>Widenhofer, </em>however, when the State had subpoenaed the witness only the night before trial and the witness had not appeared at trial. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont, at 352-53, 950 P.2d at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b623 We have also considered whether good cause justified delaying a trial for a pregnant witness in <em>City of Helena v. Roan, </em>2010 MT 29,355 Mont. 172, 226 P.3d 601. The City of Helena cited Roan for reckless driving after witnesses reported that they had watched Roan spin \u201cbrodies\u201d in a parking lot. <em>Roan, </em>\u00b6 2. The court allowed the City to continue the trial based on testimony that two key witnesses, Nick Norton (Norton) and Megan Miller (Miller), would not be available to testify due to Miller\u2019s pregnancy. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. Miller never testified at trial, but her fianc\u00e9, Norton, testified. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11. Roan argued that the City had not demonstrated good cause to justify the delay. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that Miller\u2019s pregnancy, which required a cesarean, and her necessary recovery time, demonstrated good cause for delaying the trial. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b624 Other jurisdictions have addressed the unavailability of the witness question in the context of a late-term pregnancy. Courts have considered factors in determining witness unavailability such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>nature of the illness, the expected time of recovery, the reliability of the evidence concerning the illness, the importance of the absent witness to the case, and other special circumstances. <em>United States v. McGuire, </em>307 F.3d 1192, 1205 (9th Cir. 2002); <em>Ecker v. Scott, </em>69 F.3d 69, 72 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>U.S. v. Faison, </em>679 F.2d 292, 297 (3rd Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"Amu\">\u00b625 The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals deemed a witness in her seventh month of pregnancy unavailable to testify at a criminal trial. <em>McGuire, </em>307 F.3d at 1205. The court recognized that it had been proper for a district court to rely on a physician\u2019s statement when assessing the availability of a pregnant witness. <em>Id. </em>The court also noted that the trial involved a large number of witnesses and defense attorneys, and a judge from another judicial district sitting by designation. <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the court properly had decided not to delay the trial when it would have been forced to accommodate so many competing schedules. <em>Id. </em>Although <em>McGuire </em>involved a challenge to the testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 804, not the Sixth Amendment, the same factors apply. <em>Ecker, </em>69 F.3d at 72 n. 3. A challenge under the Confrontation Clause may require a stronger showing of unavailability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b626 The facts <em>of </em>this case present circumstances more similar to <em>McGuire, Hart, </em>and <em>Roan, </em>than <em>Widenhofer. </em>Pregnancy involves a medical condition that poses special risks to a woman and her unborn child. The court properly relied upon the statements of Ashton\u2019s physician that she could not travel from Missoula to Havre to testify at the November trial. Although Ashton\u2019s doctors set her due date for mid-December, the court could not predict exactly when the baby would arrive or when Ashton would be ready to travel for trial after the birth. The court already had rescheduled once to accommodate Ashton\u2019s pregnancy and previously had rescheduled to accommodate other witnesses\u2019 schedules. The State unsuccessfully had attempted to replace Ashton with another DNA expert. None were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b627 This complex trial involved approximately 50 other witnesses whose schedules the court would have been required to accommodate. Efforts by the court to reschedule likely would have substantially delayed the trial. Ashton\u2019s videotaped deposition took place six days before trial with Norquay present. Nor quay\u2019s counsel cross-examined Ashton. The jury had the opportunity to view the demeanor of the witness and evaluate her credibility. Ashton\u2019s testimony did not address a portion of the State\u2019s case that Norquay contested. In fact, Norquay had insisted that Ashton would provide exculpatory evidence necessary for his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b628  Looking to all the facts and circumstances we conclude that the State made a good faith effort to procure Ashton for trial and that the district court properly allowed the videotaped testimony. Unlike <em>Widenhofer, </em>the State had worked to schedule a trial that would accommodate all the witnesses and attempted to replace Ashton with another DNA expert. The court properly relied upon the statement of Ashton\u2019s physician in determining that she was unavailable to testify for trial. The court took the proper procedural steps in the form of a videotaped deposition taken several days before trial to protect Norquay\u2019s confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b629 2. <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s Alien-instruction given to a deadlocked jury constituted an improperly coercive instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b630 The jury deliberated for approximately seven hours on the first day of deliberations. The judge sent the jury a note at the end of the day asking whether they had made any progress. The foreman responded, \u201cNo deadlock.\u201d The foreman sent the court a note during the next morning\u2019s deliberation to inform the court that the jury was in a stalemate. The court convened the parties and informed them that it intended to read Montana Pattern Jury Instruction Criminal No. 1-121 (MPJIC 1-121) for potentially deadlocked juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b631 Norquay\u2019s counsel objected to the instruction on the grounds that it violated his due process rights and unlawfully coerced the jury to render a verdict. The court overruled the objection and read the instruction to the jury. The jury reached a verdict about an hour and a half after receiving the instruction. Norquay appeals the following language in the District Court\u2019s jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">The ultimate responsibility of the jury is to render a verdict in this case ... The final test of the quality of your service will be in the verdict which you return to this Court. It is only bv rendering a verdict in this cause that you can make a definite contribution to efficient judicial administration as you arrive at a just and possible verdict. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Mont. Pattern Jury Instr. Crim. 1.121 (2009). Norquay argues that the court improperly instructed the jury to consider matters irrelevant to their deliberations, specifically the \u201cquality\u201d of their service, making a \u201cdefinite contribution to the administration of justice,\u201d and passing the \u201cfinal test\u201d of rendering a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b632  The U.S. Constitution and the Montana Constitution entitle defendants to an uncoerced verdict. <em>U.S. v. Lowenfield, </em>484 U.S. 231, 241, 108 S. Ct. 546, 552 (1988); <em>State v. Randall, </em>137 Mont. 534, 540-42, 353 P.2d 1054, 1057-58 (1960). A coercive instruction in Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>directs the minority jurors to reconsider their views in light of the majority. <em>Randall, </em>137 Mont, at 542, 353 P.2d at 1058. The court cannot instruct the jurors that they have to reach a decision or pressure the jurors into returning a unanimous verdict. <em>Jenkins v. U. S., </em>380 U.S. 445, 445-46, 85 S. Ct. 1059, 1060 (1965); <em>State v. Steele, </em>2004 MT 275, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 323 Mont. 204, 99 P.3d 210. Simply put, the court cannot place undue pressure upon the jury to reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AjX\">\u00b633 An AZZen,-instruction is a supplemental jury instruction given when jurors are apparently deadlocked. More than a century ago, the U.S. Supreme Court first upheld an AZZere-instruction given to a deadlocked jury that instructed the jurors in the minority to reconsider their views in light of the contrary views held by the majority. <em>U.S. v. Allen, </em>164 U.S. 492, 17 S. Ct. 154 (1896). The name \u201cAZZera-instruction\u201d or \u201cAZZen-charge\u201d derives from this case. The Montana Supreme Court first considered anAZZera-instruction in <em>Randall </em>and concluded that an instruction that asked the minority jurors to reconsider their views in light of the contrary majority views constituted an objectionably coercive instruction. <em>Randall, </em>137 Mont, at 540-42, 353 P.2d at 1057-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b634 The Court in <em>Randall </em>purposefully took \u201cthe opposite view\u201d of the U.S. Supreme Court when it did not allow the AZZen-instruction that singled out the minority jurors and asked them to reconsider their views. <em>Randall, </em>137 Mont, at 542, 353 P.2d at 1058. The Court concluded that the inevitable effect of such an instruction would be to suggest to the minority jurors that they ought to surrender their own convictions and follow the majority. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that \u201c[a] vibrant, pulsating, intelligent minority is a part of our American way of life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court ultimately concluded that the language that coerced the minority to reconsider their views in light of the majority constituted the only objectionable language in the jury instruction. <em>Randall, </em>137 Mont, at 543, 353 P.2d at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b635 The Court allowed Allen-instructions in Montana after <em>Randall </em>that did not instruct the minority jurors to surrender their opinions in light of the majority views. <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 70, 339 Mont. 309, 170 P.3d 444; <em>State v. Cline, </em>170 Mont. 520, 540, 555 P.2d 724, 736 (1976). MPJIC 1-121 now constitutes Montana\u2019s pattern AZZe/z-instruction that developed after the Court in <em>Randall </em>had rejected an earlier version. The language that Norquay challenges derives from this instruction. MPJIC 1-121 no longer contains language that instructs the minority jurors to reconsider their views in light of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u00b636 This Court has approved the language in MPJIC 1-121 on several occasions. <em>Bieber, </em>\u00b6 70; <em>Cline, </em>170 Mont, at 540, 555 P.2d at 736. We have not specifically discussed, however, the provision that Norquay challenges. The defendant in <em>Cline </em>challenged the same jury instruction that Norquay challenges and similarly argued that the instruction led the jury to believe that it should take into account irrelevant matters such as the judicial process, the selection of jurors, and the whole system rather than the facts of the case. <em>Cline, </em>170 Mont, at 539,555 P.2d at 736. The Court concluded, however, that the instruction did not single out the minority, and that the court did not pressure the jurors into reaching a verdict. <em>Cline, </em>170 Mont, at 540, 555 P.2d at 736. We therefore concluded that the AZZera-instruction in <em>Cline </em>did not constitute an objectionably coercive instruction. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that \u201cunless we are to outlaw any instruction to the jury during the course of its deliberations ... it is difficult to draw a more innocuous instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court upheld the same jury instruction again in <em>Bieber </em>based on the reasoning in <em>Cline. Bieber, </em>\u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b637 The AZZera-instruction given at Norquay\u2019s trial did not contain language that instructed the minority jurors to reconsider their views. The instruction was nearly identical to the instruction given in <em>Cline </em>and <em>Bieber. </em>The instruction thereby comported with the applicable law in Montana. <em>Bieber, </em>\u00b6 70; <em>Cline, </em>170 Mont, at 540, 555 P.2d at 736; <em>Randall, </em>137 Mont, at 542, 353 P.2d at 1058. The jury had ample time to deliberate and nothing in the facts indicate that patently coercive circumstances existed. The court did not put undue pressure on jurors to reach a unanimous verdict. The instruction stated that the jurors \u201cshould not surrender [their] honest convictions ... for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.\u201d The instruction that Norquay challenges does not constitute an objectionably coercive instruction. <em>Id. </em>The court properly instructed the jury on the law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b638 We are persuaded, however, to reconsider the \u201cfinal test\u201d language in MPJIC 1-121 that Norquay challenges. Although we find the instruction unobjectionable in Norquay\u2019s case, we disagree with the conclusion in <em>Cline </em>that MPJIC 1-121 is an \u201cinnocuous instruction.\u201d We take this opportunity to carefully evaluate the wisdom of the continued use of the \u201cfinal test\u201d language in MPJIC 1-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b639 Other courts, commentators, and the American Bar Association have scrutinized the continued use of Allen-instructions. <em>See U.S. v Brown, </em>411 F.2d 930, 932-34 (7th Cir. 1969); <em>U.S. v. Fioravanti, </em>412 F.2d 407, 414-20 (3rd Cir. 1969); <em>Thaggard v. U.S., </em>354 F.2d 735, 739-41 (5th Cir. 1965) (Coleman, J., concurring); <em>U. S. v. Seawell, </em>550 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>1159, 1162 n. 4 (9th Cir. 1977) (listing state courts that have banned or restricted the use of AZZere-instructions); see <em>also, Note, Due Process, Judicial Economy, and the Hung Jury: A Reexamination of the Allen Charge, </em>53 Va. L. Rev. 123 (1967); Paul Marcus, <em>The Allen Instruction in Criminal Cases: Is the Dynamite Charge about to Be Permanently Defused?, </em>43 Mo. L. Rev. 613 (1978); <em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Discovery and Trial by Jury, </em>Standard 15-5.4,255 (3d ed., ABA 1996). We recognize that courts have expressed wariness of <em>Allen-</em>instructions and that a growing trend exists to eliminate, in particular, the \u201cfinal test\u201d language in Allen-instructions. <em>Jones v. </em>U.S., 946 A.2d 970, 973-74 (D.C. 2008); <em>Thompson v. </em>Md., 371 Md. 473, 486, 810 A.2d 435, 443 (Md. 2002); <em>Idaho v. Flint, </em>114 Idaho 806, 812, 761 P.2d 1158; 1164 (Idaho 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b640 The Maryland Supreme Court has struck language in an <em>Allen-</em>instruction that suggests that the jury\u2019s \u201cfinal test\u201d requires them to make a determination of guilt or innocence, rather than to stay true to any individual convictions or opinions. <em>Thompson, </em>371 Md. at 486,810 A.2d at 443. Other courts have considered this same language in an AZZera-instruction and similarly deemed it to be coercive. <em>Flint, </em>114 Idaho at 812, 761 P.2d at 1164; <em>Jones, </em>946 A.2d at 973-74. Both the Idaho Supreme Court and the Arizona Supreme Court have strongly disapproved of the use of AZZen.-instructions altogether reasoning that they are inherently coercive. <em>Flint, </em>114 Idaho at 812, 761 P.2d at 1165; <em>Ariz. v. Smith, </em>108 Ariz. 121, 124, 493 P.2d 904, 907 (Ariz. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b641 The Maryland Supreme Court also noted that the final test language did not reasonably adhere to ABA standards. <em>See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Discovery and Trial by Jury, </em>at 255. The court concluded that the concept of a final test implies a standard of service to which a juror should aspire \u201cthat requires a verdict to be reached rather than one that requires consideration of individual conviction.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>371 Md. at 486, 810 A.2d at 443. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals applauded the Maryland Supreme Court for its unanimous decision in <em>Thompson. Jones, </em>946 A.2d at 974. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals recognized problematic language at issue in its <em>Allen </em>-instruction that failed to include any language \u201cthat reminded the jurors not to surrender their honestly held convictions, even if that prevented agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court recognized that the instruction seemed \u201cone-sided\u201d in favor of reaching an agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b642 The jury\u2019s ultimate responsibility is not to render a unanimous verdict of either guilt or innocence, but to consider carefully the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>presented at trial. Our jury system aspires to produce fair and accurate factual determinations in each case. Although the court here did not exert undue pressure on the jury to render a verdict when it gave MPJIC 1-121, no reason exists to continue to use the \u201cfinal test\u201d language in Montana\u2019s pattern criminal jury instructions. An <em>Alien-instruction </em>given in Montana courts should closely comport with ABA Standard 15-5.4 and eliminate the \u201cfinal test\u201d language. <em>See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Discovery and Trial by </em>Jury, at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"AvO\">\u00b643 We therefore adopt the following changes to MPJIC 1-121 to be used in future cases in which the court determines an Allen-instruction to be necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">The judicial process assigns tasks to the people involved in the case, the various units. It is the task of the witnesses to testify truthfully to the facts as they recall them, as-tfaeyrecall the facts. It is the task of the lawyers to prepare the case for final submission to the trier of the facts, the jury. It is the task of the Judge to preside, to instruct you as to the law, and to rule on the adnussibility-ofithe whether certain evidence will be allowed at trial. It is the task of the jury to decide the case. The ultimate responsibility of the-jury is to-render a verdict- in this cause. You are not partehsan-nor are you-advocates in this matter; you are the neutral iudgesrvou-are the-tndges of the facts. It is you and you alone that can render a verdict in decide this cause. There is no reason to believe that any other 12 men and women people would possess any more ability, intelligence, and courage to do the ultimate task assigned to a jury under the American system of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">The-final test-of the quality of your service wHhbe in the verdict which-you return to this-Gourtr Rris-only by rendering a verdict in this cause that-you can make a definite contribution to efficient judicial administration as youarrive at a-justeand-possible verdict. The purpose of this instruction is to encourage you to collaborate with vour fellow jurors in order to reach a iust and fair verdict in this case. This instruction is not meant to coerce or to force a verdict. You should take as much time as needed in vour deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">We-have never-asked, as a matter-of-fact we-faave-instructed- you, that You should not surrender your honest convictions in this matter for the mere purpose of returning a verdict or solely because of the opinion of other jurors. This does not mean, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>however, that you should avoid the vour task assigned-to-you-of rendering a verdict in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">This instruction is not more important than any other instruction I have previously given you. You should consider this instruction together with, and as part of. all the other instructions. Please return to vour jury room and, again, diligently and earnestly resume vour deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b644 3. <em>Whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments at trial constituted prosecutorial misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b645 Norquay next argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct that deprived Norquay of his right to a fair and impartial trial. The parties dispute the State\u2019s characterization of Red Elk\u2019s testimony. Red Elk testified that Norquay had his own pants down, and that Norquay had claimed that \u201che was going to fuck [Kvelstad] right there.\u201d The State used the word \u201crape\u201d instead of \u201cfuck\u201d several times at trial. Norquay argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Norquay had threatened to \u201crape\u201d the victim inflamed the jury. Norquay contends that Red Elk testified that Norquay had been joking, and that Norquay had not threatened Kvelstad. Norquay also argues that the State had misstated the elements of homicide at trial and wrongly attacked the defense\u2019s cross-examination tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b646  Norquay makes these arguments for the first time on appeal. We generally do not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 MT 94, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.2d 79. The Court may review claims not raised in the district court under the plain error doctrine. <em>Id. </em>We engage in plain error to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice, to prevent fundamental unfairness, and to uphold the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Id. </em>A prosecutor may comment on the gravity of the crime charged, the volume of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses, and the legal principles involved in the case. <em>State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 33, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798. Our review of the record does not establish that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct that violated Norquay\u2019s substantial rights. We decline to apply plain error review. We likewise determine that Norquay\u2019s counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b647 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
