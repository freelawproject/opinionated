We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u00b62 Great Bear Adventures (the Park), is located near West Glacier, Montana. Visitors to the Park enjoy a drive-thru experience of bears in their natural habitat, surrounded by multiple layers of electrified fence. Kilpatrick owns the Park and lives on adjacent property. Hopkins began working there in 2002, doing various tasks, including maintenance and feeding the bears. In the past, some workers have been known to smoke marijuana on the premises. Although Kilpatrick professed to not condone marijuana use by workers, testimony established that he had smoked marijuana at the Park in the past, and on occasion had done so with Hopkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b63 On November 2, 2007, Hopkins traveled to work at the Park at Kilpatrick\u2019s request. On the way, Hopkins smoked marijuana. Kilpatrick instructed Hopkins to raise the boards on the Park\u2019s front gates so they would not freeze to the ground. Before proceeding, Hopkins asked Kilpatrick if he should feed the bears as well. Testimony regarding Kilpatrick\u2019s answer conflicted. However, the WCC ultimately found that Kilpatrick never told Hopkins not to feed the bears.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b64 After completing work on the gates, Hopkins returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Kilpatrick\u2019s house. Kilpatrick was asleep inside. Hopkins mixed food for the bears and used Kilpatrick\u2019s truck to drive into the Park. He entered the bears\u2019 pen and began to place food out. Once inside, nothing separated him from the bears. At some point while Hopkins was working, the largest bear, Red, attacked him. The bear knocked Hopkins to the ground, sat on him, and bit his leg, knee and rear-end. While this was occurring, another bear, Brodie, came up from behind, and bit Red. In response, Red moved off of Hopkins momentarily, and Hopkins escaped by crawling under one of the electrified wires surrounding the pen. Kilpatrick eventually found Hopkins, and he was transported to the hospital by helicopter. He suffered severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"AW-\">\u00b65 Kilpatrick did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Hopkins petitioned the WCC for workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund. Both the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund and Kilpatrick opposed Hopkins\u2019 petition. The WCC found for Hopkins, concluding that (1) Hopkins was employed by Kilpatrick at the time of Hopkins\u2019 injuries, (2) Hopkins was in the course and scope of his employment at the time of his injuries, (3) marijuana use was not the major contributing cause of Hopkins\u2019 injuries, and (4) Hopkins was not performing services in return for aid or sustenance only. Kilpatrick appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b66 Kilpatrick raises four issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">1. Whether Hopkins was employed by Kilpatrick at the time of Hopkins\u2019 injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">2. Whether Hopkins was in the course and scope of his employment at the time of his injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">3. Whether marijuana use was the major contributing cause of Hopkins\u2019 injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">4. Whether Hopkins was performing service for Kilpatrick in return for aid or sustenance only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u00b67 We review a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decision to determine whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial credible evidence, and whether the conclusions of law are correct. <em>Tinker v. Montana State Fund, </em>2009 MT 218, \u00b6 25, 351 Mont. 305, 211 P.3d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">\u00b68 <em>Whether Hopkins was employed by </em>Kilpatrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u00b69  The WCC correctly concluded that Kilpatrick, \u201cunquestionably controlled the details of Hopkins\u2019 work at the bear park.\u201d Sections 39-71-117(l)(a), and -118(l)(a), MCA. Hopkins had worked at the Park since 2002, received regular payments from Kilpatrick, and engaged in tasks at Kilpatrick\u2019s command. Furthermore, Kilpatrick\u2019s assertion that Hopkins was a volunteer is without support. Section 39-71-118(2), MCA. As the WCC succinctly stated, \u201c[t]here is a term of art used to describe the regular exchange of money for favors-it is called \u2018employment.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b610 <em>Whether Hopkins was in the course and scope of his employment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A08\">\u00b611 Factors considered in a \u201ccourse and scope\u201d analysis include (1) whether the activity was undertaken at the employer\u2019s request, (2) whether the employer, directly or indirectly, compelled the employee\u2019s attendance at the activity, (3) whether the employer controlled or participated in the activity, and (4) whether the employer and the employee mutually benefited from the activity. <em>Michalak v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2008 MT 3, \u00b6 13, 341 Mont. 63, 175 P.3d 893. The presence or absence of any given factor is not dispositive, as the determination is dependent on a totality of the circumstances. <em>Michalak, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b612  On November 2, 2007, Kilpatrick compelled Hopkins to work at the Park. Even though there was conflicting testimony as to whether Kilpatrick agreed that Hopkins should feed the bears on that day, an employee\u2019s injuries are compensable unless the employee is not \u201cattending to employment-related matters\u201d and has abandoned the course and scope of his employment. <em>Dale v. Trade Street, Inc., </em>258 Mont. 349, 355, 854 P.2d 828, 832 (1993). Feeding the bears was one of Hopkins\u2019 regular employment duties. Hopkins testified he was engaged in the \u201csame routine\u201d he had done for two or three years and would not have fed the bears had Kilpatrick expressly so instructed him. Feeding the bears was not a personal activity \u201csevered\u201d from the continuity of Hopkins\u2019 employment-related duties at the Park. Additionally, the WCC found that \u201cKilpatrick benefitted from the care and feeding of the bears that Hopkins provided since presumably customers are unwilling to pay cash to see dead and emaciated bears.\u201d The WCC did not err when it concluded that Hopkins was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b613 <em>Whether marijuana was the major contributing cause of Hopkins\u2019 injuries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b614  Non-prescription drug consumption will preclude an injured employee\u2019s benefits if consumption was the leading cause contributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>to the result, when compared to all others. Section 39-71-407(4), and -407(13), MCA. No evidence was presented regarding Hopkins\u2019 level of impairment. The WCC aptly noted, \u201cHopkins\u2019 use of marijuana to kick off a day of working around grizzly bears was ill-advised to say the least and mind-bogglingly stupid to say the most.\u201d However, the WCC further noted that grizzlies are \u201cequal opportunity maulers,\u201d without regard to marijuana consumption. Without evidence of Hopkins\u2019 level of impairment, the WCC correctly concluded that marijuana was not the major contributing cause of Hopkins\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b615 <em>Whether Hopkins\u2019 services were in exchange for aid or sustenance only.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b616  Subject to exceptions that are inapplicable here, employment of a person performing services in exchange for aid or sustenance only is not covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 39-71-401(2)(h), MCA. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act defines aid or sustenance as a \u201csubsidy made to provide a means of support, maintenance, or subsistence for the recipient.\u201d Section 39-71-116(3), MCA. Kilpatrick testified that he gave money to Hopkins, not as wages, but rather \u201cout of his heart.\u201d The WCC found this testimony to be without credibility, and the trier of fact is in the best position to weigh the respective credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 419, \u00b6 14, 347 Mont. 354, 198 P.3d 809. The WCC did not err when it concluded that Hopkins\u2019 services were not in exchange for aid or sustenance only.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b617 For the reasons stated above, we hold that the WCC\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial credible evidence, and the conclusions of law are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
