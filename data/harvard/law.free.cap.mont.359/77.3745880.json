Howard also appeals the WCC\u2019s determination that Weidow\u2019s employment did not constitute \u201ccasual employment\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-116(6), MCA (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the WCC correctly deny the motion to dismiss Weidow\u2019s petition as untimely when Weidow filed the petition 69 days after the mediator\u2019s report had been issued?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">\u00b64 <em>Was Weidow engaged in \u201ccasual employment,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-116(6), MCA (2005), when he worked on Howard\u2019s house?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">\u00b65 Weidow sustained injuries while completing work on Howard\u2019s house at the Yellowstone Club near Big Sky, Montana. Howard holds and operates much of his real and personal property, including the house where Weidow was injured, in the Trust\u2019s name. Howard serves as the sole manager of the Trust. Howard had acquired no workers\u2019 compensation insurance for Weidow at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">\u00b66 Howard purchased the Yellowstone Club property in 2004. Howard contracted with Brickowski/Northwest Timber Structures (Brickowski) to construct a house on the property. Brickowski hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Weidow in 2005 to complete trim work on the house. Briekowski\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation policy provided coverage for Weidow. Howard discharged Brickowski in February or March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">\u00b67 Howard took over the management and development of the house. He met with the remaining subcontractors, observed their work, discussed what projects remained, and directed the order in which to complete the remaining projects. Howard also fired at least two subcontractors, hired others to finish projects, and sent two employees from Howard\u2019s California corporations to work on the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b68 Howard also entered an oral agreement with Weidow and Weidow\u2019s brother to complete the remaining work on the house. Weidow and his brother worked about 40 hours per week on the Howard house. Howard regularly paid Weidow $33 per hour using Trust money. The brothers had contact almost daily with Howard and reported progress on the house\u2019s construction. The brothers also monitored the other subcontractors\u2019 progress on the house and reported this information to Howard. The brothers completed trim work and other \u201cpunch list\u201d tasks, including pouring a concrete slab, fixing an uneven floor, and realigning the track on the house\u2019s dumbwaiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b69 Howard and Weidow had discussed the need for workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Howard had asked Weidow to investigate the cost of obtaining coverage. Weidow had learned that coverage would cost about $17,000. Howard told Weidow he did not want to buy that coverage because only a few months remained on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b610 Weidow nevertheless understood that Howard would \u201ctake care of\u2019 the workers\u2019 compensation coverage issue. Weidow knew that Howard managed other businesses with employee payrolls and believed that he would be covered through one of those entities. Weidow worked on the house alongside two other employees of Howard\u2019s other California corporations. Howard had sent the California employees to work on the house on two occasions, once in his private jet, and once in a company truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b611 Howard lives in Burbank, California. He manages and sells real estate through two different corporations. He manages about 70 residential and commercial properties through one of the corporations. He employs general maintenance workers and at least one real estate agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b612 The Trust is a legally distinct entity from the two corporations that Howard operates. Howard\u2019s attorney had advised Howard to create the Trust to hold all of Howard\u2019s personal assets in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>protect them from inheritance taxes. Howard and his wife both serve as trustees. Howard pays all his personal expenses with trust money. Howard paid for the Yellowstone Club property and all its improvements, labor, and materials out of the Trust\u2019s account. Howard claimed that he had intended to use the Yellowstone Club property as a personal vacation house. Howard claimed that he never had intended to use the Yellowstone Club property as a business or rental property.</p>\n<p id=\"ARO\">\u00b613 Weidow suffered injuries while working on the dumbwaiter in Howard\u2019s house on June 13, 2006. Howard had not obtained workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Weidow. As a result, Weidow filed a claim for benefits with the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (UEF). UEF denied liability on November 22, 2006, based on its determination that Weidow\u2019s employment with Howard qualified as \u201ccasual employment\u201d as defined in \u00a7 39-71-116(6), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b614 Weidow petitioned the Department of Labor &amp; Industry (DOL) for mediation, and the parties mediated the matter on January 4, 2007. The mediator issued and mailed the report and recommendation on January 31, 2007. The mediator recommended that the parties reach a settlement that included Weidow\u2019s lost wages and medical costs.</p>\n<p id=\"Afu\">\u00b615 Weidow notified the mediator on February 21, 2007, that he accepted the recommendation and was willing to negotiate a settlement. On the same day, UEF notified the mediator that it rejected the recommendation and would continue denying benefits. Weidow filed his petition with the WCC on April 10, 2007. Sixty-nine days had passed between the mailing of the mediator\u2019s report on January 31,2007, and Weidow\u2019s filing with the WCC on April 10,2007.</p>\n<p id=\"AiK\">\u00b616 UEF moved to dismiss Weidow\u2019s petition with the WCC. UEF claimed that UEF\u2019s denial had become final pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), when 60 days had passed from the mailing of the mediator\u2019s report. Weidow opposed the motion based on his understanding that \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), had rendered final the mediator\u2019s recommendation that Weidow receive benefits. The WCC declared \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), unconstitutionally vague and denied UEF\u2019s motion to dismiss Weidow\u2019s untimely petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b617 The WCC conducted a trial in May 2009. The WCC determined that Howard\u2019s use of the Yellowstone Club property, particularly its use for advantageous tax purposes, fell within Howard\u2019s usual course of business. The WCC concluded that the \u201ccasual employment\u201d exemption did not apply to Weidow\u2019s work on Howard\u2019s property. The WCC ordered UEF to pay medical benefits to Weidow and held Howard responsible for indemnifying UEF.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00b618 Howard appeals the WCC\u2019s conclusion that the casual employment exemption does not apply to Weidow\u2019s employment as well as the WCC\u2019s invalidation of \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005). UEF has not joined this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b619 We review de novo the WCC\u2019s grant or denial of a summary judgment motion. <em>Boyd v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., </em>2010 MT 52, \u00b6 11, 355 Mont. 336, 227 P.3d 1026. We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Schmill v. Liberty N. W. Ins. Corp., </em>2009 MT 430, \u00b6 8, 354 Mont. 88, 223 P.3d 842. We review the record to determine whether substantial credible evidence supports the court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Id. </em>The law in effect at the time of the employee\u2019s injury establishes the employee\u2019s substantive right to benefits. <em>Colmore v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2005 MT 239, \u00b6 16, 328 Mont. 441, 121 P.3d 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b620 <em>Did the WCC correctly deny the motion to dismiss Weidow\u2019s petition as untimely when Weidow filed the petition 69 days after the mediator\u2019s report had been issued?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b621 Section 39-71-520(2)(c), MCA (2005), provides that \u201c[i]f a settlement is not reached through mediation and a petition is not filed within 60 days of the mailing of the mediator\u2019s report, the determination by the department is final.\u201d The WCC declared \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), unconstitutionally vague because its phrase \u201cdetermination by the department\u201d possibly could have two different meanings. The WCC noted that Title 39, Chapter 71, Part 5 refers to both UEF and the mediation unit of DOL as \u201cthe department.\u201d The WCC could not determine whether the \u201cdetermination by the department\u201d that becomes final pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), referred to the mediator\u2019s recommendation favorable to Weidow, or to UEF\u2019s denial of Weidow\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b622 This Court generally presumes that all statutes are constitutional and attempts to construe them in a manner that gives effect to the legislature\u2019s intent if possible. Section 1-2-102, MCA; <em>Oberson v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>2007 MT 293, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 519, 171 P.3d 715. This Court attempts to \u201cavoid constitutional issues whenever possible.\u201d <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 62, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. The WCC need not have reached the constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u00b623 The WCC should have applied the doctrine of equitable tolling. The WCC refused to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling based on its erroneous conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to toll the procedural time bar in \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005). The WCC concluded that <em>Colmore v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2005 MT 239, 328 Mont. 441, 121 P.3d 1007, and <em>Flynn v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2005 MT 269, 329 Mont. 122, 122 P.3d 1216, deprived it of jurisdiction to waive the time limit of \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005). We overruled those cases in <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654, however, when we overruled <em>\u201cGray, Pena, Wells, </em>and <em>other cases\u201d </em>to the extent they have held that the legislature limited a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23 (emphasis added). We overruled those cases in part because of the confusion their \u201cless than meticulous\u201d use of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d had caused. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. The WCC fell into this linguistic trap and erroneously concluded it lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to the filing deadline of \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b624 We recently clarified that equitable principles could apply to toll procedural filing deadlines during the administrative processing of claims. <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706. The court in <em>Cringle </em>had refused to hear the railroad\u2019s petition for judicial review based on its determination that the expiration of the 14-day appeal period set forth in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, had deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9. We reversed and determined that the 14-day filing deadline constituted a procedural time bar potentially subject to tolling on equitable grounds. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20. We concluded that the court had jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the issue of whether the procedural filing deadline should be tolled based on the railroad\u2019s alleged good cause for missing the deadline. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b625 This Court has applied the doctrine of equitable tolling to statutes of limitations. <em>Harrison v. Chance, </em>244 Mont. 215, 228, 797 P.2d 200, 208 (1990); <em>Lozeau v. GEICO Indem. Co., </em>2009 MT 136, \u00b6 14, 350 Mont. 320, 207 P.3d 316. This Court determined in <em>Harrison </em>that the doctrine of equitable tolling could be applied when the plaintiff had brought a case of first impression regarding the effect of new legislation on this Court\u2019s prior holding and when the plaintiff reasonably had relied on this Court\u2019s prior holding. <em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 228, 797 P.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b626 This Court also has applied equitable tolling to toll a statute of limitations\u2019 bar when the claimant, Lozeau, initially had filed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>complaint in the wrong court. <em>Lozeau, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20. We recognized in <em>Lozeau </em>that litigants face a \u201cprocedural quandary\u201d when determining whether a Tribal Court has jurisdiction over a matter. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. We determined that Lozeau pursued her claim reasonably and in good faith. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. We also concluded that Lozeau\u2019s initial Tribal Court filing had put the defendant on notice and no prejudice had resulted to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">\u00b627 The doctrine of equitable tolling applies to procedural time requirements such as \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005). <em>See Igal v. Brightstar Info. Tech. Group, Inc., </em>51 Tex. Sup. J. 840, pp. 13-14 (Tex. 2008), citing <em>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127 (1982); <em>Irwin v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457 (1990) (stating that time requirements in lawsuits between private litigants customarily are subject to \u201cequitable tolling\u201d). Procedural time bars, such as \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), constitute affirmative defenses subject to equitable principles and constitutional review. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted). As we stated in <em>Lozeau, </em>\u201c[e]quitable tolling allows in limited circumstances for an action to be pursued despite the failure to comply with relevant statutory filing deadlines.\u201d <em>Lozeau, \u00b6 </em>14.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b628 We caution that the doctrine of equitable tolling has been applied only sparingly and warn against application of it to \u201cwhat is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S. Ct. at 458. We recognize \u201cthe importance of applying procedural bars regularly and consistently.\u201d <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6 34, 294 Mont. 252, 980 P.2d 622. We nevertheless reject any one-size-fits-all approach that would serve only to undermine the purpose of the equitable tolling doctrine and could deprive a plaintiff of his or her rights when such an approach would serve no policy purpose. <em>Burnett v. N. Y. C. RR. Co., </em>380 U.S. 424, 433-34, 85 S. Ct. 1050, 1057-58. As we recently noted, \u201climitation periods are designed to ensure justice by preventing surprise, but no surprise exists when defendants are already on notice of the substantive claims being brought against them.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 34, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b629 Turning to the case at hand, two factors generally emerge. Weidow reasonably pursued his claims in good faith, and Howard had notice of Weidow\u2019s substantive claims. <em>Lozeau, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Stevens, </em>\u00b6 34. Weidow timely notified Howard of the injury and timely filed a claim with UEF for benefits. Weidow requested mediation before DOL when UEF denied benefits. Weidow accepted the mediator\u2019s recommendation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to settle. Weidow reasonably believed that \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), would render final the mediator\u2019s recommendation unless UEF appealed within 60 days. Weidow justifiably did not understand that the statute might be read to render final UEF\u2019s denial. Weidow continued his diligent pursuit of his claim by petitioning the WCC nine days after the filing period had expired. The record contains no reason to suggest that the nine-day delay caused prejudice to Howard or inhibited his ability to collect evidence. <em>Stevens, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b630 The ambiguity inherent in \u00a7 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), justifies application of the doctrine of equitable tolling here. Section 39-71-520(2), MCA (2005), renders final a \u201cdetermination by the department\u201d upon expiration of the 60-day filing period. The statute fails to define or explain what \u201cdetermination\u201d the statute renders final. The statute also fails to define \u201cthe department.\u201d Section 39-71-116(11), MCA (2005), instructs that the \u201cDepartment\u201d means \u201cthe department of labor and industry.\u201d Both UEF and the mediation unit are branches of DOL. Title 39, Chapter 71, Part 5 of the Montana Code Annotated refers to both UEF and the mediation unit of DOL as \u201cthe department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b631  Here, UEF, a branch of DOL, determined that Weidow was not entitled to benefits. The mediation unit, also a branch of DOL, determined that Weidow was entitled to benefits. Weidow believed that the statute had placed the burden on UEF to appeal the mediator\u2019s recommendation and believed that the mediator\u2019s recommendation would be rendered final upon expiration of the 60-day filing period. Weidow justifiably relied on a plain reading of the statute. Weidow\u2019s failure to comply with an alternative reading of the ambiguous statute does not unravel his otherwise reasonable and good faith pursuit of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b632  The doctrine of equitable tolling applies to toll the 60-day filing deadline in the ambiguous statute that Weidow faced in pursuit of his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The WCC correctly denied UEF\u2019s motion to dismiss Weidow\u2019s petition. We affirm the WCC\u2019s decision when it reaches the correct result even though we reject the WCC\u2019s reasoning in reaching its decision. <em>Narum v. Liberty N.W. Ins. Corp., </em>2009 MT 127, \u00b6 31, 350 Mont. 252, 206 P.3d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b633 <em>Was Weidow engaged in \u201ccasual employment,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-116(6), MCA (2005), when he worked on Howard\u2019s house?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b634 The WCC concluded that Weidow\u2019s work on Howard\u2019s house did not fall within the exemption for \u201ccasual employment.\u201d Howard contends that the WCC improperly concluded that Howard\u2019s usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>business activities included his use and management of the Yellowstone Club property. Weidow responds that Howard\u2019s treatment of his Montana properties as business properties, including for federal taxation purposes, negates Howard\u2019s casual employment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b635 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) requires employers to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for their employees, but contains an exemption for persons engaged in \u201ccasual employment.\u201d Section 39-71-401(2)(b), MCA (2005). The Act defines \u201ccasual employment\u201d as \u201cemployment not in the usual course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of the employer.\u201d Section 39-71-116(6), MCA (2005). The Act does not define \u201ccourse of trade, business, profession, or occupation.\u201d We have interpreted \u201cbusiness\u201d to mean the \u201chabitual or regular occupation that a person [is] engaged in with a view to winning a livelihood or gain.\u201d <em>Colmore, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b636 The distinction between casual employment and employment that qualifies for workers\u2019 compensation coverage requires analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged employment. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. Whether a person has a profit motive plays an important consideration in determining whether that person is operating a business. <em>Colmore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28, 32. We also have distinguished improvements to property that constitute business and those that do not. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23 (citation omitted). Merely owning a house, or many houses, and maintaining, repairing, and renting the house so as to produce an income does not necessarily constitute a business. <em>Id. </em>Such activity constitutes a business, however, if it requires substantial time and labor for management and operation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b637 <em>Colmore </em>involved a retired farmer from Tennessee who had purchased a ranch near Livingston, Montana. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. The retired farmer, Colmore, hired his neighbor, Forgey, over four weeks to complete fencing on the Montana ranch. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11. Colmore paid Forgey $1800 and provided him with farm machinery for the fencing project. <em>Id. </em>Forgey died after getting caught in a fence post auger. <em>Id. </em>Colmore had not obtained workers\u2019 compensation insurance for Forgey. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12. Forgey\u2019s wife petitioned for death benefits with UEF. <em>Id. </em>UEF awarded death benefits to the widow. <em>Id. </em>Colmore argued on appeal that Forgey had been a casual employee and exempt from the Act. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b638 We rejected Colmore\u2019s casual employment argument because Colmore had hired Forgey in the course of his agricultural business. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. Colmore reaped tax benefits from the Montana farming and ranching operation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 31. Colmore had claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>federal income tax deductions for rent, farm equipment depreciation, Montana tax payments, and other expenses incurred from repairing the ranch fences. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b639 We rejected Colmore\u2019s argument that he had maintained the ranch solely as a summer vacation home. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. We concluded that Colmore had operated the ranch with a profit motive even though he may not have made a profit running the ranch. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28. Colmore evidenced his profit motive when he claimed agricultural and depreciation deductions on his federal income tax return to reduce his overall income tax. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 31. Colmore also had leased pasture for grazing and had hired two other persons to repair and replace fences. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b640 The circumstances of the present case do not differ significantly. Howard purchased the Yellowstone Club lot and began developing the property. Howard hired Brickowski and others to build a house on the property. Howard elected to take over the management of the property\u2019s development when he grew dissatisfied with Brickowski\u2019s performance. Howard then managed the subcontractors\u2019 work, directed them in the order in which they were to complete their work, and supervised their progress. Howard also sent employees from California to work on the house and report on its progress. Howard retained Weidow and his bother to complete trim work and other \u201cpunch list\u201d tasks. Howard paid the brothers hourly wages for forty hours of work per week over four months. The Weidow brothers had contact almost daily with Howard regarding the completion of the house. Howard\u2019s activity relating to the development of the Yellowstone Club property required substantial time and labor for management and operation. <em>Colmore, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b641 Substantial tax evidence further supports the WCC\u2019s conclusion that Howard had operated the property with a profit motive despite his claim that he intended to use it as a personal vacation home. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32. Howard listed the Yellowstone Club property on Schedule E of his federal tax returns in 2004 and 2005. Listing the property on Schedule E represents to the Internal Revenue Service that the taxpayer uses the property as business rental property. A taxpayer lists the deductible expenses of a property not held in a trade or business on Schedule A. Howard acknowledged that he knew the difference between Schedule A and Schedule E. Howard removed the property from Schedule E in 2006, after this litigation began.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b642 Howard received tax benefits for listing the Yellowstone Club property on Schedule E in 2004 and 2005. Howard increased his basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>in the property by capitalizing the costs related to the development of the property. As a business property under Schedule E, Howard would have been able to take depreciation deductions. Taxpayers owning personal residential property may not claim depreciation deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">\u00b643 Howard also had acquired a condominium in Big Sky, Montana, pursuant to a like-kind exchange transaction governed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1031. Howard traded real estate that he had owned in Bakersfield, California, for the condominium. The like-kind exchange transaction allowed Howard to defer any capital gain taxes that he otherwise would have realized. Howard listed the condominium as a Schedule E property.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b644 The Internal Revenue Code required Howard to use the condominium as a rental or business property in order to obtain the tax-deferral benefits of the like-kind exchange transaction. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1031 (2000). Howard also has used the condominium for personal purposes and as a place to store his personal possessions. Howard testified that he eventually would trade the condominium for another business property.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b645 Howard bought a Turbo Commander airplane. Howard reported on tax returns that he used the airplane sixty percent for business use and forty percent for personal use. Howard used the airplane to fly to and from Montana. Howard has never driven to Montana. Howard took delivery of the airplane in Montana and registered the airplane under the Yellowstone Club property\u2019s address to avoid paying higher California taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b646  Howard managed all his Montana properties in the usual course of his business. The tax advantages and benefits that Howard incurred through the management of the Yellowstone Club property reveal that he operated the property with a profit motive. Colmore, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32. The WCC correctly determined that Weidow was not engaged in \u201ccausal employment\u201d for Howard at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b647 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b111-9\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahu\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\u00b648 I concur with the Court\u2019s determination to affirm the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Court, but disagree with the Court\u2019s reasoning for affirming Issue 1. The Court states that <em>Colmore </em>and <em>Flynn </em>were overruled by a statement in <em>Davis </em>that the Court was overruling \u201c <em>\u2018other cases\u2019 </em>to the extent they have held that the legislature limited a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 23. Actually, the Court in <em>Davis </em>said it was overruling \u201cother cases to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>extent they have held that the Legislature limited district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction <em>by codifying a one-year time bar on post-conviction relief at \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA.\u201d Davis, </em>\u00b6 23 (emphasis added). Nonetheless, I recognize that, regardless of its actual holding, <em>Davis </em>has become the source of the Court\u2019s power to minimize the effect of statutory time bars, however broad and undefined that power may be. <em>See BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706 (Rice, J., dissenting.) Apparently, other cases, yet unidentified and decided under various statutory or constitutional provisions, have likewise been overruled by <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b649 Here, I agree with Weidow that the 60-day provision is ambiguous and that the ambiguity caused him to delay the filing of his petition. The ambiguity is not resolved by review of the provision\u2019s legislative history. Therefore, I would conclude that the general statute of limitations for worker\u2019s compensation claims, \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, should apply and that Weidow\u2019s claim was timely filed thereunder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
