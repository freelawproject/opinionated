Johnson\u2019s former employer, Western Transport, LLC, (Western Transport) appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">\u00b62 J ohnson began working for Western Transport as a local driver on April 13, 2009. He was hired to drive from his home in Libby, Montana, to Moyie, Idaho, pick up a load of wood chips and deliver them to Columbia Falls, Montana, then return to Moyie, Idaho, for a second load, deliver the second load to Columbia Falls, finally returning home to Libby. The total mileage was approximately 580 miles per day. Johnson was paid by the load.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u00b63 Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations allow drivers to work 14 hours in one day, driving 11 hours. Drivers are personally responsible for following DOT rules and regulations. Johnson claims he could not do the route in the 14 hours allowed. To make it appear he was driving \u201clegally,\u201d Johnson inaccurately reported his hours in his log book. Western Transport claims it reprimanded Johnson for driving over hours when it learned he had, but that Johnson did not turn in his driver\u2019s log in a timely fashion. Johnson denies being reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u00b64 In mid-to-late April, 2009, Johnson spoke to a co-owner of Western Transport, Cari Goss, about \u201cgoing over the road\u201d as opposed to his current local job. Johnson decided to keep his current job, and possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>go over the road when his children went back to school. Johnson never told Cari Goss he had concerns about his route or that he was having problems making two runs per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b65 On June 4, 2009, Johnson was speaking with his dispatcher and immediate supervisor, Richard Dowley, about his next haul when Johnson \u201ctold him I [Johnson] was not gonna haul loads illegally\u201d and that \u201cI [Johnson] wasn\u2019t going to haul that haul because [I] could not do it in the allotted amount of time. He told me if I didn\u2019t like it I could park my truck. I told him I would do so.\u201d June 4,2009, was Johnson\u2019s last day with Western Transport.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b66 Johnson applied for unemployment benefits, effective June 7, 2009. In his application for unemployment benefits, Johnson stated he left because \u2018We were having to lie and fudge our log books in order to make a living. They didn\u2019t tell us to lie-they scheduled me to make two runs per day. If everything went well you could legally do the run in 12.5 hours. If anything went wrong we only had 1.5 hours that we could lose without going over on the log books.\u201d Johnson also claims he talked to \u201cJimmy and Richard\u201d about his concerns \u201cmore than once.\u201d Western Transport claims that both Jimmy and Richard \u201chad no idea of [Johnson\u2019s] concerns\u201d and the last time they spoke to him was June 4, 2009, when he refused to take the haul.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b67 Johnson also filed a complaint against Western Transport with the Wyoming Division of DOT. Johnson alleged Western Transport was non-compliant with drive time hours. The Wyoming Division of DOT investigated and \u201ccertain instances of non-compliance as [Johnson] alleged were discovered.\u201d No specific instances were mentioned, and the investigator stated \u201cthat action we have taken with the carrier as a result of our investigation will result in prompt correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b68 On July 13, 2009, the Unemployment Insurance Division (UID) determined Johnson did not qualify for unemployment benefits. Johnson requested a redetermination, and on September 22, 2009, UID upheld the original determination. Johnson had until October 2, 2009, to file an appeal. On October 12, 2009, Johnson filed an appeal. A telephonic hearing on his appeal was held October 28,2009, and was reconvened on November 5, 2009. The two issues at the hearing were whether Johnson\u2019s October 12, 2009, appeal was timely, and whether Johnson was qualified to receive benefits. On November 6, 2009, the hearing\u2019s officer issued a decision upholding the decision of UID.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b69 Johnson then appealed to the Board of Labor Appeals (BLA). The BLA held a telephonic hearing on January 6, 2010. Johnson was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>represented by an attorney, and Western Transport was represented by co-owner Rob Goss. On January 8, 2010, the BLA unanimously affirmed the decision of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b610 Johnson then appealed to the Nineteenth Judicial District Court. After briefing by both parties, the District Court reversed the BLA and granted Johnson unemployment benefits. From that order, Western Transport appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b611 Western Transport presents three issues on appeal, restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b612 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court erred in substituting its own findings of fact for those of the Board of Labor Appeals?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b613 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Johnson had good cause for failing to file a timely appeal is correct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aah\">\u00b614 <em>Issue Three: Whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Johnson left his employment for good cause attributable to his employment is correct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b615 Additional facts, pertinent to each issue, will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"A5M\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">\u00b616 On judicial review, whether by a district court or this Court, the findings of the BLA as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive and the jurisdiction of the court shall be confined to questions of law. Section 39-51-2410(5), MCA; <em>American Agrijusters Co. v. Montana Dept. of Labor and Industry, </em>1999 MT 241, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 296 Mont. 176, 988 P.2d 782; <em>Brothers v. Cargill, Inc., </em>276 Mont. 105, 109, 915 P.2d 226, 228 (1996). \u201cSupported by the evidence\u201d means supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ward v. Johnson, </em>242 Mont. 225, 228, 790 P.2d 483, 485 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u00b617 The reviewing court\u2019s first determination must be whether the BLA\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Phoenix Physical Therapy v. Unemployment Insurance Division, </em>284 Mont. 95, 99-100, 943 P.2d 523, 526 (1997). Substantial evidence is something more than a scintilla of evidence, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. <em>American Agrijusters, </em>\u00b6 15. If supported by substantial evidence, the BLA\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive. <em>Phoenix Physical Therapy, </em>284 Mont, at 99-100, 943 P.2d at 526. This is true even when there is also substantial evidence or even a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. <em>See American Agrijusters, </em>\u00b6 24. The reviewing court cannot enter its own findings of fact, different from those of the BLA, unless it determines the BLA\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Connolly v. Montana Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Labor Appeals, </em>226 Mont. 201, 205, 734 P.2d 1211, 1214 (1987) (overruled on other grounds); <em>Kirby Co. of Bozeman, Inc. v. Employment Security Division of the Montana State Department of Labor and Industry, </em>189 Mont. 1, 6, 614 P.2d 1040, 1043 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b618 It is impermissible for the reviewing court to balance conflicting evidence in support of and in opposition to the [BLA\u2019s] findings, determine which is the more substantial evidence, or consider where the preponderance of the evidence lies. <em>American Agrijusters, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Brothers, </em>276 Mont. at 109, 915 P.2d at 228; <em>Ward, </em>242 Mont. at 228, 790 P.2d at 485; <em>Phoenix Physical Therapy, </em>284 Mont. 99, 943 P.2d 526; <em>Connolly, </em>226 Mont. at 205, 734 P.2d at 1214. To do so would substitute the reviewing court\u2019s view of the evidence for that of the BLA, nullifying the conclusive nature of the BLA\u2019s findings. <em>Brothers, </em>276 Mont. at 109, 915 P.2d at 228; <em>Ward, </em>242 Mont. at 228, 790 P.2d at 485; <em>Phoenix Physical Therapy, </em>284 Mont. at 99, 943 P.2d at 526; <em>Connolly, </em>226 Mont. at 205, 734 P.2d at 1214. The reviewing court must decide whether substantial evidence supports the BLA\u2019s findings and not whether, on the same evidence, it would have arrived at the same conclusion. <em>Ward, </em>242 Mont. at 228, 790 P.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b619 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court erred in substituting its own findings of fact for those of the Board of Labor Appeals?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b620 Western Transport argues that the District Court reinterpreted evidence and failed to apply the proper standard of review. Johnson argues the District Court was correct in making the findings \u201cmore complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\u00b621 Based upon the record as outlined above, the hearings officer made the following findings of fact regarding Johnson\u2019s eligibility for unemployment benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">1. Western Transport, LLC employed Johnson as a local driver beginning April 13, 2009. His last day of work was June 4, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">2. Drivers have a personal responsibility to follow the Department of Transportation (DOT) rules about drive time and accurate log books. The DOT rules allow a driver to work 14 hours a day, driving 11 hours. If a driver returns to his home each day, DOT allows the driver to work 16 hours, one day a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">3. Johnson lives in Libby, Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">4. The employer hired Johnson to drive from his home in Libby to Moyie, Idaho (45 miles), load and make a return trip to Columbia Falls, Montana (145 miles), return to Moyie (145 miles) for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>second load to Columbia Falls (145 miles), then return home to Libby (100 miles).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">5. Johnson found he could not do two runs a day. The claimant violated the drive time hours and inaccurately reported his hours in his log book. On June 4, 2009, Johnson gave the dispatcher, Richard Dowley, same day notice he was quitting because he did not want to haul illegally. Johnson called the Wyoming Division of DOT and filed a complaint after he quit stating the employer was noncompliant about drive time hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">6. On November 3, 2009, Johnson submitted a copy of the report from the Wyoming Division DOT which stated it had found some instances of noncompliance. The report did not specify what the instances were, or whether the infractions were minor or major.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">7. On November 3, 2009, the employer submitted a report from DOT, following an audit, stating their safety rating was satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b622 The District Court found these findings \u201caccurate but incomplete.\u201d It found fault with findings four and five. First, regarding finding four, it found Johnson discussed the local versus over the road job when he applied for employment. The District Court\u2019s additional finding is incorrect and not supported by the record. The only testimony on that point was from Cari Goss, who testified that the discussion of going over the road took place approximately two weeks after Johnson was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b623 Regarding finding five, the District Court found Johnson\u2019s conversation with his dispatcher, Richard Dowley, was Johnson\u2019s attempt to \u201cdiscuss the drive time problem.\u201d Johnson\u2019s testimony however, was that he called Dowley to give notice he was \u201cnot gonna haul illegally.\u201d Johnson then says Dowley told him \u201cif I [Johnson] didn\u2019t like it, I could park my truck.\u201d The District Court interpreted that to mean Dowley did not try to \u201cfind a solution\u201d to Johnson\u2019s problem. There is substantial evidence supporting two differing conclusions from this conversation-one, the BLA\u2019s determination, that Johnson called to quit; or two, the District Court\u2019s determination, that Johnson called to discuss the drive time problem and was told to \u201cpark his truck\u201d which the District Court found to mean Johnson \u201ccould quit.\u201d Because there was substantial evidence that supported the BLA\u2019s determination, its finding of fact on this issue is conclusive. <em>Phoenix Physical Therapy, </em>284 Mont. at 99-100, 943 P.2d at 526. This remains true even if \u201cthere is also substantial evidence or even a preponderance of the evidence to the <em>contraryAmerican Agrijusters,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u00b6 24. The District Court simply substituted its view of the evidence for that of the BLA\u2019s; it is not permitted to do so. <em>Brothers, </em>276 Mont. at 109, 915 P.2d at 228; <em>Ward, </em>242 Mont. at 228, 790 P.2d at 485; <em>Phoenix Physical Therapy, </em>284 Mont. at 99, 943 P.2d at 526; <em>Connolly, </em>226 Mont. at 205, 734 P.2d at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b624  It was error for the District Court to re-interpret the evidence. The BLA\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and were therefore conclusive. We reverse the District Court and affirm the findings of fact made by the BLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b625 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Johnson had good cause for failing to file a timely appeal is correct ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b626 Western Transport argues that Johnson\u2019s October 12, 2009, appeal of UID\u2019s September 22, 2009, redetermination was untimely because it was filed after the 10-day period for appeal expired and Johnson had no good cause to warrant an extension. Johnson argues he wanted to wait for the Wyoming Division of DOT report to bolster his allegations of drive time violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b627 A redetermination is final unless appealed \u201cwithin 10 days after the notification was mailed to the interested party\u2019s last-known address. The 10-day period may be extended for good cause.\u201d Section 39-51-2402(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b628  UID\u2019s redetermination became final on September 22, 2009. Johnson was notified he had until October 2, 2009, to appeal the decision, but was told the time period could be extended for good cause. The term \u201cgood cause\u201d was not defined for Johnson. The hearings officer determined that Johnson\u2019s reason for waiting to file his appeal - Johnson wanted the Wyoming Division of DOT report to corroborate his allegations of drive time violations - established good cause. The BLA upheld this decision, as did the District Court. We find no error. It was reasonable for Johnson, acting pro se at that time, to believe he had good cause for waiting to file his appeal. We affirm the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b629 <em>Issue Three: Whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Johnson left his employment for good cause attributable to his employment is correct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b630 Western Transport argues that Johnson was ineligible to receive benefits because he failed to carry his burden of proving good cause attributable to the employment and Johnson did not give Western Transport a reasonable opportunity to correct his alleged problem. Johnson argues he meets all the statutory criteria for good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b631 A claimant \u201cmust be disqualified for benefits if the individual has left work without good cause attributable to the individual's employment.\u201d Section 39-51-2302(1), MCA. A claimant has left work with good cause attributable to employment if the claimant (1) had compelling reasons arising from the work environment that caused the claimant to leave; and (2) attempted to correct the problem in the work environment; and (3) informed the employer of the problem and gave the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct it. Admin. R. M. 24.11.457(l)(a). The term \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d includes, but is not limited to, unreasonable actions by the employer concerning hours, wages, terms of employment or working conditions, including, but not limited to, reductions of 20% or more in the claimant\u2019s customary wages or hours. Admin. R. M. 24.11.457(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b632 The hearings officer found Johnson left work without good cause attributable to his employment because he did not give Cari Goss a reasonable opportunity to address his drive time problems, but rather gave notice to Dowley that he would not haul illegally-in essence, Johnson simply quit his job. The BLA affirmed the hearings officer, but also found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">[T]he preponderance of the evidence in the record supports that Johnson was not discharged and he left his employment without good cause attributable to the employment... [t]he Board further finds that there is insufficient evidence ... of an unreasonable action by the employer concerning Johnson\u2019s hours, wages, or the terms of employment ... Johnson made little attempt to correct any problems he had in the workplace and failed to give the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct any problems he had prior to leaving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b633 The District Court found that Johnson did attempt to correct the problem in the workplace by driving longer hours and altering his driving log books. The District Court also found, based on its own interpretation of Johnson\u2019s and Dowley\u2019s phone conversation, that Dowley did not try to find a solution and that Johnson had no responsibility to \u201cgo over his dispatcher\u2019s head to the owners of the company.\u201d Thus, according to the District Court, Johnson had given Western Transport a reasonable opportunity to correct the problem, the only option they offered was to \u201cpark your truck\u201d (quit), so Johnson left his employment for good cause. The District Court went on to find that even if Johnson had spoken to Cari Goss, the only alternative was to make 1.5 hauls per day, which would result in a 25% reduction in his income. While a 25% reduction in income may constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>compelling reason, it does not, alone, constitute good cause. Admin. R. M. 24.11.457.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b634  Even assuming that Johnson established both a compelling reason and that he attempted to correct the problem in the workplace, we are still left with the BLA\u2019s conclusive fact-Johnson called Dowley to give notice that he would not haul illegally and quit his job. The District Court\u2019s facts to the contrary-that Johnson spoke to Dowley in order to correct the problem and the only option he offered was to \u201cpark your truck\u201d (quit) - are irrelevant. Therefore, we reverse the District Court and reinstate the findings of the BLA that Johnson did not give the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct any problems he had prior to leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b635 While we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Johnson had good cause for filing an untimely appeal, we reverse in all other respects. The BLA\u2019s findings are reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\"> The Board of Labor Appeals (BLA) filed a Notice of non-participation in this case, requesting the Court to take judicial notice of the standard of review for BLA decisions and reserving their right to intervene should issues pertaining to the BLA arise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
