Murray (Murray) appeals from an order of the Fifth Judicial District Court, Jefferson County, denying his motion to suppress. Murray also appeals his sentence for operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b62 Murray presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred in denying Murray\u2019s motion to suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred when it sentenced Murray for operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u00b65 Issue 3: Whether, in the alternative, the prosecutor erred in recommending a sentence for operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance that was outside the scope of the plea agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\u00b66 Shortly before midnight on July 24, 2008, Jefferson County Sheriffs Deputy Chad Cross was patrolling the town of Whitehall, Montana. While stopped at the intersection of Second Street and Division Street, Cross observed an older blue pickup pass in front of him, turn onto Yellowstone Trail, and immediately pull over, stop, and shut off its headlights. Cross proceeded with his patrol and eventually traveled back down Yellowstone Trail. Cross noted the truck was still parked alongside the road, and a man was walking two dogs on the side of the road, while another man remained in the passenger seat. Cross recognized Murray as the man walking the dogs. Cross passed the truck and continued his patrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">\u00b67 Later, while Cross approached Yellowstone Trail from Kelly Road, he noticed the truck traveling on Yellowstone Trail. Cross pulled onto Yellowstone Trail behind the truck. While following the truck, Cross observed it weave across the center area of the unlined road and straddle the center area for approximately one to two seconds before weaving back to the right-hand side of the road. Cross believed that the truck\u2019s driver (Murray) had committed a traffic offense by failing to drive to the right side of the roadway, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA. Cross continued to follow the truck to determine whether the behavior would repeat itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u00b68 Shortly thereafter, however, the truck pulled into the Mormon Church parking lot and parked. Cross followed and parked, blocking the truck from reversing. While Cross radioed dispatch, Murray exited the truck with his dogs and walked away. Cross yelled at Murray to get his attention and requested that he return to the truck. Murray complied, and the subsequent interaction between Murray and Cross led to Murray\u2019s arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). On appeal, Murray does not challenge the legality of any events occurring after Cross contacted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b69 Murray was charged injustice court with driving or operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .08 or greater (DUI Per Se), in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, and operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance, in violation of \u00a7 61-6-301, MCA. Murray filed a motion to suppress in justice court, arguing that Cross did not have sufficient particularized suspicion to stop him. The court denied his motion, and, following a bench trial, Murray was found guilty of both offenses. Murray then appealed to District Court and again filed his motion to suppress. The District Court denied the motion, concluding Cross had particularized suspicion to stop Murray. Subsequently, Murray entered a conditional plea, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to both the DUI Per Se and no insurance charges on the condition that he could appeal the denial of his motion to suppress to this Court. Murray was sentenced for the no insurance offense to six months in the Jefferson County Jail, with all but two days suspended, credit for ten days of jail time served, and a $250 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b610 Murray appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u00b611 We review the denial of a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly applied those findings as a matter of law. <em>State v. Rutherford, </em>2009 MT 154, \u00b6 9, 350 Mont. 403, 208 P.3d 389. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>State v. Deines, </em>2009 MT 179, \u00b6 6, 351 Mont. 1, 208 P.3d 857. We review for clear error a finding that an officer had a particularized suspicion to conduct an investigative stop. <em>Rutherford, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u00b612 This Court reviews criminal sentences for legality only, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>confine our review to whether the sentence falls within statutory parameters. <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b613 Issue 1: <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Murray\u2019s motion to </em>suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b614 \u201c[A] peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Section 46-5-401, MCA. Particularized suspicion exists where there is (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a certain vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>State v. Loney, </em>2004 MT 204, \u00b6 7, 322 Mont. 305, 95 P.3d 691. A law enforcement officer\u2019s observation of a traffic offense more than satisfies the particularized suspicion requirement: probable cause, rather than particularized suspicion, exists in that instance because there are sufficient facts and circumstances, rather than inferences and a resulting suspicion, within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge to warrant a reasonable person\u2019s belief that the suspect has committed an offense. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>In re License Suspension of Cybulski, </em>2008 MT 128, \u00b6 26, 343 Mont. 56, 183 P.3d 39. Relevant to this appeal, \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, provides that, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, \u201c[u]pon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle must be operated upon the right half of the roadway <em>...\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b615 The District Court, after personally driving upon and viewing Yellowstone Trail, determined that the road was of sufficient width to allow vehicles to meet and remain upon their respective right halves of the road surface. The District Court further noted that \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, does not require that a centerline be marked with a paint stripe or otherwise, and Murray\u2019s failure to operate his truck to the right side of the roadway violated \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA. Based on the above, the District Court denied Murray\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that a violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, provides probable cause, a higher standard than particularized suspicion, and, therefore, Cross was authorized to stop Murray. In the alternative, the District Court concluded that even if there was no statutory violation, Murray\u2019s unsteady travel from the left of center to the right of the roadway provided particularized suspicion for the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00b616 On appeal, Murray argues that the District Court\u2019s determination that Yellowstone Trail is of sufficient width for \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, to apply is unsupported by case law or statute and is unrealistic when applied to rural roads. In addition, Murray argues the District Court\u2019s alternative finding was error because Murray\u2019s weaving does not give rise to particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b617  We conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that Yellowstone Trail was of sufficient width and that Murray violated \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, is not clearly erroneous. The District Court heard testimony from Cross who testified that he had no trouble staying on the right side of Yellowstone Trail. The District Court also noted that Murray acknowledged that almost everyone drives down the center of the roadway until another car approaches, at which time each vehicle drives on its respective right half of the road-an implicit admission that the road is sufficiently wide. Finally, the District Court independently viewed the portion of Yellowstone Trail at issue and concluded that \u201cthe road is of more than sufficient width to allow two vehicles to meet.\u201d After finding Murray drove on the left side of the road (Murray failed to refute this), the District Court correctly concluded Murray violated a statute, thus satisfying the particularized suspicion requirement for the stop. <em>See Loney, </em>\u00b6 16. Because we affirm on the basis that Murray\u2019s violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, established probable cause for the stop, it is not necessary for us to address the District Court\u2019s alternative holding that regardless of a statutory violation, particularized suspicion existed for the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b618 Issue 2: <em>Whether the District Court erred when it sentenced Murray for operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b619 Section 61-6-301(4), MCA, provides that it is unlawful for a person to operate a motor vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public without a valid policy of liability insurance in effect. A first conviction of this offense is punishable by \u201ca fine of not less than $250 or more than $500 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 10 days, or both.\u201d Section 61-6-304(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b620  Murray\u2019s sentence of six months with all but two days suspended clearly exceeds the statutory maximum penalty. The State concedes that Murray\u2019s sentence is illegal. Therefore, we remand to the District Court for resentencing to correct the illegal provision \u2014 the six month sentence-of Murray\u2019s sentence. <em>State v. </em>Heafner, 2010 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087. Because we reverse and remand for resentencing, we need not address Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b621 We affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that Murray\u2019s violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, established probable cause, a higher standard than that of the minimum particularized suspicion requirement, thus justifying the investigatory stop. However, we reverse the sentence imposed by the District Court for failure to have liability insurance because it exceeds the statutory maximum sentence, and, therefore, we remand to the District Court to correct the illegal portion of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b622 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-6\">JUSTICES COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b152-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"AVy\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u00b623 I concur with the result reached by the Court, but I write separately because I disagree that the dispositive issue was probable cause to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\u00b624 The majority, the District Court, and briefs filed on appeal, assume that Officer Cross required either particularized suspicion or probable cause because Murray\u2019s vehicle was stopped. However, this case does not concern a vehicular stop. Rather, the central issue is whether Murray was seized when Officer Cross engaged him in the parking lot of the Mormon Church. I would hold that Murray was never subjected to a constitutional seizure and suggest the Court take this opportunity to clarify its seizure jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u00b625 When addressing the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the central inquiry is the reasonableness of the government\u2019s intrusion of an individual\u2019s personal security. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1878-79 (1968). An individual is seized for constitutional purposes when, by means of physical force or show of authority, his or her freedom of movement is restrained. <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 1877 (1980). In <em>Mendenhall, </em>Justice Stewart, writing for a plurality, explained that \u201ca person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S. Ct. at 1877. This Court adopted the <em>Mendenhall </em>test in <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>192 Mont. 539, 543, 629 P.2d 761, 764 (1981), and has reaffirmed its use in later cases. E.g. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, 293 Mont. 476, 977 P.2d 974; <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>2009 MT 99, 350 Mont. 96, 205 P.3d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u00b626 Subsequent to <em>Mendenhall, </em>the United States Supreme Court revisited and altered its seizure jurisprudence on numerous occasions. <em>See I.N.S. v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 104 S. Ct. 1758 (1984); <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 111 S. Ct. 1547 (1991); <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 111 S. Ct. 2382 (1991). Although <em>Mendenhall </em>is still credited as the foundation for Fourth Amendment seizure inquiries, the federal test has evolved to inquire whether, in a totality of the circumstances, \u201cthe police conduct would \u2018have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\u2019\u201d <em>Kaupp v. Texas, </em>538 U.S. 626, 629,123 S. Ct. 1843, 1845 <em>(2003);Brendlin v. California, </em>551 U.S. 249, 254-55, 127 S. Ct. 2400, 2405-06 (2007) <em>(citing Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 435-36, 111 S. Ct. at 2386-87). This Court however, has remained tethered to the original <em>Mendenhall </em>language. <em>Wilkins, </em>\u00b6 9.1 believe that the \u201creasonable person\u201d test has resulted in a confusing, unhelpful standard. This Court should take the opportunity to clarify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b627 As a threshold matter, Mendenhall\u2019s \u201creasonable person\u201d standard has a problematic built-in contradiction, inquiring whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave, while inherently recognizing that the reasonable person already feels a level of compulsion to remain. Some courts frame this as a citizen\u2019s interest in cooperating with law enforcement out of obligation, duty, or etiquette. <em>U.S. v Tavolacci, </em>895 F.2d 1423, 1424 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Others acknowledge a level of pressure or coercion to stay when an officer approaches and begins questioning. <em>U.S. v. Simmons, </em>918 F.2d 476, 480 (5th Cir. 1990) (\u201c[0]ne\u2019s self-identification as a law enforcement officer is not so coercive that this statement alone renders an encounter between citizen and police a seizure.\u201d); <em>Colorado v. Melton, </em>910 P.2d 672, 677 (Colo. 1996) (defendant felt no intimidation beyond \u201cthe inherent pressure felt by any citizen to cooperate with law enforcement officers\u201d); <em>Tennessee v. Daniel, </em>12 S.W.3d 420, 427 (Tenn. 2000) (\u201cencounter did not become a seizure simply because Daniel may have felt inherent social pressure to cooperate\u201d). Concurring in <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>Justice Brennan posited that the average person remains because he or she cannot know what is in an officer\u2019s head, and is not sure that walking away is actually an option. 461 U.S. 352, 368-69, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 1864 (1983) (Brennen J., concurring). Professor Wayne LaFave has reasoned that a literal interpretation of <em>Mendenhall </em>would convert nearly every interaction between citizens and the police into a constitutional seizure. Wayne LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>vol. 4, \u00a7 9.4(a), 424 (4th ed., West 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u00b628 Furthermore, it does not make sense for this Court to continue to adhere to a standard that is impractical and unrealistic. Recently, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals expressed displeasure with <em>Mendenhall\u2019s </em>focus, explaining \u201c[i]t might bring greater clarity to this area of the law if the test were framed in terms of whether the officer\u2019s behavior is coercive rather than whether, under the circumstances, the reasonable person would feel Tree to disregard the police,\u2019 which we suspect is unrealistic.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>546 F.3d 1223, 1226 n. 1 (10th Cir. 2008). The Supreme Court of Illinois has stated that \u201c\u2018a practical, realistic inquiry\u2019 ... is not a description that one often sees applied to the <em>Mendenhall </em>standard.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Luedemann, </em>857 N.E.2d 187, 202 (Ill. 2006). Such sentiments have been echoed by other courts and jurists. <em>Golphin v. State, </em>945 So.2d 1174, 1190 (Fla. 2006) (\u201cIn interpreting the scope of the Fourth Amendment, courts appear to have steadily increased expectations that the \u2018reasonable person\u2019 is one who not only knows the full extent of his rights, but zealously protects them to the point that he will not hesitate to confront authority and demand the return of identification so that he may effect his right to walk away.\u201d); <em>United States v. Notorianni, </em>729 F.2d 520, 522 (7th Cir. 1984) (\u201cMaybe this is a wrong guess about what the average person feels in this situation but it is the law of this circuit.\u201d); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>356 F.3d 1268, 1276 (10th Cir. 2004) (McKay J., dissenting) (arguing that the \u201creasonable person\u201d is a legal fiction historically defined by the experience of judges, rather than the record at hand); <em>State v. Lalezari, </em>1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 3800, 14-15 (Ohio App. 2nd Dist.) (doubting the legal fiction that a \u201creasonable person\u201d is the most likely individual to resist authority and avoid coercion); <em>People v. Spicer, </em>157 Cal. App. 3d 213, 218 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1984) (citing <em>State v. Shy, </em>373 So.2d 145 (La. 1979) (acknowledging that the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard \u201cmay be the greatest legal fiction of the late 20th century\u201d); <em>Shy, </em>373 So.2d at 148-49 (Dennis J., dissenting) (criticizing the \u201cfree to walk away\u201d standard as both legalistic and unrealistic).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b629 The foregoing leads me to conclude that Montana would be better served by abandoning <em>Mendenhall\u2019s </em>\u201creasonable person\u201d language. A clearer standard would be one similar to the test recently adopted by the Oregon Supreme Court: Whether an officer\u2019s objective actions restrict, interfere with, or deprive an individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement. <em>See State v. Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or. 297, 244 P.3d 360 (2010). Such a standard properly turns on the officer\u2019s objective conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u00b630 Moreover, this Court has already chosen to break with federal seizure jurisprudence. <em>State v. Clayton, </em>2002 MT 67, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 215, 45 P.3d 30. In <em>Clayton, </em>this Court declined to follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. at 626, 111 S. Ct. at 1550, that an individual is not seized unless he or she actually yields to physical force or a show of authority. <em>Clayton, </em>\u00b6 22. The Court determined that <em>Hodari D. </em>did not comport with the protections of the Montana Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. As a result, in Montana a seizure can occur at the moment an officer displays authority, regardless of the individual\u2019s subjective response to the authority. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24. Considering this Court is no longer tethered to the federal seizure standard, I see no reason for continued adherence to the confusing and problematic \u201creasonable person\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b631 Turning to the case at hand, Cross did not \u201cstop\u201d Murray\u2019s vehicle. He did not utilize the patrol car\u2019s light-bar or siren, or indicate that Murray was not free to continue driving. Rather, Cross merely followed Murray down the road. Moreover, Charles Massey, the passenger in the truck, testified that he and Murray were unaware that they were being followed by a police car, and insisted that they parked at the church for reasons unrelated to the car'behind them. Thus, the proper focus of the inquiry is whether Cross seized Murray after the truck was already parked.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b632 The objective circumstances do not support the conclusion that Murray was seized in the parking lot. Cross parked behind Murray\u2019s truck preventing him from reversing. In <em>Roberts </em>this Court held a seizure occurred after an officer blocked Roberts\u2019 car into a one-lane driveway, immediately exited the patrol vehicle, proceeded directly up to Roberts and engaged him in conversation. <em>Roberts, </em>\u00b6 16. The circumstances here are quite different. Rather than exiting, Cross remained in his vehicle and radioed the dispatcher. Moreover, he sat and watched while Murray got out of the truck, removed his dogs and wandered off. Cross did not pursue Murray or demand engagement. Instead, he entirely ignored Murray, walked to the passenger side of the truck and spoke with Massey. Only after finishing with Massey and discovering that Murray was across the parking lot did Cross yell, in order to get Murray to approach. Accordingly, I would hold that no seizure occurred because Cross\u2019 actions did not objectively restrict, interfere with, or deprive Murray\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing specially concurring opinion of CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
