T.J.F. was committed to the Montana State Hospital for a period not to exceed 90 days. T.J.F. appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u00b62 T.J.F. was living with his grandparents in their home when his grandfather began to notice changes in T.J.F.\u2019s behavior. His grandfather testified that T. J.F. was not himself and he felt something was going on with T.J.F. His grandfather testified that T.J.F. was aggressive, anxious, lacked comprehension, refused to follow house rules, and had \u201cno control and just loses himself.\u201d T.J.F. also destroyed or threatened to destroy his grandfather\u2019s property. His grandfather felt T.J.F. needed medical help, such as going to the Montana State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u00b63 On April 2,2010, T.J.F.\u2019s father and his father\u2019s girlfriend visited T.J.F. in the hopes of getting T.J.F. mental health treatment. T.J.F.\u2019s grandfather testified that T.J.F. \u201ctried to run out of there and cussing and swearing and just losing it actually.\u201d T.J.F.\u2019s father tried to hold him down, and his father\u2019s girlfriend called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">\u00b64 When the police arrived, T.J.F. ran down the street. Police officers followed him, trying to engage T.J.F. While running, T.J.F. yelled obscenities and said repeatedly \u201cI\u2019m just out for a run. You\u2019ve got nothing on me.\u201d T.J.F. also jumped in front of cars, causing them to slam on their brakes and stop. T.J.F. yelled obscenities at the drivers and told them he was being harassed. T.J.F. also punched a patrol car, putting \u201ca pretty good dent in the front fender.\u201d When the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>finally caught up to T.J.F., he started \u201ckicking, fighting, attempting to bite officers that were holding him.\u201d It took all officers present (approximately seven) to detain T.J.F.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b65 After being detained, T.J.F. was taken to the emergency room for a psychological evaluation. At the hospital, T.J.F. was medicated and calmed down enough for the officers to take restraints off him. The hospital would not accept T.J.F. as a patient because he was \u201ctoo great of a safety risk,\u201d so he was transported to the county jail. It appears from the record that T.J.F. was released without further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AiO\">\u00b66 Several weeks later, on April 29, 2010, T.J.F. was pulled over for failing to stop at a stop sign. T.J.F. got out of his vehicle and began to walk away. The officer asked him to stop. T.J.F. responded with an obscenity and came back to speak with the officer. T.J.F. was acting aggressively and was \u201cextremely upset.\u201d The officer called for backup. T.J.F. was \u201cunpredictable\u201d and was \u201cin an enraged state.\u201d The officer asked T.J.F. to sit in his vehicle and he complied. Several more officers arrived and T.J.F. locked himself in his vehicle. Officer Houston spoke with T.J.F. and asked him to step out of his vehicle. T.J.F. complied. The officers attempted to put T.J.F. in handcuffs to control the situation for officer safety. T.J.F. resisted, asking \u201cWhy?\u201d and using profanity. T.J.F. would not turn around to be cuffed and \u201cit went immediately to a fight.\u201d The officers were unable to control T.J.F. and T.J.F. was tased several times. T.J.F. stopped resisting and was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b67 On May 7, 2010, the Cascade County Attorney\u2019s Office filed a petition seeking a mental evaluation of T.J.F., that T.J.F. be appointed counsel, and that T.J.F. be committed to the Montana State Hospital pending resolution of the petition. The District Court set an initial appearance for May 11,2010, and ordered T.J.F. held at the Montana State Hospital until that time. At the initial appearance, T.J.F. appeared, via Vision Net from the Montana State Hospital, with his appointed counsel. The District Court ordered T.J.F. to submit to a mental evaluation and that T.J.F. be detained at the Montana State Hospital pending further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b68 A bench trial was held on May 17, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> T.J.F. appeared in person, represented by counsel. Prior to trial, when T.J.F. was not present in the courtroom, the chief security officer \u201cindicated some concerns about the safety of court personnel\u201d due to T.J.F. \u201cacting out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>both verbally and physically.\u201d The District Court conducted a security hearing and took sworn testimony in order to determine \u201chow and whether or not-to what extent [T.J.F.] should be restrained during these proceedings.\u201d The security officer testified that T.J.F. was a threat to the safety of court personnel and the people involved in the hearing. T.J.F.\u2019s counsel asked the District Court to give T.J.F. the opportunity to show he could behave before being restrained, or in the alternative, the least restrictive restraints, such as handcuffs. The State asked that T.J.F. be restrained by \u201cbelly chains and additional restraints.\u201d The security officer recommended \u201c[a]t the minimum, [a] belly chain and hand restraints ... I would also prefer leg irons due to the fact that he has been kicking and he did demonstrate the behavior today while he was in transport.\u201d Ultimately, the District Court found T.J.F. was a \u201cdanger to court personnel,\u201d including his own counsel, and ordered full restraints. In doing so, the District Court found \u201cthis is a bench trial; there won\u2019t be the prejudice that would be presented in front of a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b69 The District Court also discussed two other matters on the record before T.J.F. was brought into the courtroom. First, it confirmed with T.J.F.\u2019s counsel that T.J.F. waived a jury trial. Second, the District Court confirmed that T.J.F.\u2019s counsel received an order regarding examination by another professional, and checked on the status of that examination. T.J.F. was then brought into the courtroom and was present in person, in full restraints, for the rest of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiy\">\u00b610 At the bench trial, Mr. Delbert Fischer, a licensed clinical professional counselor and mental health professional, testified regarding his evaluation of T.J.F. He found T.J.F. was \u201csuffering a psychosis to a degree that it perhaps is aggravated by [his] history of substance abuse, and as a consequence of his substance abuse it\u2019s somewhat difficult to pin down the diagnosis.\u201d Mr. Fischer diagnosed T.J.F. with a psychotic disorder (not otherwise specified), and wanted to rule out substance abuse. Mr. Fischer testified that substance abuse might mask a mental illness, but also that mental illness may be aggravated by substance abuse. He testified that T.J.F.\u2019s behavior \u201cputs himself and others within the community at risk for harm. And as a result, I thought that hospitalization would be appropriate.\u201d Ultimately, Mr. Fischer testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, T.J.F. suffered from a mental disorder. Finally, he testified that the least restrictive placement for T.J.F. was at the Montana State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b611 The District Court issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>and an Order committing T.J.F. to the Montana State Hospital for a period not to exceed 90 days. The District Court found \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty, [T.J.F.] suffers from a mental disorder\u201d and \u201c[b]ecause of the mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to [T.J.F.] and others through overt acts and failures to act. The least restrictive placement for [T.J.F.] ... is commitment to the Montana State Hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b612 T.J.F. raises three issues on appeal, restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b613 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court violate T.J.F.\u2019s due process and statutory rights when it held a security hearing without T.J.F. present and when it required him to appear at his bench trial in restraints?</em></p>\n<p id=\"APN\">\u00b614 <em>Issue Two: Was T.J.F.\u2019s trial counsel ineffective for failing to object to holding the security hearing without T.J.F. present?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b615 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court err in concluding the State proved T.J.F. met the statutory criteria for commitment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b616 We exercise plenary review of constitutional questions, such as due process and the right to counsel. <em>In re Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2009 MT 125, \u00b6 13, 350 Mont. 211, 207 P.3d 289 (hereinafter <em>C.R.C. ID; In re Mental Health </em>of L.K., 2008 MT 169, \u00b6 17, 343 Mont. 366, 184 P.3d 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u00b617 We review the findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine if the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>In re Mental Health of A.S.B., </em>2008 MT 82, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 169, 180 P.3d 625. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if substantial credible evidence does not support them, the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Id.; In re Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 11, 325 Mont. 133, 104 P.3d 1065 (hereinafter <em>C.R.C. D\u25a0 </em>The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>A.S.B., </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">DISCUSSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">\u00b618 As an initial matter, we note that T.J.F.\u2019s appeal from an expired 90-day commitment is not moot. <em>In re Mental Health of D.V., 2007 </em>MT 351, \u00b6 32, 340 Mont. 319, 174 P.3d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">\u00b619 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court violate T.J.F.\u2019s due process and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>statutory rights when it held a security hearing without T.J.F. present and when it required him to appear at his bench trial in restraints?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">\u00b620 T.J.F. argues the District Court violated both his due process right and statutory right to be present during any hearing or trial, and his due process right to be free from bodily restraint. The State argues that T.J.F.\u2019s counsel did not object to either the security hearing or to T.J.F. being in restraints during the bench trial. Further, the State argues that T.J.F. has not sought plain error review of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">A. The Security Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b621 T.J.F.\u2019s counsel did not object to the security hearing. To preserve an objection for appeal, a party must state grounds for the objection that are sufficiently specific. <em>In re B.I. &amp;N.G., </em>2009 MT 350, \u00b6 16, 353 Mont. 183, 218 P.3d 1235 <em>(citing State v. Benson, </em>1999 MT 324, \u00b6 19, 297 Mont. 321, 992 P.2d 831.). Because T.J.F.\u2019s trial counsel did not object to holding the security hearing without T.J.F. present, T.J.F. did not properly preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b622 However, we note that any person involuntarily detained or against whom a petition for involuntary commitment has been filed has the right to be present at any hearing or trial. Sections 53-21-115(2), -116, MCA; <em>In re Mental Health of L.K., </em>2009 MT 366, \u00b6 12, 353 Mont. 246, 219 P.3d 1263. T.J.F. was not present for the security hearing held by the District Court and he argues this violates his right to be present at any hearing. At the security hearing, nothing about the underlying petition was decided. The security hearing was simply an administrative proceeding held to ensure the orderly conduct of the hearing on the State\u2019s petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-1-111(3), MCA (every court has the power to provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it). The District Court made no ruling whatsoever on the State\u2019s petition, but ruled only on the issue of restraints. Once that issue was decided T.J.F. was promptly brought into the courtroom and was present for the entire commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">B. Restraints During the Bench Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b623 T.J.F. next argues that requiring him to appear in full restraints during his bench trial violated his due process right to be free from bodily restraint and his right to dignity under the Montana Constitution. The State argues that T.J.F. did not object, and therefore his present argument was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u00b624 T.J.F.\u2019s counsel did object to T.J.F. appearing in full restraints, despite not using the word \u201cobjection.\u201d T.J.F.\u2019s counsel made \u201ca statement on the record,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">Judge, just before the beginning of the trial I did briefly meet with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>[T. J.F.] and he indicated to me that he was calm, that he had the ability to remain calm throughout the trial. He understood that he needs to be on his best behavior here in the courtroom. I would ask, Your Honor, that the Court would give him an opportunity to show that he can behave before he is restrained. Alternatively, if the Court feels that it is necessary to impose some restraint, that the least restrictive restraint be imposed, probably maybe handcuffing him, and the Court give him an opportunity to see if he can behave, and if for any reason that he seems to not be able to maintain composure here in the courtroom, then at that point it isn\u2019t an issue of whether additional restraint is necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The argument on appeal was not waived by failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b625 The District Court ultimately found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">The Court feels that the respondent [T.J.F.] is a danger to court personnel, including respondent\u2019s counsel. The Court agrees that this is a bench trial; there won\u2019t be the prejudice that would be presented in front of a jury. And accordingly, I\u2019m going to order full restraints, including leg irons, handcuffs and belly chains for the respondent for the purposes of these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">T.J.F. was then brought in and was fully restrained throughout his commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b626  The due process clauses of the United States and Montana Constitutions entitle <em>criminal </em>defendants to appear before <em>juries </em>free of bodily restraints. U.S. Const, amends. V and XTV; Mont. Const, art. II, Section 17; <em>State v. Merrill, </em>2008 MT 143, \u00b6 12, 343 Mont. 130, 183 P.3d 56 (emphasis added). The reason for this, of course, is to avoid creating the impression within the minds of jurors that a criminal defendant is guilty or dangerous, thus possibly prejudicing the defendant and his right to a fair trial. The right to be free from physical restraints is not absolute however. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 12. The district court must be persuaded by compelling circumstances that some measure is needed to maintain the security of the courtroom, and must pursue less restrictive alternatives before imposing physical restraints. <em>State v. Herrick, </em>2004 MT 323, \u00b6 14, 324 Mont. 76, 101 P.3d 755 (adopting this test from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals); <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 13. The district court\u2019s decision to restrain a criminal defendant dining trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u00b627 It appears that Montana has not yet addressed whether an individual facing civil commitment has such a right. The statutes governing involuntary commitment offer no guidance on this particular issue. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 53-21-101 to -198, MCA. Rather, the statues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>provide a list of procedural rights regarding those facing involuntary commitment. Section 53-21-115, MCA. The right to appear without restraints is not among them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b628  Although not authoritative, we find the criminal cases above informative on this issue, and were this case about an individual appearing in full restraints before a jury in a civil commitment proceeding we may be inclined to adopt the standard adopted in <em>Herrick. </em>However, that is not the case. Involuntary commitment proceedings are civil in nature. There need not be automatic congruence between procedural due process requirements in criminal trials and involuntary civil commitments. <em>Tyars v. Finner, </em>709 F.2d 1274, 1283 (9th Cir. 1983). Although we do not adopt the <em>Herrick </em>standard for this particular case, we find that in an involuntary commitment proceeding before a district court sitting without a jury, there must be a showing on the record that restraints are needed before the District Court may order them.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b629  Applying this standard, we find no error by the District Court in requiring T.J.F. to appear before it, at a bench trial, in full restraints. The record shows the District Court took testimony on the issue, and allowed both the State and T.J.F.\u2019s counsel to address it. Contrary to T.J.F.\u2019s assertions, T.J.F. was not restrained solely due to T.J.F.\u2019s verbal outbursts, but also due to him acting out physically during the ride from the Montana State Hospital to court that day, and the allegations of T.J.F.\u2019s violent behavior in the underlying petition. The District Court established, on the record, the need for restraints to maintain the security of the courtroom and court personnel, which was well within its authority. Section 3-1-111(3), MCA (every court has the power to provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it). Further, the District Court made the specific finding that, because there was no jury, the potential for T.J.F. to be prejudiced by appearing in restraints was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b630 Finally, and importantly, the record is devoid of any prejudice suffered by T.J.F. because he appeared in restraints. T.J.F.\u2019s argument to the contrary - that \u201c[t]he district court prejudged T.J.F. as requiring involuntary commitment based on a \u2018feeling\u2019 that T.J.F. was dangerous\u201d - is unsupported by the record and without merit. We also find no violation of T.J.F.\u2019s right to dignity under the Montana Constitution. The District Court established a need for T.J.F. to be restrained, and we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b631 <em>Issue Two: Was T.J.F.\u2019s trial counsel ineffective for failing to object to holding the security hearing without T.J.F. present?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u00b632 T. J.F. argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the District Court held a security hearing outside of his presence. The State argues that the record as a whole establishes that T. J.F.\u2019s counsel was effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b633 The proper role of an attorney in involuntary commitment proceedings is to represent the perspective of the respondent and to serve as a vigorous advocate for the respondent\u2019s wishes. <em>C.R.C. II, </em>\u00b6 18. The traditional <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance does not apply to involuntary commitment proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16. We look instead to five \u201ccritical areas\u201d to measure effective assistance of counsel in involuntary commitment proceedings: 1) appointment of counsel; 2) counsel\u2019s initial investigation; 3) counsel\u2019s interview with the client; 4) the patient-respondent\u2019s right to remain silent; and 5) counsel\u2019s role as an advocate for the patient-respondent. <em>Id. </em>Upon a substantial showing of evidence that counsel did not effectively represent the patient-respondent\u2019s interests pursuant to these five critical areas, an order of involuntary commitment should be vacated. <em>Id. </em>We review the record as a whole, and each critical factor is evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances of the entire case. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b634 The only factor implicated here is counsel\u2019s role as an advocate for the patient-respondent. Based upon the record as a whole, and the facts and circumstances of the entire case, we cannot say that T. J.F.\u2019s counsel was ineffective. While she did not object to the security hearing being held without T.J.F. present, she did advocate for him during the security hearing, asking the District Court to allow him an opportunity to conform his behavior before restraining him and asking for the least restrictive restraints. The record is replete with other evidence of counsel's vigorous advocacy-she moved for T. J.F.\u2019s release pending trial, actively objected during witness testimony, cross-examined all witnesses, succeeded in having hearsay evidence excluded, and advocated for the dismissal of the petition. In all, T. J.F.\u2019s counsel represented the perspective of T.J.F. and served as a vigorous advocate for T. J.F.\u2019s wishes. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b635 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court err in concluding the State proved T.J.F. met the statutory criteria for commitment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b636 T.J.F. argues the District Court erred by failing to consider T. J.F.\u2019s substance abuse and by finding T.J.F. an imminent danger to himself or others because of his mental disorder. The State argues that while T.J.F. admitted substance use, there was no evidence substance abuse played a role in this case, and that the District Court made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>requisite connection between the mental disorder andT.J.F.\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"AFi\">\u00b637 At trial on a petition for involuntary commitment, the district court must first \u201cconsider all the facts relevant to the issues of whether the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder.\u201d Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. If the district court determines that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, it must \u201cthen determine whether the respondent requires commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether the respondent requires commitment and the appropriate disposition under \u00a7 53-21-127, MCA, the court shall consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by the respondent\u2019s relevant medical history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\"><em>Id. </em>Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed above justifies commitment. Section 53-21-127(7), MCA. The term \u201cmental disorder\u201d does not include addiction to drugs or alcohol. Section 53-21-102(9)(b), MCA. A mental disorder may co-occur with an addiction or chemical dependency. Section 53-21-102(9)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b638 The District Court found \u201cthere is little, if any, evidence of substance abuse much less dependency or addiction.\u201d We agree. While there is evidence that T.J.F. used drugs occasionally, there is no evidence in the record that T.J.F. was addicted to drugs, or that T.J.F. was even using drugs at the time the events underlying the petition occurred. Mr. Fischer testified that T. J.F.\u2019s \u201cmedical illness\u201d caused him to exhibit behaviors that put him and others in the community at risk of harm. T.J.F.\u2019s argument that his behavior was caused by substance abuse is not supported by the record. We find no error in the District Court\u2019s findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u00b639  The District Court also found that \u201c[b]ecause of the mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to [T.J.F.] and others through overt acts and failures.\u201d T.J.F. argues that there is no evidence that T.J.F. caused injury or posed the imminent threat of injury to anyone because of his mental disorder. However, the record demonstrates that T.J.F., while fleeing from police, ran in and out of traffic, causing drivers to slam on their brakes. T.J.F. punched a patrol car. T.J.F. was agitated, enraged, and unpredictable. Mr. Fischer\u2019s report indicates that T. J.F.\u2019s behavior was bizarre and aggressive. Mr. Fischer testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, T.J.F. had a mental disorder and because of this T.J.F. posed a risk of harm to himself and the community. Based on the record before the Court, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b640 For the reasons stated above, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> T.J.F. waived his right to a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b247-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AbI\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b641 I concur with the Court\u2019s Opinion as to Issues 2 and 3 and the result of the Opinion. I specially concur with the result of Issue 1 on the facts of this case only.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\u00b642 Specifically, I am not necessarily persuaded that just calling the security hearing an \u201cadministrative proceeding,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22-assuming, arguendo, that is what it is-relieves the trial court from honoring the person\u2019s statutory rights under \u00a7 53-21-115(2), MCA. Constitutional issues aside, this statute plainly and unambiguously guarantees the right of the person against whom a petition is filed to be present at \u201cany hearing.\u201d The statute does not except out or exempt \u201cadministrative proceedings\u201d or, for that matter, any other hearing however the Court wants to denominate the proceeding. Our precedent requires that this Court \u201crigorously adhere to the standards\u201d expressed and the statutory rights accorded to persons subject to involuntary civil commitment. <em>In re Mental Health of K.G.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6 92, 306 Mont. 1, 29 P.3d 485. The Court has not followed that precedent here by creating, from whole cloth, an \u201cadministrative proceeding\u201d exemption from \u00a7 53-21-115(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">\u00b643 That said, I conclude that the error is harmless on the facts of this case. Given that the involuntary commitment proceeding was tried to the court, as opposed to a jury, I am not persuaded that T.J.F. was prejudiced by the court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u00b644 Additionally, if the person subject to an involuntary commitment proceeding is to be restrained in a court proceeding, I would adopt the same test that we adopted in <em>State v. Herrick, </em>2004 MT 323, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 324 Mont. 76, 101 P.3d 755, and re-affirmed in <em>State v. Merrill, </em>2008 MT 143, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20, 343 Mont. 130, 183 P.3d 56. The Court\u2019s standard, Opinion, \u00b6 28 (where the court is sitting without a jury, \u201cthere must be a showing on the record that restraints are needed before the [court] may order them\u201d), gives courts-especially when prodded by law enforcement-virtually unlimited discretion to order the person shackled or physically restrained. In my view, a person who are subject to an involuntary commitment proceedings has-and loses-virtually the same liberty and dignity interests that a criminal defendant has and loses as a result of a criminal proceeding. I would not, therefore, adopt a lesser standard for shackling or restraining a person subject to involuntary civil commitment than that required in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b645 Again, however, on the facts of this case, I am persuaded that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b646 Accordingly, I specially concur with the result reached in Issue 1, but not in all that is said.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
