(FCP), on the grounds that \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA or Act), bars Carol Walters\u2019 (Walters) survivorship and wrongful death claims against FCP arising from the work-related death of her son, Timothy Walters (Tim). The District Court also denied Walters\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment asserting that \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, and \u00a7 39-71-721(4), MCA, are unconstitutional. Walters appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in holding that Walters\u2019 claims were barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the WCA and denying her claim that \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, and \u00a7 39-71-721(4), MCA, were unconstitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">\u00b64 On December 14, 2006, Tim was tragically run over and crushed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>by a company forklift while engaged in his employment. The record indicates that Tim was treated by emergency personnel and taken to the hospital, dying later that day from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b65 At his death, Tim was 42 years old, was not married, and had no children. He resided with his mother, Carol Walters, but did not provide support to her in an amount which would qualify her as his dependent as defined by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, which is incorporated by \u00a7 39-71-116(4)(e), MCA (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b66 FCP provided workers\u2019 compensation coverage to its employees through the Montana Contractor Compensation Fund (MCCF). Pursuant to FCP\u2019s coverage, MCCF assumed responsibility for Tim\u2019s medical and hospital bills related to his treatment and death under \u00a7 39-71-704, MCA, his burial expenses up to $4,000 under \u00a7 39-71-725, MCA, and a $3,000 payment to Walters in her capacity as a non-dependent parent under \u00a7 39-71-721(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b67 Walters filed a complaint asserting survivorship and wrongful death claims against FCP, based upon alleged intentional and negligent acts and omissions by FCP. FCP moved for summary judgment on Walters\u2019 claims based upon the exclusive remedy rule stated in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. Walters conceded in response that she could not meet the heightened standard of proof necessary to establish an intentional injury claim which would circumvent the exclusive remedy rule, but she moved for partial summary judgment on the grounds that \u00a7 39-71-721(4), MCA (providing $3,000 payment to non-dependent parent) and \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA (exclusive remedy) were unconstitutional because the quid pro quo was not satisfied. Based on the asserted unconstitutionality of these provisions, Walters argued that her negligence claims against FCP should be permitted to proceed. The District Court denied Walters\u2019 constitutional challenges and granted FCP\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Walters appealed, and we granted motions from the Montana Trial Lawyers Association, the Montana Defense Trial Lawyers Association, and Montana State Fund to participate as amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u00b68 On appeal from a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>standard of review is de novo, and we apply the criteria set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Alexander v. Bozeman Motors, Inc., </em>2010 MT 135, \u00b6 15, 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (citation omitted). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, Inc. v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 349 Mont. 453, 203 P.3d 1283 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\">\u00b69 This Court\u2019s review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Rohlfs v. Klemenhagen, LLC, </em>2009 MT 440, \u00b6 7, 354 Mont. 133, 227 P.3d 42). The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law, and we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Rohlfs, </em>\u00b6 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b610 Walters broadly states her issue on appeal as: \u201cIs $3,000 for the death of a worker constitutional?\u201d Under this issue, Walters presents several arguments challenging provisions of the WCA. She argues that because Tim did not receive wage loss benefits, the quid pro quo upon which the Act is based is eliminated as to Tim, and because the $3,000 payment she received as a non-dependent parent is \u201cnot fair and balanced,\u201d the quid pro quo is eliminated as to her. Walters thus argues that the exclusive remedy provision, \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, should be set aside to allow her claims against FCP to proceed. She also argues that the challenged provisions of the WCA are fundamentally unfair and violate substantive due process. Walters\u2019 fairness arguments are overlapping, and she offers that \u201cworkers compensation quid pro quo is a due process analysis ....\u201d We considered quid pro quo as part of a substantive due process analysis in <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>2009 MT 368, \u00b6\u00b6 36-39, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566, but independent of substantive due process in <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County (Stratemeyer II), </em>276 Mont. 67, 74-79, 915 P.2d 175, 179-82 (1996). Here, we analyze the issue in both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"AO8\">\u00b611 The Montana Constitution sets forth the basis for the workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy provision. <em>Adsem v. Roske, </em>224 Mont. 269, 270-71, 728 P.2d 1352, 1353 (1986). Article II, Section 16 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj6j\">The administration of justice. Courts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for every injury of person, property, or character. <em>No person shall be deprived of this full legal redress for injury incurred in employment for which another person may be liable except as to fellow employees and his immediate employer who hired him if such immediate employer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>provides coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of this state. </em>Right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial, or delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 16 (emphasis added). This constitutional authority to deprive full legal redress by barring claims against employers who provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage \u201cis implemented by Section 39-71-411, MCA <em>....\"Adsem, </em>224 Mont. at 271, 728 P.2d at 1353. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\"><em>[A]n employer is not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act </em>or for any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person from whom damages are sought on account of such injuries or death. <em>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act binds the employee himself, and in case of death binds his personal representative and all persons having any right or claim to compensation for his injury or death, </em>as well as the employer and the servants and employees of such employer ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Section 39-71-411, MCA (emphasis added). In simple terms, this means that \u201cwhen an employee is injured in the work place due to negligence or accident, his remedy is exclusive to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Common law damages are not available under Section 39-71-411, MCA, for injuries negligently or accidentally inflicted by an employer. Negligence claims should be dismissed on this ground.\u201d <em>Sitzman v. Shumaker, </em>221 Mont. 304, 307, 718 P.2d 657, 659 (1986) (internal citation omitted). The exclusive remedy provision binds not only the employee himself, but \u201cin case of death binds his personal representative and all persons having any right or claim\u201d for his injury or death. Section 39-71-411, MCA; <em>see Money v. La. Pac. Corp., </em>2000 MT 366, \u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 398, 15 P.3d 962 (\u201c[T]he Act\u2019s exclusivity provision bars any third party action against an employer for compensation claimed \u2018as a result of or \u2018concerning\u2019 an employee\u2019s injury or death.\u201d). Thus, on its face, \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, bars all claims made here on behalf of Tim and Walters.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b612 The exclusive remedy is the benefit which employers are to receive from the quid pro quo compromise when they provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. Injured workers are to receive a no-fault recovery from the compromise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cThe purpose of the [WCA] is to protect both the employer and the employee by incorporating a <em>quid pro quo </em>for negligent acts by the employer. The employer is given immunity from suit by an employee who is injured on the job in return for relinquishing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>common law defenses. The employee is assured of compensation for his injuries, but foregoes legal recourse against the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE1\"><em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Bush Hog, LLC, </em>2009 MT 349, \u00b6 13, 353 Mont. 173, 219 P.3d 1249 (citation omitted); <em>accord Sitzman, </em>221 Mont, at 307-08, 718 P.2d at 659. As we explained in <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>\u201c[t]he exclusive remedy rule is perhaps the most firmly entrenched doctrine in workers\u2019 compensation law. The rationale for adopting workers\u2019 compensation legislation was to guarantee workers with work-related injuries some form of compensation in exchange for relinquishing any potential tort claims against their employers.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont, at 74, 915 P.2d at 179 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b613 Walters argues that the quid pro quo bargain upon which the exclusive remedy is premised does not exist in this case, relying upon our decision in <em>Stratemeyer II. </em>Stratemeyer suffered a mental injury known as a \u201cmental-mental\u201d injury in his employment as a deputy sheriff. <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont, at 70, 75-76, 915 P.2d at 176, 180. We noted that \u201cit is unequivocally clear that mental injuries, such as Stratemeyer\u2019s, are beyond the scope of coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d and Stratemeyer had \u201cno possibility of recovery\u201d under the Act. <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont, at 76, 915 P.2d at 180. We thus concluded that \u201cthere is no quid pro quo for workers who suffer \u2018mental-mental\u2019 injuries.... Absent the quid pro quo, the exclusive remedy cannot stand, and the employer is thus exposed to potential tort liability.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont, at 76, 915 P.2d at 180 (citations omitted). Stated conversely, \u201c[t]he exclusive remedy rule applies only if the injury suffered by the worker is covered by the Act.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont, at 78, 915 P.2d at 181 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A_E\">\u00b614 FCP argues that, unlike the claimant in <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>Tim suffered an injury which is covered and compensable as defined by the Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-119(1), MCA (\u201c\u2018Injury\u2019 or \u2018injured\u2019 means: (a) internal or external physical harm to the body ... (c) death.\u201d). Unlike Stratemeyer, who could never be eligible for coverage, Tim\u2019s covered injury gave him \u201csome possibility of recovery,\u201d <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont, at 75, 915 P.2d at 179, and thus the quid pro quo and exclusive remedy remain existent. Tim\u2019s estate was not left with \u201cno possibility of recovery.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont. at 76, 915 P.2d at 180. FCP\u2019s argument is supported by our decision in <em>Maney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b615 Maney was the mother of Jason Fogleson, an employee killed while working, and she brought tort claims against Fogleson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Maney, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. The district court granted summary judgment to the employer based on the exclusive remedy rule of the WCA. <em>Maney, </em>\u00b6 7. We began by noting that \u201cthe initial inquiry in determining whether the \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, exclusive remedy provision applies is whether the employee suffered an \u2018injury\u2019 as defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA.\u201d <em>Maney, </em>\u00b6 16. We reasoned that, unlike the claimants in <em>Stratemeyer II </em>and other similar holdings, Fogleson\u2019s \u201cphysical injury and death were compensable injuries under the Act, thus bringing into play the exclusive remedy provision.\u201d <em>Maney, </em>\u00b6 16. We also concluded the mother\u2019s \u201cindependent tort\u201d claims were likewise precluded by the exclusive remedy provision. <em>Maney, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 26. Addressing the exclusive remedy statute, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">[Section] 39-71-411, MCA, provides that \u201can employer is not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the ... Act....\u201d <em>This language is clear and unequivocal. An employer has no liability for an employee\u2019s work-related injury or death which is compensable under the Act. </em>The statute then states that, in case of an employee\u2019s death, the Act binds \u201call persons having any right or claim to compensation for his injury or death....\u201d This also is clear and unequivocal. In the case of an employee\u2019s death, the employer has no liability for any claim of any person for that injury and death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><em>Maney, </em>\u00b6 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b616 Like the injured worker <em>inManey, </em>Tim sustained an injury which was covered and compensable under the Act. Thus, the claims made here for Tim\u2019s injury are distinguishable from those made in <em>Stratemeyer II </em>in the same manner as the claims made in <em>Maney. </em>The basis for the Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Stratemeyer II </em>that the quid pro quo had failed-that the Act provided no coverage for the injury-is not present in this case. Tim\u2019s injury was covered by the Act, and he had \u201csome possibility of recovery.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont, at 75, 915 P.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b617 Walters also argues that the quid pro quo should be deemed to be nonexistent here because the amount of benefits paid under the Act is insufficient to sustain the bargain. She argues that \u201cthe Act is only viable if it is fair,\u201d and that, here, \u201cthe \u2018bargain\u2019 is not fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>balanced.\u201d However, beyond <em>Stratemeyer, </em>distinguished above, Walters offers no authority to support the proposition that the quid pro quo can be challenged on a stand-alone \u201cfair and balanced\u201d theory. She cites Article II, Section 16 as incorporating the quid pro quo, but that section does not address the quid pro quo directly and provides no mandates concerning its content. Walters\u2019 argument that the quid pro quo is unfair and unreasonable is properly considered as part of her substantive due process challenge, which tests \u201cthe reasonableness of a statute in relation to the State\u2019s power to enact such legislation.\u201d <em>Raisler v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co., </em>219 Mont. 254, 263, 717 P.2d 535, 541 (1985). She argues that the \u201cConstitution mandates fairness,\u201d and that an unfair benefit payment renders the quid pro quo and the exclusive remedy unconstitutional, citing <em>N.Y. Central R.R. Co. v. White, </em>243 U.S. 188, 205-06, 37 S. Ct. 247, 254 (1917) (noting the possibility of criticism \u201con the ground that the compensation prescribed by the statute in question is unreasonable in amount\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">\u00b618 We have explained substantive due process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201cThe essence of substantive due process is that the State cannot use its police power to take unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious action against an individual. In order to satisfy substantive due process guarantees, a statute enacted under a state\u2019s police power must be reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az0\"><em>Town &amp; Country Foods, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Raisler, </em>219 Mont, at 263, 717 P.2d at 541); <em>accord Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 33. \u201cSubstantive due process primarily examines underlying substantive rights and remedies to determine whether restrictions are unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose of a government body in enacting a statute, ordinance or regulation.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, </em>\u00b6 17 (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n essence, substantive due process analysis requires that we decide (1) whether the legislation in question is related to a legitimate governmental concern, and (2) that the means chosen by the Legislature to accomplish its objective are reasonably related to the result sought to be <em>attained.\u201dPlumb v. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>279 Mont. 363, 372, 927 P.2d 1011, 1016 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b619 FCP objects to Walters\u2019 substantive due process claim on the ground that Walters cannot \u201cmeet the threshold showing of a protected property interest.\u201d Relying primarily on <em>Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, 332 Mont. 303, 137 P.3d 545, FCP argues that it is \u201cbeyond dispute\u201d that a substantive due process claim necessitates a threshold showing of a constitutionally protected property interest, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>District Court properly denied the claim on this basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfX\">\u00b620 In Germann, the plaintiff brought procedural and substantive due process claims, as well as federal and state takings and equal protection claims, against the City of Whitefish and City officials. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 17, 25. In discussing due process, we did not distinguish between substantive and procedural claims, stating generally and without specific analysis that \u201c[s\u00edtate due process and takings claims likewise require the plaintiff to first establish that it has a property interest.\u201d Germann, \u00b6 27. As support for this statement, we cited <em>Montana Media, Inc. v. Flathead County, </em>2003 MT 23, \u00b6 65, 314 Mont. 121, 63 P.3d 1129, a procedural due process case. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b621 The due process guarantee \u201chas both a procedural and a substantive component.\u201d <em>State v. Egdorf, </em>2003 MT 264, \u00b6 19, 317 Mont. 436, 77 P.3d 517. We have differentiated between these components as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">The process requirement necessary to satisfy procedural due process comes into play only after a showing that a property or liberty interest exists. <em>ISC Distributors, Inc. v. Trevor </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 185,191, 903 P.2d 170,173. Substantive due process bars arbitrary governmental actions regardless of the procedures used to implement them and serves as a check on oppressive governmental action. <em>Englin v. Bd. of County Com\u2019rs, </em>2002 MT 115, \u00b6 14, 310 Mont. 1, \u00b6 14, 48 P.3d 39, \u00b6 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\"><em>Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 19. Consistent with this description, we have noted that \u201c \u2018[e]ven though a plaintiff may have no property or liberty interest grounded in state law which is protected from arbitrary government action, such action still may be subject to review under substantive due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Powell v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 321, \u00b6 28, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877 <em>(quotingNewville v. State, Dept. of Fam. Servs., </em>267 Mont. 237, 249, 883 P.2d 793, 800 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b622 We find it incongruent for FCP to argue on the one hand that there was an exchange of interests sufficient to satisfy the quid pro quo bargain supporting the exclusive remedy, but to argue on the other hand that Walters lacks an interest sufficient to test whether the quid pro quo bargain satisfied substantive due process. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Walters has demonstrated an interest which is sufficient to bring her challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">\u00b623 Walters asserts that the failure to pay wage loss benefits for Tim, and payment of the small benefit of $3,000 to her, is insufficient to sustain the quid pro quo. She argues that, under Article II, Section 16 of the Constitution, an employer must provide wage loss benefits, offering that \u201c[t]here were no wage loss benefits paid to Tim after his death, so there was no quid pro quo between Tim and his employer.\u201d As to the $3,000 payment made to her, Walters argues that it bears no relationship to the amount of wages lost, to the public policy of promoting safety in the workplace, and there is no \u201cpermissible objective in providing that, in the event a worker dies without a spouse or dependents, his death is worth $3,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b624 Walters\u2019 arguments about the sufficiency of the benefits are focused, primarily, on the failure of FCP\u2019s coverage to provide wage loss payments. FCP and its amici criticize Walters\u2019 approach as a \u201csingle benefit impeachment\u201d of the Act and ask that we reject her \u201cmicroscopic\u201d inquiry in favor of a broader review of the overall compensation scheme, noting that our decision in <em>Satterlee </em>did not turn on eligibility for one particular benefit: \u201c[Wjhile the claimant who suffers a work related injury after becoming eligible for SSRI may not be able to qualify for PTD benefits, he or she is still eligible for benefits of sufficient significance to satisfy the <em>quid pro quo </em>principle.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b625 We are not persuaded by Walters\u2019 arguments that we are bound to look only at wage loss benefits in analyzing the quid pro quo issue. Wage loss benefits are important and serve an important purpose under the Act, but are not the only benefit provided by the Act. It is appropriate to consider these other benefits Tim may have been eligible to receive, as we did in <em>Satterlee. </em>Walters argues that wage loss benefits are mandated by Article II, Section 16, but that provision refers generally to employers providing \u201ccoverage,\u201d not wage loss benefits. However, on the other hand, testing the quid pro quo by considering the total sum of all benefits paid under the Act to all injured workers, as posited by FCP, would be an overly broad inquiry rendering an individual quid pro quo challenge futile. Therefore, we begin by considering the Act\u2019s purposes and provisions with regard to a worker who suffers an injury causing death during the course of his or her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b626 The Act provides for payment of a deceased worker\u2019s medical and hospital expenses related to his injury and death. Sections 39-71-704; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>39-71-736(l)(b), MCA. The Act provides for payment of burial expenses of a deceased worker, up to $4,000. Section 39-71-725, MCA. Compensation for an injury causing death is governed by \u00a7 39-71-721, MCA, which incorporates the categories of beneficiaries defined in \u00a7 39-71-116, MCA. Subsection 721(2) provides wage loss benefits to a deceased worker\u2019s surviving spouse \u201cliving with or legally entitled to be supported by the deceased\u201d; an unmarried child of the deceased under 18 years of age; an unmarried child under 22 years of age who is a full-time student or enrolled in an apprenticeship program; and an invalid child over 18 years of age who satisfies the federal statutory definition of dependency. Sections 39-71-721(2); 39-71-116(4)(a)-(d), MCA. If the deceased worker has none of these family members, then subsection 721(3) provides wage loss benefits to a dependent brother or sister under the age of 18 years, or to a dependent parent, again as defined by federal statute. Sections 39-71-721(3); 39-71-116(4)(e)-(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b627  Tim had none of these dependents. Although she was Tim\u2019s parent, Walters did not satisfy the federal definition of dependency incorporated into the Act which would have entitled her to wage loss payments. She thus received the payment provided by subsection 721(4), a lump sum payment of $3,000 paid to \u201cthe decedent\u2019s surviving parent or parents.\u201d Section 39-71-721(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b628 Walters\u2019 arguments fairly include both a facial and as-applied challenge to these provisions, and our analysis encompasses both. Though \u201c\u2018[t]he purpose of the legislation does not have to appear on the face of the legislation or in the legislative history, but may be any possible purpose of which the court can conceive,\u201d\u2019 <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 34 (citation omitted), the Act expresses numerous purposes, and we have noted in previous cases the general governmental concerns underlying the WCA. The workers\u2019 compensation system is \u201cintended to be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates.\u201d Section 39-71-105(4), MCA. The system is designed \u201cto provide, without regard to fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease.... at a reasonable cost to the employer.\u201d Section 39-71-105(1), MCA. We have noted a purpose to \u201cpromote the continued economic welfare of employers who pay into the State Fund and the welfare of employees who receive compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Raisler, </em>219 Mont. at 264, 717 P.2d at 541. We have identified improving the financial viability of the system, controlling costs of the system, and providing benefits as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201clegitimate governmental objective[s].\u201d <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln Co. (Stratemeyer I), 259 </em>Mont. 147, 155, 855 P.2d 506, 511 (1993). We have further noted that the quid pro quo itself serves legitimate purposes, providing \u201cno fault recovery\u201d for workers and \u201cpredictability of consistent workers compensation payments\u201d for the employer. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">\u00b629 We have held that \u2018\u201c[t]he power of the legislature to fix [the] amounts, time and manner of payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits is not doubted.\u2019\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting <em>Ingraham v. Champion Intl., </em>243 Mont. 42, 48, 793 P.2d 769, 772 (1990)). Here, the Legislature created a framework whereby medical, hospital, and burial benefits are paid for all deceased workers, but wage loss benefits are paid only to the worker\u2019s dependents-his or her surviving spouse, children, or other relatives. The challenged statutes evidence a legislative intention to manage resources by paying wage loss benefits only to those people who are dependent upon the deceased worker\u2019s wages. Spouses and minor children are automatically provided for, while other relatives, such as adult children, siblings, and parents, must satisfy dependency requirements before they can receive the deceased worker\u2019s wage benefits. As in <em>Satterlee, </em>where we said it was not irrational that the Legislature may have decided to protect \u201cthe most vulnerable claimants, those who do not qualify for SSRI\u201d by allowing them to continue to receive PTD benefits even after they reached the age at which they would otherwise lose the benefit, here the Legislature clearly intended to limit wage loss benefits to people who depended upon the worker\u2019s wages-those who were made \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d by reason of a worker\u2019s death. <em>See Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b630 Walters\u2019 arguments focus on the small amount she received and, without question, the amount is minimal. However, she overlooks the overall purposes of the statutes addressing deceased workers, which provide medical, hospital, and burial benefits to all deceased workers, and provide wage benefits for a deceased worker\u2019s dependents. Here, she ignores a critical fact-she is not a dependent. She offers no challenge to the Act\u2019s method of determining dependency, arguing only that the benefit she received was insufficient. She offers no explanation about why the Legislature\u2019s determination to pay wage loss only to dependents, and to provide a small payment to non-dependents, in addition to the other benefits provided, is unreasonable. As has been noted to the contrary, about the need to protect dependents: \u201c\u2018the [workers\u2019 compensation] award itself is completely cut off in most jurisdictions when, through the death of the worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>without dependents, for example, there is no further need to worry about anyone\u2019s becoming destitute.\u2019\u201d 1 A. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 2.60, 12-13 (1990), as quoted in <em>Yarchak v. Munford, Inc., </em>570 So. 2d 648, 650 (Ala. 1990). (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"A3h\">\u00b631 <em>Taylor v. Southeast-Harrison Western Corp., </em>694 P.2d 1160 (Alaska 1985), involved the death of a worker who had no statutory dependents. His estate brought an action for his wrongful death, challenging the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act on equal protection grounds. <em>Taylor, </em>694 P.2d at 1161. The Alaska Supreme Court noted an \u201coverwhelming weight of authority\u201d upholding the exclusive remedy provision for non-dependents, <em>Taylor, </em>694 P.2d at 1162, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">Here the legislature has chosen to provide greater compensation to the estates of those deceased workers leaving dependents, <em>i.e. </em>persons, such as children and spouses, who are generally dependent, at least in part, upon the deceased worker\u2019s salary for their own support. The fact that they are entitled to favored treatment, over the estates of workers leaving no dependents, reflects a legislative determination that the former require greater compensation, because of the need to replace the income that provided support for those dependent upon the deceased worker prior to his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><em>Taylor, </em>694 P.2d at 1162. The Court concluded that this legislative determination was reasonable, and the Act did not violate equal protection. <em>Taylor, </em>694 P.2d at 1162-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b632 We have stated the burden to be satisfied in constitutional challenges to legislation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">\u201cThe constitutionality of a legislative enactment is prima facie presumed, and every intendment in its favor will be presumed, unless its unconstitutionality appears beyond a reasonable doubt. The question of constitutionality is not whether it is possible to condemn, but whether it is possible to uphold the legislative action which will not be declared invalid unless it conflicts with the constitution, in the judgment of the court, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\"><em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Stratemeyer </em>1, 259 Mont, at 150, 855 P.2d at 508-09). The party challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality carries the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Henry v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 449, 982 P.2d 456). If there is any doubt as to constitutionality, the resolution must be made in favor of the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\">\u00b633 We have noted that \u201c[a]s with all legislative compromises, the WCA is not infallible and the legislative decisions made in adopting the WCA are subject to honest debate.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 37. We certainly concur with that statement here. It is easy to opine that the Legislature could have done better in providing for family members after a worker\u2019s death, even those who are non-dependents of the worker. Work-related death is traumatic, final, and adversely impacts a family forever. However, the law requires us to recognize that \u201csuch a debate involves issues and decisions about public policy that are clearly of the sort much better suited to the halls of the legislature.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b634  We conclude that the Act, in providing medical, hospital, and burial benefits, and providing wage loss benefits only to dependents of deceased workers, while providing a minimal payment to a non-dependent parent, is rationally related<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the recognized legitimate government objectives of the Act. Out of available resources, the Legislature logically directed wage loss benefits to those persons who depended upon them, and paid a small amount to those who did not. Under the challenge presented here, the Act was not arbitrary or unreasonable, and satisfied substantive due process and the quid pro quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICE MORRIS and DISTRICT JUDGE LANGTON, sitting for former JUSTICE LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> The 2005 version of the WCA applies. <em>See Heisler v.

However, I join the Court\u2019s Opinion because the quid pro quo extends to injured workers and their beneficiaries, as defined in the Workers Compensation Act. It does not extend to persons who are not beneficiaries of the deceased worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b637 No one can dispute that the benefits available under the Act do not make injured workers-or their beneficiaries-whole. The Act acknowledges as much at \u00a7 39-71-105(1), MCA. Although the 2011 legislative session is not yet over, it appears we may see even greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>limitations placed on benefits. All this being so, I cannot conclude that loading what benefits are available towards workers and their beneficiaries, and away from non-beneficiaries and non-dependent relatives, is irrational. It is a matter of allocation of resources in favor of those who stand to suffer the most financially from the worker\u2019s injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b638 Justice Nelson may well be correct in observing that we will someday be presented with a case establishing that the quid pro quo no longer exists. In my judgment, this is not that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b639 I therefore concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b384-6\">JUSTICE WHEAT</author>\n<p id=\"ASH\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b640 I dissent. In my opinion, the unavailability of wage loss benefits to a non-dependent parent violates the <em>quid pro quo </em>that supports the WCA. Furthermore, the $3,000 death benefit that is available to a non-dependent parent is unreasonable and also violates the <em>quid pro quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATX\">\u00b641 Under the Act, the legislature has used \u201cdependency\u201d as a cut-off point for the recovery of wage loss benefits. Although Carol was partially dependent on Tim's wages, she did not meet the statutory definition, so her benefits were limited to a payment of $3,000. This paltry amount has no reasonable correlation to Tim's actual lost future earnings, which were nearly $800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b642 If Tim had been killed in a car crash caused by another person\u2019s negligence, Carol, as the personal representative, would have been able to recover damages in a survival action pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-501, MCA, including the present value of Tim\u2019s lost future earnings. The survival action is personal to the decedent and any damages recovered belong to the decedent\u2019s estate and are distributable to the heirs of the decedent. <em>See Swanson v. Champion Intl. Corp., </em>197 Mont. 509, 515, 646 P.2d 1166, 1169 (1982); <em>Payne v. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2002 MT 313, \u00b6 7, 313 Mont. 118, 60 P.3d 469. The complete denial of future wage loss benefits to Tim\u2019s estate violates the <em>quid pro quo </em>and should remove the exclusivity protection under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\u00b643 In my opinion, if there are no \u201cdependency\u201d beneficiaries, as defined by the Act, then the wage loss benefits that would have been available to a defined beneficiary should go to the decedent\u2019s estate for distribution to the heirs or as directed by his or her will. I cannot imagine that a working person being asked to give up what could be recovered in a survival action in exchange for worker\u2019s compensation benefits (the <em>quid pro </em>quo) would not want it this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">\u00b644 I would reverse the District Court and find that the <em>quid pro quo </em>was violated in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b385-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AW0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">\u00b645 I agree with Justice Wheat\u2019s Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b646 Article II, Section 16 of Montana\u2019s Constitution guarantees to all Montanans, as a fundamental right,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that courts of justice shall be open to every person; that speedy remedy shall be afforded for every injury of person, property, or character; and that right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial, or delay. Coverage under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Title 39, chapter 71, MCA) provides the sole exception to these fundamental constitutional guarantees. This exception is premised on the existence of a real, bona fide, quid pro quo. And when the quid pro quo ceases to exist as a practical matter-that is, when it no longer fairly balances what employers and injured workers are getting for what they are giving up-the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act exception to Article II, Section 16 is no longer met. While the Legislature has the power to determine and adjust the specifics of the quid pro quo from time to time, that body does not have the power to effectively abrogate it without destroying the constitutional exception itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b647 This case may not be <em>the </em>case which raises that issue. But, given the direction of workers\u2019 compensation reform, there will likely come a case which presents this Court with the issue of whether the whole Workers Compensation Act, or significant parts of it, has been rendered unconstitutional under Article II, Section 16 because, as a practical matter, the quid pro quo no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b648 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> <em>Walker v.
