We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by enjoining Forbes from further construction on his property when the City initiated its injunction proceedings without filing a complaint and serving summons?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b64 Was <em>Forbes entitled to a jury trial on the City\u2019s application for an injunction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b65 The City issued a Stop Work Order to Forbes in June 2009 because a construction project on his property violated City zoning requirements. Forbes admittedly had not obtained the required City building permit. Forbes failed to heed the Stop Work Order. The City petitioned the District Court on August 28, 2009, for an injunction under \u00a7\u00a7 27-19-201 and -301, MCA, that would prohibit Forbes from further construction. Forbes received service of the City\u2019s petition. The court set a hearing date and served Forbes with notice. Forbes filed response briefs on September 1, 2009, and September 14, 2009. The court held hearings on the injunction request in October 2009 and March 2010. The court enjoined Forbes from further construction without the requisite building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\u00b66 Forbes admitted that he had been doing construction work on a structure within the city limits of Great Falls. Forbes claimed that his construction project involved a \u201cmobile home,\u201d however, and that the City\u2019s zoning regulations did not apply to his construction. The court rejected Forbes\u2019s \u201cmobile home\u201d exception. The court found that the construction work had occurred on-site and that the construction had involved replacing the foundation and constructing a roof supported by walls. The court determined that Forbes\u2019s construction project met the definition of a \u201cbuilding\u201d and that Forbes\u2019s construction project required a building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">\u00b67 The court concluded that the City had authority to adopt property and zoning codes to promote health, safety and the general welfare of the community. Section 76-2-301, MCA. Pursuant to this authority, the City had adopted the Official Code of the City of Great Falls (Code). The City had also adopted the 2006 International Residential Code for determining whether to deny or approve a building permit. The Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>requires property owners to obtain building permits prior to beginning on-site construction of buildings within the city limits. Pursuant to the Code and \u00a7 76-2-308(2), MCA, the City had authority to issue the Stop Work Order for Forbes\u2019s unpermitted work.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b68 The court granted the City\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction. The court ordered Forbes to obtain a permit from the City before commencing construction at the site. The court ordered that the City could demolish Forbes\u2019s construction if he had failed to obtain a building permit within 180 calendar days.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b69 We will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction barring a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Yockey v. Kearns Props., LLC, </em>2005 MT 27, \u00b6 12, 326 Mont. 28, 106 P.3d 1185. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by enjoining Forbes from further construction on his property when the City initiated its injunction proceedings without filing a complaint and serving summons?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b611 Forbes contends that the City improperly commenced the proceeding by filing the application and giving notice, rather than filing a complaint and causing summons to be issued. He contends that if the City would have properly filed a complaint, he would have been entitled to a jury trial on the injunction issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\u00b6 12 Section 27-19-201(1), MCA, provides that a preliminary injunction may be granted \u201cwhen it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually.\u201d Section 27-19-301(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[n]o preliminary injunction may be issued without reasonable notice to the adverse party of the time and place of the making of the application therefor.\u201d The court receiving an application for injunction must \u201cmake an order requiring cause to be shown, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted.\u201d Section 27-19-301(2), MCA. A preliminary injunction may be granted upon affidavits or oral testimony at the hearing. Section 27-19-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\u00b613 The Legislature amended the statutes governing applications for preliminary injunctions in 1979.1979 Mont. Laws 992-96. Section 27-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>19-301, MCA (1978), had provided that an injunction could be issued at the discretion of the court with or without notice \u201cunless the defendant has answered.\u201d Section 27-19-303, MCA (1978), had provided that the preliminary injunction could be granted \u201cat the time of issuing the summons upon the complaint or at any time afterward.\u201d Further, a preliminary injunction could \u201cnot be granted on the complaint alone\u201d unless it was \u201cduly verified\u201d and the material allegations of the complaint were made \u201cpositively and not upon information and belief.\u201d Section 27-19-303, MCA (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b614 The 1979 amendments repealed these express references that had connected preliminary injunctions to civil actions commenced by complaint, summons, and answer. The 1979 amendments allowed applications for preliminary injunctions upon notice to the opposing party. The legislative history of the 1979 amendments additionally indicates that an injunction could be issued upon application and notice without filing a complaint and issuing summons. The amendments as presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee proposed to \u201crevise the statutes regarding the procedure for obtaining and dissolving or modifying preliminary injunctions.\u201d Mont. Sen. 243 (Feb. 3, 1979). Specifically, the amendments proposed to allow a party to obtain an injunction \u201cwithout filing a lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b615  The City filed an application for injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA. Forbes does not contend that the City failed to serve him with notice or that the court failed to provide him with a show cause hearing. Forbes cites no statute or case law that requires the City to file a complaint and serve summons in order to obtain a preliminary injunction. We conclude that the City followed the proper procedure under \u00a7\u00a7 27-19-301 and -303, MCA, by filing an application for an injunction, requesting that the District Court set a hearing date, and providing reasonable notice to Forbes.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b616 <em>Was Forbes entitled to a jury trial on the City\u2019s application for an injunction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b617 Section 27-19-101, MCA, provides that an injunction order may be granted \u201cby the court.\u201d Both \u00a7 27-19-301(2), MCA, and \u00a7 27-19-303(2), MCA, indicate that the court grants or denies an application for a preliminary injunction. Section 50-60-109, MCA, provides that a \u201cjudge of the district court\u201d may enjoin the unpermitted construction of buildings within the court\u2019s judicial district.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b618  No right to a jury trial for a purely equitable action exists in Montana. <em>Supola v. Mont. Dept. of Justice, </em>278 Mont. 421, 425, 925 P.2d 480, 482 (1996). A party has a right to a jury trial only on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>legal claims even in litigation involving both equitable and legal claims. <em>Gray v. City of Billings, </em>213 Mont. 6, 12-14, 689 P.2d 268, 272 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b619 Forbes acknowledges that a proceeding on an application for a preliminary injunction proceeds in equity, that Montana law provides no right to a jury trial in a preliminary injunction proceeding, and that \u201c[n]o jury at the injunction hearing was expected.\u201d Forbes does not contend that the District Court improperly determined contested issues of fact. Forbes argues, nonetheless, that had the City filed a complaint, he would have had a legal right to a jury trial. We already have concluded that the City need not have filed a complaint and affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that these equitable proceedings on the City\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction did not entitle Forbes to a jury trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
