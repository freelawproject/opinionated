We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the officers\u2019 conduct exceeded the scope of Pearson\u2019s traffic stop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the officers inevitably would have discovered the evidence obtained in the officers\u2019 unwarranted second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u00b65 The State of Montana (State) charged Pearson with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, and operating a motor vehicle without proof of insurance. The charges stem from a routine traffic stop that led to a search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack and car. Officer LaMantia (LaMantia) and his field training officer, Officer Kristj anson (Kristj anson), stopped Pearson after they had observed Pearson driving with a broken tail light.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">\u00b66 Pearson pulled into a parking lot and parked his car instead of pulling to the side of the road. The officers watched Pearson make furtive movements in the car as LaMantia approached. The officers testified that Pearson had appeared to stretch across the passenger seat. Kristjanson feared that Pearson may have been reaching for a weapon. Kristjanson also saw a \u201cmeth watch\u201d sticker in the car window. Kristjanson testified that he knew that users of methamphetamine often put \u201cmeth watch\u201d stickers on their cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\u00b67 When LaMantia approached the car he saw Pearson clutching a large wad of cash in his hands. LaMantia also discovered that Pearson did not have any insurance for the car and that his registration had expired. LaMantia returned to his patrol car and explained Pearson\u2019s odd behavior to Kristjanson. Officer Kristjanson ran a search on Pearson\u2019s license that revealed that Pearson was on probation and had a drug history.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">\u00b68 Kristjanson approached the car and asked Pearson to put down the wad of money and step out of the car. Pearson stepped out of the car and the officers removed his fanny pack. Kristjanson patted down Pearson and searched his fanny pack for weapons. Kristjanson did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>find any weapons or contraband. Shortly after searching the fanny pack Kristjanson looked into Pearson\u2019s car and saw a can of pepper spray in plain view near the driver\u2019s seat by the center console. Kristjanson knew that probationers lawfully cannot possess a weapon, including pepper spray. Kristjanson handcuffed and detained Pearson for the probation violation and placed him in the patrol car. Kristjanson attempted to contact Pearson\u2019s probation officer, Officer Pinnick (Pinnick).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b69 Pearson gave the officers written consent to search his car. Officer Vickery (Vickery) assisted Kristjanson and LaMantia with the search. The officers found drug paraphernalia in Pearson\u2019s car. Vickery also found a bindle of methamphetamine during a second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack. Kristjanson reached Pinnick by telephone while still at the scene, but after the officers already had searched Pearson\u2019s car and fanny pack. Pinnick authorized a probation violation hold on Pearson. The officers transported Pearson to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b610 Pearson moved to suppress the evidence obtained in the searches. The District Court denied Pearson\u2019s motion to suppress. The court concluded that officer safety concerns justified the first search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack. The court similarly determined that Pearson\u2019s written consent justified the officers\u2019 search of his car. The court also held that the officers\u2019 second search of the fanny pack constituted an unlawful search. The court declined, however, to suppress the methamphetamine found during the second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack. The court determined that either a subsequent probation search authorized by Pinnick or a routine inventory search at the detention center would have led officers to discover the methamphetamine. Pearson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law for correctness to determine whether the district court correctly ruled on a motion to suppress evidence. <em>State v. Hurlbert, </em>2009 MT 221, \u00b6 16, 351 Mont. 316, 211 P.3d 869. This Court conducts plenary review of the district court\u2019s application of the law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the officers\u2019 conduct exceeded the scope of Pearson\u2019s traffic stop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u00b613 Pearson does not challenge the lawfulness of the officers\u2019 initial investigatory stop of his car for the broken tail light. Pearson argues instead that the officers exceeded the scope of an otherwise lawful investigatory stop. An investigative traffic stop may not last longer than necessary for the officer to effectuate the purpose of the stop. Section 46-5-403, MCA; <em>Hurlbert, </em>\u00b6 21. Additional objective data of wrongdoing that gives rise to further suspicions may enlarge the scope of a routine traffic stop. <em>Hurlbert, \u00b6 </em>21 (citing <em>State v. Case, </em>2007 MT 161, \u00b6 34, 338 Mont. 87, 162 P.3d 849).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b614 An officer stopped the defendant in <em>Hurlbert </em>for speeding. The officer observed that Hurlbert appeared uneasy and exhibited nervous behavior such as shaking, sweating, rapidly smoking a cigarette, and constantly moving. Hurlbert told the officer that he had been visiting his parents, but could not remember their address. The officer asked Hurlbert whether he had any illegal drugs in the car. The officer eventually obtained consent to search the car. Hurlbert argued that the officer\u2019s questioning after the stop unlawfully had expanded the scope of the traffic stop to the point that any evidence obtained thereafter should have been suppressed. We concluded that the officer had observed sufficient additional evidence that served to enlarge the scope of the investigation and that the officer properly had questioned Hurlbert about the contents of the car. <em>Hurlbert, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b615 Kristjanson and LaMantia testified that they had observed unusual behavior after they had stopped Pearson for a broken tail light. This unusual behavior had raised the officers\u2019 suspicions. Pearson pulled off the road and into a parking spot instead of pulling over on the side of the road. Pearson jerked about nervously in the car and appeared to reach to the passenger seat for what Kristjanson feared might have been a weapon. Both officers saw Pearson tightly gripping a wad of cash in his hand. Kristjanson saw a \u201cmeth watch\u201d sticker in the rear window of the car, and suspected illegal drug use. A check on Pearson\u2019s driver license revealed that he was on probation and had a drug history.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b616 These articulable facts obtained after the initial stop for a broken tail light supported the officers\u2019 suspicion that Pearson might have weapons or contraband in his car. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. This suspicion properly served to enlarge the scope of Pearson\u2019s traffic stop and justified the officers\u2019 additional questioning. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the officers inevitably would have discovered the evidence obtained in the officers\u2019 unwarranted second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u00b618 The Montana and U.S. Constitutions deem warrantless searches per se unreasonable unless a warrant exception applies. <em>Hurlbert, </em>\u00b6 19. Officers do not need a warrant for an investigative stop and frisk, for an administrative post-arrest inventory search, or for a search authorized by consent. Section 46-5-401, MCA; <em>State v. Hilgendorf, </em>2009 MT 158, \u00b6 26, 350 Mont. 412, 208 P.3d 401; <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 269, \u00b6 9, 323 Mont. 157, 99 P.3d 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b619 An officer may frisk a person whose car lawfully has been stopped and may take other reasonably necessary steps for protection if the officer reasonably believes that the person is armed and dangerous. Section 46-5-40l(2)(b), MCA; <em>State v. Gopher, </em>193 Mont. 189, 194, 631 P.2d 293, 296 (1981). Kristjanson testified that he saw Pearson reach across the passenger seat after he had stopped Pearson\u2019s car. Kristjanson also testified that he thought that Pearson might have been reaching for a weapon. Kristjanson frisked Pearson and searched his fanny pack for weapons for officer safety reasons. Kristjanson\u2019s initial search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack constituted a lawful investigative stop and frisk. Section 46-5-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b620 Kristjanson saw Pearson\u2019s pepper spray in the front seat of his car in plain view shortly after he had conducted the investigative stop and frisk. Kristjanson knew from his check of Pearson\u2019s license that Pearson was on probation. Kristjanson placed Pearson in handcuffs and escorted him to the patrol car. Kristjanson informed Pearson that he needed to contact Pearson\u2019s probation officer and asked the operator for Pinnick\u2019s phone number. Pearson then gave the officers written consent to search his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b621 Pearson does not challenge whether he voluntarily consented to the search. Pearson also does not argue that the officers\u2019 failure to <em>Mirandize </em>him violated his rights. Pearson argues instead that he consented only to a search of his car, and, therefore, the second search of his fanny pack constituted an unlawful search. He argues that the Court should suppress any evidence obtained from the unlawful second search.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b622 Pearson\u2019s written consent gave the officers permission to search only his car. Vickery conducted an unwarranted second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack that revealed a bindle of methamphetamine. The officers did not have a warrant or warrant exception to support the second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack. We agree with the District Court that the officers exceeded their authority when they searched Pearson\u2019s fanny pack for a second time. The District Court concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>however, that the doctrine of inevitable discovery applied and thereby rendered admissible the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b623 The court determined that the officers inevitably would have discovered the bindle of methamphetamine either during a search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack authorized by Pearson\u2019s probation officer, or during an inventory search at the detention center after the officers had transported Pearson there for a probation violation based on the pepper spray. We do not address whether Pinnick\u2019s \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d authorization of a probationary search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack and car would have justified the unlawful search. We focus instead on whether the officers inevitably would have discovered the methamphetamine during an inventory search at the detention center after the officers had detained Pearson for the probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b624 The exclusionary rule excludes evidence unlawfully obtained from a search without a warrant or warrant exception. <em>Hilgendorf, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Wong Sun v. U.S., </em>371 U.S. 471, 484-85, 83 S. Ct. 407, 416 (1963)); \u00a7 46-13-302, MCA. The exclusionary rule does not apply, however, if the unlawfully obtained evidence would have been discovered despite the unlawful government intrusion. <em>Hilgendorf, </em>\u00b6 24. The Court generally applies the doctrine of inevitable discovery when investigatory procedures already were in progress and the lawful investigation eventually would have revealed the evidence. <em>See Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 449-50, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 2511-12 (1984). This Court has made clear that it must appear \u201cas certainly as night follows day\u201d that the evidence would have been discovered without reference to the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Hilgendorf, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>State v. Dickinson, </em>2008 MT 159, \u00b6 25, 343 Mont. 301, 184 P.3d 305).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b625 The Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Hilgendorf </em>proves instructive here. An officer lawfully stopped Hilgendorf s vehicle and conducted a pat-down search. <em>Hilgendorf, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7,19. The officer discovered drug paraphernalia and placed Hilgendorf in handcuffs. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. The officer conducted a second search of Hilgendorf sifter he had handcuffed Hilgendorf and discovered a small container holding crystal powder and marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7. Hilgendorf argued that the court should have suppressed the evidence obtained in the unauthorized second search.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b626 The Court did not address whether the second search of Hilgendorf required a warrant. The Court determined instead that the officer clearly had intended to arrest Hilgendorf for possession of drug paraphernalia based on the fact that they had found drug paraphernalia and had placed Hilgendorf in handcuffs. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. The Court concluded, therefore, that the officers inevitably would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>discovered the container of drugs in an inventory search at the detention center. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b627 Here Kristjanson already had discovered pepper spray in plain view and drug paraphernalia in a lawful search of Pearson\u2019s car. Pearson consented to the officers\u2019 search of his car. Kristjanson had placed Pearson in handcuffs, placed him in the patrol car, and attempted to contact his probation officer to gain permission to transport him, before the second search took place. <em>Id. </em>Kristjanson testified that he had intended to detain and arrest Pearson based solely on the pepper spray violation. Similar to the offense in <em>Hilgendorf, </em>Kristjanson had intended to arrest Pearson before the illegal second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b628 The evidence establishes that Kristjanson would have taken Pearson to the detention center and that Officer Pinnick would have authorized Pearson\u2019s arrest based solely on the pepper spray violation or the drug paraphernalia. Officers at the detention center would have subjected Pearson to a routine inventory search at the detention center. The officers inevitably would have discovered the methamphetamine found in the second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack during a routine inventory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b629 The Dissent argues that the record does not support the Court\u2019s decision. Dissent, \u00b6 48. We disagree. The District Court asked Kristjanson whether he had intended to arrest Pearson based solely on the pepper spray violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">Q. Prior to the consent to search being signed and the paraphernalia found in the vehicle, as well as the drugs found in the fanny-pack, was your intention to detain him and probably take him to the detention facility on a reported violation or a PV hold after confirming with the probation officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Again the court asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">Q: I think you testified that you intended to take the defendant to jail for the probation violation, that being the pepper spray; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">A: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">\u00b630 The Dissent focuses on the next questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">Q: Do you ever [transport a probationer] without talking to the probation officer first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">A: Never, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Q: So at the time on the video that you\u2019re placing the defendant in handcuffs, you\u2019re detaining him for what you believe to be a probation violation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">A: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">Q: And that\u2019s the pepper spray?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">A: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">Q: But you would not actually transport him until you talked to the probation officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">Q. What if you hadn't-Did you ever talk to Pinnick on that night? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">Q. And when would that have been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">A. It was sometime after placing him in the vehicle, in the patrol car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">Q. And did he say he wanted him held on a PV hold?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">\u00b631 The court again asked Kristjanson what he had intended to do with Pearson immediately after he had discovered the pepper spray in plain view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-15\">Q: And so at that point were you detaining him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">A: I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">Q: Were you in contact with a probation officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-18\">A: I was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-19\">The court then listens to the audio recording from the patrol car. Kristjanson explains that he was asking the operator to send him Pinnick\u2019s cell phone number. This activity took place before Vickery had searched Pearson\u2019s fanny pack. The record demonstrates that investigatory procedures already were in progress based solely on the pepper spray violation before the illegal search took place. <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 449-50, 104 S. Ct. at 2511-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-20\">\u00b632 The Dissent argues that because Pinnick did not authorize Pearson\u2019s detention until after Vickery had searched the fanny pack, the inevitable discovery doctrine could not justify the search. Dissent, \u00b6 50. The facts establish that Kristjanson was in the process of lawfully arresting Pearson based solely on the pepper spray violation when Vickery discovered the methamphetamine. <em>Hilgendorf, </em>\u00b6 27. Lawful investigatory procedures that inevitably would have led to the officers\u2019 discovery of methamphetamine in Pearson\u2019s fanny pack were in progress when Vickery unlawfully searched the fanny pack for a second time. <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 449-50,104 S. Ct. at 2511-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u00b633 Kristjanson informed Pinnick about all the violations-the pepper spray, the drug paraphernalia, and the methamphetamine-when he reached Pinnick on his cell phone. Pinnick testified that Pearson\u2019s possession of the pepper spray alone violated the conditions of Pearson\u2019s probation and would have justified his arrest. Pinnick authorized Pearson\u2019s arrest based on the pepper spray, the drug paraphernalia, and the methamphetamine, however, because Kristjanson had reported everything. This fact does not contradict the notion that the pepper spray violation alone justified Pearson\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">\u00b634  The search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack is not justified by an unlawful \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d consent. Pearson\u2019s possession of pepper spray violated the conditions of his probation and subjected him to immediate detention. The officers had substantial evidence to detain Pearson before, and independent of, the unlawful search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack that revealed the bindle of methamphetamine. The evidence supports our conclusion that Pearson would have been subjected, therefore, to a routine inventory search at the detention center. The officers inevitably would have discovered the methamphetamine in Pearson\u2019s fanny pack.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b459-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b459-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag2\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b636 I concur with the Court\u2019s decision in Issue 1. However, I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision in Issue 2 that the inevitable discovery doctrine justifies the admission of the evidence obtained from the second search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack. In my view, the Court has incorrectly applied the inevitable discovery doctrine to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u00b637 The District Court concluded, and this Court agreed, that although the officers exceeded their authority when they searched Pearson\u2019s fanny pack for a second time, the evidence was admissible. The District Court reasoned that the testimony of Officer Pinnick, Pearson\u2019s probation officer, that he would have authorized a search of Pearson\u2019s fanny pack had he been asked, rendered the evidence admissible via the inevitable discovery doctrine. However, under this Court\u2019s precedent, such a post-search authorization does not overcome the illegality of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u00b638 The District Court also reasoned that the evidence would inevitably have been discovered during an inventory search at the detention facility when Pearson was transported there at Officer Pinnick\u2019s direction for a probation violation based on possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>pepper spray. However, this presupposes that the officers had decided to arrest Pearson and transport him to the detention facility even before they searched the fanny pack for the second time. The facts in this case do not support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b639 Warrantless searches, as in the instant case, are considered per se unreasonable unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies. <em>State v. Dickinson, </em>2008 MT 159, \u00b6 18, 343 Mont. 301, 184 P.3d 305 (citing <em>State v. Ruggirello, </em>2008 MT 8, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 88, 176 P.3d 252). Where no exception exists, the exclusionary rule bars the admission at trial of evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search or seizure. <em>State v. Ellis, </em>2009 MT 192, \u00b6 48, 351 Mont. 95, 210 P.3d 144. The primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter illegal police conduct and to preserve judicial integrity. <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b640 The inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the exclusionary rule. <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 48 (citing <em>Dickinson, </em>\u00b6 19). It allows the introduction of illegally obtained evidence where the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tainted evidence would inevitably have been discovered through lawful means. <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 49 (citing <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>69 F.3d 309, 319 (9th Cir. 1995)). However, we have held that evidence which comes to light as a result of the exploitation of an initial illegal act of the police cannot be justified under the inevitable discovery doctrine. <em>State v. Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6 57-60, 302 Mont. 189, 14 P.3d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>Search authorized by probation officer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHP\">\u00b641 While we have held that a search of a probationer\u2019s effects may be conducted without a search warrant, we have also held that the search <em>must be authorized by the probation officer. See State v. Meza, </em>2006 MT 210, \u00b6 29, 333 Mont. 305, 143 P.3d 422 (\u201cAs a general matter, searches of parolees conducted by police officers are permissible <em>with the consent of the parole officer.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>see also State v.

Their failure to secure Officer Pinnick\u2019s authorization <em>prior </em>to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>search of the fanny pack cannot be justified after the fact by the inevitable discovery doctrine. Such an after-the-fact authorization from a probation officer is similar to the after-the-fact consent to search we held improper in <em>Ellis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b643 In that case, law enforcement officers had the victim fill out a form giving officers permission to search her father\u2019s residence after the officers had already searched it and seized various items. <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 45. We stated in that case that this after-the-fact consent was ineffective because \u201c \u2018to be valid and qualify as an exception to the warrant requirement, a consent must <em>precede </em>a search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 45 (quoting <em>State v.

Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b644 Inevitable discovery applies when the investigatory procedures were already in progress prior to the illegal search. <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 55 (citing <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 104 S. Ct. 2501 (1984) (two hundred volunteers were already searching the area where the defendant had abandoned his victim\u2019s body before the defendant gave an illegally obtained statement about the exact location of the body); <em>State v.

The District Court\u2019s reasoning to the contrary assumes a post-search authorization can cure the illegality of the search, but the inevitable discovery doctrine is not meant to justify law enforcement\u2019s decision to not follow proper procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b646 The State argues here that it would have searched the fanny pack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>legally had they not already searched it illegally. We stated in <em>Ellis </em>that \u201c[a]llowing the introduction of evidence under the inevitable discovery doctrine in this case would \u2018amount to the unacceptable assertion that police would have done it right had they not done it wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 57 (quoting <em>State v. Davolt, </em>84 P.3d 456, 469 (Ariz. 2004)); <em>see also State v. Topanotes, </em>76 P.3d 1159, 1164 (Utah 2003) (\u201cthe argument that \u2018if we hadn\u2019t done it wrong, we would have done it right\u2019... is far from compelling\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>955 F.2d 207, 210 (4th Cir. 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\n<em>Inventory search at detention facility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Agqt\">\u00b647 Nor can the admission of the evidence in this case be justified on the basis that the fanny pack would have been searched at the detention facility in any event. This argument relies on the assumption that Pearson would have been detained for the pepper spray violation alone. However, Officer Pinnick did not testify that he would have authorized a <em>probation hold </em>absent the drug evidence. Rather, he testified that he would have authorized a <em>search </em>of Pearson\u2019s vehicle and fanny pack had the officers contacted him after observing the pepper spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b648 The actual record in this case belies the Court\u2019s decision. After Officer Kristjanson observed the pepper spray in Pearson\u2019s vehicle, Pearson was handcuffed and placed in the back of the patrol car so that the officers would be free to search his vehicle. The testimony presented at the hearing on Pearson\u2019s motion to suppress indicates that Pearson had not been placed under arrest at that point; he simply was being detained while all four officers at the scene searched his vehicle. In fact, Officer Kristjanson testified that Pearson was not read his <em>Miranda </em>rights at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b649 It was not until after the fanny pack was searched for the second time and the officers found the bindle of methamphetamine that they decided to arrest Pearson and take him to the detention facility. Notably, Officer Kristjanson testified to the following when questioned by the Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">Q: I think you testified that you intended to take the defendant to jail for the probation violation, that being the pepper spray; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">A: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">Q: Do you ever do that without talking to the probation officer first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-10\">A: <em>Never, </em>Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-11\">Q: So at the time on the video that you\u2019re placing the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>in handcuffs, you\u2019re detaining him for what you believe to be a probation violation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">A: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">Q: And that\u2019s the pepper spray?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">A: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">Q: <em>But you would not actually transport him until you talked to the probation officer?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">A: <em>Correct. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">And, Officer Pinnick testified to the following when questioned by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">Q: Probation Officer Pinnick, when you were called by Officer Kristjanson, it\u2019s your understanding that the search of the vehicle and the fanny-pack had already occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">Q: Okay. So the information that was presented to you is that the officers had found methamphetamine in the defendant\u2019s fanny-pack; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-14\">Q: And so you made the consideration as to whether the officers should hold the defendant for a probation violation based on the methamphetamine and the pepper spray; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-15\">A: <em>Both, </em>yes. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">\u00b650 It is clear from Officer Kristjanson\u2019s testimony that Pearson would not have been transported to the detention facility without Officer Pinnick\u2019s authorization. It is also clear from Officer Pinnick\u2019s testimony that he only authorized the probation violation hold of Pearson on the discovery of <em>both </em>the pepper spray and the methamphetamine. Consequently, it was not \u201cinevitable\u201d that the evidence would have been discovered during an inventory search at the detention facility because it was not until after the methamphetamine was discovered that the decision was made to transport Pearson to the detention facility. Thus, the methamphetamine evidence was inadmissible because it was the product of an illegal warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-17\">\u00b651 In addition, the Court points out that Officer Kristjanson testified that he had intended to detain and arrest Pearson based solely on the pepper spray violation. Opinion, \u00b6 27. While that may or may not be the case, Officer Kristjanson did not arrest Pearson until <em>after </em>the discovery of the methamphetamine. The patrol car\u2019s video cam shows that several minutes after the officers searched Pearson\u2019s fanny pack for the second time, one of the officers returned to the patrol car to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Pearson the cash Pearson left in his vehicle. While the events taking place inside the patrol car are not visible on the video, the audio portion clearly indicates that after counting out the cash in front of Pearson, the officer stated: \u201cAt this time you\u2019re being placed under arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia, criminal possession of dangerous drugs-methamphetamine, and a probation violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b652 As already pointed out in this Concurrence and Dissent, the inevitable discovery doctrine allows the introduction of illegally obtained evidence where the government <em>proves by a preponderance of the evidence </em>that the tainted evidence would inevitably have been discovered through lawful means. <em>Ellis, </em>\u00b6 49. The State has not made the requisite showing in this case. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b653 The Court continues to emphasize Officer Kristjanson\u2019s testimony that he would have taken Pearson to the detention facility based solely on the discovery of the pepper spray. Opinion, \u00b6 29. But the conduct of all of the officers is totally inconsistent with that testimony. If the pepper spray alone was enough in the officers\u2019 opinion to justify Pearson\u2019s arrest, why bother to enlist additional officers to search Pearson\u2019s vehicle? Why not just arrest Pearson for the probation violation and take him to jail? Why bother to solicit Pearson\u2019s consent to search his vehicle unless the officers felt they did not yet have 9 enough evidence to arrest him? And why, if they had already decided to arrest Pearson after finding the pepper spray, did they wait so long to read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b654 Furthermore, the Court states that after Officer Kristjanson placed Pearson in the patrol car in handcuffs, Officer Kristjanson attempted to contact Officer Pinnick \u201cto gain permission to transport\u201d I Pearson. Opinion, \u00b6 27. Why, if Officer Kristjanson intended to arrest 1 Pearson anyway, did he need the permission of Pearson\u2019s probation I officer to transport Pearson to jail? I</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b655 In short, the actual record demonstrates that the 1 methamphetamine was seized as the result of an unauthorized, and 1 therefore, illegal, probation search. Officer Pinnick was not contacted 1 until <em>after </em>the unauthorized search, and it is clear from his testimony 9 that Pearson\u2019s detention was premised on the discovery of both the 9 pepper spray and the methamphetamine. The record reflects that, H based on the pepper spray alone, Pearson would <em>not </em>have been 9 detained. In fact, Officer Kristjanson testified that he would <em>never </em>take I a defendant to jail without talking to the probation officer first, fl Therefore, there would not have been an inventory search. The actual 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>record plainly refutes the Court\u2019s determination to affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b656 Based on the foregoing, I would reverse the District Court on Issue 2, and I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
