A jury found Nicole Guill guilty of sexual intercourse without consent, sexual intercourse without consent by accountability, and incest by accountability. The District Court sentenced her to three concurrent terms of 25 years at the Montana Women\u2019s Prison with 10 years suspended. The court also imposed a number of terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b62 Nicole raises two issues on appeal, both of which relate to her sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">1. Is the condition requiring her to continue being responsible for the victim\u2019s counseling, treatment, or therapy costs illegal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">2. Is the restriction on contact with her husband illegal and unreasonable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">We reverse and remand as to Issue 1, and affirm as to Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">\u00b63 The circumstances surrounding Nicole\u2019s convictions and sentence are intertwined with the crimes of her husband, Douglas, who was convicted of five counts of sexual misconduct against his daughter, Sarah, during the years 1992 to 2006. We affirmed those convictions in <em>State v. Douglas Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152. Douglas and his previous wife, Candace, have also been to this Court in a prior appeal concerning their divorce. <em>Douglas Guill v. Candace Guill, </em>2008 MT 279N. As we noted in that decision, this is factually one of the more bizarre cases to reach this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">\u00b64 The Honorable Deborah Kim Christopher presided over both Douglas\u2019s criminal trial and Nicole\u2019s criminal trial. After hearing extensive testimony regarding Nicole\u2019s mental health and the history of the relationships in the Guill family, Judge Christopher determined that it was necessary and appropriate to restrict contact between Nicole and Douglas as part of Nicole\u2019s sentence. Specifically, the judge ordered Nicole not to have any contact with Douglas of any sort (even through intermediaries), with one exception: if Nicole\u2019s therapist determines that limited contact for therapeutic purposes would benefit Nicole\u2019s rehabilitation. In imposing this restriction, Judge Christopher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>cited Nicole\u2019s unhealthy bond with Douglas and the degree of control that he exerted over family members. To fully understand this power dynamic and the extent of Nicole\u2019s devotion to Douglas, it is necessary to describe the relationships in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Pre-Arrest Background</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b65 Douglas and Candace met in Boise, Idaho, on Christmas Eve 1972 and were married 12 days later. He was 20; she was 18. The couple followed an itinerant course during the 1970s and 1980s, living at various times in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Oklahoma. Financially, as Candace described it, \u2018We never really got ahead. We\u2019d make the bills, but that was just about it.\u201d They had their first child (Sarah) in 1984 and their second child (Jacob) two years later. In 1991, the family finally settled in Heron, Montana, where Douglas started a successful heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning business with help from Nicole\u2019s older brother, Rick Christensen.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b66 Douglas had known Rick, at this point, for 15 years. They first met in 1976 when Candace got a job at a Boise drugstore managed by Rick and Nicole\u2019s father. Nicole was five or six years old at the time, and Rick was in high school. Douglas and Candace became friends with the Christensen family, and Douglas hired Rick to work for his painting business. Douglas and Candace left Boise in 1979 but returned six years later and reconnected with the Christensens. By this time, Nicole was in her mid-teens, and Rick was married and had three children. Rick soon divorced his wife, however, and joined the Guills when they moved to Wyoming and then to Heron.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b67 Meanwhile, Douglas did not hold any strong religious views in the early years of his marriage to Candace, but in the early 1980s he claimed to have had some sort of religious epiphany. He told Candace that he had begun \u201ca communication with God\u201d and that God spoke to him. Over the ensuing years, he justified many of his decisions and actions as being God\u2019s will. Douglas became \u201cLord of the house,\u201d and Candace became submissive to him. He told her that \u201cGod\u2019s head of man, man\u2019s head of woman, and you\u2019re supposed to do what I tell you.\u201d Similarly, as Sarah got older, Douglas told her \u201cthat God had given him an understanding [of] the Bible and that God had chosen him to be like his son, the son of God, Jesus, and that he was pure and holy.\u201d Douglas wrote an inscription on the inside of a Bible given to Sarah, \u201cYou are mine now and forever, I love you, rejoice,\u201d and signed it \u2018Your Lord Jesus.\u201d He convinced her that he could decide who goes to heaven and who goes to hell.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u00b68 When the Guills moved to Heron in 1991, Nicole was married and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>living in Idaho, working for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. She and her husband had met while in high school, and the two were married in 1990. In early July 1992, Nicole took a trip to Heron and stayed with the Guills for three to five days. This was the first time that she had significant interaction with Douglas. Shortly thereafter, Douglas called Nicole and the two of them agreed to meet in McCall, Idaho, where her parents owned a condominium. They spent nine days there in late July and began an intimate relationship. Douglas told Candace beforehand that God wanted him to go to McCall; and upon returning to Heron, he told her that a \u201cmiraculous thing\u201d had happened between him, Nicole, and God. He announced to the family that he and Nicole were in love.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b69 Nicole packed up her belongings in Idaho and moved to Heron. She was 21 years old at the time. Douglas explained to eight-year-old Sarah that he had brought Nicole to live with them because Candace \u201cwasn\u2019t good enough anymore for him\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t really love him like Nicole loved him.\u201d At Douglas\u2019s insistence, Nicole divorced her husband and cut ties with her family in Idaho. Although Douglas remained legally married to Candace, he quit spending time with her and instead spent all of his time with Nicole, who essentially supplanted Candace as Douglas\u2019s wife. Nicole had her last name changed to \u201cGuill,\u201d began signing checks as \u201cNicole Guill,\u201d and had a credit card issued to her under that name. Douglas instructed Sarah and Jacob to refer to Nicole as \u201cmom,\u201d and the public perception was that he and Nicole were married.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b610 When Nicole moved in with the Guills, the family was living in a two-bedroom trailer house situated on two acres they had purchased on the outskirts of Heron (\u201cthe Heron property\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Initially, for the first night or two, Nicole, Douglas, and Candace all slept in the same bed. However, Douglas ultimately exiled Candace to a detached storage building, which had electricity and a wood stove but no plumbing. For the next several years, Candace spent her nights in this outbuilding while Douglas and Nicole slept in the trailer\u2019s master bedroom and Sarah and Jacob shared the other bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b611 Douglas eventually had a house built on the Heron property. The construction proceeded in two phases: half of the basement and two levels on top of that, followed by the other half of the basement and two levels on top of that. Essentially, as described at trial, \u201chalf a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>house is built over one basement, and then when that\u2019s finished the other half is built over the other basement.\u201d The first phase was completed in 1998 or 1999, at which point Douglas, Nicole, and the children moved into the house. Candace, however, remained in the storage building until the second phase was completed a year or two later. She then moved to the second half-basement, which was separated by a concrete wall from the first half-basement where Sarah\u2019s and Jacob\u2019s rooms were. Thus, Candace had to go outside in order to access the rest of the house-which she was not allowed to do, in any event, unless Douglas gave her permission to enter. There was a bathtub but no toilet in Candace\u2019s basement area, and she thus had to use a port-a-potty.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b612 After Nicole\u2019s arrival, Candace was relegated to the status of an unseen domestic worker. She cooked, cleaned, and did other chores; she homeschooled Sarah and Jacob; and she assisted to a limited extent with Douglas\u2019s business. Nevertheless, Douglas repeatedly told her that she \u201cdid nothing\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t even deserve room and board.\u201d Unless Douglas said otherwise, Candace was required to go down to her half-basement when visitors came over, as he did not want people to see her or know that she was there. Terry Williams, one of Douglas\u2019s business acquaintances, testified that he had been to the Guills\u2019 home five or six times and never saw Candace. In fact, he was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d when he learned of Candace\u2019s existence in 2006, as \u201c[m]y crew worked there for days right outside her door and I didn\u2019t know she existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b613 Nicole, in contrast, was treated \u201clike royalty\u201d and given practically everything she asked for. If she wanted to take a trip, they went. Because she liked Cadillac Escalades, Douglas bought her six or seven of them over the 14 years they were together. Nicole was allowed to make household decisions and to control the home and business finances. Candace was told that \u201cwhatever Nicole wanted or whatever she wanted me to do ... I was to do it.\u201d Douglas and Nicole were very affectionate with each other and spent literally \u201c24 hours a day together every day.\u201d The two were \u201cnever more than a couple feet away\u201d from each other. They ran errands together. They went to jobsites together. They ate their meals together-from the same plate, sharing the same fork. By Nicole\u2019s own account, they even went to the bathroom together.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b614 Although Candace did not agree with Nicole\u2019s moving in and becoming Douglas\u2019s partner, she had learned that \u2018You don\u2019t object to Douglas.\u201d Once, when they were living in Oklahoma, Candace tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>assert herself against Douglas and he reacted by pinning her against a wall and choking her. On another occasion, he got mad at her and flogged her hand with a wooden spoon, causing pain, swelling, and bruising. A similar incident occurred on a trip to Lake Koocanusa. Candace was in one vehicle towing a boat, and Douglas was in another vehicle ahead of her. He became enraged that she was following too far behind him, so he pulled off to the side of the road (as did Candace), yelled at her, and hit her thigh repeatedly, causing significant bruising on her leg and hip. Sarah and Jacob were in the pickup with Candace and witnessed this event. On still another occasion, Douglas, Nicole, Sarah, and Candace were in the hot tub on the Heron property in the middle of winter, and Douglas ordered Candace to get out and stand in the cold while wearing only her swimsuit. He also commanded her to lie in the snow and did not allow her to get a towel or get dressed. This went on for about an hour. When asked at trial why she did not go inside to get warm, Candace responded: \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t given permission to do so.\u201d When asked why she had remained with Douglas despite the way he treated her, Candace explained that she loved him, but also was \u201cextremely scared\u201d of him and thought he would be \u201cvery angry\u201d if she left. In addition, she had asked Douglas about getting a divorce, but he would not allow it. Candace testified that she had not known that she could file for divorce herself; she only knew \u201chis rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVE\">\u00b615 As Sarah testified, Douglas also \u201cbeat [Jacob] up quite a bit for different things.\u201d On one occasion, he saw J acob talking to a youth who was working for a neighbor. When Jacob returned, Douglas asked him \u201cwhat the hell he was doing.\u201d Not realizing that Douglas had seen him, Jacob fibbed and said that he had been somewhere else. Douglas responded, \u201cNo, I saw you over there,\u201d and he then picked Jacob up by the shirt, threw him on the ground, and kicked him a couple of times, calling him \u201ca lying little asshole.\u201d Sarah, who witnessed this event, testified that Douglas was mad about both the lying and the fact that Jacob had befriended the youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b616 Douglas was not violent with Sarah, however. For one thing, she witnessed the violence perpetrated against Candace and Jacob, which caused her to be scared of Douglas and to do whatever he told her. Moreover, Douglas instilled in Sarah the belief that she would \u201cbum in hell\u201d if she went against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b617 Douglas was not violent with Nicole either. Nor was he threatening to her. In fact, Nicole never exhibited any fear of Douglas at all. Rather, she was \u201ccompletely devoted to Doug through love and affection.\u201d She spent all of her time with him because, as she later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>explained, she liked him \u201cas a person,\u201d \u201cas a friend,\u201d and \u201cas a husband\u201d and just \u201cenjoy[ed] being with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b618 Candace, Sarah, and Jacob were kept largely isolated from the outside world on the Heron property. There were some years when Candace was allowed to go to town once or twice, but other years when she never went at all. Likewise, Sarah did not travel off the property except once or twice a year to buy clothes. She had little or no access to newspapers, television, or the Internet and was not allowed to read books other than the homeschooling books and the Bible. When she expressed a desire to enroll in school, Douglas refused. He also did not allow her to have friends, to date boys, or to invite anyone over to the house. He told her that \u201cpeople are evil\u201d and that any friends she had would \u201cdrag [her] to hell.\u201d These same restrictions applied to Jacob.</p>\n<p id=\"A1n\">\u00b619 The homeschooling did not progress past an eighth grade level because Douglas kept Candace, Sarah, and Jacob busy doing work on the Heron property. He had them clear and burn trees, mow the lawn, maintain a greenhouse, and help with the house construction and landscaping. He also put them to work (without pay) for his business. As a result of their isolation, Sarah\u2019s and Jacob\u2019s knowledge of the outside world was severely limited, and their only acquaintances outside the family were the people they came in contact with through Douglas\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b620 Ed Cain, a pastor from Spokane, Washington, knew Douglas and Candace in the 1980s. In 1997, he came to Heron for a brief visit. Cain later described the dinner he had with the Guills as \u201cthe most bizarre meal I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d Nicole sat beside Douglas and spoon-fed him; and when he wanted a drink, she held the cup to his mouth. Meanwhile, Candace was present but said nothing, and Sarah and Jacob appeared intimidated, afraid, and embarrassed. After dinner, while Cain and Douglas were conversing on the couch, Douglas began to shake as if he were having a seizure. Nicole, who had been sitting at Douglas\u2019s feet, got up and rubbed his chest, which evidently calmed him. Still later, Cain was subjected to another \u201cbizarre incident\u201d in which Douglas had Nicole model some negligee in front of Cain. Cain characterized these events as \u201codd beyond extreme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b621 Cain also felt uncomfortable with Douglas\u2019s comments regarding religion. During their conversation, Douglas indicated that God spoke to him directly and that God had told him Nicole was to be his \u201cspiritual wife.\u201d The next morning, as Cain was preparing to go visit his children in a nearby town, Douglas confronted him and said that God had told him Cain was not to go visit his children but, instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>was to remain with the Guills. Cain rejected this proposition \u201cin no uncertain terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b622 Clifford Phillips, a carpenter and general contractor, met Douglas during the construction of a house in the area. Douglas later hired Phillips to install a custom stairway in the Guills\u2019 new home. In the course of this project, Phillips had a dinner experience with the Guills that he later characterized as \u201cthe strangest thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d For one thing, he had been under the impression that Nicole was Douglas\u2019s wife or girlfriend, since the two were always \u201cconnected at the hip in public.\u201d He had no idea that Candace even existed and, thus, was surprised when she was introduced as Douglas\u2019s wife. Then, during the meal, \u201cboth of them, his two wives, fed him; very submissive. Never stopped looking at him. They would take a fork full of food and put it to his mouth. He never touched the fork, the plate or anything during the meal.\u201d They also would \u201ccatch[ ] any crumb or morsel\u201d that fell. Phillips testified that at one point, \u201c[Douglas] told me that, you know, wouldn\u2019t it be great if I were treated that way. And I said my wife would never go for that. And he said, would you like one of these women to feed you. And I said no; I\u2019m doing just fine on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b623 Meanwhile, Sarah and Jacob did not speak at all. As Phillips described it, \u201c[t]hey were very quiet and very well-behaved to the point that was-it was very uncomfortable to me. Because they didn\u2019t react and respond like normal children, chatting and talking or interacting with their mother or anything.\u201d It was \u201cas if they were living in fear. They didn\u2019t move out of line and the slightest glance from Douglas would stop any kind of activity during that meal.\u201d At some point, one of the children spilled some milk, which appeared to enrage Douglas. Douglas \u201clooked at [Candace], and that was it. She-they were gone, whisked them away. He didn\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b624 Douglas talked to Phillips about the Bible. He told Phillips that he (Douglas) was \u201cone of God\u2019s chosen people, chosen to be a leader.\u201d At the time, Phillips was going through a rough patch in his marriage, and Douglas advised him to leave his wife and move in with the Guills. Phillips felt like \u201c[i]t was as if he was trying to recruit me to some kind of a cult or something that he was trying to start.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b625 His last day at the Heron property, Phillips saw Douglas outside on the gravel driveway smoking a cigarette. Nicole was standing right next to him, \u201ccatching his ashes from his cigarette in her hand.\u201d It was quite cold, and she was wearing only a halter top and a pair of shorts. Phillips observed that Nicole was \u201cturning purple-I kid you not-tuming purple.\u201d He noted that she often was \u201cunder dressed\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u201cscantly clad wearing skimpy clothing all the time, regardless of the weather,\u201d which in itself seemed odd. But seeing her out there turning purple, in order to catch the ashes from Douglas\u2019s cigarette in the palms of her hands, \u201ccompletely freaked [Phillips] out.\u201d When asked at trial whether he perceived Nicole\u2019s conduct to be the product of free will, Phillips said that he thought she was acting out of \u201csubmission\u201d to Douglas\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b626 Douglas\u2019s power and control over the family extended to Rick. As noted, Rick helped Douglas start a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning business in Heron. Whereas Douglas had little or no background in this field, Rick was a well-respected journeyman. Yet, Rick worked for next to nothing. He subsidized the company and received from Douglas and Nicole a very limited amount of money per week. He had no bank accounts and no share in the business. He had no home and instead lived in a trailer that the company rented as an office in downtown Heron. He had no vehicle except the use of the company van, for which he paid all travel expenses (including work-related travel). Meanwhile, as Rick was working to support them, Douglas and Nicole drove Cadillac Escalades, bought snowmobiles, and lived on the Heron property with the rest of the family as servants.</p>\n<p id=\"AsE\">\u00b627 Douglas started molesting Sarah when she was six years old. At first, he would give her \u201cnaked hugs\u201d and place his hands on the outside of her underwear. But within a year or so, he began touching her on the inside of her underwear and trying to insert his fingers inside her. Then, when she was eight, Douglas began to attempt penile intercourse. He initially was unable to accomplish full penetration, and his repeated attempts injured Sarah and caused her great pain. But Douglas persisted nevertheless and was able to engage in full intercourse when Sarah was 11 or 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b628 Nicole began participating in the sexual abuse two or three weeks after moving to the Heron property. Sarah testified that there was a \u201cgeneral routine\u201d to these encounters. Douglas would either whisper in her ear or give her \u201cthis look,\u201d indicating that he wanted her to stay up with him and Nicole in the living room after Candace and Jacob went to bed. Nicole would start by \u201cmessing with\u201d Douglas to get him aroused. Then he would have (or attempt to have) intercourse with Sarah, after which he would \u201cfinish off\u2019 with Nicole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The encounters lasted anywhere from one to five hours and occurred three to six times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>per week, starting when Sarah was 8 and continuing until she was 22. At the time, it \u201cfelt normal\u201d to her. \u201cIt felt like life, that\u2019s the way it had to be.\u201d Meanwhile, Candace (who was always out in the storage building or down in the basement) and Jacob (who was always in his bedroom) were unaware that Sarah was being abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b629 When she was 15 or 16, Douglas had Sarah start taking birth control pills. He told Candace that they were necessary to alleviate Sarah\u2019s menstrual cramps. When she was 18 or 19, Douglas had Sarah and Nicole start touching each other and sticking their fingers inside each other as part of the \u201cgeneral routine.\u201d Sarah testified that she did not want to do this but was afraid to defy Douglas. She also stated that she and Nicole never spoke about the sex. For one thing, they were never alone to discuss it. Moreover, Sarah felt that Nicole didn\u2019t like her and \u201cnever really wanted anything to do\u201d with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b630 Douglas told Sarah multiple times that if she ever disclosed the sex to anyone, he would harm himself or cause harm to others, it would be her fault, and she would never be forgiven. Believing that Douglas knew what was right and that she would bum in hell if she disobeyed him, Sarah promised never to tell. Moreover, being isolated on the Heron property, she felt like she had no one to tell anyway-including her mother, whom she feared Douglas might harm. Candace actually witnessed an instance of the abuse when Sarah was 20, but she did not report it because she was \u201ctoo scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b631 With Candace\u2019s help, and without Douglas\u2019s or Nicole\u2019s foreknowledge, Sarah fled the Heron property in September 2006 on a day when she knew that Douglas and Nicole were going to be away for several hours. She took some personal belongings plus some cash that Candace had retrieved from Douglas\u2019s safe. When Douglas returned, he initially was in shock that Sarah had left. Later, however, he became angry and asserted that Candace and Sarah \u201cwere trying to kill him and take his business and his money and his belongings.\u201d Nicole, in contrast, did not seem to care at all that Sarah had left.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b632 Although he had refused for years to divorce Candace, Douglas suddenly decided to do so. He filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on October 10, 2006, and a final decree of dissolution was issued November 6. Douglas also compelled Candace to write several letters (which she later recanted at trial) apparently intended to exculpate him in the event he was charged with a crime. He told her exactly what words to use. One of the letters, dated October 7, 2006, related specifically to sexual abuse. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">Douglas, I just wanted to write this note to let you know that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>I know that Sarah has been pursuing your body for years and I want to thank you for resisting all of her advances and being such a good Dad. I also want you to know that she might try to accuse you of child molestation and I will be more than happy to defend you in a court of law even though we are in the middle of divorce. I thank you so much for loving all of us and wish you well. Candy</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANi\">Nicole kept these letters in her purse after they were written.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b633 After leaving the Heron property, Sarah ended up at the home of Terry Williams, whom she had met through Douglas\u2019s business. Williams and his wife let her stay with them for a couple of months. Sarah eventually reported the sexual abuse to authorities in early November 2006, and Douglas and Nicole were arrested on November 24. Candace moved off the Heron property a day or two later. Jacob had already left in October.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Post-Arrest to Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b634 Douglas was charged with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent, two counts of incest, and one count of felony sexual assault. Nicole was charged with sexual intercourse without consent, accountability for sexual intercourse without consent, and accountability for incest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Against the advice of counsel, Nicole insisted that she and Douglas be tried together. The District Court initially allowed the cases to be joined but later reconsidered and reversed that decision due to concerns that joinder did not appear to be in Nicole\u2019s best interest. Douglas\u2019s trial was held in March 2008, and Nicole\u2019s was held two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b635 Douglas remained incarcerated pending trial, but Nicole was released on bond. During the ensuing year and a half (between their November 2006 arrests and Nicole\u2019s May 2008 trial), the two maintained extensive contact with each other. Nicole wrote Douglas over 400 letters, they spoke on the phone for roughly four hours every day (at a cost of 19 cents per minute), and she visited him at the Sanders County jail. In addition, on January 19, 2007, they executed a declaration of marriage,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which they backdated to November 7,2006 (the day after Douglas\u2019s divorce from Candace became final).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\u00b636 Dr. Eobert Page conducted two forensic mental health evaluations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>of Nicole, one before her trial and the other before her sentencing. He also testified at both proceedings. Based on a variety of assessment procedures, Dr. Page found that Nicole does not possess any significant signs of psychopathology. In other words, he did not find any personality traits that would cause her difficulties in maintaining satisfactory day-to-day functioning. Nor did he find any signs of antisocial, narcissistic, or sadistic traits. He also found no deviant sexual interests, no prior history of criminal or sexually deviant acts, and no issues with drug or alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b637 Dr. Page did find, however, that Nicole \u201ctends to feel insecure\u201d and \u201ctends to be driven in her day-to-day behaviors and attitudes by a need for acceptance and gratification from others,\u201d especially those in authority. \u201cTo avoid the criticism she anticipates for her feared shortcomings, she has become socially adaptable, willingly deferential to others, and ready to modify her behavior to gain their attention and approval.\u201d As a result, she \u201cis quite vulnerable to external influence and may act in ways which compromise her own internal values and morals in favor of obtaining validation and acceptance from others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A91\">\u00b638 Since the test results did not suggest that Nicole is predisposed to sexually molest children or otherwise purposely hurt others, Dr. Page concluded that her commission of the charged offenses \u201cwould likely have resulted from a strong desire to please an outside influence in order to gain acceptance and validation from that source.\u201d In particular, he found that Nicole\u2019s strong need for external validation is \u201cfocused specifically on her significant relationship with Mr. Guill.\u201d One indicator of this was her insistence on being tried together with Douglas, despite legal advice to the contrary, which suggested that she may be \u201cunrealistically and irrationally bonded with him\u201d and \u201cwilling to disregard her own well-being... in favor of maintaining [that] bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoE\">\u00b639 Another indicator was the content of some of Nicole\u2019s letters to Douglas during his incarceration. Dr. Page noted that these writings appear tangential at times and have a religious or spiritual flavor. But more to the point, they are \u201cstrongly suggestive\u201d of \u201ca very unnatural, unhealthy, bizarre bond.\u201d The \u201cmost compelling\u201d piece of evidence is an October 2007 letter, which opens as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">Hi my wonderful, splendid, exquisite, magnificent, brilliant, bright, glorious, majestic, marvelous, clean, pure, holy, loving, honest, kind, caring, heartful, thoughtful, giving, considerate, compassionate, so very special, wanted, needed, cared about, thought of, adored, cherished, worshipped, honored, honorable, trusted, missed, loved, one with me, one with Him, one-dear-ful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>delicious, delightful, adorable, handsome husband who is all mine and I\u2019m keeping always and forever and never letting go!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The letter then proceeds, over the course of 15 handwritten pages, into what is essentially a stream of consciousness,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> consisting of various passages such as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">* \u201cI have my heart cuffs on you and I\u2019m never letting go!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">* \u201cYou are my absolute everything good, pure and holy! I love you with all of my heart, everything and much, much, much more my so very special, magnificent, bright, clean, noble, priceless husband that I\u2019m keeping always and forever!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">* \u201cHe wants us together, we will be together, there\u2019s no stopping His hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">* \u201c \u2018They have everything backwards, they diagnosed wrong people and have wrong people in jail, they let the guilty go free, and they will pay, I will punish them.\u2019 \u201d (This statement is quoted in the letter as something that Nicole heard during prayer-hence, the internal quotation marks here.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Dr. Page noted that these writings could suggest obsessive ideation, but he concluded that they were the product of Nicole\u2019s desire to please Douglas and maintain his approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u00b640 Nicole was called by the defense at Douglas\u2019s trial. She testified that she had never engaged in any sort of sexual activity with Sarah and had never seen Douglas touch Sarah in any way that was inappropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She denied that the incidents of violence and intimidation described by Candace and Sarah took place. She also denied that the bizarre incidents described by Cain and Phillips took place. She acknowledged that she and Douglas shared the same plate and ate off the same fork during meals, but she stated that this did not seem weird to her. She also acknowledged that they were together \u201c[a]ll the time, 24 hours a day,\u201d to the point of going to the bathroom together. But she explained that she enjoyed being with Douglas and, moreover, that she provided \u201ca protection for him, a witness,\u201d so that \u201cif others would say something about him that wasn\u2019t true, I could testify and say, I was there, that\u2019s not true.\u201d She maintained that Douglas never raised a hand to Candace, Sarah, or Jacob. In her view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the general attitude around the house was \u201cgood\u201d and \u201chappy,\u201d and there was no sense of fear or intimidation at all. She denied being controlled by Douglas, being \u201cunder a spell from him,\u201d or being worried that God would \u201cstrike some sort of wrath\u201d on her if she displeased him.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b641 At her own trial, however, \u201cthe crux\u201d of the defense was that Douglas controlled <em>everyone </em>in the house-Nicole included. Defense counsel elicited testimony to establish that if Nicole did, in fact, engage in the sexual misconduct as alleged, then it was because she was under Douglas\u2019s \u201ccontrol,\u201d which was the result not of fear, but of \u201clove taken to an extreme.\u201d In this regard, counsel introduced testimony from Sarah that Nicole loves Douglas \u201ctoo much\u201d and might even hurt herself or take her own life if he asked her to. Also, counsel called Dr. Page, who testified that Nicole\u2019s hunger for external validation could make her susceptible to being controlled by someone with a stronger personality-Douglas in particular. Dr. Page agreed that being fed by Nicole (in the way described by Cain and Phillips) is an example of \u201cextreme control.\u201d He further testified that Nicole fits the profile of someone whose abnormally high need for validation \u201coverrid[es]\u201d any concern about the impact of their actions on others. In other words, the person has \u201csuch a hunger to secure the validation from an outside source, other than the victim, that the victim would take a second place in their decision process.\u201d But under questioning by the prosecution, Dr. Page agreed that the need for external validation does not excuse a person for sexually abusing a child. Moreover, he agreed that Nicole had the ability to exercise free will, to make decisions, and to conform her behavior to societal norms.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b642 During closing arguments, defense counsel argued that this case is about \u201clove taken to a place where it should never go\u201d-i.e., that Douglas was able to control Nicole and direct her actions during their years on the Heron property because she loved him \u201ctoo much.\u201d In light of the second issue raised in this appeal, it is notable that counsel also asserted that \u201ceven to this day, Nicole is controlled by Douglas\u201d-who, at that point, was in jail. The prosecutor countered that Nicole\u2019s abnormal need for validation from Douglas could not excuse her participation in and facilitation of his sexual abuse of Sarah for 14 years. The jury agreed with the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b643 Nicole was found guilty of the charges on May 23, 2008, and was remanded to the custody of the Sanders County Sheriffs Office. That same day, the Sheriffs Office terminated all contact between Nicole and Douglas. Nevertheless, Rick visited Nicole in jail and attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to relay communications from Douglas: The detention staff intervened and prohibited Rick from communicating any conversations from Douglas to Nicole. On May 27, Nicole was moved to the Mineral County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b644 At the sentencing hearing, Dr. Page testified that \u201cother than the current situation which involves her relationship with Mr. Guill, [Nicole] has demonstrated autonomy and an ability to maintain herself as an individual.\u201d He observed that her commission of the offenses \u201cwas driven by an external force\u201d-namely Douglas, who influenced her \u201cto act in ways that I believe [she] otherwise would not have acted.\u201d In short, \u201cbut for Mr. Guill we would not all be sitting here today.\u201d As to whether a no-contact restriction would aid Nicole\u2019s rehabilitation and protect society, Dr. Page agreed that it would. He noted that she is \u201cat a high risk for reconnecting in a vulnerable maimer with others,\u201d and Douglas\u2019s influence is \u201csubstantial enough\u201d that it would be \u201can inhibitor in her ability to be treated\u201d and would increase her likelihood of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b645 Sarah, Jacob, and Candace submitted victim impact statements to the court. Sarah stated that Nicole \u201cis as responsible for what happened as my father.\u201d Sarah said that she feared Nicole \u201conly <em>if </em>[Nicole] is allowed to have contact with my father. She will do anything he tells her.\u201d Jacob recounted that he \u201cwas treated like a prisoner by Nicole\u201d and that it \u201churt to see that she can come in, assist and allow this to happen, to me, my mum, and my sister.\u201d Lastly, Candace stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">I am angry that Nicole refused to step in and assist my children and myself. She had all the power, she could have made a difference in our lives. She hated my children and sometime[s] me. We were treated as less than nothing, only tolerated to cook, clean and maintain the home and business. As with Douglas nothing was ever done right, daily verbal abuse for eighteen years has taken a huge toll on myself and my children. I am hopeful that she is punished as well as given treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b646 Nicole spoke at the hearing and gave a lengthy statement, most of which was dedicated to singing Douglas\u2019s praises-that he\u2019s \u201ca good man, an honest man, a man of integrity, and a man of impeccable character.\u201d She said that \u201c[b]y his behavior he has taught me by example to be the same way.\u201d She talked about how Douglas had \u201ccared about us\u201d and \u201csacrificed himself and his health\u201d for his family. She stated that she was \u201cpleased, proud, blessed, honored, and thankful\u201d to be married to him. She asserted that a \u201chorrendous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>injustice\u201d had been done to them. She closed with the following remarks: \u201cThe next time you wash your hands they won\u2019t come clean. That\u2019s the stain of innocent blood on your hands, my husband\u2019s and mine. And I hope and I pray to God that he does to you what you have done to my husband and myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b647 The State asked the District Court to order that there be no contact between Nicole and Douglas. The prosecutors argued that, given Dr. Page\u2019s evaluations and testimony, this restriction is necessary for Nicole\u2019s rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society. In this regard, they noted the \u201chigh level of animosity\u201d shared by Douglas and Nicole toward the rest of the family, as reflected in her letters to him. Defense counsel objected to the restriction on the grounds that it is not an appropriate condition of sentence and that it intrudes on the right of privacy of a married couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b648 As noted, the District Court sentenced Nicole to three concurrent terms of 25 years at the Montana Women\u2019s Prison with 10 years suspended. Of relevance to this appeal, the court ordered Nicole, as conditions of her suspended sentence, to \u201cpay restitution in the amount of $7,249.43 plus 10%\u201d (Condition 15) and to \u201ccontinue to be responsible for all counseling, treatment or therapy costs incurred by the victim\u201d (Condition 16).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a separate restriction on Nicole\u2019s entire sentence, the court also ordered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">[t]he Defendant shall have NO contact with Douglas Guill through any means including third parties including her brother due to Douglas Guill\u2019s demonstrated ability to control and direct her activities, thoughts and conduct as shown through the Defendant\u2019s own testimony, the testimony of her brother, Rick Christensen, and their deification of Douglas Guill. The only exception to this no contact order is if, and only if, the Defendant\u2019s therapist determines that limited contact for therapeutic purposes, under the direct supervision of the therapist, is in both community and the Defendant\u2019s best interest for her treatment and rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Nicole now appeals Condition 16 and the no-contact restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b649 We review restrictions or conditions on a sentence for both legality</p>\n<p id=\"AQP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>and abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hafner, </em>2010 MT 233, \u00b6 13, 358 Mont. 137, 243 P.3d 435; <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b650 As charged in the Amended Information, Nicole\u2019s three offenses occurred within discrete blocks of time spanning multiple years: June 2002 to September 2006 (sexual intercourse without consent), June 1992 to June 2000 (sexual intercourse without consent by accountability), and June 1992 to September 2006 (incest by accountability). This implicates an important question concerning the application of the sentencing statutes, given that \u201ca person has the right to be sentenced under the statutes which are in effect at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 220, 113 P.3d 297. Of particular note is the fact that the restitution statutes were amended several times between 1992 and 2006. But since Nicole has not briefed this as an issue on appeal, and since the pertinent statutory language does not appear to have been materially altered during this period, we need not break up our analysis into discrete time periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b651 <em>Issue 1. Is Condition 16 illegal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b652 Nicole concedes that she is responsible for restitution. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA. Nicole also concedes that restitution includes future medical expenses that the victim can reasonably be expected to incur as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct, including the cost of psychological counseling, therapy, and treatment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA. But Nicole contends that Condition 16, requiring her to \u201ccontinue to be responsible for all counseling, treatment or therapy costs incurred by the victim,\u201d is illegal because it does not specify the total amount of restitution that she must pay with regard to the future medical and treatment expenses. Nicole points out that a sentencing court is required to specify the total amount of restitution that the offender shall pay. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA. As we have said, \u201c[t]his means that the amount of restitution must be stated as a specific amount of money.\u201d <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 7, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087. The State concedes that Condition 16, in its present form, does not comply with this statutory mandate and is consequently illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b653  We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of a restitution obligation for future medical expenses of the victim without reducing the obligation to a stated amount, and we remand to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>District Court to correct this illegal provision. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 11. On remand, the District Court may, after such further proceedings as it deems appropriate and consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, order restitution for the victim\u2019s future medical expenses in a specified amount. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b654 <em>Issue 2. Is the no-contact restriction illegal and unreasonable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b655 In explaining the no-contact restriction on Nicole\u2019s sentence, the District Court provided the following written reasons, which aptly sum up Nicole\u2019s unhealthy bond with Douglas and the extent of his control over her.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">1. The Defendant was so completely programmed through her relationship with Douglas Guill that he successfully involved her in the criminal conduct of which she stands convicted. Her indoctrination was so thorough that when she appeared in court and otherwise she was dressed in white, the color dictated by Douglas Guill. She testified she fed Douglas Guill and they were so close neither would go into the bathroom without the other one. At one point in testimony at trial, a witness testified he watched as the Defendant stood outside in the cold in scant clothing catching Douglas Guill\u2019s cigarette ashes in her hands while she was shivering so hard she almost lost them. One of the most telling pieces of evidence presented at trial as to the level of worship Douglas Guill had inspired in his family was the salutation in the one of the hundreds of Defendant\u2019s letters to Douglas Guill. This salutation approached deification in the approximately one hundred words of reverence and adoration that opened the letter. Whatever her own choices were, she had so completely adopted the lifestyle and philosophies given her by Douglas Guill that anyone was and is in danger if they come within the circle of influence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">2. The level of power asserted by Douglas Guill and supported by the Defendant is corroborated by the testimony of Rick Christensen, the Defendant\u2019s brother. Mr. Christensen is a well respected journeyman in his field, who worked for next to nothing, subsidizing the Defendant\u2019s company and receiving a limited amount of money per week, with no vehicle, no bank accounts, no home, and no share in the business. Meanwhile his sister, the Defendant, allowed Douglas Guill, with little or no background in the business, to take complete advantage of her brother. While Mr. Christensen was working to support them, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Defendant and Douglas Guill drove Cadillac Escalades, lived on Golden Pond and spent their significant free time engaging in sexual activities with children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">3. The circumstances of these offenses including the conduct, the isolation and the perversion of the family relationships are among the most egregious the Court has heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b656 At the oral pronouncement of sentence, Judge Christopher acknowledged that the no-contact restriction would probably be \u201ctantamount to a death sentence\u201d from Nicole\u2019s perspective, given her bond with Douglas. But the judge reasoned that the restriction was the only way, in light of all the evidence, that Nicole could develop a life where she is not an \u201cabsolute servant.\u201d Moreover, given Nicole\u2019s \u201csusceptibility to outside validation\u201d and the \u201cpathological difference\u201d between who she was before getting involved with Douglas and who she became afterward, the judge indicated that continued contact with Douglas posed a danger to the victim, to the community, and to Nicole herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b657 Nicole contends on appeal that the no-contact restriction fails to meet statutory requirements and unconstitutionally infringes her right of marital privacy and association. The State, conversely, argues that the restriction is legal and reasonable. We begin with the statutory question and then address the constitutional one.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b658 A court does not have the power to impose a sentence unless authorized by a specific grant of statutory authority. <em>State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, \u00b6 23, 342 Mont. 499, 182 P.3d 66. In the present case, the State cited \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA, as authority for the no-contact restriction. This statute authorizes the sentencing judge to impose \u201con the sentence provided for in 46-18-201\u201d any restrictions or conditions that are \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Section 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA. Section 46-18-201, MCA, in turn, authorizes various sentences including what Nicole received here: a term of incarceration at a state prison, plus a partial suspension of sentence. Section 46-18-201(2), (3)(a)(iii), MCA. Hence, pursuant to these statutes, the District Court was authorized to impose a restriction that is applicable while Nicole is incarcerated and during the suspended portion of her sentence. The only question is whether the restriction is \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b659 We use a nexus test to determine whether a restriction or condition meets the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA. <em>Ashby, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15; <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 293 Mont. 133, 974 P.2d 620. As originally articulated, this test is satisfied so long as the restriction or condition is reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society, and has a correlation or connection (i.e., nexus) to the underlying offense. <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11,12. The test has since been expanded to allow for a nexus to either the offense or the offender. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b660 As to rehabilitation, Nicole grudgingly offers that the no-contact restriction \u201cmay serve to rehabilitate\u201d her. The record, however, establishes that the restriction is in fact vital to her rehabilitation. According to Dr. Page\u2019s evaluations and testimony, Nicole possesses \u201csome elements of autonomy\u201d and \u201can ability to maintain herself as an individual.\u201d At the same time, however, she has a \u201cstrong need for external validation\u201d which makes her quite vulnerable to external influence, even to the point that she will \u201ccompromise her own internal values and morals in favor of obtaining [such] validation.\u201d Thus, her treatment needs to focus on her tendency to be manipulable under the coercive tactics of others, and this will require an \u201cautopsy\u201d of her life to figure out where things went wrong and how she ended up where she is now. But \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s going to keep her treatable is her own motivation to access her own issues\u201d; and right now, Nicole is in total denial about her situation. As expressed in her statement to the District Court, she views herself and Douglas as the victims here of a \u201chorrendous injustice,\u201d and her past conduct demonstrates that she is willing to disregard her own well-being in favor of maintaining her \u201cvery unnatural, unhealthy, bizarre bond\u201d to Douglas. Since denial is \u201cthe factor that will keep a person from being treatable,\u201d the initial step in a treatment program is to break through the denial so that the person can \u201cstart opening up and talking in terms of reality as opposed to self lies.\u201d That is not going to happen with Nicole as long as she remains stuck in the \u201cpathological enmeshment\u201d of her relationship with Douglas. Indeed, Dr. Page agreed that there is a connection \u201cbetween her continued contact with Mr. Guill and her continued denial.\u201d He testified that Douglas\u2019s influence is substantial enough to be \u201can inhibitor in [Nicole\u2019s] ability to be treated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b661 Nicole analogizes her situation to the one we addressed in <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318. There, the sentencing court imposed on the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence a condition which banished him from Cascade County. The court directed him to maintain residence in Lewis and Clark County instead. We concluded on the facts presented that this condition \u201cis not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>reasonably related to the goals of rehabilitation and is broader than necessary to protect the victim.\u201d <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28. For one thing, the defendant resided in Cascade County at the time of sentencing and had family there, but had no family in Lewis and Clark County. Moreover, the defendant was precluded from \u201cever\u201d entering Cascade County, not even on a temporary basis. Finally, the court had imposed other conditions that were less restrictive means to rehabilitate the defendant and protect the victim and society. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28. Thus, we held that the banishment condition was \u201cunduly severe and punitive to the point of being unrelated to rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>see also e.g. State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 24-25, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b662  In the present case, however, we are not persuaded that the no-contact restriction is unduly severe and punitive. The District Court specifically provided for Nicole to have contact with Douglas if Nicole\u2019s therapist \u201cdetermines that limited contact for therapeutic purposes, under the direct supervision of the therapist, is in both community and the Defendant\u2019s best interest for her treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d The record reflects that any more contact than this would undermine Nicole\u2019s chances for rehabilitation. She was so completely programmed by Douglas that she participated in the ongoing sexual abuse of a child, even though she had no paraphilic interests or sadistic traits. Defense counsel made a point of establishing through Sarah\u2019s testimony that Nicole loved Douglas so much that \u201cif [he] asked Nicole to hurt herself or to take her own life,\u201d she might do so. In these circumstances, Nicole\u2019s claim that no contact is an unduly harsh restriction rings hollow. And the same is true of her assertion that the restriction serves no rehabilitative purpose because Douglas will likely die in prison (having received a sentence of 50 years with no eligibility for parole). Nicole admitted during closing argument that \u201ceven to this day, [she] is controlled by Douglas,\u201d notwithstanding that he is imprisoned. Lastly, while the court did impose several other conditions which Nicole argues are \u201cless restrictive\u201d methods of rehabilitating her,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the fact is that many, if not all, of those conditions will be ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>unless she overcomes her denial and becomes motivated to access her issues in therapy-which is not going to happen, as noted, as long as she remains in contact with Douglas. Bottom line: the no-contact restriction is not simply a <em>component </em>of her rehabilitation; it is a <em>prerequisite </em>for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b663 Turning next to the protection of the victim and society, Nicole argues that the restriction does not serve this purpose because she has no sexual interest in young boys or girls, has no sadistic attributes, has no power and control issues (over others), and was not out to hurt people. Yet, these facts only bolster the conclusion that she poses a danger to the victim and society if she remains in contact with Douglas. The evidence shows, and Nicole has conceded, that she is controlled by Douglas. She will do harm to others, despite her own internal values and morals, in order to please him. She essentially functions as an extension of Douglas-one might even say an automaton controlled by him and programmed to do his bidding. Restricting her contact with him, therefore, will reduce the likelihood of her continuing to engage in criminal conduct and cause harm to others (whether in prison or serving her suspended sentence).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfO\">\u00b664 Finally, as to the existence of a nexus, Nicole had an abnormally high need for external validation. She relied on her relationship with Douglas to satisfy that need, and he thus was able to control her. She committed sexual offenses against Sarah in order to gain and maintain acceptance and validation from Douglas. Her hunger to secure that validation caused her to act in ways she otherwise would not have acted and overrode any concern she might have had about the harm being inflicted on Sarah. The nexus criterion is plainly satisfied, and Nicole does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b665 We hold that the no-contact restriction is valid under \u00a7 46-18-202(1X0, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b666 Moving on to the constitutional issue, we begin with the foundational principles underlying Nicole\u2019s claim. The Supreme Court has said that \u201c[mjarriage is one of the \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 fundamental to our very existence and survival.\u201d <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 1824 (1967). We too have recognized that marriage is a fundamental right. <em>See e.g. McDermott v. Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Corrections, </em>2001 MT 134, \u00b6 31, 305 Mont. 462, 29 P.3d 992. The Due Process Clause provides heightened protection against governmental interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests, including the right to marry and the right to marital privacy. <em>Washington v. Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 719-20,117 S. Ct. 2258, 2267 (1997) (citing <em>Loving </em>and <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678 (1965)). Not only as a component of due process (Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 17), it can be said that marriage and marital privacy are given heightened protection under our privacy provision (Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 10) and as one of the unenumerated rights retained by the people (Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 34) as well. In this regard, the right of marital privacy is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">older than the Bill of Rights-older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; abilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S. at 486, 85 S. Ct. at 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b667 There is no dispute in this case that the no-contact restriction burdens Nicole\u2019s right of marital privacy and association. The parties instead dispute the level of scrutiny to be applied in reviewing the restriction and whether the restriction passes muster under that standard. As to the first point, Nicole argues that strict scrutiny applies-i.e., that the State must demonstrate that the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. <em>Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., </em>2004 MT 390, \u00b6 17, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445. The State, on the other hand, argues that it must show only that the restriction is \u201creasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.\u201d <em>McDermott, </em>\u00b6 31. As Nicole points out, however, this standard was adopted to review \u201cprison regulations,\u201d <em>see McDermott, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Worden v. Bd. of Pardons and Parole, </em>1998 MT 168, \u00b6 33, 289 Mont. 459, 962 P.2d 1157; <em>Johnson v. California, </em>543 U.S. 499, 509-10, 125 S. Ct. 1141, 1148-49 (2005); <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987), and the no-contact restriction is not a prison regulation. It was imposed by the District Court, not the Women\u2019s Prison or the Department of Corrections; and it was designed to achieve the goals of sentencing, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, not to enhance prison administration. Accordingly, given that marriage is a fundamental right under Article II, and thus is entitled to the highest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>level of scrutiny, <em>Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, \u00b6 74, 316 Mont. 103, 68 P.3d 872, we conclude that the State must show that the restriction furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b668 As to the first prong, Nicole concedes, and we agree, that rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society are compelling governmental interests. This is reflected in \u00a7 46-18-801(1), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">Conviction of an offense does not deprive the offender of a civil or constitutional right, except as provided in the Montana constitution or as specifically enumerated by the sentencing judge as a necessary condition of the sentence directed toward the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of society.. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">For the reasons already discussed, we conclude that the no-contact restriction serves both a rehabilitative purpose and a protective purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b669 As to the second prong, Nicole contends that the no-contact restriction is \u201cfar too broad.\u201d She asserts that the purpose of rehabilitation \u201cis not to conform all of a person\u2019s behavior to some preexisting societal norm.\u201d She claims she is a \u201csomewhat dependent but otherwise normal\u201d person whose right to marital communication and privacy has been subject to \u201cdrastic\u201d curtailment. Such assertions, however, misstate the facts of her relationship with Douglas and the purpose of the no-contact restriction. Nicole is not \u201csomewhat dependent\u201d on him. She is completely subject to his control and influence, as evidenced by the fact that she engaged in unlawful sex acts with a child at his behest although she had no paraphilic interests. Moreover, she is not being forced \u201cto conform all of [her] behavior to some preexisting societal norm.\u201d Rather, she is being given the opportunity to become rehabilitated so that she may conform her behavior to the law and not reconnect in a vulnerable manner with Douglas or some other coercive individual. But more to the point, the no-contact restriction is not overly broad. As explained above, prohibiting contact with Douglas is an essential component of Nicole\u2019s rehabilitation. The record reflects that anything beyond supervised contact for therapeutic purposes would not only defeat this goal, but also present a danger to the victim and society.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b670 We hold that the no-contact restriction passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b671 As a final observation, we note that this case is somewhat sui generis. As cogently stated by the Attorney General in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>It is not just that two married defendants committed terrible crimes and, therefore, should not be permitted to be in contact. [Nicole] and Douglas committed these crimes as an expression of their bond and their relationship-they did not just sexually abuse an innocent girl, which would be bad enough, they used their unholy union and their unified position of power and control over an entire family as a constant force of oppression. Douglas was lord over all of [the Heron property] to do as he pleased and demand subservience from all; [Nicole] was chosen by Douglas as his \u201cspiritual wife,\u201d and, as his mistress over all, [Nicole] did as Douglas pleased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">Through the union [Nicole] seeks now to uphold, she committed heinous criminal acts. Under Douglas\u2019s influence and in association with him, [Nicole] participated in 14 years of rape and sexual assault of Douglas\u2019s own daughter. In the process, [Nicole] and Douglas together ruined innocent lives and tore their own families apart. While their \u201cloved ones\u201d suffered at their hands and worked for them like slaves, [Nicole] and Douglas engaged in the domineering and arrogant pursuit of their own pleasures, ease, and comfort, and celebrated only each other and their own criminal purposes in their above-the-law and self-righteous union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">[Nicole\u2019s] relationship with Douglas was not incidental to these crimes. Rather, [Nicole] used her relationship with her master as an integral instrumentality to the crime. Whatever the limits of the marital right to privacy and association are, it should not include the rights of two convicted sex offenders to continue to have unrestricted communication when they used their relationship as a tool for their criminal activities-especially where their continued contact may prove dangerous to the victims or society, and the subservient offender\u2019s rehabilitation would be hopeless under the influence of continued contact with the dominant partner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b672 The District Court similarly observed that the conduct of Douglas and Nicole, the isolation of Sarah and Jacob, and the perversion of the family relationships were among the most egregious the court had ever heard. While Rick worked to support them and Candace performed the domestic chores, Nicole and Douglas \u201cdrove Cadillac Escalades, lived on [the Heron property] and spent their significant free time engaging in sexual activities with children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b673 We reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of Condition 16 in its present form and remand for further proceedings as described above in \u00b6 53.
