(\u201cGaston\u201d) appeals from two orders of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County; the first granting summary judgment to Defendant Yellowstone Bank (\u2018Yellowstone\u201d), and the second denying Gaston\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b62 Defendant Oakwood Properties, LLC<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cOakwood\u201d) planned to develop a residential subdivision near Bozeman, Montana. On June 12, 2006, Oakwood entered into a buy-sell agreement to buy the property for the subdivision (the \u201cProperty\u201d) for $4,500,000. The sale was contingent on Oakwood\u2019s acceptance of water monitoring and perc test results. The same day, June 12, 2006, Gaston began work performing the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\u00b63 Oakwood approached Yellowstone for financing. Yellowstone agreed to finance \u201cup to $6,000,000\u201d to purchase and develop the Property. Oakwood accepted Gaston\u2019s test results and on September 20, 2006, Oakwood concluded the purchase of the Property. Yellowstone advanced approximately $4,500,000 for the purchase price of the Property and recorded its Mortgage that same day. That left approximately $1,500,000 available on the \u201cup to $6,000,000\u201d Mortgage. A Warranty Deed was also filed September 20, 2006, making Oakwood the owner of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\u00b64 Initially, Gaston sent Oakwood its invoices and Oakwood would send them to Yellowstone requesting advances so Gaston could be paid. Yellowstone approved the advances and they were made from the $1,500,000 available on the Mortgage. Yellowstone modified its Mortgage to include the advances it knew were being used to pay Gaston and to pay for other work on the Property. Eventually, Oakwood stopped paying Gaston for Gaston\u2019s work. As a result, Gaston filed a construction lien on the Property, in the amount of approximately $79,000, which was recorded on October 12, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">\u00b65 Gaston sued Oakwood to foreclose on the construction lien and Yellowstone to establish priority of the construction lien. Gaston filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>for summary judgment, arguing that its construction lien had priority over Yellowstone\u2019s Mortgage. The District Court denied Gaston\u2019s motion and granted summary judgment to Yellowstone, finding Yellowstone\u2019s Mortgage was a purchase money mortgage and had priority over Gaston\u2019s lien. Additionally, the District Court found that Gaston could not have \u201ccommenced work\u201d under the construction lien statutes until September 20, 2006, the date Oakwood actually owned the Property, thus Gaston\u2019s lien could not have priority. Gaston then filed a M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion to amend the judgment, which was denied. Gaston appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">\u00b66 Gaston states several issues on appeal, restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b67 Issue One: Did the District Court err in finding Gaston\u2019s construction lien did not attach prior to Yellowstone\u2019s Mortgage?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b68 Issue Two: Did the District Court err in finding Yellowstone\u2019s Mortgage was a purchase money mortgage, and thus had priority over Gaston\u2019s construction lien?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b69 Issue Three: Did the District Court err in denying Gaston\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b610 Because we find the first issue dispositive, we decline to address Gaston\u2019s other issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u00b611 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the district court. <em>Thornton v. Flathead County, </em>2009 MT 367, \u00b6 13, 353 Mont. 252, 220 P.3d 395. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">\u00b612 Gaston argues that its lien attached to the Property on June 12, 2006, the date that it commenced work on the water monitoring and perc tests, regardless of whether Oakwood actually owned the property on that date. Yellowstone argues that Gaston\u2019s lien could not have attached on June 12,2006, because Oakwood did not own the Property until September 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">\u00b613 \u201cA construction lien extends to the interest of the contracting owner in the real estate, as the interest exists at the commencement of work or is thereafter acquired in the real estate.\u201d Section 71-3-525(1), MCA (2007); <em>Swain v. Battershell, </em>1999 MT 101, \u00b6 25, 294 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Mont. 282, 983 P.2d 873. A \u201ccontracting owner\u201d is \u201ca person who owns an interest in real estate and who, personally or through an agent, enters into an express or implied contract for the improvement of the real estate.\u201d Section 71-3-522(4)(a), MCA (2007). A lien attaches at the \u201ccommencement of work,\u201d subject to certain exceptions, none of which are applicable here. Section 71-3-535(5), MCA (2007). \u201cCommencement of work\u201d means the \u201cdate of the first visible change in the physical condition of the real estate caused by the first person furnishing services or materials pursuant to a particular real estate improvement contract.\u201d Section 71-3-522(1), MCA (2007). \u201cA construction hen arising under this part has priority over any other interest, lien, mortgage, or encumbrance that may attach to the ... real property on which the ... improvement is located and which is filed after the construction lien attaches.\u201d Section 71-3-542(1), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b614 Once the statutes\u2019 procedural requirements have been met, the statutes will be liberally construed to give effect to their remedial purpose. <em>Swain, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Federal Land Bank of Spokane v. Green, </em>108 Mont. 56, 62-63, 90 P.2d 489, 491-92 (1939) (once the statutory requirements have been met, \u201cthe lien law is subject to the most liberal construction, for it is remedial in character, and rests upon the broad principle of natural equity and commercial necessity.\u201d) There is no indication in the present case that Gaston did not follow proper statutory procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b615 Liberally interpreting the construction lien statutes, we hold that Gaston\u2019s construction lien attached prior to Yellowstone\u2019s Mortgage and therefore has priority over the Mortgage. At the time Gaston commenced work, Oakwood was a \u201ccontracting owner\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 71-3-522(4)(a), MCA (2007), because Oakwood owned \u201can interest in real estate\u201d via the buy-sell agreement. <em>See In re Estate of Wooten, </em>198 Mont. 132, 138, 643 P.2d 1196, 1199 (1982) (an enforceable contract for the purchase and sale of real property passes to the purchaser the equitable and beneficial ownership thereof); <em>Kern v. Robertson, </em>92 Mont. 283, 289, 12 P.2d 565, 567 (1932). There is nothing in the text of either \u00a7\u00a7 71-3-522(4)(a) or 71-3-525(1), MCA (2007), that states the \u201cinterest in real estate\u201d or the \u201cinterest of the contracting owner\u201d must be a fee simple interest, or that the \u201ccontracting owner\u201d must hold title to the real estate. Rather, there must be some type of ownership interest on the part of the \u201ccontracting owner\u201d either at \u201ccommencement of work\u201d or \u201cthereafter acquired.\u201d Section 71-3-525(1), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b616  Oakwood was also a \u201ccontracting owner\u201d because once Gaston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>commenced work, Oakwood \u201cthereafter acquired\u201d an ownership interest in the Property, and remained the owner of the Property at the time the lien was filed. Section 71-3-525(1), MCA (2007). Here, unlike <em>Swain, </em>where the party against whom the lien was filed held no interest in the property at the time of filing, Oakwood was undisputedly the owner of the Property when Gaston\u2019s lien was filed. The lien attached the day Gaston commenced work-June 12, 2006. Section 71-3-535(5), MCA (2007). While Yellowstone attempts to refute this date, it did not provide any evidence that created a genuine issue of material fact on this issue. In their stipulated judgment, Oakwood and Gaston (the contracting parties) agreed that Gaston commenced work on June 12, 2006. More importantly, Yellowstone knew Gaston began work before it recorded its Mortgage, as evidenced by an email Yellowstone itself produced in discovery. Given this factual record, it cannot be disputed that Gaston commenced work before Yellowstone recorded its Mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">\u00b617  Even a purchase money mortgage is subordinate to a construction lien that attaches before the mortgage is recorded. Section 71-3-542(1), MCA (2007). Yellowstone relies on \u00a7 71-3-114, MCA (2007), for its argument that purchase money mortgages have priority over all other liens. That statute, found in the \u201cgeneral provisions\u201d of Title 71, chapter 3 of the MCA, provides <em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, </em>a mortgage given for the price of real property at the time of its conveyance has priority over all other liens created against the purchaser, subject to the operation of the recording laws.\u201d Section 71-3-114, MCA (2007) (emphasis added). Gaston\u2019s lien falls into the exception \u201cotherwise provided by law\u201d as discussed above. The legislature has made clear in \u00a7 71-3-542(1), MCA (2007), that a construction lien has priority over a mortgage filed after the construction lien attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b618 Because Gaston\u2019s construction lien attached the day it commenced work, June 12, 2006, it has priority over Yellowstone\u2019s Mortgage, which was recorded on September 20,2006. Section 71-3-542(1), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b619 Based upon the foregoing, we reverse the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment to Yellowstone and remand to the District Court for entry of summary judgment for Gaston on the attachment issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-11\"> Oakwood Properties, LLC is not a party to this appeal. Gaston obtained a stipulated judgment against Oakwood allowing Gaston to proceed with the foreclosure of its construction lien against the Property, subject to ruling on the priority issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
