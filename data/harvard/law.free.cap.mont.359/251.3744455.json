We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b63 <em>Does the DOJ\u2019s suspension of Nichols\u2019s driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-2-402, MCA, violate her right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u00b64 Missoula County Sheriff deputies stopped Nichols for a traffic infraction on June 1,2009. The deputies observed Nichols display signs of intoxication. Nichols performed the standard field sobriety tests and provided a breath sample on a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test (PAST) device. Based on Nichols\u2019s performance of the field sobriety tests and the results of the PAST, the deputies arrested Nichols for DUI and transported her to the Missoula County Detention Center (MCDC) for DUI processing. Nichols refused to provide a breath sample on the Intoxilyzer 8000 at MCDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\u00b65 DOJ suspended Nichols\u2019s driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, because of her refusal to provide a breath sample pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(l)-(2), MCA. On June 8, 2009, Nichols filed a \u201cPetition to Set Aside Driver\u2019s License Suspension, Pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, or in the Alternative, For Declaratory Relief Setting Aside Driver\u2019s License Suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u00b66 For the purposes of this civil proceeding only, Nichols stipulated that the officers validly had stopped her car for a traffic infraction, that the officers validly had arrested her for DUI, and that she had refused the requested breath test at MCDC. Nichols argued during the civil proceeding that the statutory requirements to provide multiple alcohol breath tests violated her right to be free from unreasonable searches, her right to not be compelled to incriminate herself, and her right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">\u00b67 The District Court rejected Nichols\u2019s constitutional challenges. The court \u201cstresse[d] that this is not a criminal action charging the Petitioner with driving while under the influence\u201d and that Nichols\u2019s constitutional arguments \u201cshould be raised in the criminal action.\u201d The court limited the issue \u201cin this civil action to whether law enforcement can seize the Petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license under the \u2018implied consent\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>statutes for refusing a second breath test at the detention center.\u201d The court \u201cnevertheless\u201d undertook a discussion of Nichols\u2019s constitutional challenges as they related to the civil proceeding, determined that the challenges lacked merit, and denied her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a petition to reinstate a driver\u2019s license to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 8, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation of constitutional law. <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b69 <em>Does the DOJ\u2019s suspension of Nichols\u2019s driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-2-402, MCA, violate her right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b610 Montana law permits law enforcement officers to administer two separate breath alcohol tests during a criminal DUI investigation. Sections 61-8-402, -409, MCA. Section 61-8-409, MCA, provides that a driver is considered to have given consent <em>to </em>a preliminary alcohol screening test requested by a police officer in a DUI investigation. Section 61-8-402, MCA, similarly provides the so-called implied consent for \u201ca test or tests of the person\u2019s blood or breath\u201d when the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person has been driving under the influence. Section 61-8-402(l)-(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b611 The 1995 Montana Legislature enacted the additional implied consent law in \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA, to provide for the use of pre-arrest PASTs to estimate the alcohol concentration of persons suspected of driving under the influence. <em>Smith v. State, </em>1998 MT 94, \u00b6 8, 288 Mont. 383, 958 P.2d 677. Section 61-8-409(2), MCA, states that a person\u2019s providing of a PAST pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA, <em>does not satisfy </em>the person\u2019s obligation to submit to a test under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA. Section 61-8-409(2), MCA, \u201cclearly differentiates between a PAST and a test under MCA \u00a7 61-8-402.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14. The two tests neither conflict with each other nor suffer unconstitutional vagueness. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u00b612  If an arrested person refuses to submit to one or more tests requested by the officer, the officer may not administer the test, but immediately must seize the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license on behalf of the DOJ. Section 61-8-402(4), MCA. The DOJ then suspends the person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>driver\u2019s license for the applicable time period as set out in \u00a7 61-8-402(6), MCA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b613 The person has a limited right to appeal the driver\u2019s license suspension under \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA. The court hearing the appeal may consider only certain issues delineated in \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA. These issues include whether the peace officer had reasonable grounds for the stop and arrest and whether the person refused to submit to the test designated by the officer. Section 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), (iv), MCA. Section 61-8-403(4)(b), MCA, provides that \u201c[b]ased on the issues in subsection (4)(a) and no others,\u201d a district court shall determine whether the petitioner\u2019s license is subject to suspension or revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"AGP\">\u00b614 Nichols has stipulated to all the issues that a district court may consider pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA. Nichols\u2019s petition does not rest on \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, but can be characterized only in its proposed alternative as a petition \u201cFor Declaratory Relief Setting Aside Driver\u2019s License Suspension.\u201d Nichols seeks a declaratory judgment that the implied consent provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402 and -409, MCA, forced an unconstitutional search or seizure by threatening her with the suspension of her driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b615 Nichols argues that the Department\u2019s seizure and suspension of her driver\u2019s license, pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, violated her constitutional rights under Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution. Nichols does not indicate clearly whether she believes that the unconstitutional search occurred when the officer requested the second breath test after explaining the consequences of refusal, when the officer seized her license, or if the unconstitutionality existed when the legislature authorized implied consent provisions in both \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402 and -409, MCA. We take these possibilities one at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b616 First Nichols could not have suffered a search of her breath at MCDC because she refused to provide a breath sample. Nichols also could not have suffered a seizure due to the \u201cthreat\u201d of driver\u2019s license suspension. Nichols has not explained how the officer\u2019s explanation of the rights and consequences of her choices constituted either a \u201cthreat\u201d or an unconstitutional search or seizure. We note that Montana\u2019s statutory right of refusal affords arrested intoxicated drivers even greater protections from self-incrimination than required either by the United States or Montana Constitution. <em>South Dakota v. Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 565 (1983); <em>State v. Turbiville, </em>2003 MT 340, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 451, 81 P.3d 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b617  We next address Nichols\u2019s contention that the officers\u2019 seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>of her driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, constituted an unconstitutional seizure. The state lawfully may seize and suspend a person\u2019s driving privileges for refusing to take a blood-alcohol test pursuant to the state\u2019s implied consent laws. <em>Neville, </em>459 U.S. at 560. We have upheld the constitutionality of the related consequence of refusing a breath test-the rebuttable inference in \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA-over challenges based on due process, the right to counsel, and the protection against self-incrimination. <em>Michaud, </em>\u00b6 63. Driving in Montana constitutes a privilege, not a right. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 58 (citations omitted). If a person wishes to enjoy the benefits of this privilege, the person must accept concomitant responsibilities, including the implied consent provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402 and -409, MCA. <em>Id. </em>The seizure and suspension of Nichols\u2019s driver\u2019s license constitutes a civil administrative penalty and has not violated her protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b618 Finally, we address Nichols\u2019s argument that the implied consent laws work an unlawful infringement on her constitutional rights. Nichols asserts that the officers\u2019 requests for two breath tests constitute \u201cmultiple, invasive, warrantless\u201d searches that require warrant exceptions. Nichols argues that the Court must apply strict scrutiny and conclude that any compelling interest based on exigency extinguished at the moment that the officers had obtained the results from the PAST.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b619 DOJ responds that Nichols has based her argument on the incorrect legal premise that Montana\u2019s statutory implied consent provisions constitute common law warrant exceptions to the warrant requirement. DOJ further argues that Nichols\u2019s exigent circumstances argument is wholly irrelevant to the constitutionality of the implied consent condition to the privilege to drive in Montana. DOJ contends that the implied consent provisions do not infringe on a fundamental right, that driving is not a right at all, that the statutory right of refusal actually provides greater protections than constitutionally required, and that the implied consent provisions must only pass rational basis review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b620 Courts have recognized only a few \u201cspecifically established and well-delineated\u201d search warrant exceptions. <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 468, 914 P.2d 592, 597 (1996). Those few warrant exceptions are \u201cjealously guarded and carefully drawn.\u201d <em>State v. Ellis, </em>2009 MT 192, \u00b6 73, 351 Mont. 95, 210 P.3d 144. Nichols does not identify a single authority for her proposition that implied consent statutes constitute a warrant exception. We refuse to conflate warrant exceptions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>implied consent provisions as Nichols proposes. The suspension of a driver\u2019s license constitutes a civil penalty that results from the refusal to provide a breath sample under the circumstances set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402 and -409, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b621 The flaw in Nichols\u2019s argument becomes readily apparent when one considers the remedy that Nichols seeks. The exclusionary rule provides the standard remedy for constitutional violations of illegal searches by excluding illegally obtained evidence from subsequent prosecutions against the victim of the illegal search. Nichols does not request the exclusion of breath test evidence. No such evidence exists. Nichols instead requests that this Court declare the implied consent statutes unconstitutional as applied to these facts. We reject Nichols\u2019s unavailing invitation to declare the implied consent laws unconstitutional as infringements on the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b622 Nichols has stipulated to the legality of the stop and her arrest for the purposes of this civil proceeding. Nichols challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402 and -409, MCA. We conclude that the administrative seizure and suspension of Nichols\u2019s driver\u2019s license does not present a cognizable seizure subject to heightened scrutiny. The two implied consent provisions have not worked an unreasonable search or seizure against Nichols.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
