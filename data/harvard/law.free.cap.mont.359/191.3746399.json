The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in committing L.K.-S. to MSH in violation of her right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AyF\">\u00b62 L.K.-S. is a resident of Choteau, Montana, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. She has been involuntarily committed four times in the past, and many of the people involved in this case have had previous experience with her in similar proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u00b63 On May 26, 2010, the State of Montana, through Teton County Attorney Joe Coble (Coble), filed a petition pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-121 and 53-21-129, MCA, for emergency detention of L.K.-S. and for her involuntary commitment to MSH. The State\u2019s petition set out over forty reported instances in which L.K.-S. acted in a manner evidencing a mental disorder and imminent threat of injury to herself or others resulting therefrom. The State\u2019s petition argued that the listed events demonstrated a \u201ccontinuing escalation of events which create an emergency situation.\u201d The events included L.K.-S. trespassing onto property and yelling at residents, \u201cbarking\u201d at children, causing numerous disturbances at public places, failing to care for her own basic hygiene, threatening to poison neighbors\u2019 pets, speaking with and \u201csensing the presence\u201d of nonexistent persons, making U-turns on the highway and blocking both lanes of traffic, and drinking and driving. The incidents all occurred between May 17 and May 25, 2010, after L.K.-S. allegedly stopped taking her prescribed medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">\u00b64 Later that day, the District Court entered an order for emergency detention pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA. The court found probable cause for the petition and that an emergency situation existed under \u00a7 53-21-129, MCA, \u201cin that [L.K.-S.] presents a threat of bodily injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>or death to either herself or others.\u201d The order directed that L.K.-S. be brought in front of the court to be read her rights. The order also appointed counsel through the Office of the Public Defender, appointed a statutory \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cprofessional person,\u201d and instructed law enforcement to detain L.K.-S. at MSH pending further hearing or order, following her initial appearance before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b65 Following entry of the order, Teton County Sheriffs Deputies brought L.K.-S. to the Cascade County Detention Center. Using the Vision Net system, the Hon. John L. \u201cPete\u201d Howard, Justice of the Peace for Teton County, informed L.K.-S. that the proceeding was a detention hearing on the State\u2019s petition, read aloud her rights under \u00a7 53-21-115, MCA, and notified L.K.-S. that she would be transported to MSH for purposes of having a professional person examine her. L.K.-S. was generally cooperative, but stated that she \u201cobject[ed] to this entire proceeding.\u201d She also claimed that the charges against her had been \u201ctrumped up\u201d and refused to provide a corrected address after stating that the address on the petition was not her current address. She was then transported to MSH by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b66 On the following day, May 27, L.K.-S. was examined at MSH by Richard Wagner (Wagner), her appointed professional person, in the presence of her appointed friend, Dr. Martin Krautter (Krautter), and public defender, Bill Hunt (Hunt). Wagner concluded that L.K.-S. had quit taking her medications for schizophrenia and recommended that she be committed to \u201cprevent further deterioration of her mental status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b67 On June 1, a hearing was held on the State\u2019s petition in the Ninth Judicial District Court before the Hon. Laurie McKinnon. Hunt and Coble were present in the courtroom. L.K.-S., Wagner, and Krautter were present via Vision Net from MSH. L.K.-S. immediately interrupted the proceedings and stated, \u201cI am simply here to request an actual legal trial, in person, judge-excuse me, an in person jury trial.\u201d The court continued its attempt to discuss initial matters in the case with Hunt, but L.K.-S. again interjected, repeating her desire for a jury trial and objecting to numerous elements of the proceedings. The court admonished L.K.-S. to stop interrupting, stating \u201c[i]f you keep interrupting me I\u2019m going to have the video ... muted so that you can\u2019t interrupt.\u201d L.K.-S. was undeterred. She again interrupted and stated that there was \u201cno point in this proceeding,\u201d and eventually left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b68 With L.K.-S. not present, Coble said \u201c[ajlright, let\u2019s make a record.\u201d He noted that L.K.-S. had requested a jury trial and stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>that under \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, the right can be waived if a proper record is made. At this point, L.K.-S. re-entered the room and continued being disruptive. The court warned L.K.-S. to stop interrupting and subsequently muted the system when L.K.-S. refused. Hunt asked Coble to continue, stating that Coble \u201cwas right in the middle of making a record on the waiver of a jury trial.\u201d Coble then outlined the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119, MCA, relating to a waiver of the right to a jury trial and the right to be present during the hearing, explaining that the statute \u201crequires the concurrence of the Friend of the Respondent [Krautter] and the concurrence of the Professional Person [Wagner] .... [I]f Mr. Krautter and Mr. Wagner concur, the Court can find a waiver of the request for a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b69 Coble also stated that if L.K.-S. were to leave the room again, in order to validly waive her right to be present, the court would need to make a finding that her continued presence would adversely affect her mental condition and that an alternative location would not prevent the adverse effect. The court then asked Hunt for his position on the waiver of the jury trial. Hunt replied that he believed a jury trial \u201cwould be detrimental to [L.K.-S.\u2019s] mental health and not result in any different outcome\u201d and stated that he anticipated asking for a waiver of her presence in the hearing because it would be detrimental. The court inquired, consistent with \u00a7 53-21-119, MCA, whether Hunt believed that L.K.-S. was capable of making an \u201cintentional and knowing decision with respect to indication of those jury trial rights.\u201d Hunt responded that based on his experience and his review of the reports, it was his belief that she was not capable of making such a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b610 The court then attempted to ask Wagner the same question. The transcript reveals a chaotic scene. In order to ascertain whether Wagner and Krautter concurred with the waiver of a jury trial, the court evidently took the Vision Net system off of the \u201cmute\u201d setting. L.K.-S.\u2019s presence in the room, and continued interruptions, made it extremely difficult for any communication to occur between the court and those at MSH. The court asked Wagner three times whether he had \u201chear[d] the question,\u201d ostensibly inquiring if Wagner concurred with the question just posed to Hunt as to L.K.-S.\u2019s capacity to make an intentional decision regarding her jury trial rights. It is clear that Wagner did not. Krautter attempted to provide assistance, stating, \u201cRick, the judge is asking you if you heard that?\u201d Wagner responded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d At this point, Hunt requested that L.K.-S. be removed again, so that the record could be made without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>further interruption. The court attempted to ask Krautter for his consent to remove L.K.-S. from the room, but difficulties in communication persisted. Krautter could only respond, \u2018Your Honor, I can\u2019t hear anything ... \u201d until L.K.-S. was removed from the room.</p>\n<p id=\"AAC\">\u00b611 After L.K.-S. was removed, the court asked Krautter for his consent to waive L.K.-S.\u2019s presence during the hearing, as mandated by \u00a7 53-21-119(2), MCA. He consented, as did Wagner. The hearing then progressed, with the State calling witnesses to testify to instances demonstrating L.K.-S.\u2019s unstable mental condition. No further mention was made of L.K.-S.\u2019s request for a jury trial. L.K.-S. did not return to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b612 On the day following the hearing, June 2, 2010, the court issued the Order for Confinement that is the subject of this appeal. The order contained the following Finding of Fact #3: \u201c[u]pon the representation of Respondent\u2019s counsel, Respondent\u2019s Friend, and the concurrence of Professional Person Rick Wagner, the Court determined that the Respondent was not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision regarding her rights. Respondent\u2019s counsel thereby waived Respondent\u2019s right to a jury trial pursuant to 53-21-119(1), MCA.\u201d The order committed L.K.-S. to MSH for a period of 90 days. A Notice of Appeal was timely filed with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b613 On appeal, L.K.-S. claims the District Court erred by not making a sufficient record to support its findings as to the waiver of her right to a jury trial. She asserts that the statutory requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, were not followed by the court and that, as a result, the order committing her to MSH must be vacated. In addition to the claimed statutory violations, L.K.-S. also argues that her right to a jury trial under the Montana Constitution was violated. She does not challenge the merits of the underlying commitment proceedings or the waiver of her right to be physically present at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s civil commitment order to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In the Matter of T.S.D., </em>2005 MT 35, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 82, 107 P.3d 481. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, after a review of the entire record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b615 This case requires a close reading of the record in light of the statutory scheme governing involuntary commitment. We have emphasized the necessity of strict adherence to this statutory scheme, given the utmost importance of the rights at stake. <em>In the Matter of the Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 16, 325 Mont. 133, 104 P.3d 1065. In recognition of the \u201ccalamitous effect of a commitment, including loss of liberty and damage to a person\u2019s reputation,\u201d we have described the \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d of these statutes as \u201cof critical importance.\u201d <em>In the Matter of the Mental Health </em>of T.J.D., 2002 MT 24, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 222, 41 P.3d 323 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). We have further emphasized the duty of trial courts to \u201csafeguard the due process rights of the individual involved at every stage of the proceeding.\u201d <em>In the Matter of the Mental Health of L.C.B., </em>253 Mont. 1, 7, 830 P.2d 1299, 1303 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b616 At issue is whether L.K.-S.\u2019s right to a jury trial was properly waived under \u00a7 53-21-119, MCA. Section 53-21-125, MCA, provides all persons subject to involuntary commitment with the right to a jury trial. Section 53-21-119, MCA, governs how this right may be legally waived. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">53-21-119. Waiver of rights. (1) A person may waive the person\u2019s rights, or if the person is not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision, these rights may be waived by the person\u2019s counsel and friend of respondent acting together if a record is made of the reasons for the waiver. The right to counsel may not be waived. The right to treatment provided for in this part may not be waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">(2) The right of the respondent to be physically present at a hearing may also be waived by the respondent\u2019s attorney and the friend of respondent with the concurrence of the professional person and the judge upon a finding supported by facts that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">(a) the presence of the respondent at the hearing would be likely to seriously adversely affect the respondent\u2019s mental condition; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">(b) an alternative location for the hearing in surroundings familiar to the respondent would not prevent the adverse effects on the respondent\u2019s mental condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\u00b617 We have recently had occasion to examine this statute in a case which coincidentally involved the same respondent as the present case. <em>In the Matter of the Mental Health of L.K., </em>2009 MT 366, 353 Mont. 246, 219 P.3d 1263. In that case, we reviewed a waiver of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>respondent\u2019s right to be physically present at the hearing. The waiver was placed at issue when the respondent walked out of the hearing. The court made clear, on the record, that she was free to return and participate at any time. We reversed the court\u2019s commitment order, however, after concluding that the record insufficiently demonstrated compliance with the required procedural hurdles.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b618 In <em>In the Matter of </em>L.K., we noted that under the plain language of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, if L.K. were not capable of \u201cmaking an intentional and knowing decision,\u201d then her rights could be waived by her attorney and appointed friend, acting together, if a record were made of the reasons for the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. Section 53-21-119(2), MCA, we observed, imposes additional requirements before the right to presence at the hearing may be waived: the concurrence of a professional person, and two necessary factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b619 Proceeding element by element, we concluded that the record did not support the court\u2019s order. We first determined that the requirements under \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, were not met, as there was \u201cno record of a waiver made by L.K.\u2019s attorney and friend acting together, and no record of any reasons for such a waiver... [therefore, there was an insufficient record of a waiver under \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, of L.K.\u2019s right to be present at the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Similarly, we determined that the court erred in conducting the hearing outside L.K\u2019s presence for failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119(2), MCA. \u201cThere was no record that the appointed friend or professional person concurred with a waiver of L.K\u2019s right to be present, and there was no record of findings supported by facts as required by \u00a7 53-21-119(2)(a) and (b), MCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b620  <em>In the Matter of L.K. </em>and previous cases dealing with Montana\u2019s involuntary commitment statutes set a strict standard for determining waiver of the rights preserved by statute. Without factual findings necessary to each procedural requirement, supported by evidence in the record, the commitment order cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b621  As the District Court noted during the hearing, the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-119(1) and 53-21-119(2), MCA, are not coextensive; the factual predicate for each subsection differs and the concurrence of a professional person is only required to waive the right to be present during a hearing under subsection (2). Under subsection (1), in order for the right to a jury trial to be waived, the record must demonstrate that both L.K.-S.\u2019s attorney and friend concurred with the waiver, and together made a record of the reasons for this waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>independent of their waiver of her right to be present during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b622 After a thorough review of the record, we are compelled to set aside the commitment order here for failure to comply with these requirements. The District Court\u2019s Finding of Fact #3 is clearly erroneous as it is not supported by evidence on the record, and as a result, the legal conclusion that the right to a jury trial was validly waived is not correct. L.K.-S.\u2019s attorney Hunt, who was physically present in the courtroom, represented to the court that she was not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision on the matter of a jury trial, and competently set forth his conclusion that waiver of a jury trial was in her best interests. The record is barren, however, of the necessary concurrence of L.K-S.\u2019s friend Krautter in the waiver of a jury trial. When asked directly for his reply to Hunt\u2019s conclusions, Krautter\u2019s response was, \u201cYour Honor, I can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d No additional testimony from Krautter is present on the jury trial waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"AuR\">\u00b623 It is overwhelmingly evident from a review of the transcript that the District Court, the State\u2019s attorney, and counsel for L.K.-S. believed they had completed the necessary record. L.K.-S.\u2019s own disruptive activities are the primary reason why the record was not developed in compliance with the statutory requirements. The Vision Net system was placed on mute to avoid further disruption, but the commotion evidently resulted in the judge and counsel being inaudible to Krautter and Wagner. After several further disruptions, the parties seemingly then lost their place in making the record for waiver of the right to a jury trial, as their attention turned to making the necessary record for waiver of the right to be physically present during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b624  We cannot know what, if anything, this transcript unintentionally omitted. The court reporter had an unenviable task transcribing a chaotic scene. We are constrained, however, to consider only the record before us, and we are not at liberty to make assumptions to fill in the blanks. Where L.K.-S. made adamantly clear her demand for a jury, the record must be equally clear that there was a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b625 The State urges us to apply the doctrine of implied findings to the case at bar. The doctrine provides that where findings of fact are \u201cgeneral in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the [determination], are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Wooster, </em>2001 MT 4, \u00b6 18, 304 Mont. 56, 16 P.3d 409 (quoting <em>Interstate Brands Corp. v. Cannon, </em>218 Mont. 380, 384, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>708 P.2d 573, 576 (1985)). Here, however, the court made the specific finding required by statute, but it was not supported by any direct evidence in the record. The doctrine is thus facially inapplicable. A waiver of rights should not be presumed. L.K., \u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>2004 MT 312, \u00b6 32, 324 Mont. 1, 101 P.3d 288).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b626  L.K.-S.\u2019s confinement thus violated her right to a jury trial, as the strict requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, were not met. We need not consider L.K.-S.\u2019s argument that her constitutional right to a jury trial also was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b627 Accordingly, the order involuntarily committing L.K.-S. to MSH is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
