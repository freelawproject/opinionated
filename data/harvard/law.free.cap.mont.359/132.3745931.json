We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion by issuing a challenged jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b63 In the summer of2002 or 2003, John Neumann purchased a home near Pipestone, Montana. At the time of purchase, the property had an existing bam. In 2005, Neumann, using the design of the original barn, constructed an addition to the bam with a new roof. On June 29,2007, the roof on Neumann\u2019s barn addition blew off. While the testimony was somewhat unclear, it appears the airborne roof struck and severed a power line located on Goles\u2019 property, east of Neumann\u2019s land. The severed line sparked a fire that ultimately consumed seven outbuildings, multiple fences, corrals, trees, a field, and substantial personal property of the Goles.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b64 On May 14, 2008, Goles filed a complaint against Neumann for negligent constmction of the barn addition roof. They demanded a jury trial and prayed for damages, prejudgment interest and costs. They asserted that Neumann failed to use \u201cstorm collars\u201d or appropriate metal strapping on the new roof. They argued that storm collars are required to safely secure a roof in place during periods of high winds. Goles alleged this failure constituted negligence in that it was foreseeable that an improperly constructed roof could cause damage to another\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\u00b65 Goles pointed out that when Neumann reconstructed the barn addition after this incident, he rebuilt it with storm collars to avoid losing the roof again. Goles presented a constmction witness, Don Kavanagh, who testified that in windy areas, he uses storm collars on every job he does. Kavanagh explained that storm collars are safety devices that are readily available anywhere. In Kavanagh\u2019s opinion, the lack of storm collars given the way the roof was constructed was not reasonable and prudent, and rendered the roof \u201cinsufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b66 Neumann countered that he constructed his barn \u201cin a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with accepted methods of constmction for such a structure.\u201d He argued that he designed and constmcted his barn addition based on the design of the existing barn, which had been structurally viable through snow and wind for all the years he owned the Pipestone property. He asserted that the barn addition was built properly, and it was unforeseeable that the roof would blow off. Neumann opined that the roof was ripped off by a microburst. He submitted that the lack of storm collars originally and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the use of them subsequently did not establish negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b67 Neumann\u2019s wood science expert, Dr. Burke, testified that while storm collars are commonly used in windy areas to secure roofs to the structural rafters, it was significant that Neumann secured the new roof with at least 550 nails and constructed it in a way that it probably required a 100-105-mile-per-hour wind to lift Neumann\u2019s roof from the barn. Such a wind was higher than the 90-mile-per-hour typical design wind speed standard. Burke conceded on cross-examination by plaintiffs counsel, however, that when metal strapping is added to a roof on which the proper nails are used, \u201cyou can make it better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b68 A jury trial was held on April 19-22, 2010. At the close of the evidence, the District Court gave the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aio\">Instruction No. 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">In a civil case, such as this one, the party that makes a claim must prove that claim by the greater weight of the evidence, sometimes referred to as the preponderance of the evidence. This is called the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">A party who has the burden of proof must persuade you by the evidence that his claim is more probably true than not true. In other words, the evidence supporting the propositions, which a party has the burden of proving, must outweigh the evidence opposed to it. In determining whether a party has met this burden, you will consider all the evidence, whether produced by the plaintiff or defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">Instruction No. 7:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">Every person is responsible for injury to the person of another, caused by his negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">Negligence is the failure to use reasonable care. Negligence may consist of action or inaction. A person is negligent if he fails to act as an ordinarily prudent person would act under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">Instruction No. 8:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">The plaintiffs have the burden of proving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">(1) That the defendant was negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">(2) That the plaintiffs\u2019 property was damaged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">(3) That the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause of the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">(4) The amount of money that will compensate the plaintiffs for the damage to their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-17\">Instruction No. 9:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-18\">Negligence is not proved merely because someone later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>demonstrates that there would have been a better way. Reasonable care does not require prescience nor is it measured with the benefit of hindsight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The jury returned a special verdict ruling that Neumann was not negligent. The Goles appeal. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s decision pertaining to jury instructions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. While the district court\u2019s discretion is broad, it is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. The instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights to constitute reversible error. The purpose of jury instructions is to guarantee decisions consistent with the evidence and the law, which can be accomplished when the instructions are as plain, clear, concise, and brief as possible. <em>State v. Christiansen, </em>2010 MT 197, \u00b6 7, 357 Mont. 379, 239 P.3d 949 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by issuing a challenged jury instruction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u00b611 Goles objected to Instruction No. 9 arguing that the other instructions adequately instructed the jury on the law of negligence and that Instruction No. 9 was \u201ccumulative, unnecessary, and a comment on the evidence.\u201d The District Court, relying on <em>Jacobsen v. State, </em>236 Mont. 91, 769 P.2d 694 (1989) (in which the same instruction was given), overruled the objection and gave all four negligence instructions to the jury. Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict for Neumann.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">\u00b612 On appeal, Goles argue that the District Court abused its discretion by overruling their objection to the instruction. They maintain that the instruction was an improper comment on the evidence by the District Court. Goles opine that this instruction allowed the jury to disregard the evidence presented by the experts that storm collars are the better and safer way-i.e., proper way-to secure a roof in a windy area, such as Pipestone, Montana, and that failure to use, or consider using, storm collars constitutes negligence. Goles assert prejudice, claiming that the instruction \u201ceffectively directed a verdict in favor of Neumann on the fundamental issue of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u00b613 Neumann counters that the instruction was necessary to \u201cfairly and fully instruct the jury on negligence based upon both parties\u2019 theory of the case.\u201d He submits that under M. R. Evid. 407, Goles could not prove negligence based exclusively on the fact that Neumann subsequently took remedial measures to ensure that his roof would not be blown off again.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neumann further argues that Goles failed to show prejudice or how the instruction was a comment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b614  For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s giving of Instruction No. 9 was error. We further conclude that the instruction is not a completely correct statement of the law, and we therefore overrule <em>Jacobsen </em>to the limited extent it approved the statement and the giving of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b615 As indicated above, plaintiffs expert Kavanagh opined that the use of storm collars was the reasonable and prudent way to construct a roof in an area with such high winds as Pipestone experienced. Although the defense expert then testified that the construction of the Neumann roof was done in a reasonably prudent manner, he conceded on cross-examination that the use of storm collars \u201ccan make it better.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 7. Thus, the jury had before it an indication-from both experts-that storm collars can make for a stronger \u201cbetter\u201d roof in windy areas. Enter Instruction No. 9, which told the jury that \u201cNegligence is not proved merely because someone later demonstrates that there would have been a better way.\u201d The jurors could have reasonably inferred from this instruction that the testimony of both experts to the effect that storm collars make better roofs, should be disregarded. As evidence of the better way to build a roof under the Pipestone wind conditions might support a finding of negligence if accepted by the jury, the call to reject this evidence pursuant to jury instruction constituted a comment on the evidence which prejudiced the plaintiffs. As we stated in <em>Ewing v. Esterholt, </em>210 Mont. 367, 376, 684 P.2d 1053, 1058 (1984), \u201c[a]ny instruction which assumes as fact a matter legitimately in controversy, as shown by the evidence, is erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b616 Instruction Nos. 3, 7, and 8 properly and fully instructed the jury regarding negligence. Given that Instruction No. 7 informed the jury that a person is negligent if he fails to act as an ordinarily prudent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>person would act \u201cunder the circumstances,\u201d Neumann was free to argue that it was the circumstances present at the time the roof was built and not the opinion of an expert offered in hindsight, that should guide the deliberations of the jurors. In other words, the gist of Instruction No. 9 was fair game for argument; it was not, however, fair game for a jury instruction. Jurors are free to accept or reject the arguments of counsel, but they are specifically informed they <em>must follow </em>the instructions of the court. Jurors adhering to this mandate could have very well concluded that they were obliged to disregard much of the evidence before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b617 Further, Instruction No. 9 is not, as concluded by the Court in <em>Jacobsen, </em>a completely correct statement of the \u201cprinciples of negligence law.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>236 Mont, at 98, 769 P.2d at 698. Among other things, the instruction provides that \u201creasonable care does not require prescience.\u201d \u201cPrescience\u201d is defined as \u201cknowledge of actions or events before they occur; foresight.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 1387, (4th ed., Houghton Mifflin 2000). Depending on the circumstances of the negligence case, however, reasonable care may indeed encompass the duty to employ foresight so as to anticipate problems which might result in the future from one\u2019s conduct. As explained in <em>Busta v. Columbus Hospital Corp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 362, 916 P.2d 122, 134 (1996), \u201cIf the chief element in determining whether defendant owes a duty or obligation to plaintiff is the foreseeability of the risk then that factor will be of prime concern in every case. Further, because it is inherently intertwined with foreseeability, such duty or obligation must necessarily be adjudicated only upon a case-to-case basis.\u201d As noted above, both parties cast their theory of the case in such terms, with Goles arguing that it was foreseeable that an improperly constructed roof could cause damage to another\u2019s property, and Neumann countering that it was unforeseeable that the roof would blow off. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5. Therefore, \u201cprescience,\u201d as herein defined and under the circumstances of this case, was an appropriate consideration for the jury. Accordingly, we overrule the holding in <em>Jacobsen </em>to the effect that Instruction No. 9 is a correct statement of the law and an appropriate jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it gave Instruction No. 9 to the jury, and further conclude that the plaintiffs were prejudiced as a result. We therefore reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> It appears from the record that Goles did not present evidence of Neumann\u2019s subsequent use of storm collars as evidence that his initial construction without them was negligence; rather, this evidence appears to have been presented to show that design and construction with storm collars was feasible and such a practice was in use at the time Neumann originally constructed the bam addition roof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b162-4\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"Alj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b619 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial. In my view, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by giving a jury instruction previously approved by this Court as a correct statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b620 In <em>Jacobsen, </em>we upheld a defense verdict in a case involving damage caused by a wildfire. <em>Jacobsen, </em>236 Mont, at 98, 769 P.2d at 698. The plaintiffs alleged negligence by the State in combating the fire. <em>Id. </em>Not unlike the Defendant in this case, the State claimed that forces ofnature-\u201cspecifically the sudden, strong winds\u201d-caused the fire and the plaintiffs\u2019 resulting losses. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 769 P.2d at 697. We approved the jury instructions, including the instruction challenged here, as an appropriate statement of the standard of care and a correct statement of principles of negligence law. <em>Id. </em>at 98, 769 P.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">\u00b621 It is commonly recognized that \u201c[floresight, not hindsight, is the standard by which a person\u2019s duty of care is to be judged\u201d in a negligence case. 57A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Negligence </em>\u00a7 125 (2010); <em>Alcoa, Inc. v. Behringer, </em>235 S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. App. 2007) (\u201c[floreseeability is not measured by hindsight, but instead by what the actor knew or should have known at the time of the alleged negligence.\u201d). Likewise, foreseeability \u201cdoes not require prescience, omniscience, or clairvoyance.\u201d 57A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Negligence </em>\u00a7 470 (2010) (footnotes omitted). Jury instructions including some mention of \u201chindsight\u201d have often been considered proper. <em>Klisch v. MeritCare Med. Group, </em>134 F.3d 1356, 1359 (8th Cir. 1998) (upholding a jury instruction stating \u201c[floresight, not hindsight, is the standard of negligence,\u201d applying Minnesota law and citing cases); <em>Zebley v. Heartland Indus, of Dawson, Inc., </em>625 F.3d 449, 457-58 (8th Cir. 2010) (upholding a hindsight instruction, applying North Dakota law and citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"AN1\">\u00b622 This Court has previously disapproved jury instructions that may tend to elevate certain principles above what is required to be proven in a negligence action or create an impression of a second hurdle the plaintiff is to overcome in order to prevail. <em>Simonson v. White, </em>220 Mont. 14, 25, 713 P.2d 983, 989-90 (1986) (disapproving instruction on \u201csudden emergency\u201d doctrine); <em>Graham v. Rolandson, </em>150 Mont. 270, 290, 435 P.2d 263, 273 (1967) (disapproving instruction on \u201cunavoidable accident\u201d). I agree with the majority insofar as the first sentence of Instruction No. 9, in an ordinary negligence case, similarly may inject a \u201cstraw issue\u201d into the case, suggesting a standard beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the presence or absence of ordinary care. <em>Graham, </em>150 Mont, at 290, 435 P.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b623 I do not agree, however, that the instruction should never be given. Courts have used the language of Instruction No. 9 numerous times in connection with product liability claims sounding in negligence. <em>Dean v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>301 F. Supp. 187, 192 (E.D. La. 1969) (ruling in favor of defendant manufacturer where \u201cits product was designed with reasonable care for safety in the use for which it was manufactured, measured by the knowledge available both at the time of design and manufacture\u201d); <em>Garst v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>484 P.2d 47, 61 (Kan. 1971) (directing judgment for defendant in negligent design case); <em>Jones v. Hittle Serv., Inc., </em>549 P.2d 1383, 1394 (Kan. 1976); <em>Maxted v. Pac. Car &amp; Foundry Co., </em>527 P.2d 832, 835 (Wyo. 1974) (upholding judgment for defendant in negligent design case). In my view, the instruction appears best suited to situations involving evidence of new technological developments subsequent to the defendant\u2019s alleged negligent acts. <em>See </em>3 Frumer &amp; Friedman, <em>Products Liability </em>\u00a7 18.03 (Matthew Bender 2010) <em>(citingDean </em>for the principle that a manufacturer cannot be held negligent for failing to utilize technologies unavailable at the time); <em>Maxted, </em>527 P.2d at 835 (manufacturer not required \u201cto adopt every possible new device which has been then conceived or invented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b624 In addition, although Neumann correctly points out that the trial court is required to instruct the jury on an important part of a party\u2019s theory in the case, <em>Chambers ex rel. Chambers v. Pierson, </em>266 Mont. 436, 440-42, 880 P.2d 1350, 1353-54 (1994), Instruction No. 9 was not necessarily the best means of informing the jury\u2019s consideration of the limited purpose for which it could consider evidence of subsequent measures taken by Neumann in his reconstruction of the roof. <em>See e.g. Hash v. State, </em>247 Mont. 497, 503, 807 P.2d 1363, 1367 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b625 Nonetheless, given that the instruction does not reflect an incorrect principle of negligence law generally, and-until today-had been held a proper jury instruction in a negligence case, I do not believe the trial court \u201cacted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason\u201d in giving it. <em>Peterson v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.
