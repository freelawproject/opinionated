While Savage does not appeal the revocation of his suspended sentence, he appeals from certain conditions that were previously imposed on his suspended sentence and the procedure utilized in imposing those conditions. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>also argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to file objections to the new probation conditions imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b62 Savage raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Did the District Court err by prospectively delegating its sentencing authority to the executive branch of government?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Does the Department of Corrections (DOC) sentencing modification procedure, through its use of a condition modification form, violate a probationer\u2019s rights to due process and assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b65 Issue 3: Are conditions prohibiting contact with vulnerable populations and from accessing human nudity unconstitutionally vague and overbroad?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b66 Issue 4: Did Savage receive ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b67 Excluding Savage\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we conclude the other arguments he raises on appeal are not justiciable. Accordingly, this Opinion is limited to the justiciability of Issues 1 through 3 and Savage\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">\u00b68 In 1988, Savage pled guilty to three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and was sentenced to forty years on each count, with all counts running concurrently. The District Court suspended ten years on each count, subject to certain terms and conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">\u00b69 Savage was discharged from the Montana State Prison (MSP) on April 27,2005. Prior to his discharge, a probation officer visited Savage and presented him with a DOC form that recommended Savage\u2019s conditions of supervision be modified,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011, MCA. The form contained an \u201coffender notification\u201d that allowed Savage to select between a box indicating he agreed with the modifications or a box indicating he disagreed with the modifications and requested a hearing. Savage indicated his agreement. When Savage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>discharged, he signed a condition of probation form that contained essentially the same conditions as agreed upon in the DOC condition modification form.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b610 In September 2005, the State moved the District Court to amend Savage\u2019s judgment to add the conditions contained in the DOC condition modification form. Savage objected, and the State withdrew its motion. Savage remained on probation, subject to the conditions enumerated in the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b611 The State filed a petition to revoke Savage\u2019s suspended sentence in September 2006, based upon Savage\u2019s misdemeanor traffic violations, admission of cocaine use, and failure to maintain employment. Savage\u2019s suspended sentence was revoked, and the District Court sentenced Savage to ten years imprisonment, all re-suspended, subject to the conditions imposed in the original judgment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plus the conditions Savage agreed to in the DOC condition modification form. The court imposed the additional condition that Savage refrain from contacting youths or disabled persons outside of his immediate family without first obtaining permission. At Savage\u2019s request, the court stayed his sentence and set a briefing schedule to allow him time to file objections to the new conditions imposed. Savage never filed a brief or requested a continuance to file one.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b612 In January 2007, the State filed a supplemental petition to revoke Savage\u2019s sentence, alleging he was having unsupervised contact with his daughter and other minors. The District Court revoked Savage\u2019s three concurrent ten-year suspended sentences and sentenced Savage to ten years on each count, with five years suspended on each count. The court imposed all previous conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b6 13 Savage was discharged from MSP in April 2009 and began serving the suspended portion of his sentence. After his discharge, a probation officer approached Savage and presented him with a DOC condition modification form that included the conditions that Savage avoid contact with minors and vulnerable populations, including the developmentally disabled and elderly, unless accompanied by an approved, responsible adult and that Savage avoid places where children congregate, refrain from accessing material that describes or depicts human nudity, and refrain from contacting the victims or their immediate family members. Savage consented to these conditions. The State petitioned the District Court to add the above conditions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Savage\u2019s sentence, indicating that because Savage did not object to the conditions, there was no need for a hearing. The District Court added the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b614 In November 2009, the State filed a petition to revoke Savage\u2019s suspended sentence, alleging that he had contact with his elderly aunt and his niece (members of a vulnerable population) and had viewed pornography on his computer (which he admitted). At a hearing on the matter, Savage\u2019s counsel asked for a continuance because Savage believed some of the amended conditions might be illegal. The court proceeded with the hearing and revoked Savage\u2019s suspended sentence. He was sentenced to five years on each count, all counts running concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b615 Savage appeals, but does not challenge the revocation of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b616 Although he does not challenge the revocation of his suspended sentence, Savage raises in Issues 1 through 3 several collateral constitutional claims challenging the procedures used to modify the conditions of his suspended sentence and the specific conditions imposed. Savage argues that the District Court prospectively delegated its sentencing authority to a probation officer (via the DOC condition modification form), thus violating his rights to due process and counsel during a critical stage of the proceedings. Additionally, he asserts that the no contact with vulnerable populations and no access to human nudity conditions most recently imposed by the District Court are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b617 We decline to review the above claims because no justiciable controversy exists. This Court has previously noted that the existence of a justiciable controversy is a threshold requirement to a court\u2019s adjudication of a dispute. <em>Clark v. Roosevelt </em>Co., 2007 MT 44, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 118, 154 P.3d 48. \u201cA justiciable controversy is one upon which a court\u2019s judgment will effectively operate, as distinguished from a dispute invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A matter is moot where judgment will not operate to grant relief, and, absent relief, \u201ca decision on the merits of the issue raised would be merely advisory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not submit advisory opinions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b618 Savage admitted that he viewed pornography and does not challenge the revocation of his suspended sentence on that basis. Because we cannot grant him relief, any opinion on the merits would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>be merely an advisory one. We do not render advisory opinions and, therefore, decline to address Issues 1 through 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b619 Issue 4: <em>Did Savage receive ineffective assistance of counsel!</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b620 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims raise mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 66, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b621 Savage argues that his counsel did not effectively represent him in 2006 when he failed to file a brief objecting to the additional and modified conditions that were imposed on Savage\u2019s suspended sentence. Savage asserts that there can be no justification for counsel\u2019s failure to ignore the court\u2019s briefing schedule. The State urges us to decline to review Savage\u2019s claim on the basis that it is undeveloped. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f). Alternatively, the State argues that Savage\u2019s claim is without merit because even if his counsel had filed a brief, he would not have been successful in challenging the added conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"A5o_\">\u00b622 We review ineffective assistance of counsel claims using the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668,104 S. Ct. 2052. In order for a criminal defendant to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he or she must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b623 Before we reach the merits of such claim on direct appeal, we must determine whether the claim is properly before us, or if it would more appropriately be addressed in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 70. If a claim is record-based-the record contains the answer as to why counsel took or failed to take a certain action-the claim is appropriate for direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 70-71. If the claim is based on matters outside of the record, the claim is more appropriately addressed in a petition for postconviction relief where the defendant can develop a record as to why counsel acted the way he or she did. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b624 Here, we simply do not know why Savage\u2019s counsel chose to ignore the briefing schedule and did not file a brief or request for a continuance to file a brief. Because we are left asking \u201cwhy,\u201d we conclude that this matter should be addressed in a petition for postconviction relief, rather than on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u00b625  We decline to review Savage\u2019s collateral challenges to the revocation of his suspended sentence because the claims are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>justiciable. Savage\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is more appropriately addressed in a petition for postconviction relief. We affirm the order of the District Court revoking Savage\u2019s suspended sentence and resentencing Savage to five years at MSP.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-4\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\"> The conditions included obey federal/state laws; remain under the court\u2019s jurisdiction; submit to searches and polygraph examinations; obtain therapy; no victim contact; and, pay court-appointed attorney\u2019s fees and surcharges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-13\"> The proposed modifications required Savage to register as a sex offender; refrain from possessing or consuming intoxicants, associating with other probationers and/or inmates, contacting children under the age of eighteen, entering casinos, and using or possessing pornography; submit to alcohol and/or drug testing, supervision and ISP, and DNA testing; and, attend sex offender counseling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> The polygraph test requirement was excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
