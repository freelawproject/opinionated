We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">\u00b63 <em>Does the 14-day filing deadline in \u00a749-2-505(3)(c), MCA, deprive a district court of jurisdiction over matters arising between the parties after the deadline has expired?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">\u00b64 The Montana Human Rights Bureau determined that BNSF unlawfully had discriminated against Chad Cringle (Cringle) when it denied him employment based solely on a statistical analysis of his height and weight ratio. BNSF appealed the decision to the Human Rights Commission (Commission) several days after the 14-day filing deadline of \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, had expired. Both the Commission and the District Court have refused to hear BNSF\u2019s reasons for missing the filing deadline based on their conclusion that \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, has removed their subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-15\">\u00b65 BNSF conditionally had offered Cringle employment as a track laborer. BNSF later denied Cringle employment after reviewing his height and weight. BNSF determined that Cringle presented a risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>harm to himself or others based on a statistical analysis of Cringle\u2019s height and weight. Cringle filed his complaint charging BNSF with unlawful discrimination in July 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b66 The Human Rights Bureau found reasonable cause to believe that unlawful discrimination had occurred and forwarded the complaint for a contested case proceeding. The Human Rights Bureau\u2019s hearing officer awarded summary disposition in favor of Cringle in May 2009. The hearing officer entered a final decision awarding damages to Cringle on September <em>2, </em>2009. The hearing officer also issued and served notice of the decision on September 2, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b67 BNSF filed a notice of appeal and a request for an extension of time with the Commission on September 22,2009. Cringle objected to BNSF\u2019s appeal and request for an extension of time. Cringle argued that the expiration of the 14-day filing deadline of \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, had rendered final the agency\u2019s decision. Cringle further argued that the filing deadline created a jurisdictional bar and deprived the Commission of authority to entertain BNSF\u2019s untimely appeal. The Commission denied BNSF\u2019s motion for an extension of time and dismissed BNSF\u2019s appeal. The Commission did not hear evidence regarding BNSF\u2019s reasons for missing the deadline. The Commission did not evaluate whether BNSF had good cause to support its motion and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b68 BNSF filed a petition for judicial review in district court on November 2, 2009. BNSF argued that the Commission had authority to extend the 14-day filing deadline and had authority to hear BNSF\u2019s reasons why an extension should have been granted. BNSF acknowledged that it had received the hearing officer\u2019s final decision on September 3,2009. BNSF mentioned in its brief that it had missed the appeal deadline due to its staff misfiling the decision or failing to calendar the appeal deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b69 Cringle moved to dismiss BNSF\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6). Cringle relied on \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, to support his argument that the hearing officer\u2019s decision had become \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cnot appealable to the district court\u201d when BNSF missed the 14-day filing deadline. The District Court agreed with Cringle, concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and dismissed BNSF\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b610 Cringle then filed an M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion for relief on March 23, 2010. Cringle advised the court that though it did not have jurisdiction to set aside the Commission\u2019s dismissal of BNSF\u2019s appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>it retained jurisdiction to enforce the hearing officer\u2019s decision that had granted damages to Cringle and to award attorney fees. The court issued a nunc pro tunc order on March 29, 2010, to enforce Cringle\u2019s award of damages and determine the amount of attorney fees that BNSF owed to Cringle. The court entered judgment for Cringle on April 9, 2010. BNSF now appeals the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, deprived the District Court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b611 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Mont. Dept, of Envtl. Quality, </em>2010 MT 111, \u00b6 19, 356 Mont. 296, 234 P.3d 51. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination regarding its subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Koeplin v.

Cringle responds that the legislature properly circumscribed the court\u2019s jurisdiction by enacting \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA. We agree with BNSF. The legislature does not deprive the courts of subject matter jurisdiction when it enacts filing or notice deadlines. We have required accurate use of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in our more recent history. <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654; <em>Miller v.

We have emphasized the importance of not confusing the situation of a claimant\u2019s untimely filing with the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Miller, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44; <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b614  We have concluded that \u201ccategorical time prescriptions\u201d do not \u201cwithdraw\u201d or \u201ccircumscribe\u201d the district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 45; <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23. In <em>Davis, </em>we overruled <em>\u201cGray, Pena, Wells, </em>and other cases to the extent they have held that the Legislature limited district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>enacting statutory time bars. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23. We since have consistently confirmed that statutory filing deadlines do not affect a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>State v. Johnston, </em>2008 MT 318, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 346 Mont. 93, 193 P.3d 925; <em>Cobb v. Saltiel, </em>2009 MT 171, \u00b6 33-34, 350 Mont. 501, 210 P.3d 138. <em>See also Lorang v. Fortis Ins.

Mont. Con. art. VII, \u00a7 4; <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 45. Article VII, Section 4(1) provides that district courts have \u201coriginal jurisdiction [...] in all civil matters and cases at law and in equity.\u201d Article VII, Section 4(2) also provides that \u201c[t]he legislature may provide for direct review by the district court of decisions of administrative agencies.\u201d Subject matter jurisdiction involves the court\u2019s fundamental authority to hear and adjudicate cases or proceedings. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 57 (citations omitted). Subject matter jurisdiction \u201ccan never be forfeited or waived, nor can it be conferred by the consent of a party.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 44).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b616 We have called procedural time bars by several names. We characterized the one-year time bar for post-conviction relief in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, as a \u201crigid, categorical time prescription.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23. We also described the judicially-enacted 60-day time bar in <em>Miller </em>as \u201ca categorical, but nonjurisdictional, time prescription.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 48. We have recognized the federal courts\u2019 use of the term \u201cclaim-processing rule\u201d to describe procedural time bars. <em>Miller, \u00b6 </em>44 (referencing <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 454-56, 124 S. Ct. 906, 915-16 (2004)); <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 13 (referencing <em>Eberhart v. U.S., </em>546 U.S. 12, 13, 126 S. Ct. 403, 403 (2005).

We have distinguished these \u201ccategorical time prescriptions\u201d from \u201cjurisdictional provisions\u201d that \u201cdelineat[e] the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) ... falling within a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 455, 124 S. Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>915). Regardless of the label, none of the judicially or statutorily created procedural deadlines deprive a district court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 45; <em>Davis, \u00b6 </em>23; <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b618  Procedural time bars are affirmative defenses that are subject to forfeiture and waiver. <em>Marias Healthcare Serv., Inc. v. Turenne, </em>2001 MT 127, \u00b6 9, 305 Mont. 419, 28 P.3d 491; M. R. Civ. P. 8(c); <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 46; <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 25 (Nelson &amp; Morris, JJ., concurring); <em>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, </em>455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 1132 (1982). Generally, a litigant who properly raises a procedural time bar may expect the time bar to be applied \u201cregularly and consistently.\u201d <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>Forsythe v. Leydon, </em>2004 MT 327, \u00b6 9, 324 Mont. 121, 102 P.3d 25 (stating that \u201ca firm time-limit advances the cause of justice by bringing predictability to our process\u201d). Procedural time bars, like the 14-day filing deadline in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, remain subject to constitutional review and equitable principles. <em>See e.g. Rohlfs </em>(reviewing the constitutionality of a 180-day notice requirement); <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 25 (providing that the district court may consider a motion to toll a statutory filing deadline on equitable grounds); <em>Lozeau v. GEICO Indent. Co., </em>2009 MT 136, 350 Mont. 320, 207 P.3d 316 (applying the doctrine of equitable tolling to a three-year statute of limitations); <em>Salway v. Arkava, </em>215 Mont. 135, 140, 695 P.2d 1302, 1305 (1985) (stating that \u201c[c]ourts of general jurisdiction have from the beginning possessed the power to entertain equitable actions to set aside judgments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b619 Subsection 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, provides that \u201cthe hearings officer shall issue a decision\u201d after a hearing. Subsection 49-2-505(4), MCA, states that \u201c[a] party may appeal a decision of the hearings officer by filing an appeal with the commission within 14 days after the issuance of the notice of decision of the administrative hearing.\u201d Subsection 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, further provides that \u201c[i]f the decision is not appealed to the commission within 14 days as provided in subsection (4), the decision becomes final and is not appealable to district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b620  The 14-day filing deadline set out in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, does not \u201cwithdraw,\u201d \u201ccircumscribe,\u201d \u201climit,\u201d or \u201caffect\u201d the District Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 45; <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Cobb, </em>\u00b6 34. This statutory filing deadline ultimately may bar BNSF from a full appeal on the merits, but it does not deprive the District Court of subject matter jurisdiction over BNSF\u2019s petition for review in District Court. The District Court possesses jurisdiction to hear the parties\u2019 dispute and adjudicate their issues. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Court possesses jurisdiction to consider the parties\u2019 arguments for the application of equitable doctrines and constitutional principles. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-4-702, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b621 The Dissent aggrandizes today\u2019s decision with claims that the Court has \u201cbreathtakingly [...] legislated a \u2018good cause\u2019 exception to every procedural deadline the Legislature has ever enacted.\u201d We agree that this decision resounds with separation of power considerations, but disagree that we have \u201cviolate[d] separation of powers,\u201d struck \u201cdown the Legislature\u2019s fundamental power,\u201d or \u201cviolate[d] this Court\u2019s constitutional duty.\u201d Stripped of its grandiose language, the Dissent contains no response to any of the caselaw on which the decision rests. Where the Dissent has relied on legal authority, the Dissent has relied on clearly distinguishable caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b622 The Dissent\u2019s concern regarding the separation of powers further appears misplaced alongside the Dissent\u2019s concession that the District Court incorrectly used \u201cjurisdictional language\u201d and erroneously concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain BNSF\u2019s appeal. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 42. The Dissent falls into the linguistic trap identified by this Court\u2019s recent opinions, <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 13, when it attempts to distinguish \u201cthis jurisdiction\u201d with the court\u2019s authority. <em>Compare </em>Dissent, \u00b6 32 <em>with </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b623 The Dissent relies on a reference guide\u2019s interpretation of <em>Nye v. Department of Livestock </em>for the proposition that \u201conly the legislature may validly provide for judicial review of agency decisions.\u201d <em>Nye v. Dept, of Livestock, </em>196 Mont. 222, 226, 639 P.2d 498, 500 (1982). <em>Nye </em>involved a terminated employee\u2019s filing of a petition for judicial review in district court. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 639 P.2d at 499. The employee argued that the district court had jurisdiction to hear the claim for wrongful termination based on broad language in an employment policy manual. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 639 P.2d at 500. The Court in Nye concluded that the policy manual constituted an administrative regulation that could not confer a right to appeal in district court. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 639 P.2d at 500. Read in context, the assertion that \u201conly the legislature may validly provide for judicial review of agency decisions\u201d clearly responds to the employee\u2019s argument that the policy manual permitted her to sue directly in district court. <em>Id., </em>639 P.2d at 500. The Dissent ignores this critical distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b624 The Dissent also relies on <em>Molnar </em>and <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, 295 Mont. 357, 983 P.2d 968. Though disguised as a separation of powers concern, the Dissent advocates for the return to a distinction between \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cauthority jurisdictional in nature\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Court made in <em>Molnar, </em>\u00b6 9. <em>See </em>Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38. This distinction, insofar as it is even possible to distinguish jurisdiction into separate meanings, has been identified as a source of confusion for our courts and federal courts. <em>See Miller, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44; <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19,22-23. We refuse to promote this confusing distinction here, just as we have in <em>Davis, Johnston, Miller, Cobb, </em>and <em>Clark. </em>We abandoned the approach taken in <em>Molnar </em>and <em>In re McGurran </em>when we decided <em>Davis. Compare Davis, </em>\u00b6 23 <em>with Davis, </em>\u00b6 29 (Rice, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b625 We finally address the Dissent\u2019s unfounded implication that our decision restricts a district court\u2019s authority to enforce procedural statutes sua sponte. Dissent, \u00b6 41. As we emphasized in <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 24, and recently confirmed in <em>Spencer v. Beck, </em>2010 MT 256, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 295, 245 P.3d 21, a court can raise a procedural time bar sua sponte so long as the court takes due process precautions, including fair notice and providing an opportunity for the parties to present their positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b626 The Dissent also presents a laundry list of statutory \u201cgood cause\u201d exceptions to statutory deadlines. Dissent, \u00b6 38. The Dissent apparently believes that the existence of these statutory exceptions somehow supports its conclusion that courts cannot hear and determine whether a litigant has good cause to justify the missing of a procedural bar. Under the Dissent\u2019s approach, a court would be required to deny BNSF\u2019s petition for judicial relief even if BNSF had missed the deadline because a tornado that struck its counsel\u2019s office had destroyed the entire case file. Under the Dissent\u2019s approach, the district court would \u201cproperly exercise subject matter jurisdiction\u201d simply by tallying the days that have passed and issuing a denial of judicial review without a hearing, regardless of whether good cause existed. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36. Article VII, Section 4(2) of the Montana Constitution does not so diminish and automate the court\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b627 BNSF requests that this Court remand to the Commission to hear its motion for an extension of the 14-day filing deadline in the first instance. BNSF cites to M. R. Civ. P. 6(b) and Admin. R. M. 24.9.113 and Admin. R. M. 24.9.315 in support of its argument that the Commission had authority to extend the filing deadline. We disagree. Subsection 49-2-505(4), MCA, permits BNSF to have appealed the hearing examiner\u2019s decision to the Commission only within the 14-day filing deadline. Only the District Court had authority to grant BNSF equitable relief from the procedural bar of \u00a7 49-2-505(4), MCA, after the appeal deadline had expired. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-4-702, -704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u00b628  On remand, the District Court shall hear BNSF\u2019s alleged good cause that would justify its motion for an extension of time. If the District Court finds good cause, it shall order the Commission (1) to grant BNSF\u2019s motion for an extension of time, and (2) to hear and determine the merits of BNSF\u2019s appeal. If the District Court concludes that BNSF\u2019s motion lacks good cause, it shall deny the motion for an extension of time and resolve any other outstanding matters presented by BNSF\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b629 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b52-6\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b630 In my view, the Court has misapplied jurisdictional principles, misinterpreted the Constitution, and failed to follow our holdings. Worse, the Court has acted beyond its own constitutional powers by legislating a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to virtually every procedural bar passed by the Legislature. In its zeal to diminish the effect of procedural bars, the Court has gone too far. I strongly dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b631 The Court states repeatedly that legislatively enacted filing deadlines do not deprive the courts of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14,17, 20. In fact, virtually the entire analysis of the Opinion is dedicated to this proposition. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 13-20. While I generally agree with this proposition-that legislative acts may improperly impinge the jurisdiction of the courts-that did not happen here. The Court\u2019s jurisdictional analysis is insufficiently nuanced and misses the real issue in this case-the express constitutional authority given to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u00b632 The District Court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain BNSF\u2019s appeal from the agency decision and to address the issues raised therein. We have previously explained this concept. <em>Molnar v. Mont. Pub. Serv. </em>Commn., 2008 MT 49, \u00b6 9, 341 Mont. 420, 177 P.3d 1048 (\u201cthe District Court possessed general subject matter jurisdiction to review the agency decision ....\u201d); <em>see also In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, 295 Mont. 357, 983 P.2d 968. The District Court had jurisdiction to determine whether BNSF\u2019s appeal was validly filed, whether the cross-petitions seeking enforcement of the agency decision were valid, and whether an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in this discrimination proceeding was appropriate pursuant to \u00a7 49-2-505(8), MCA. Nothing the Legislature did deprived the court of this jurisdiction. While the District Court used incorrect language in denying relief to BNSF for \u201clack of jurisdiction,\u201d a phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>which, unfortunately, courts are wont to employ, it nonetheless had jurisdiction to do exactly what it did, and reversal is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"A99h\">\u00b633 However, the Court reverses on the ground that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of a filing deadline and a limitation upon appeals made directly from a hearing officer to the courts impermissibly conflicts with a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. For the following reasons, I believe there is no such conflict in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b634 First, the Constitution has granted the Legislature express authority over appeals to the district courts from agency determinations. Right within Article VII, Section 4, entitled \u201cDistrict court jurisdiction,\u201d the Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he legislature may provide for direct review by the district court of decisions of administrative agencies.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4(2). The Court quotes this provision in passing, <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 15, but fails to discuss it or acknowledge that it has any effect. Further, the Court fails to advise that we have previously interpreted it contrary to the Court\u2019s holding today. Placed within the \u201cDistrict court jurisdiction\u201d section of the Constitution, the provision expressly grants authority over agency appeals to the Legislature. As one commentary has explained this provision of the Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">This section establishes the basic trial and appellate jurisdiction for district courts ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">As to appellate jurisdiction, the principal litigation concern has been review of administrative action. The Montana Supreme Court has emphasized the legislative role in providing for administrative review. <em>Only the legislature may provide for judicial review of administrative actions (Nye v. Department of Livestock, </em>1982), <em>and the legislature may deny or restrict the right of review from administrative decisions to a particular court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa\">Larry M. Elison &amp; Fritz Snyder, <em>The Montana State Constitution: A Reference Guide </em>144-45 (Greenwood Press 2001) (emphasis added). The comment correctly cites our decision in Nye <em>v. Department of Livestock, </em>196 Mont. 222, 639 P.2d 498 (1982), where we held: \u201cIn Montana, only the legislature may validly provide for judicial review of agency decisions. \u2018The legislature may provide for direct review by the district court of decisions of administrative agencies.\u2019 Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4, cl. 2. A right of judicial review cannot be created by agency fiat.\u201d <em>Nye, </em>196 Mont, at 226, 639 P.2d at 500. We held similarly in <em>Molnar, </em>\u00b6 7: \u201cWe have held that only the Legislature may validly provide for judicial review of agency decisions. <em>Nye v. Dept. of Livestock, </em>196 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>[at] 226, 639 P.2d [at] 500). As such, a court\u2019s authority to review administrative rulings is constrained by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b635 Pursuant to its constitutional authority, the Legislature enacted the appeal provisions at issue in this case, particularly, \u00a7 49-2-505, MCA. Subsection (4) provides that \u201c[a] party may appeal a decision of the hearings officer by filing an appeal with the commission within 14 days after the issuance of the notice of decision of the administrative hearing.\u201d Section 49-2-505(4), MCA. Then, critically, subsection (3)(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">If the decision is not appealed to the commission within 14 days as provided in subsection (4), <em>the decision becomes final and is not appealable to district court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Section 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA (emphasis added). It should first be noted that, by the plain words of this provision, the Legislature made no direct effort to limit the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court-in other words, to declare that district courts lacked jurisdiction to entertain appeals from state agencies. Rather, it exercised its constitutional authority to govern agency appeals by prohibiting parties from \u201cleapfrogging\u201d over the Human Rights Commission and seeking direct review by a district court if they have failed, first, to timely appeal to the Human Rights Commission. If a party fails to appeal from a hearing officer\u2019s decision within 14 days, the Legislature has declared the hearing officer\u2019s decision is to be \u201cfinal\u201d and nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b636 Within this statute, the Legislature utilized the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court by authorizing appeals to the district court <em>after </em>the Commission has rendered a decision. Section 49-2-505(9), MCA. It further utilized that jurisdiction by permitting district courts to award attorney fees and costs to a prevailing party following an agency decision. Section 49-2-505(8), MCA. This case played out exactly as the statutes envisioned. Despite its incorrect use of jurisdictional language, the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain BNSF\u2019s appeal and to determine whether, pursuant to the statutory provisions, BNSF had the right to proceed. Determining that BNSF\u2019s appeal was in violation of statute, the District Court properly denied the appeal. Also pursuant to its subject matter jurisdiction, it ordered the agency decision, declared \u201cfinal\u201d by statute, to be enforced and granted attorney fees to Cringle.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b637 However, the Court, which apparently sees only the potential for inequity in the enforcement of procedural deadlines, has not only ignored the Constitution, but has overreacted: it has effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>abolished the Legislature\u2019s power to enact a firm filing deadline. Based upon its overbroad reasoning that all filing deadlines necessarily conflict with a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the Court, in a breathtakingly broad response, has legislated a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to every procedural deadline the Legislature has ever enacted-in its words, to all \u201c \u2018periods of limitation\u2019 \u201d which \u201care scattered throughout the Montana Code Annotated and are \u2018too numerous to mention.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17. The Legislature has thus been stripped of its authority to enact a \u201crigid statutory prescription.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. Beyond the repudiation of the specific constitutional authority provided to the Legislature by Art. VII, Section 4(2), to govern appeals from agencies, this decision, more critically, violates separation of powers by encroaching upon and striking down the Legislature\u2019s fundamental power and violates this Court\u2019s constitutional duty. Obsessed with turning all deadlines into \u201c \u2018claim-processing rule[s],\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16, the Court has lost sight of the fact that these are statutes-enacted pursuant to the Legislature\u2019s separate constitutional authority. By euthanizing them, the Court has overstepped its bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b638 It is only the Legislature who is constitutionally empowered to enact \u201cgood cause\u201d exceptions to statutory deadlines, and it uses that authority often. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7 16-4-30 l(l)(f), MCA (\u201cthe department may, for good cause, waive the 3-day requirement\u201d); \u00a7 16-4-416(2), MCA (\u201c[t]he department, upon a showing of good cause, may in its discretion extend the time\u201d); \u00a7 32-3-216(3), MCA (\u201c[flor good cause shown within the 60-day period, the department may extend the response period for an additional 30 days\u201d); \u00a7 32-3-303(3), MCA (\u201cthe department may extend the approval period for an additional 30 days for good cause\u201d); \u00a7 33-2-1111(1), MCA (\u201cshall register within 15 days after becoming subject to registration, unless the commissioner for good cause extends the time\u201d); \u00a7 33-35-301(2)(b), MCA (\u201ccommissioner ... upon a showing of good cause, may extend by 30 days the filing date for the report\u201d); \u00a7 46-13-108(1), MCA (\u201c[e]xcept for good cause shown, if the prosecution seeks treatment of the accused as a persistent felony offender, notice of that fact must be given at or before the omnibus hearing\u201d); \u00a7 77-6-302(3), MCA (\u201c[u]pon authorization, the movable improvements must be removed within 60 days ... unless the department for good cause grants additional time for the removal\u201d). (Emphases added to all foregoing statutory provisions.) Likewise, the Legislature has the authority to decline to create a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to a filing deadline. Here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Legislature, pursuant to that authority, determined to prohibit an appeal made directly from a hearing officer\u2019s decision to the district court when the appealing party failed to timely appeal to the Human Rights Commission, and provided no good cause exception. The District Court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction in this case to ensure the statutes had been followed as they were enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b639 It is true, as the Court notes, that statutory time bars are subject to constitutional challenge and review. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Application of a procedural bar may be found to violate a litigant\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Pickens v. Shelton-Thompson, </em>2000 MT 131, \u00b6 21, 300 Mont. 16, 3 P.3d 603. We have delineated the standards by which we will determine whether due process is satisfied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, BNSF has not mounted a constitutional challenge to the 14-day statutory time bar enforced in this case, electing instead to rely on jurisdictional arguments, which I would reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b640 Of course, it is cumbersome for courts to entertain constitutional challenges to statutory procedural bars on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the Court avoids such cumber and inconvenience by judicially legislating a good cause exception to every statutory time deadline. I will admit this is a much more convenient approach. However, what is convenient is not always constitutional, and here it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b641 Then, further narrowing our existing precedent, the Court declares that procedural bars are merely \u201caffirmative defenses that are subject to forfeiture and waiver.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18. Yet, in <em>Davis, </em>a case on which the Court relies, the Court held that \u201cnothing in our ruling precludes a court from raising, <em>sua sponte, </em>the timeliness of the petition\u201d and enforcing the statutory time bar. <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 24, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654. Today, the Court steps away from that holding, essentially implying that a district court can no longer enforce procedural statutes by its own action.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b642 The Legislature was within its express constitutional authority to enact the statutes at issue here. The Court has erred in its jurisdictional analysis but, worse, has acted beyond its constitutional authority and duty by legislating good cause exceptions to statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>deadlines which are the province of the Legislature. I dissent and would affirm the District Court. Although I would correct the incorrect language used by the District Court, I would nonetheless affirm for the reasons set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b643 In response, the Court asserts that this dissent has relied upon \u201cclearly distinguishable caselaw.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21. However, this criticism merely seeks to distract from the reality that this dissent relies at root upon Article VII, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution, which gives express authority to the Legislature to govern the issue in this case. The Court cannot bring itself to acknowledge that the Constitution\u2019s \u201cDistrict corurt jurisdiction\u201d provision grants such authority to the Legislature. Although criticizing this dissent at length, the Court is at a loss to explain or apply this express constitutional provision. This is because the Constitution is clearly contrary to the Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdictional theory\u201d and its holding in this case. The Court reasons that its theory of jurisdiction is superior because various scenarios such as tornado strikes will be conveniently resolved thereby. However, the potential for tornado strikes does not excuse us from following the dictates of the Constitution. And when courts refuse to honor, or even <em>discuss, </em>controlling constitutional provisions, so that they may instead adopt their own legal theories, the use of \u201cgrandiose language\u201d in opposition is most appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b644 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\"> \u201c[D]ue process requirements are flexible and may be adapted to meet the procedural protections demanded by a specific situation. <em>McDermott [v.
