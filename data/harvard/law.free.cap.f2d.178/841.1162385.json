The Referee in Bankruptcy entered an order denying this motion but directing that the claim be allowed as a general creditor\u2019s claim. The district court ordered that a petition for review of the Referee\u2019s order be denied. Appellant appeals.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b891-17\">FRANK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">Appellant\u2019s claim was not a debt \u201cincurred\u201d after the date of the filing of the arrangement petition. It was \u201cincurred,\u201d before that date, when debtor accepted the orders obtained by appellant. That the debtor did not schedule any debt to appellant has no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"AT3\">When the arrangement went into effect, and before the orders were filled and the debtor was paid, appellant could at once \u2014under Bankruptcy Act Sections 57, sub. d and 63, sub. a(8) \u2014 have filed a claim either<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) as an unliquidated claim or (2) as a contingent claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For appellant had fully performed, and the only possible questions were (a) whether the amount of the claim could be determined, and if so, (b) what the amount was. Had the orders not been filled and debtor paid, it would have been necessary, at most, in ascertaining the amount of the claim, to consider (because of clause 5 of the contract) the likelihood of the debtor\u2019s inability to fill the orders, and (because of clause 8) to take into account the credit standing of the customers who had given the orders. The facts that the orders were filled and the debtor paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>by the customers served to remove any possible necessity for such -an inquiry. But those facts did not convert appellant\u2019s claim into a preferred claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">We see nothing in appellant\u2019s contention that appellant should have a preferred claim because the debtor\u2019s estate was, by appellant\u2019s services, enriched when debtor, having filled the orders, was paid. The estate was no more enriched than it would 'have been had the debtor bought goods on credit, before filing the arrangement and sold them afterwards; and no one would argue that the unpaid seller of such goods is entitled to more than a general claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">.
