He says it is indebted to him for that amount \u201cfor a sickness incurred as follows: * * He says that while on duty as a soldier in the Army of the United States he became ill and was confined to a hospital and that later he was discharged from the Army because of a neuropsychiatric condition. He alleges no facts to show that the defendant was <em>in </em>any way responsible for his illness, but he do.es allege that his \u201cclaim for compensation due to the aforesaid neuropsychiatric condition * * * was rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-18\">If these allegations state a cause of action at all it is for the pension provided for by section 701(a) of Title 38, U.S.C.A., which authorizes the payment of a pension to \u201cAny person who served in the active military or naval service and who is disabled as a result of disease or injury or aggravation of a preexisting disease or injury incurred in line of duty in such service.\u201d But section 705 expressly makes the decision of the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs \u201cfinal and conclusive on all questions of law and fact\u201d connected with a claim for a pension, and it says, \u201cno other official or court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review by mandamus or otherwise any such decision.\u201d See also section 11a \u2014 2 of Title 38 U.S.C.A., and Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434; Van Horne v. Hines 74 App.D.C. 214, 122 F.2d 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-20\">Both under these sections as well as under section 145 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 250, which denies to this court jurisdiction of claims for pensions, it is plain that defendant\u2019s plea must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-21\">Plaintiff\u2019s petition will be dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-22\">WHALEY, Chief Justice, and JONES and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-23\">MADDEN, Judge, took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
