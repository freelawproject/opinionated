By virtue of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case the devise to M: F. and A. V.

The trial court correctly held that the will of Mrs. S. H. Cockrell vested in Monroe F. and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell a fee simple title to the property in controversy. A devise to A. for his natural life with remainder to his heirs or the heirs of his body vests in the devisee a fee simple title. Lacey v. Floyd, 99 Texas, 112; Scott v. Brin, 107 S.

Worrill.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u201cFiled Sept. 8, 1893, L. H. Hughes, Clk. Co. Ct., by A. S. Jackson, Deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cSaid will was duly probated.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u201cThereafter in 1907, Alice H. Cockrell, joined by her husband, Frank M. Cockrell, brought suit in the 14th Judicial District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of Dallas County, against the above named Monroe F. and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell, and Mrs. Ettie F. Cockrell and her husband, Alex Cockrell, the petition in effect alleging that plaintiff owned in fee simple an undivided one-half interest in and to the \u2018Cockrell Building\u2019 (being the property here in controversy) : that Monroe F. and Alexander V. Cockrell jointly claimed title to the other one-half undivided interest by virtue of -the will of Mrs. S. H. Cockrell, their grandmother (setting out the 4th paragraph of said will), which had been probated. That the Probate Court of Dallas County had set aside to said Monroe F. and Alexander V. Cockrell a life estate in and to said Cockrell Building with remainder to their heirs and prohibited them from selling or alienating same. That while said will and said probate order purport to vest only a life estate in said property, plaintiff is informed and believes that said Monroe F. and Alexander V. Cockrell are vested with a perfect fee simple title in and to said property, without reversion or remainder to any person, with the full right and power to dispose of same at pleasure; that by reason of the said conditions some doubt might be cast upon the right, title and authority of the said Monroe F. and Alexander V. Cockrell, which tends to affect the interest of plaintiff herein, for the reason that said property is incapable of the partition as hereinafter set forth, and plaintiff can not sell her undivided interest in said property as to get full value. That said Monroe F. and Alexander V. Cockrell were unmarried and neither had ever been married, and that Ettie F. and Alex Cockrell are the parents and next heirs presumptive; that the interest of said M. F. and A. V. Cockrell has become encumbered for State and county and city taxes in excess of $7,000, for which they have had to borrow the money to pay, and the building requires a large sum in expenditure to properly preserve it and the value thereof, and defendants have not the means to make the necessary expenditures; that said building is constructed as an entirety and not susceptible of partition in land, and a sale thereof is necessary in order that plaintiff may realize the full value of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">\"Premises considered, plaintiff prays that all of said parties above named be made defendants herein, and that upon hearing hereof, she have judgment establishing her right to one-half of said property, and decreeing a sale thereof, and further prays that the court appoint a commissioner of partition to make said sale, and distribute the proceeds thereof, one-half of this to plaintiff and the other one-half to the said Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell, unless it shall be determined that said parties have only a life estate in said property, in which event plaintiff prays that her one-half of said proceeds be paid to her or to her order and that the court make such further orders and decrees with- reference to the other one-half of said property as to fully protect and preserve same for the owners thereof, according to such proportions as the court may decree such adverse parties entitled to, and plaintiff further prays for such other general and special legal and equitable relief as the facts may justify.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\"On October 2, 1907, judgment was rendered to the effect that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Alice H. Cockrell owned an undivided one-half interest in said building and that Monroe F. and Alexander V. Cockrell jointly are the owners in fee simple of the other one-half, and that the property was incapable of partition in specie. Also removing the apparent cloud from the interest of Monroe F. and Alexander V. Cockrell and vesting title in them as against all persons who might be held to come within the description of their heirs, etc., and ordering the sale of said property by a special commissioner for the purpose of partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">\u201cSaid judgment has never been in any manner appealed from or set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u201cIt is agreed that said Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell are both of lawful age and unmarried, and that neither of them has ever been married, and that both their parents are living, to wit: Alex Cockrell and Mrs. Ettie F. Cockrell, his wife, who are defendants in the suit above referred to, brought by Mrs. Alice N. Cockrell and husband against said Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u201cIt is agreed that in the above entitled suit brought by Mrs. Alice E\". Cockrell and Frank M. Cockrell against Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell, Alex Cockrell and Mrs. Ettie F. Cockrell, the defendants, Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell, adopted the pleadings of said Mrs. Alice H. Cockrell, as above set forth, and prayed that a decree be entered against all parties, removing all cloud from their title, which they claimed was an absolute fee simple title .in an undivided one-half interest in said property, and the defendants Alex Cockrell and Ettie F. Cockrell, his wife, answered by general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u201cSaid Harry L. Seav declined to carry out his contract above set forth, and accept the title to said property on the ground that there was a doubt as to whether or not said Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell had a fee simple title to the undivided one-half interest in said property claimed by them, or only a life estate, and that is the only question presented to this court for consideration, the plaintiffs herein claiming that the title of said Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell is a good and nm'fnet, fee simple title, it being agreed that Alice H. Cockrell has a good fee simple title to the other undivided one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u201cIt is agreed that if in fact said Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell have a fee simple title to the property above d\u00e9scribed, judgment shall be entered decreeing a specific performance of said contract against all parties hereto, both plaintiffs and defendant, as prayed for in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, and defendant\u2019s answer, and that the fact that their said title may have been in a measure clouded bv reason of the facts above set forth, shall' constitute no defense to this action in the event the court shall hold that in fact said Monroe F. Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell have a fee simple title to said property. A formal tender of conveyance in compliance with contract is waived as a' condition precedent to the suit and on trial hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u201cQuestion 1. Did the will of Mrs. S. H. Cockrell vest in Monroe F, Cockrell and Alexander Vardeman Cockrell the fee simple title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>in and to one-half the undivided interest in said property, being the property mentioned in paragraph 4 of the will as hny 5 story office house on north side of Main Street,\u2019 and are they by reason thereof empowered to convey such title?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u201cQuestion 2. Is the judgment of the 14th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, above mentioned, res adjudieata of the issue involved ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We are of opinion that the first question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Chancellor Kent in his Commentaries adopts, with slight modification, the statement of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, laid down by Mr. Preston as follows: \u201cWhen a person takes an estate of freehold, legally or equitably, under a deed, will, or other writing, and in. the same instrument there is a limitation by way of remainder, either with or without the interposition of another estate, of an interest of the same legal or equitable quality, to his heirs, or heirs of his body, as a class of persons to take in succession, from generation to generation, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the whole estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The rule in Shelley\u2019s ease is in force in this State. Hancock v. Butler, 21 Texas, 804; Lacy v. Floyd, 99 Texas, 112; Simonton v. White, 93 Texas, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Our Revised Statutes, article 627, provide that every \u201cestate ir lands which shall hereafter be . . . devised to one, although other words heretofore necessary at common law to transfer an estate in fee simple be not added, shall be deemed a fee simple, if a less estate be not limited by express words or do not appear to have been . . . devised by construction or operation of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Hnder this provision it is very clear, we think, that Monroe F. and Alexander Yardeman Cockrell took under paragraph four of the will, if it stood alone, a fee simple title to the property therein mentioned, including an undivided one-half interest in the five story office building on North side of Main Street, which is the property in controversy in this suit. But the question is whether the provision contained in the 8th paragraph of the will controls this So much of that paragraph as affects this question reads as follows: \u201cSaid Monroe and Aleck and Yardeman Cockrell, shall not sell a black that lies between Jefferson and Market or the half interest in the 5 story office building on Main at their death and shall revert to their heirs.\u201d This is somewhat confused, but we think it clearly means that Monroe F. and Alexander Yardeman Cockrell shall, not sell the half interest in the five story office building on Main Street during their lifetime, but upon their death it shall revert to their heirs. If the will conveys a fee simple estate the provision that the devisees shall not sell is clearly void. (Gray, Restraints on Alienation, para. 13.) If it convey a life estate we think the clause restraining its alienation equally void. (Brandon v. Robinson, 18 Ves. Jr., 429; McCormick Harvesting Co. v. Gates, 75 Iowa, 343; Henderson v. Harness, 176 Ill., 302; Gleason v. Fayweather, 4 Gray, 349.) Therefore we think that the provision has no bearing upon the question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Divested of the question of the effect of the provision which attempted to restrain the sale of the property by the devisees, it is clear, we think, that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case applies and that the word heirs, as here used, must be taken \u25a0 as words of limitation and not words of purchase. It is argued strenuously in behalf of appellant that because these provisions are found in a will and not in a deed they must receive a more liberal construction than if they were found in an instrument of the latter character. It is possible this rule may be correct, yet, under the provision which brings it so clearly within the rule .in question, we fail to see that there is any room for construction in applying the rule in Shelley\u2019s case as commonly laid down, and unless the will shows very clearly that the rule ought not to apply, it must be followed. We do not know how to argue what appears to us so plain a proposition. The devisees Monroe and Alex Cockrell are given a legal freehold estate by the 4th paragraph of the will and by the 8th there is a limitation to their heirs upon their .death, and therefore we think the case falls strictly within the , rule under discussion. This is a clearer case than Simonton and White, supra, where it was held the rule applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">The prohibition against the devisees selling the property is void. It is clearly a restraint upon alienation and in no manner affects the question under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The decision of this question renders it unnecessary to decide the second.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
