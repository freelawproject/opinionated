That your petitioners, hereinafter called the plaintiffs, are each railroad corporations, duly incorporated and- organized under the laws of the State of Texas, and were such at all times hereinafter mentioned. That plaintiff, the' Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway Company, is the lessee of and operating the railroad lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of the other plaintiffs under leases executed on or about the first day of December, 1903, there being a separate lease between the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company and each of the other plaintiffs. That each of said leases are for a term beginning December 1, 1903, and ending the 30th day of June, 1913, subject, hoAvever, to the tenth paragraph of each of said leases, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\">\u201c \u2018Tenth. If either of the parties hereto at any time during the continuance of the term of this lease, shall give to the other party written notice that it, the party giving such-notice, elects to terminate this lease on the last day of the third month after the month during which such notice shall be given, then this lease shall terminate on the last day of such third month after the month in which such written notice shall be given, anything herein contained to the contrary, notwithstanding/</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u201c \u2018That under the terms of said leases the said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company is entitled to operate the. railroads and exercise all of the franchises and rights of each of the other plaintiffs. That a copy of one of said leases is filed herewith, marked \u2018Exhibit 3\u2019 and made a part hereof; that the other lease is in identically the same language, except the description of the property leased. That the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Railway Company, and the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Great Northern Railway Company join as plaintiffs herein, because the rates and orders of the said Railroad Commission of Texas hereinafter complained of, affect the value of their respective properties. That the railroad of the said Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Railway Company extends from Beaumont, in Jefferson County, Texas, to Rogan, in Jasper County, Texas; and that the railroad of the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Great Northern Railway Company extends from said Rogan, in Jasper County, to Center, in Shelby County, State of Texas. That the distance from Beaumont to said Rogan is 62.44 miles, and the distance from said Rogan to Center is 77.7 miles. That there is a spur track of the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Railway extending from Call Junction, in Jasper County, Texas, to Call, in Newton County, Texas. That Kirbyville, a station on the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Railway, is 52.4 miles from Beaumont. That the distance from Beaumont to Port Arthur, via the Texarkana and Fort \u201cSmith Railway is 19.9 miles. That the distance from Beaumont to' Sabine Pass via the Texas &amp; New Orleans Railroad, formerly the Sabine &amp; East Texas Railroad, is 30 miles. That on April 1, 1899, or sometime prior thereto, the plaintiff, the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Railway Company and the Texarkana &amp; Fort Smith Railway Company, acting together, established a through rate of four (4) cents per hundred pounds on lumber from Kirby-ville and points between Kirbyville and Beaumont to Port Arthur, said rate, however, applying only to lumber in car loaded to a minimum of fifty thousand (50,000) pounds. That in the division of said rate between the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Railway Company, and the Texarkana &amp; Fort Smith Railway Company, each company was allowed or was entitled to two (2) cents. That the said rate was improvidently established, in the nature of an experiment, by the said Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Railway Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>and turned out, as hereinafter more specifically alleged, to be wholly unremunerative, unreasonable and unjust to it, the said Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Bailway Company. That thereafter, on or about the 18th day of March, 1900, the said Bailroad Commission made an order putting in effect said rate of four (4) cents per hundred pounds from Bogan and points between Bogan and Beaumont to. Sabine- Pass, with a minimum weight cof only 30,000 pounds of lumber to the car, and that said order was so made against the protest and without the consent of your petitioners or any of them. That on or before the 28th day of February, 1903, the said Bailroad Commission, without the consent of any of your petitioners, and over their objection and protest, made an order applying said four (4) cent rate to' Port Arthur on car loads of lumber with a minimum weight of only thirty thousand (30,000) pounds to the car. That at all tim\u00e9s herein mentioned the cars used by your petitioners and by the other railroads mentioned herein, could have been safely loaded with fifty thousand (50,000) pounds of lumber to the car, and can be so loaded hereafter. That your petitioner, the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Bailway Company, applied to the said Bailroad Commission for permission and authority to cancel said four (4) cent rate, both to Port Arthur and Sabine Pass, and that such petition to cancel such rate was denied by said Commission on April 7, 1900, and that another petition of said Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Bailway Company to cancel said rate was denied on December 27, 1900\u00cd That on May 16, 1903, the said Bailroad Commission, by its Chairman, advised in writing the General Freight Agent of the Gulf, Beaumont &amp; Kansas City Bailway Company that no specific authority was granted by the said Bailroad Commission for said rate of four (4) -cents per hundred pounds from Kirbyville and points south thereof to Port Arthur, but that as it was applied, the said Bailroad Commission had declined to authorize its cancellation, the position of the said Bailroad Commission apparently being that because thp railroad company had once made a mistake in putting in a rate which was too low and unremunerative that it should be compelled to continue such rate in effect unto the end of time. That on or about the 8th day of April, 1904, the said Bailroad -Commission, without the consent of any of your petitioners, and over their objection and protest, by an order made on the 18th day of March, 1904, put said rate of four (4) cents per hundred pounds in effect from Bogan and points between Bogan and Kirbyville to Sabine Pass and Port Arthur. That Bogan is distant from Beaumont 62.44 miles.

That on February <em>12, </em>1906, the said Bailroad Commission again refused to cancel, amend or increase the said rates, but continued the same in full force and effect. That said rates and each and all of them are unreasonable and unjust to your petitioners, and to each of your petitioners. That as aforesaid, the division of said four cent rate only allows to your petitioners the sum of two cents per hundred pounds with a minimum of only thirty thousand pounds to the car for the haul from Bogan and points south of Bogan to Beaumont, and that the division of said six cent rate only allows to your petitioner for the haul from points north of Bogan to and including Center to Beaumont, the sum of four cents per hundred pounds. That the said two and four cents per hundred pounds, respectively, are wholly insufficient to compensate your petitioners for the service performed. That the same not only do not adequately compensate your petitioners for the service rendered in the transportation of such lumber, but that the said rates are insufficient to pay the actual expense of performing the service, and that the services under such rates are rendered by your petitioners at an actual loss. That the said rates are wholly insufficient to compensate your petitioners for the cost of the service and the same do not enable your petitioners to earn enough for the transportation of lumber under such rates to contribute anything towards the payment of the value of the use of the said railroads, or to contribute anything towards a fair return on the value of the said railroads or the cost thereof, and are not, have not been, and will not be sufficient to pay the actual cost of transporting the lumber, without contributing anything towards the expense of the repair or maintenance of said railroads, the taxes thereon or the interest on the value thereof, but that the effect of the said rates is, has been, and will be to require your petitioners to give the use of the said railroads to shippers of lumber on said rates free and without any compensation, and without reasonable compensation, or any compensation whatever for the use of said railroads, either to the owners thereof, or to the said lessee thereof, and at an actual loss on each car of lumber shipped on such rates, and your petitioners aver that the earnings remaining after paying operating expenses (not including in operating spurs, taxes, rentals, interest on bonds, or other indebtedness or dividend on capital stock) of said railroads at the end of each week, month and year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>would have been greater during all the times mentioned herein had the lumber shipped to Port Arthur and Sabine Pass on such rates never been shipped at all, and that such will continue to be the case as long as such rates are in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u201c \u2018That the rates herein complained of are, have been, and will be in the future much lower than necessary to freely move the shipments of lumber; that under the rates which your petitioners so. requested the Railroad Commission of Texas to permit them to charge, the manufacturers of lumber and the shippers of lumber could have in the past freely shipped their lumber, and can in the future freely ship their lumber from all stations on said lines of railroad from Center to and inclusive of the first station north of Beaumont, to Sabine Pass and Port Arthur, and \" there sold, the same heretofore shipped and can sell the same hereafter shipped, at a profit of more than 25 percent, being a much higher profit than they obtained in the past on lumber shipped to and sold at-any other place or places in the State of Texas or elsewhere, and can obtain in the future by shipping lumber. to and selling lumber at any other place or places in the State of Texas, or elsewhere; that the manufacturers of lumber in the territory north of Beaumont to Center, inclusive of the latter place, adjacent to and tributary to said lines of railroad, could have in the past and can in the future manufacture and ship lumber, paying the rates thereon which your petitioners asked the Railroad Commission' of Texas to establish to Sabine Pass and Port Arthur, and there have sold or sell .the said lumber at a profit of at least 25 percent, being a much higher profit than they could have realized in the past or can realize in the future by. shipping lumber to and selling lumber at any \"other place or places in the . State of Texas or elsewhere. . That the effect of the unreasonably low rates complained of herein was and is to enable the manufacturers of lumber in said territory to ship lumber therefrom to Sabine Pass and Port Arthur, and there sell lumber at a higher rate of profit than can be obtained by shipping lumber (from the same places) to and selling lumber at any other place or places in the State of Texas or .elsewhere, and have sold and to hereafter sell said lumber at Port Arthur and Sabine Pass for less prices than they sold or. hereafter can sell similar lumber for at any other place or places in the State of Texas or elsewhere; that the towns or cities of Port Arthur and Sabine Pass, and the citizens thereof have been in the past, are now, and will be' in the future, more wealthy, owners of more property in value per capita, and have enjoyed and will enjoy larger profits from their respective occupations and greater prosperity than any other towns or .cities or the citizens thereof, of similar population in the State of Texas; that is not now and has not been since the low rates herein complained of were in effect, any pestilence, flood, storm, fire or other calamity in said towns or cities or either of- them or any fact which would justify, call for, or even suggest lower rates on lumber or other freights for the same service or distances to such towns or either of them, than to other places in the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">\u2018\u201cThat the distance between stations north of Beaumont on said lines of railroad, and Beaumont, are as follows, the distance, set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>opposite each station being the distance from said station to Beaumont :</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">Stations.

Did the trial court err in sustaining the general demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 petition? To reduce this general question to those that we especially desire the court to answer, we propound the following additional questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u201c3. Was it necessary for the plaintiffs, in attacking the order of the Eailroad Commission, fixing the rates in question on lumber between the points named in the petition, as unjust and unreasonable, to allege that the entire body of rates on other commodities was unjust and unreasonable ? Or, in other words, that the rates on other commodities transported would not furnish the railway companies a reasonable earning or profit on the investment, considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>as embraced in the term \u2018investment\u2019 all matters upon and for which the railroads would be entitled to an earning or profit?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\u201c3. Repeating this last question in a different form, we suggest that as the plaintiffs\u2019 petition alleges that by reason of the order of the- Commission the railway companies were required to transport lumber under the rates in question without some compensation for such services, or at a loss of $1000 a month, was it necessary, in order to show that such order was unreasonable and unjust to further allege and show that from other commodities transported by the railroads there\u2018would not result a reasonable profit or earning?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u201c4. Would an order of the Railroad Commission fixing rates for transportation of a commodity, which would result in a loss for such services to the railway companies of a sum alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, or that would not furnish the railway companies for such services performed some compensation therefor, have the effect of, depriving the railway companies of their property without due process of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u201c5. Would it be just and reasonable to the railway companies, or would it be a fair and just discrimination, or would it be in effect class legislation to require the railway companies to transport commodities of a certain class of shippers at a loss to the railway companies, or at a fixed rate that would not furnish to the railway companies some compensation for the services rendered?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u201c6. Would it be lawful, just and reasonable for the Railroad Commission by its order, to permit a shipper or class of shippers to have his or their traffic transported for less than the \u2022 cost of carriage, and without any compensation to the carrier for the services performed, or the value of the property devoted to the use thereof, expecting the carrier to obtain a fair compensation for the general use of its property from other shippers ?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u201cWe desire to explain that in using the expression- \u2018traffic,\u2019 \u2018commodity\u2019 and \u2018shipment\u2019 in the foregoing questions, we merely intend to apply these terms to domestic shipments within this State, and do not intend that they shall be considered in connection with interstate traffic. The court\u2019s attention is called to this in view of the rule announced in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S., 466; s. c. 43 L. ed., 197, and Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul R. R. Co. v. the Minnesota Railway Commission, 186 U. S., 260, 46 L. ed., 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u201cThese questions, in our opinion, are all raised by the appellants in their briefs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The first question propounded presents the whole .case, to which we answer, the court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">This action is authorized by the following sections of the Revised Statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">\u201cArt. 4565. If any railroad company or other party at interest be dissatisfied with the decision of any rate, classification, rule, charge, order, act or regulation adopted by the commission, such dissatisfied, company or party may file a petition setting forth the particular cause or causes of objection to such decision, act; rate, rule, charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>classification or order, or to either or all of them, in a court of com* petent jurisdiction in Travis County, Texas, against said commission as defendant. Said action shall have precedence over all other causes on the docket of a different nature, and shall be tried and determined- as other civil causes in said court. Either party to said action may appeal to the Appellate Court having jurisdiction of . said cause, and said appeal shall be at once returnable to said Appellate Court, at either of its terms, and said action so appealed shall have precedence in said Appellate Court of all causes of a different character therein pending; provided, that if the court be in session at the time such right of action accrues, the suit may be filed during such term and stand ready for trial after ten days\u2019 notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\">\u201cArt. 4566. In all trials under the foregoing article the burden of proof shall rest upon the plaintiff, who must show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the rates, regulations, orders, classifications, acts or charges complained of are unreasonable and itnjust to it or them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">It will be observed that the railroad company under these sections had the right to attack any rate, or it might have attacked any number or all of the rates prescribed for it by the Railroad Commission as being unreasonable and unjust. It is plain from the terms of the law that the railroad company was not required to attack all of the rates prescribed, nor is it necessary in order to show the unreasonableness or injustice of the rate attacked to prove that the operation of the road under the rates prescribed will not produce a reasonable and just compensation for services rendered by the company to shippers and a reasonable return upon the investment made and the money expended in carrying on the business. Railroad Commission v. Houston &amp; T. C. Ry. Co., 90 Texas, 352; Same v. Weld &amp; Neville, 96 Texas, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">While the railroad company had the right to call in question the one rate, it was required to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the rate so attacked was \u201cunjust and unreasonable.\u201d It follows that the petition must contain allegations of such facts and circumstances as would, if true, authorize the court to adjudge the rate to be unjust and unreasonable as a matter of law. The petition in this case' alleges that hauling lumber over that portion of its road designated in the petition, at the rate specified by the Commission, will not yield a sufficient revenue to pay the cost of transportation. There is nothing in the petition to show what were \u25a0 the earnings of the railroad in hauling lumber over the remainder of its said railroad. It does not show the amount of lumber traffic carried over that road from points beyond the stations designated from which the objectionable tariffs are prescribed. It may be and doubtless is a fact that trains which start from points beyond the specified stations take up and carry as a part thereof cars loaded with lumber destined to Beaumont or Port Arthur, thus the operation of that train may yield a sufficient profit to make the rates reasonable, whereas, taken separately, the rate from any one of the poiiits, if carried by separate trains, would not be reasonable. It may be true that such freight, -though not remunerative, considered alone, would, when thus carried, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>contribute to the cost of such train to a degree that would be reasonable compensation, therefore the rates can not be held, upon the facts stated, unreasonable and unjust as a matter of law. The railroad company can not select one rate and a particular part of its road for the application of that rate, showing thereby the deficiency in profit, and from that establish that the rate is not reasonable. (St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Gill, 156 U. S., 649.) In the case cited the court said: \u201cThe company can not claim the right to earn a net profit from every mile, section, or other part into which the road might be divided, nor attack as unjust a regulation which fixed a rate at which some such part would be unremunerative; that it would be practically impossible to ascertain in what proportion the several parts should share with others in the expenses and receipts in which they participated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">We think it unnecessary to discuss the other questions submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Opinion filed December <em>2, </em>1908.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">ON MOTION POE REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In making our former answer to the questions propounded by the Court of Civil Appeals we assumed that the railroads operated by the appellant extended beyond Center to the north, and, upon that assumption, we based our conclusion. We were mistaken as to that fact; the two railroads by connecting with each other reach from Beaumont to Center and terminate at the latter place, the appellant operating no road beyond Center, therefore, we grant the motion for a rehearing and will re-examine the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">This action was brought under articles 4565 and 4566 of the Revised Statutes, which are copied in our former opinion. In the case of Railroad Commission v. Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad Co., 90 Texas, 340, this court held that in a proceeding under those articles of the statute it was not necessary for the railroad company to show that the rate attacked was confiscatory, but that the issue was whether or not, under all the facts and circumstances, the rate was unreasonable and unjust, and, in answer to the second question propounded in that case, the court said: \u201cIn actions of this character the courts will determine the question of reasonableness and justice of any matter by the same rules as if it were an issue in other classes of suits, except as to the conclusive character of the evidence.\u201d (90 Texas, 355; Weld v. Neville, 96 Texas, 404.) If articles 4565 and 4566 had not been enacted by the Legislature the courts would have no authority to revise rates made by -the Railroad Commission, but in the exercise of their equity\" powers the courts could enjoin such rates if found to be confiscatory; that is, violative of the Constitution of this State or the Hnited States. Those articles conferred authority upon the courts to examine into the reasonableness and justice of such rates and in the exercise of that jurisdiction the courts will try the questions as if they arose in any other proceeding. Article 4566 places the citizen in such an action as this upon the same footing as it does the railroad corporations and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>quires of such citizen who may be a shipper upon the railroad to make just as clear and conclusive proof of the unreasonableness or injustice of the rates as is required of a railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\">It is true that by article 4566 the railroad company, or shipper, who attacks the rate or order of the Commission, has the burden to show by \u201cclear and satisfactory evidence\u201d that the rat\u00e9 or order, etc., attacked in the proceeding is unjust and unreasonable in its effect upon such carrier or person. The question presented to us is, if the facts alleged in the applicant\u2019s petition shall be established by \u201cclear and satisfactory evidence,\u201d would a jury be authorized to find a verdict that such rates, charges, etc., were unreasonable and unjust to the appellant? In passing upon the question we must consider the allegations in the petition as facts proved by \u201cclear, satisfactory and uncontroverted evidence.\u201d It is a matter of common knowledge that lumber is one of the principal articles of transportation on the railroads and a chief source of income. \u2022 It being true that the revenue derived from hauling lumber over the appellant\u2019s road does not yield sufficient revenue to pay for the costs of transporting it, not including interest on investment, taxes or other expenses, th\u00e9re could be no reasonable doubt that such rate applied to lumber would be unreasonable and unjust to that railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">. It does not follow that a railroad company might select an unimportant article and attack the rate prescribed for that as being unreasonable because it would not pay for the transportation of such article alone. Public carriers must of necessity carry many things which of themselves would not compensate them for the carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The trial court erred by sustaining the demurrer to plaintiffs petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Opinion filed March 10, 1909.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
