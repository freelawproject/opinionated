While the two laws levy the tax upon a different basis, one upon mileage of track and the other upon gross receipts, they are essentially and confessedly the same character of tax, viz.: occupation tax, and in the absence of express provision to the ' contrary, the latter act must be construed as intended to supersede and take the place of the older act, if not in toto, at least to the extent that the two acts cover the same subjects of taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-17\">There is nothing in the Act of 1907 levying occupation tax upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the basis of gross receipts which evidences legislative intent that this occupation tax should be in addition to the occupation tax levied by the law of 1897 upon the basis of mileage of track. Section 22, wherein it is provided \"except as herein stated, all other taxes now levied by law,\u201d manifestly was intended to have reference to other forms of taxes, such as ad valorem, franchise tax, etc., and not to occupation taxes levied by former laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-3\">While the Act of 1907 contains no general repealing clause of laws in conflict and no clause expressly repealing the Act of 1897, as it embraces the same subject matter, viz.: occupation tax upon street car companies, adopting a new basis for the levy of such tax, and without expressly preserving in force the old occupation tax, it is manifest that the later act was intended as a substitute for the older, and therefore operates as an implied repeal of the old occupation tax upon street car companies.

It has been continuously held by the courts of this State that, under a Constitution demanding that taxes shall be equal and uniform, double taxation can not be tolerated. Gillespie v.

Jaqua, 114 Ind., 246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b630-3\">Should it be conceded that, insofar as the State of Texas is affected, two occupation taxes upon the' same occupation are authorized by section 22 of the Act under consideration, nevertheless, it is beyond controversy that the county of Dallas had no right of recovery herein, and the judgment herein is erroneous insofar as it permits a recovery in its behalf. We again quote the section: \u201cSec. 22: Except as herein stated, all taxes levied by this Act shall be in addition to all other taxes now levied by law; <em>provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing any county or city to levy an occupation tax on the occupations and business taxed by this Act.\u201d </em>It is difficult to understand how clearer language can be used than that employed in the section quoted, with reference to the rights of counties and cities in the premises. The court, by some processs, which we do not follow, construes the italicized words to mean that no county or city shall be authorized to levy the same tax as that imposed by the Act, but there is nothing in the section even remotely to justify such a perversion of the plain intent and meaning of words used.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b630-4\"><em>Robert V.

Lewelling, </em>County Attorney, and <em>James L. Goggans, </em>for Dallas County.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amh\">While the Act of 1897 and the Act of 1907, both of which are under consideration herein, are each, eo nomine, occupation tax laws and each- levies an occupation tax on street railway companies, the levies are each made upon a different basis, and it appears that not only under the general rules of construction is there no conflict between the two acts, and that the latter act was not intended as a substitute for the former, but the latter act contains an \u201cexpression to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b630-6\">When the Act of 1907 provided in sec. 22 that \u201cexcept as herein stated, all taxes levied by this act shall be in addition to all other taxes now levied by law,\u201d it meant except as stated in the very act of which these words form a part; and, inasmuch as section 25 of the same act contains the only exception provided in the act, section 22 should be construed just as if it read \u201call taxes levied by this act shall be in addition to all other taxes now levied by law, except those enumerated in section 25 hereof.\u201d The terms \u201call other taxes now levied by law\u201d as used in said section 22, are broad enough to include and in fact do include not only taxes such as ad valorem, franchise, etc., but also occupation taxes of whatever description.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b630-7\">As repeals by implication are not favored, especially where the rights of the public are involved, it must clearly appear that there is a necessary conflict between the two acts or that the latter was intended as a substitute for the former before the court could decree such repeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>There is a provision in the Act of 1907 \u201cexpressly preserving in force the old occupation tax.\u201d Acts of 1907, 479-489, particularly secs. 10, <em>22 </em>and 25; Acts of 1897, Special Session, pages 49-58, subsecs. 54, 56; Sayles\u2019 Rev. Stats., art. 5049, subsec. 54; House Journal, Thirtieth Legislature, First Called Session, pages 62-68, 72, 111, 113 and 405; 1 Sutherland Statutory Construction, (2d ed.), pages 461, etc.; 4 Words and Phrases, 3281.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-3\">Ho authorities are needed to establish the proposition that repeals by implication are not favored. The general rules as to repeal of prior statutes by subsequent statutes are well stated in Lewis\u2019 Sutherland Statutory Construction, vol. 1, second edition, pages 461 et seq. It is also a rule that a statute in derogation of an existing statute will be strictly construed, in consequence of the rule that implied repeals are regarded with disfavor. (Id., p. 472.) The intention to repeal will not be presumed, nor the effect of repeal admitted, unless the inconsistency is unavoidable, and only to the extent of the repugnance. It is the duty of the court, if possible, to so construe the act that both shall be operative. (Id., pp. 464-466.) Bepeals by implication are avoided if possible. (Id., p. 510.) Every presumption is against the surrender of taxing power, and- doubt must be resolved in favor of the State. (Id., vol. 2, p. 1002.) Where the statute prescribes a general rule, with certain named exceptions, the court will not add to the latter by implication. Roberts v. Yarboro, 41 Texas, 452; Wallace v. Stevens, 74 Texas, 559. Affirmative words in a statute imply a negative of what is not affirmed. Bryan v. Sundberg, 5 Texas, 423; State v. Hutchings, 32 S. W. Rep., 315. The words, \u201cexcept as herein stated,\u201d mean except as stated in the very act or chapter of which they form a part. 4 Words and Phrases, p. 3281. The Legislature has in that chapter excepted certain occupation taxes (section 25); showing conclusively that such taxes were given consideration. Bevenue laws are always construed most liberally to effect the end and aim of supplying the government with the means of sustaining its existence. Aulanier v. The Governor, 1 Texas, 665. In passing an act, the Legislature has a right to say what interpretation shall be placed thereon, and its declaration is binding upon the court as to matters arising thereafter. Snyder v. Compton, 87 Texas, 378. A new statute does not repeal an old one by implication, unless there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two. Herndon v. Reed, 82 Texas, 651. While repeals by implication are not favored, there is a rule that a subsequent statute revising the subject matter of a former one, and evidently intended as a substitute for it, must operate as a repeal of the former to the extent to which its provisions are supplied or repealed. Tunstall v. Wormley, 54 Texas, 480. Where there are express words of repeal in the later statute, so far as the two statutes are inconsistent, there is no room for construction save as to the question of conflict, and, insofar as they do conflict, the later act must prevail, but not further. State v. International &amp; G. N. R. R. Co., 57 Texas, 550.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-4\">We think that the terms \u201call other,\u201d as used in the Act of 1907, are just as comprehensive and broad as can be briefly made. Kellett v. Kellett, 94 Texas, 206; Callaway v. Boroughs, 19 S. W., 611.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The construction of the words \u201cin addition to all other taxes,\u201d etc., contended for by appellant, it occurs to us, is directly the opposite of the generally recognized rule of construction embodied in the doctrine of \u201cejusdem generis,\u201d which is to the effect that \u201cwhere an enumeration of specific things is followed by some more general word or phrase, such general word or phrase is to be held to refer to things of the same kind.\u201d Spalding v. People, 49 N. E., 993-6; Williams v. Williams, 16 Tenn., 20-26; Harmon v. Jennings, 22 Maine, 240.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-4\">The \u201cequality and uniformity\u201d clause in article 8, section 1, Constitution of Texas, does not refer to occupation taxes and, subject to the provisions of article 8, section 2, of the Constitution of Texas, the Legislature has a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing such taxes. Where the classification is upon a reasonable or proper basis and the amount so fixed is not in the aggregate unreasonable, prohibitory or confiscatory, the Legislature may, in the exercise of its discretion, levy more than one occupation tax on certain occupations, and any party complaining of such tax has the burden of showing its unreasonableness. Constitution of Texas, art. 8, sec. 2; State v. Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co., 100 Texas, 153; Texas Company v. Stephens, 100 Texas, 628; Brown v. City of Galveston, 97 Texas, 1; 21 Am. and Eng.

S., 226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-5\">The provision in section 1 of article 8 of the Constitution of Texas that \u201ctaxation shall be equal and uniform\u201d applies only to a direct tax on property and not to occupation taxes, and does not limit the power of the Legislature as to the subjects- of taxation, being intended only to prevent the arbitrary taxation of property according to kind or qualify without regard to value. City of Newton v. Atchison, 1 Pac., 288; Phoenix Carpet Company v. State, 22 So., 627; Beebe v. Wells, 15 Pac., 565.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-6\">The only restrictive provision to be found in the Constitution- of Texas concerning occupation taxes which is material here, is in section 2 of article 8, which declares that \u201call occupation taxes shall be equal and uniform upon the same class of subjects within the limits of the authority levying the tax.\u201d Texas Banking Company v. State, 42 Texas, 636; Taylor v. Boyd, 63 Texas, 541; Higgins v. Bordages, 88 Texas, 461. As an illustration of the wide discretion of the Legislature in this connection, we call the court\u2019s attention to Armour Packing Company v. Lacy, 200 U. S., 226; Metropolitan Street Ry. v. New York, 199 U. S., 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-7\">Of the Act of 1907 it may fairly be said that it \u201cdoes not discriminate against some and favor others, but though limited in its application does within the sphere of its operation affect alike all persons similarly situated.\u201d This is also true of the Act of 1907 even when considered in connection with the Act of 1897, assuming that they are both still in full force and effect. Merchants Life Assn. v. Yoakum, 98 Fed., 271; Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U. S., 27; Cooley on Taxation (3d ed.), p. 72 et seq.; Amer. and Eng.

State v. Galveston H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co., 100 Texas, 153.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b633-3\">Mr. Justice Williams</author>\n<p id=\"Aho\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The question in this case is whether or' not so much of the Act of 1897 as levied an occupation tax upon street railway companies of $2.00 per mile of their roads was repealed by the Act of May 16th, 1907, levying an occupation tax upon the same companies, consisting of a percentage of their gross earnings. (Art. 5049, Subd. 54, Sayles Stat.; Laws 30th Leg., 479-489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\u2022 We quite agree with counsel for plaintiff in error, that a statute may impliedly repeal an earlier one by entirely superseding it, although there be nothing in the provisions of the two which might not stand together if all of them were inserted in one Act. This kind of \"repeal by implication is familiar and takes place when the later Act manifests a clear intention to cover the entire subject of the earlier one and to substitute its own provisions for the others to govern and regulate that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We also agree that the ordinary implication arising from a statute which merely imposes an occupation tax is that it is to be the only tax upon the occupation\u2014all that the State proposes to charge for the pursuit of it; and that we should naturally look for some expression of a different intent when it exists. This much was frankly conceded at the argument by counsel representing the State. The Act of 1907 does contain such expressions as make it clear to our minds that the occupation tax imposed by it on street railway companies was intended as an additional tax and not as a substitution of that previously charged. Such expression is found in Section 22 as follows: \u201cExcept as herein stated all taxes levied by this Act shall be in addition to all other taxes now levied by law, provided that nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing any county or city to levy an occupation tax on the occupations and business taxed by this Act.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Counsel for plaintiff in error attempt to limit this sweeping reference to \u201call other taxes\u201d so that it would mean other kinds of taxes than occupation taxes, and the suggestion, at first, struck us with much force; but the intention thus imputed to the Legislature is made improbable even by the language of this section wherein it denies to the counties the power to levy Occupation taxes of the kind levied by this Act. If it also repeals former statutes levying occupation taxes it at once deprives the counties of all power to charge occupation taxes against the corporations here taxed and it is not probable that such a consequence was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Looking to Section 25 of the Act we find that a large part of the taxes referred to by the words of Section 22\u2014\u201cexcept as herein stated\u201d\u2014as those which are <em>not </em>to be charged in addition to those \u201clevied by this Act,\u201d were the occupation taxes imposed by the Act of 1905, When, therefore, the Legislature provided by Section 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>that the taxes levied should be in addition to all other taxes with exceptions defined by the Act itself, some of which exceptions were occupation taxes, it is plain that occupation taxes were in mind and that all but those excepted were included in the words \u201call other taxes\u201d in addition to which those imposed by the Act were to be collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The explanation of this additional imposition as an occupation tax is found in the fact that the necessity for increased revenues for the support of the State Government had arisen and had led to the adoption of the policy of taxing certain corporations and businesses upon the basis of their gross receipts, which policy was carried into the Act of 1905, of which the Act of 1907 is largely a revision. The purpose of this legislation, as expressed throughout the former statute and in Section 22 of the latter, was to raise additional revenue to meet a deficit and to provide means for the support of the government, and not, generally, to supplant entirely the existing revenue measures. And hence it was that an additional charge was laid to make up the occupation tax to be paid in future by those mentioned in these acts. If one statute had provided for an occupation tax to consist of the prescribed mileage and also of the percentage of the gross receipts there would be no conflict between the provisions and no question to decide. As it is, the question exists only because of the implication which might arise if the last statute merely levied an occupation tax without expression of intention as to that already levied by other laws. That implication is excluded by the express provisions to which we have referred and no room is left for the contention that the Act of 1907 repeals the part of the Act of 1897 relating to street railway companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
