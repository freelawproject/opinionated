On trial before the court, judgment was for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed, and on affirmance obtained writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-13\">The case, filed in 1905, stood at the term preceding trial upon the nonjury docket, which, by order of the court, was set for trial on the first week of the succeeding term, for which week no jury was summoned. On the first day of that term, June 10, 1907, and at the first call of the nonjury docket, plaintiff demanded a jury and tendered the fee. The demand was refused and the case proceeded to trial before the court, plaintiff introducing his evidence. The Appellate Court held that plaintiff was entitled to a jury, but that the refusal was harmless because, upon the evidence, the defendants would have been entitled to a peremptory instruction in their favor. So much of the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals as relates to this ruling is here given, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-15\">PLEASANTS, Chief Justice. \u201cWe are of opinion, however, that this error of the trial court does not require nor authorize a reversal of the judgment, because the undisputed evidence adduced upon the trial would have required a verdict in favor of the appellees, and if a jury had been impaneled to try the case it should have been instructed to find for the defendants. Such being the state of the evidence, no injury resulted to appellant from the refusal of the court to comply with its demand for a jury, and the error in refusing such demand was harmless. ;.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ON MOTION EOR REHEARING.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\">\u201cIn holding, in the main opinion in this case, that the error of the trial court in refusing appellant\u2019s request for a jury does not require a reversal of the judgment, because, had there been a trial by jury, no other verdict than one in favor of the appellees could have been properly rendered under the undisputed evidence adduced on the trial, we do not intend to announce the rule that a party who has been wrongfully deprived of his right to a jury trial is required to submit his cause to the court. It may be that the party thus denied a trial by jury can stand upon his rights and decline to offer any evidence or to recognize the right of the court to proceed with the trial, and in such case would be entitled to have any judgment which might be rendered against him reversed because of the refusal of the court to grant his request for a jury; but this record does not present a case of this kind. The judgment recites that after the refusal of the court to grant appellant\u2019s request for a jury the parties by their attorneys submitted The matters in controversy, as well of fact as of law, to the court, and the evidence and argument of counsel having been heard and fully understood it is considered by the court,\u2019 etc. There is nothing in the record to negative the presumption that the facts of the case were fully developed. The appellant having submited its entire case to the court, and taken its chances on a favorable judgment, is not in the position to claim a reversal of the judgment because of the error of the court in refusing its request for a jury, when the case made by the undisputed evidence is one in which no other verdict than one in favor of appellees could have been rendered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-5\"><em>H.

The point is sufficiently discussed in the opinion of Chief Justice Pleasants. Having held thus, the Court of Civil Appeals refused to reverse the judgment of the trial judge rendered upon a hearing without a jury, because it was thought no injury was done, inasmuch as the court would have been justified upon the evidence in instructing a verdict against the plaintiffs in error if a jury had been allowed. We think this is not a sufficient answer to the complaint. There were questions of fact in the case upon which plaintiffs in error were entitled by both the Constitution and the statute to have a jury pass. The trial court in order to render the judgment had to find facts which it was the right of the plaintiffs in error to have only a jury find; and such findings can not support a judgment thus erroneously rendered. The following authorities are in point: American Mtg. Co. v. Hutchinson, 19 Ore., 334; In re Robinson, 106 Cal., 493; Hinchly v. Machine, 15 N. J. Law, 476; Swasey v. Adair, 88 Cal., 179; Chasteen v. Martin, 81 N. C., 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Whether or not the trial court \"might properly have instructed a verdict had the case been tried before a jury with evidence the same as that adduced before him, may admit of grave doubt; but however that may be, it can not be assumed for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the denial of the right to a jury that, had it been allowed, the evidence would have been the same in all respects as that before the judge. We think it clear that if such an error can ever be cured by such a reason, it would only be when it is clear beyond peradventure that there were no facts to be found from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
