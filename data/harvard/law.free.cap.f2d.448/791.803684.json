The solicitor\u2019s brief in support of the petition concedes to appellant claims 4, 7, and 8, drawn to processes of making \u201ccups,\u201d and claim 17, drawn to a \u201ccup,\u201d but asks reversal of our decision as to claims 1, 2, 10,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 11, and 13, drawn broadly to processes of making \u201ccontainers,\u201d and claims 3, 12, and 14-16, drawn to \u201ccontainers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-19\">This distinction between the two groups of claims is based (1) on appellants\u2019 specification, in which it is stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-20\">While the invention is of particular importance in the manufacture of <em>cwps </em>it is also useful in preparing other open <em>containers </em>such as food trays, buckets, plates and other foamed articles, e. g. face masks [emphasis ours],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhO\">and (2) on the ratio decidendi of our opinion, which was that appellants\u2019 evidence of commercial success and the satisfaction of a long-felt need, both the success and the need being with respect to \u201ccups\u201d used in vending machines, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>sufficient to overcome the Patent Office\u2019s case of prima facie obviousness. The solicitor\u2019s position is that the objective evidence of non-obviousness is not commensurate with the scope of claims 1-3 and 10-16, reciting \u201ccontainers\u201d generally, but establishes non-obviousness only with respect to \u201ccups\u201d and processes of making them. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Contrary to the assertion in appellants\u2019 brief in opposition to the petition, the solicitor <em>did </em>argue this distinction in his principal brief, if only in discussing product claim 17. He then said \u201cthe evidence shows only commercial success for <em>cups </em>and not <em>containers </em>broadly.\u201d We therefore cannot agree with appellants that this is a distinction made for the first time on this petition. We overlooked this point in rendering our original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">As the solicitor now points out, it is the view of this court that objective evidence of non-obviousness must be commensurate in scope with the claims which the evidence is offered to support. In re Law, 303 F.2d 951, 954, 49 CCPA 1157, 1162 (1962); In re Kennedy, 436 F.2d 1394, 1399, 58 CCPA 916 (1971); and In re McLaughlin, 443 F.2d 1392, 1396-1397, 58 CCPA 1310 (1971). Here, appellants\u2019 claims 1-3 and 10-16 are too broad in the sense of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 in that they are inclusive of subject matter which is prima facie obvious and concerning which appellants have <em>not </em>rebutted the Patent Office\u2019s prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Accordingly, our decision of June 10, 1971, is modified for the above-stated reasons to reverse only with respect to claims 4, 7, 8, and 17 and to affirm the rejection of the remaining appealed claims, 1-3 and 10-16. The opinion shall be deemed amended to so state.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-12\"> Actually, claim 10 contains both the word \u201ccontainer,\u201d by dependency from claim 1, and the phrase \u201cin the major portion of the cup wall means,\u201d but there is no antecedent in either claim 1 or claim 10 for \u201cthe cup wall means\u201d and it cannot be deemed limited to \u201ccups\u201d for want of a clear limitation. Of. note 1 in our June 10 opinion as to related defects in claim language. 443 F.2d 394, 395, 58 CCPA 1277.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
