The essence of plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the failure to provide a full trial type hearing upon his discharge from his position as a junior high school teacher constituted a denial of due process. Jurisdiction is asserted under the Fourteenth Amendment and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1964) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1964). Since we find that the complaint does not state a claim properly cognizable in the federal court, we affirm the determination of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Plaintiff Canty is the holder of a substitute teacher\u2019s license in the New York City school system. In September 1969 he was engaged to teach science at Junior High School No. 136 as a regular substitute teacher, a probationary status. One month later, he was given an unsatisfactory performance rating and discharged on an emergency basis, that is, without the 10 days notice and severance pay to which he would otherwise be entitled. Plaintiff\u2019s principal gave various reasons for this action. These included charges that plaintiff kept children in school for several hours after class, that plaintiff used physical force on children, that his language and grammar were deficient, that he was late for a class and was found sleeping in the teacher\u2019s room when a pupil was dispatched to locate him, that an inordinate number of children were referred to the dean by plaintiff without reason for the referrals, and that plaintiff was absent from school on two occasions for which an explanation was requested but never given.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Plaintiff denies the truth of these charges and asserts that students in his class were out to \u201cget rid\u201d of him and made false complaints, that he was marking papers, not sleeping, in the teachers room, and that his absences were caused by his being held incommunicado in a North Carolina jail, after his arrest in a local speed trap.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Plaintiff secured a hearing before the New York City Human Rights Commission where it was stipulated that the complaint filed with the Commission would be dismissed if the Board of Education provided a hearing for plaintiff. Such a hearing was granted as a \u201cStep 1\u201d grievance procedure pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Board of Education and the United Federation of Teachers. The Board upheld the principal\u2019s finding of an emergency, justifying plaintiff\u2019s discharge without notice and pay. At the \u201cStep 2\u201d grievance level, however, this determination was reversed and the plaintiff was awarded 10 additional days salary. Plaintiff\u2019s request for a \u201cStep 3\u201d hearing was denied on the ground that, under the by-laws of the Board of Education, the basis alleged for his discharge, his unsatisfactory rating, was reviewable by the Superintendent of Schools. Although plaintiff\u2019s request for a hearing by the Superintendent was late, the time limitation was waived and he was granted a hearing before an Assistant Superintendent. Plaintiff, his principal, a fellow teacher, and a union representative testified at the hearing. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal was denied. Plaintiff alleges that it was only well after the complaint in the instant action had been filed that he dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>covered that he could appeal this determination. By this time the 30 day limit for such an appeal had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed because his claim is not cognizable in the federal courts under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1964). As this court said in Tichon v. Harder, 438 F.2d 1396, 1399 (2d Cir. 1971), \u201cthe claim that appellant was denied procedural due process had no independent jurisdictional significance.\u201d The civil rights statutes confer jurisdiction only when \u201cthe right or immunity is one of personal liberty, not dependent for its existence upon the infringement of property rights.\u201d Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 531, 59 S.Ct. 954, 971, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939); Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560, 566 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 841, 91 S.Ct. 82, 27 L.Ed. 2d 75 (1970). In a case where a denial of procedural due process is alleged, \u201cthe <em>jHague </em>and <em>Eisen </em>test focuses on the interests claimed to be injured by the denial of due process, because it is the character of those interests that determines whether the suit involves a \u2018right of personal liberty\u2019 or not.\u201d Tichon v. Harder, <em>supra </em>438 F.2d at 1399 (footnote and citation omitted) .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The facts of this case are remarkably similar to those in the <em>Tichon </em>case. As was true in that case, \u201cthe circumstances of appellant's dismissal involve none of the essential elements of \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdiction.\u201d Tichon v. Harder, <em>supra </em>at 1401. In both cases probationary employees were discharged for unsatisfactory work from positions of public employment. In neither case was the capacity to hold further employment, including public employment, impaired to any greater degree than would result from a similar rating in private employment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">\u201cAlthough every dismissal for reasons other than reduction in the work force can be said to have some impact on future employability * * * in the absence of a clear, immediate and substantial impact on the employee\u2019s reputation which effectively destroys his ability to engage in his occupation, it cannot be said that a right of personal liberty is involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1402 (citation and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Though plaintiff may indeed find it more difficult to obtain employment, \u201cCongress did not intend that every claim of unfair treatment by a state of an employee, even accompanied by a lack of procedural due process, could be brought to the federal courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1402.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">The plaintiff cites Birnbaum v. Trussell, 371 F.2d 672 (2d Cir. 1966). In that case it was alleged that Birnbaum, a staff physician of Coney Island Municipal Hospital, was summarily dismissed in consequence of labor union pressures based on a claim that he was guilty of anti-Negro bias. The complaint claimed that Birnbaum\u2019s dismissal was followed by official blacklisting by the First Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Department of Hospitals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case plaintiff\u2019s discharge was not based upon any charge that he was guilty of discrimination on racial grounds, a charge which, as we said in Birnbaum v. Trussell, <em>supra </em>at 679, \u201cpermanently brands the person accused as one who is unable to put public and professional duty above personal bias.\u201d Nor is there a suggestion of any such official blacklisting as would support a charge of conspiracy by state officials to deprive Canty of rights secured by \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 676-677. <em>Birnbaum </em>is, therefore, readily distinguishable from the present case, and, as this court said in Tichon v. Harder, <em>supra, </em>438 F.2d at 1403, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>line was drawn in <em>Birnbamn </em>and should remain there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Since under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), the district court had no jurisdiction of plaintiff\u2019s claim, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The court commends appointed counsel, Mr. Louis L. Hoynes, Jr., for his able and conscientious representation of plaintiff-appellant in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">. For a review of some of the relevant cases involving discharge from public employment see Tichon v. Harder, 438 F. 2d 1396, 1399-1400 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-14\">. Although Canty makes some vague references in his brief to racial discrimination against him, his complaint alleges no facts to support such a claim, and, indeed, the claim was raised here for the first time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
