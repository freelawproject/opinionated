App. \u00a7 462. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">In 1966 Pryor was classified 1-0 by his local board (conscientious objector available for civilian work). 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.14. Thereafter, he applied for, and received, a IV-D exemption as a minister of religion \u201cwho as his regular and customary vocation preaches and teaches the principles of religion and administers the ordinances of public worship\u201d of his sect. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 466(g) (1). The change in classification was based upon evidence submitted by Pryor that he had been appointed a Pioneer Minister of Jehovah's Witnesses and, because of that status, was required to average one hundred hours a month, or twelve hundred hours a year, performing various duties for the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-18\">A year later the board received a note from Pryor stating that he was no longer a Pioneer Minister. On the basis of this information, the board reclassified him I-O. Pryor presented no further information in support of a ministerial exemption, did not take advantage of the right to a personal appearance or appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was eventually issued his Order to Report for Civilian Work which forms the basis of this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-19\">The burden is upon the registrant to present facts which, unless shown to be untrue, entitle him to a lower classification. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.1(c). Since Pryor\u2019s original IV-D classification was based simply on the fact that he was a Pioneer Minister, there was no evidence left in the file to support a claim for IVD exemption once he indicated that he was no longer a Pioneer Minister. Although he may still have been a \u201cminister\u201d in the eyes of his church, there were no facts indicating whether this was a \u201cvocation\u201d or \u201cavocation,\u201d facts which are vital to a ministerial exemption. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 466(g). Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 395, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953). Since a prima facie case had not been presented, the board was not required to state its reasons for denying the IV-D classification. United States v. Campbell, 439 F.2d 1087 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-20\">Appellant argues that he was unconscionably misled by a board employee into believing that only Pioneer Minis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>ters qualified for IY-D classification. <em>See </em>United States v. Lowell, 437 F.2d 906 (9th Cir. 1971). The record does not support this assertion. The employee told Pryor that he could submit verification of his Pioneer status or \u201cany verification of his work as a minister he had.\u201d Hence, the employee did no more than tell him how to present his claim for a change in status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Pryor\u2019s other assignments of error are without merit. The trier-of-fact could infer that he wilfully refused his work assignment from the fact that it was sent to him and he \u201cdid not report as ordered.\u201d United States v. Wilkinson, 443 F.2d 15 (9th Cir., decided May 11, 1971). The questioning of a board member as to his mental process in arriving at his classification decision was not relevant to the validity of the order. United States v. Lloyd, 431 F.2d 160, 166 (9th Cir. 1970). And conscription does not violate freedom of religion. <em>See </em>United States v. Craft, 423 F.2d 829, 833 (9th Cir. 1970) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1328-16\">. In light of our disposition, we do not consider whether Pryor\u2019s failure to ex-liaust his administrative remedies precludes him from challenging the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
