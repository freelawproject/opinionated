Accordingly, the decision of the district court is affirmed without oral argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aanj\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-12\">. The Secretary also denied the claim on the alternative basis that the claimant, by engaging in gainful activity after the lapse of his insured status, was disqualified from receiving disability benefits; but the district court rejected this ground of decision, relying on Leftwich v. Gardner, 377 F.2d 287 (4 Cir. 1967). While we do not reach the question of whether <em>Leftwich </em>should be overruled, we call attention to its doubtful continuing validity in the light of the 1968 enactment of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d) (4), the legislative history of the addition, S.Rep. No.744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1967) ; 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. p. 2882 (1967), and the Secretary\u2019s regulations promulgated thereunder, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1534, et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
