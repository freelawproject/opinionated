Contending that she was denied additional compensation because of her sex and was ultimately discharged for the same reason, appellant argues that the district court erred in its finding of fact and in its application of the statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">Originally hired in October 1964, as a junior clerk-steno at the Apollo Site in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, at an $86.00 weekly salary, appellant was later transferred to a newly-established publication section of the Zia Company as an editor-writer, also qualified for full stenographer duties, at a salary of $502.66 per month. At the time of her discharge she was earning $580.00 monthly. During this time there were eighteen men employed as \u201cprocedures writer\u201d or \u201ctechnical writer\u201d; twelve were associated with appellant in the publication section. These employees, including appellant, worked with engineers in the preparation of various system operational check lists and detailed maintenance procedures. Only appellant did not receive clearance for duties in the Apollo test area, where her male co-workers were able to enter and discuss specifics with various engineers, and it is this exclusion from the test area upon which appellant anchors her basic contentions of discrimination in compensation by reason of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Although in Shultz v. Wheaton Glass Co., 421 F.2d 259, 266 (3 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 905, 90 S.Ct. 1696, 26 L.Ed.2d 64 (1970), the Third Circuit interpreted the Equal Pay-Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d), it held that the provisions of the Civil Rights Act \u201cregarding discrimination based on sex are in pari materia with the Equal Pay Act,\u201d that both statutes \u201cserve the same fundamental purpose\u201d and that the \u201cEqual Pay Act may not be construed in a manner which by virtue of \u00a7 703(h) would undermine the Civil Rights Act.\u201d Therefore, the burdens of proof therein delineated have proper application in the instant case: while one who asserts a violation of the statute has the burden of proving that the company\u2019s wage differential is based on sex discrimination, if a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination is established, the burden of proof falls upon the company to prove that the differentiation is authorized by Section 2000e-2(h) of the Civil Rights Act which provides that a differential may be authorized if permitted by the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d): \u201c(iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">It is the contention of appellant that she established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination in compensation by showing that she was not permitted to qualify for the test area, even to the extent of being denied the opportunity of taking a physical examination. Critical to this approach, however, would have been a further showing that test area clearance would have entitled her to higher pay. The sole evidence supporting this inference was evidence that three male writers in the publication section, qualified for the test site, earned more than she. Yet, nine of the twelve male procedures writers in the publication section, who also qualified for the test area, earned the same or less than she.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, higher compensation appears not to have been keyed to qualifications relating to test area clearance. There was no other evidence which directly or by implication supported the contention that admission to the test area was a passport to higher pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Additionally, it will be observed that the male writers who did earn more than appellant bore more impressive credentials. Although appellant attended junior college, she had earned no degree. She had last attended college in 1932 or 1933, had been unemployed for eight years and nine months before going to work for Zia Company, and her only previous .employment experience in heavy industrial areas was in the Brooklyn Navy Yard during World War II. Although she had held several previous editorial positions, she had no engineering training or experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Of the men in the publication section earning more than she, Browning had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>earned both a bachelor and master\u2019s degree in journalism; Mack held a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology, had two years of mechanical engineering study, twenty graduate semester hours toward a master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering, and extensive experience as a procedures writer and systems engineer; and Per-ron had two years of college, plus a year of radio electronics school and extensive experience in electronic and technical writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Moreover, to establish a case of discrimination under Title VII, one must prove a differential in pay based on sex for performing \u201cequal\u201d work. \u201c[C]ongress in prescribing \u2018equal\u2019 work did not require that the jobs be identical, but only that they be substantially equal.\u201d Shultz v. Wheaton Glass Co., <em>supra, </em>421 F.2d at 265. Thus, in the instant case, appellant was obliged to demonstrate that the work performed by the three higher paid male workers was \u201csubstantially equal\u201d to that performed by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Appellant cites Browning and Mack as examples of males performing substantially equal work. Browning, the journalism school graduate, was hired to produce the company newspaper. Mack was responsible for systems analysis, computer programming, and preparing data for White Sands Missile Range. In addition, he actually designed some of the tests about which the publication section did its writing. Appellant had no similar responsibilities. Indeed, her non-writing duties, including typing, taking dictation, and answering the telephone, involved less responsibilities than those expected of the higher paid men.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Congress did not intend that a naked averment of job discrimination would suffice to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the Equal Pay Act. It required factual support of an accusation that the employer paid the aggrieved employee wages \u201cat a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (1). An independent review of the evidence persuades us that appellant failed to sustain her burden of showing that she was paid less than others performing \u201csubstantially equal work.\u201d It therefore does not become necessary to meet the question, reached by the district court and decided adversely to the appellant, whether the company would have been justified under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (1) (iv) in establishing a differential based on work within the vigorous environment of the test area.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The second prong of appellant\u2019s attack is the allegation of discriminatory discharge. Specifically, she contends that she was fired because she constantly complained of low pay based on her sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Methodically keeping a record of her complaints about low pay, she totalled 32 such instances. These complaints began, however, while she was still a junior clerk-steno and persisted when she was transferred to the publication section at a time when she was earning more money than the only other procedures writer, a male. Between August 15, 1965 and November 15, 1966, a period during which there was no male procedures writer paid more than she, appellant demanded more pay on fourteen different occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The company admits that appellant\u2019s constant complaints about being underpaid had some bearing on its ultimate decision to discharge her. It emphasizes, however, that this stemmed from the complaints qua complaints of underpayment, not as complaints of underpayment by reason of her sex. In support of this contention it points to the many complaints made before there were higher paid male writers. Moreover, the company insists that other reasons prompted its action. It produced evidence that appellant persisted in violating a company rule prohibiting the bringing of personal equipment to work; that she improperly used a government typewriter and paper for personal corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>spondence; that an \u201caverage\u201d efficiency rating resulted in dramatic protests that she deserved the rating of \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201csuperior\u201d; and that she had been using amphetamines and barbiturates for thirty years. Finally, upon a request for company information, represented by the co-employee to be urgently needed for company business, received by telephone shortly after close of office hours, appellant responded that she could not use government property \u2014 the telephone\u2014 after hours. This last incident, occurring shortly after her being criticized for the use of the government typewriter, was \u201cthe final straw.\u201d The company said she was fired because of the accumulation of all the incidents and not because of her sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The district court found: \u201cPlaintiff was discharged because of a series of incidents, not related to her sex, which were reasonable grounds for her discharge.\u201d We will not disturb that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">.
