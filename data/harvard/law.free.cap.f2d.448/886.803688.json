BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">In this appeal, the Government finds itself in the awkward position of having to complain of evidence admitted into trial on its own suggestion. Finding as we do that any such error was harmless and that an apparent error in the charge turns out not to be so in fact, we affirm the judgment of the Court below in favor of Taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">I. The Device and the Tax</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">Taxpayer Thrash operated an \u201cElectric Box Score Game,\u201d a mechanical wagering device not unlike roulette in the nature of the gambling risk involved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>game had been purchased pursuant to a promotional letter sent to Taxpayer by the manufacturer of the device. The promotional letter referred to and quoted from a private ruling letter issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to attorneys for the manufacturer, in which the Commissioner concluded that the device in question, if operated in the specified manner, would fall within a statutory exclusion from the definition of a taxable lottery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">II. Admission of the Revenue Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The only question before the Trial Court was whether or not Taxpayer operated the game in the manner necessary to qualify for the statutory exclusion. At the pretrial conference the Government had stipulated to the admissibility of the promotional letter and the pretrial order stated it \u201cis received in evidence.\u201d But at trial, without seeking leave to amend or withdraw the stipulation, the Government objected to introduction of the letter, on grounds that it was irrelevant to the fact determinations then at hand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the Trial Court indicated that he was going to overrule the Government\u2019s objection and admit the promotional letter, the Government requested that \u201cto minimize prejudicial error\u201d the private ruling letter be admitted instead of the promotional letter. The Trial Court granted this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-19\">Although the record indicates strongly to us that the Government agreed to the introduction and use of the advisory memorandum,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it now asserts that intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>duction of the private ruling constituted reversible error. Arguing on authority of the well-established rule that a taxpayer may not rely on private rulings not addressed to him,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>the Government urges that admission of the letter prejudicially allowed the jury to consider the Taxpayer\u2019s good faith, rather than deciding the case on the fact questions properly before them. Further, it is asserted, admission of the letter improperly influenced the jury that the Commissioner had taken a prior position on this issue inconsistent with the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">We need not decide whether the Government preserved the point or whether the Government really complains of the admissibility of the wrong document since the private ruling letter was admitted instead of the promotional letter solely at the Government\u2019s suggestion. For we are of the view that it was all harmless if \u2014 and the if is a very big one \u2014 it was error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Oddly enough the jury already knew of it since Section B of the ruling (see note 1, <em>supra) </em>was set out verbatim in Taxpayer\u2019s amended complaint. More important, all it did was to describe the operations which had to take place to come within the exemptions. And as the Court told\u00ae and retold the jury four or five times, that was what they had to decide, step by step.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Although we disclaim resting this decision on the untimely, unannounced, presumptuous indifference to the pretrial stipulation and order that the promotional letter \u201cis admitted,\u201d we are entitled to weigh excusability in the light of the situation suddenly and improperly pressed on the Judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Thus we conclude that any error in the admission of the revenue ruling was harmless, particularly in view of the fact that the situation was thrust upon the Judge suddenly and unexpectedly by the Government\u2019s improper disregard of the pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">III. Burden of Proof and Rule 49(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">The second issue raised by the Government is that the Trial Court\u2019s charge to the jury improperly placed the burden of proof on the Government on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Taxpayer had paid a small part of the Commissioner\u2019s assessment and brought suit against the District Director for refund. The United States intervened and cross-claimed for the remainder of the deficiency. In charging the jury, the Trial Court properly instructed that Tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>payer had the burden of proving each element of his case with a preponderance of the evidence and unless the jury found that he had, Taxpayer should not be allowed to recover. On the Government\u2019s cross-action the Trial Court ostensibly, but not actually, placed the burden improperly on the Government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">We say ostensibly because, first, there is much doubt that what was said was anything more than a juridical slip of the tongue,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and second, in the charge as a whole the Court stated time and again what the jury had specifically to determine and what the effect was on Taxpayer and Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">Actually, what the Judge did was to use the marvelous device of a general charge with special interrogatories under F.R.Civ.P. 49(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ironically, as in the case of the revenue ruling, it was the Government which by formal requested charges \u2014 all of which were given\u2014 sought submission by specific questions covering each of the three conjunctive elements of the exemption.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Not only were the decisive fact issues pinpointed, but the Court, giving full use to. the flexibility of the Rule 49(a) device, gave specific instructions on the answers open to the jury, their effect as \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as well as controlling principles.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In all of these, his earlier positive instructions on Taxpayer\u2019s burden of proof were in effect repeated and repeated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only way Taxpayer could win was by convincing the jury by a preponderance of the evidence to answer all questions \u201cYes.\u201d And with the interrogatories constructed as they were (see note 11, <em>supra), </em>calling for dependent answers, the Government never had any burden either of proof or persuasion for contingent dependent answers. The failure to find \u201cYes\u201d automatically called for</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">a \u201cNO\u201d and on that the Government automatically prevailed. At no time did the Court ever speak in terms of the Government having the burden to convince the jury to a \u201cNo\u201d answer to the questions. All was tied to Taxpayer affirmatively establishing all \u201cYes\u201d answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">The only complication is that the Judge gave the jury two forms of a general verdict, one for Taxpayer, one for the Government. These were wholly unnecessary and in any event the instructions were clear that the form of the general verdict depended on the answers to the interrogatories. Having found all \u201cYes\u201d and having been properly instructed as to the requirements to reach such successive answers, the form of general verdict followed automatically. That in one ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>erence to the form for rendering a verdict for the Government the Court spoke in terms of the Government\u2019s burden of proof cannot be turned into harmful error where the jury answered the questions precisely and then filled out the general verdict forms consistent with those answers and the Judge\u2019s binding instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Thus, what might have been an impossible problem of deciphering the actions of the jury from the enigma-wrapped-in-a-mystery of a single general verdict plus the law\u2019s strange fiction that the jury heeds the Judge only when he commits a verbal error, became a simple matter of applying plain statutory language to facts specifically found on evidence that no one can challenge. That speaks well again for 49(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The upshot is that the Government\u2019s contentions are both without merit. Unlike Taxpayer\u2019s patrons who committed their economic fate to the whims of chance, we hold that Taxpayer did not risk imposition of the lottery tax by operating his Wheel of Fortune \u2014 or at least, the jury so found. That finding having been fairly, properly and conclusively ascertained, the case ends right there.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-8\">. A more complete description of the \u201cElectric Box Score Game\u201d is provided by the Commissioner\u2019s Excise Tax Advisory Memorandum 1213, April 30, 1952 sent to the manufacturer\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHV\">\u201cElectric Box Score Game. This is a mechanically simulated baseball game, not coin-operated, representing 16 teams in the two major leagues. The operation of this machine is entirely in the hands of the operator, although the mechanism, not he, determines the outcome of the game. About 20 minutes are required to complete the game, and at the end the team having the highest number of runs appearing on the electric board is the winner. Before and during the game, ticket cards similar to the ones described in Item \u2018A\u2019 but not having the tip number or seal number, are sold to the players for 50 100, or 250, depending on the amount of tlie prize. Each sealed ticket on the card gives a number corresponding to the team number on the board. Each card contains only 16 tickets, so that there is only one winner per card. However, more than one card is usually sold during the running of a game, so several winners are present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-20\">Each winner at the end of the game is awarded a prize of a cash award which was indicated at the top of the card from which his winning ticket was purchased. Some cards give the winner a chance to win a higher award than his guaranteed prize if, at the end of the game, he pushes out a lucky push at the top of the cardboard from which he purchased his winning ticket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-21\">If any tickets are not sold during a game, they are kept by the operator at his risk and the prize is awarded, regardless. At the end of the game, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>whieh all players are normally present, the prize is usually paid out immediately in the presence of all the players.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. The revelant portion of the Internal Revenue Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-8\"><em>\u201cLottery. </em>\u2014 The term \u2018lottery\u2019 includes the numbers game, policy, and similar types of wagering.

Among those games which are within the scope of the exclusion would be card games such as draw poker, stud poker, and blackjack, roulette games, dice games such as craps, bingo, and keno games and tlie gambling wheels frequently encountered at country fairs and charity bazaars. On the other hand, punch-boards would not normally be excluded under this definition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-21\">. The Government\u2019s explanation for its objection after previous stipulation takes this form. At the j)retrial conference, Government counsel had agreed to the admission of the manufacturer\u2019s letter because it was relevant to the issue of whether taxpayer had reasonable cause for his failure to file excise tax returns. However, since that issue was conceded by the Government jirior to trial, the letter was no longer relevant and a pretrial stipulation admitting this evidence does not bar the Government from objecting to its admission on the grounds of non-relevance to the sole issue remaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-22\">Since our decision does not rest on the issue of the previous stipulation, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the pretrial order could have been disregarded, as the Government attempted to do, without a prior motion and amendment of the pretrial order. But see footnote 7, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b942-23\"><em>. </em>After pointing out that the promotional letter had significant omissions from the ruling it was publicizing Government counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-24\">\u201cWe have no objection if [Taxpayer\u2019s counsel] wants to use the original ruling. It would be fine if he wants to use the original ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-25\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-26\">I will do that, or I will let you offer that to show the language that was given.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b943-14\">.

Clearly, even if the Commissioner\u2019s determination of tax liability is presented by way of cross-appeal in a refund suit, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove with a preponderance of the evidence, that the Commissioner\u2019s determination is erroneous.
