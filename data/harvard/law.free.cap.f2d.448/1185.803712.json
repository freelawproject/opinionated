Consolidated Corporation. As a result of these injuries, he was paid workmen\u2019s compensation benefits by American Motorists Insurance Co. (American), the compensation insurance carrier for his employer, under the terms of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The payments were made by American without a formal award of compensation benefits being entered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">On February 19, 1969 Joyner filed a third-party action against appellee Cala-cino as the person allegedly responsible for Joyner\u2019s injuries, and against F. &amp; B. Enterprises, Inc. as Calacino\u2019s employer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that Joyner\u2019s injuries were caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence and/or their intentional, willful and malicious acts. The defendants then filed a motion with the trial court to join American as a named party plaintiff in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">The pretrial examiner entered a recommendation that the motion to join American be granted, and Joyner filed an opposition to the recommendation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial judge denied the motion in opposition, but granted leave to apply to this court for permission to take an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1964). On March 6, 1970 the petition for an interlocutory appeal was granted by order of this court, and the appeal is now here for decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">The controversy between the parties is whether American <em>must </em>be joined as a \u201creal pai-ty in interest\u201d under Fed.R. Civ.P. 17(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus it is necessary to understand the true nature of the real party in interest provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Professor Moore has said of Rule 17(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-9\">The meaning and object of the real party in interest provision would be more accurately expressed if it read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-15\">\n<em>An action shall be prosecuted in the name of the party who, by the substantive law, has the right sought to be enforced.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-16\">3A J. Moore, Federal Practice j[ 17.02, at 53 (2d ed.1953) (emphasis in original) . This concept of a real party in interest has been given effect by the courts, <em>see generally </em>3A J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>jf 17.07, and has been applied to the circumstances of subrogation as between an insurer and an insured. For example, in United States v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co., 338 U.S. 366, 380, 70 S.Ct. 207, 215, 94 L.Ed. 171 (1949), the Court said that \u201cof course the insurer-subro-gee, who has substantive equitable rights, qualifies as [a real party in interest].\u201d But the Court also made clear that the \u201csubstantive equitable rights\u201d referred to were \u201csubstantive rights <em>against the [third </em>party] <em>tort-feasor.\u201d </em>338 U.S. at 381, 70 S.Ct. at 215 (emphasis supplied). The question to be resolved then reduces to whether, by the terms of the applicable substantive law, American possesses substantive rights against the defendants on the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-17\">The substantive law to be applied begins with section 33(b) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b) (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-18\">(b) Acceptance of [workmen\u2019s) compensation under an award in a compensation order filed by the deputy commissioner shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>such third person unless such person shall commence an action against such third person within six months after such award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Subsection (b) has been construed to confer subrogation rights on the employer, or on the employer\u2019s insurance carrier,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> even where workmen\u2019s compensation was paid without the entry of a formal compensation award, as in the present case. <em>E. g., </em>Hugev v. Dampskisaktieselskabet International, 170 F.Supp. 601 (S.D.Cal.1959), aff\u2019d, Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Dampskisaktieselskabet International, 274 F.2d 875 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 803, 80 S.Ct. 1237, 4 L.Ed.2d 1147 (1960) ; The Etna, 138 F.2d 37 (3d Cir. 1943); <em>see </em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Wynn, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 343 F.2d 295 (1965). The significant point to be explored concerns the <em>nature </em>of American\u2019s subrogation rights, once it paid workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to Joyner without an award, and once Joyner commenced his third-party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">It is settled that an injured employee \u201cmay bring suit against a third party whenever it is evident that the employer-assignee, for whatever reason, does not intend to bring suit.\u201d Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Wynn, <em>supra, </em>120 U.S.App.D.C. at 15, 343 F.2d at 298. The first consequence of the employee\u2019s commencing suit is to deprive the employer-assignee of any right to control the employee\u2019s third-party action. <em>E. g., The Etna, supra, </em>138 F.2d at 41. The second consequence is the one of central importance to this case. Where compensation benefits are paid without an award, and the employee commences a third-party action, what substantive right does the employer-assignee then enjoy? Does the employer-assignee retain a substantive right as against the <em>third party </em>? Or, is there merely a right as against the <em>employee </em>if the employee succeeds in his third-party action? It is clear that the latter is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">In <em>The Etna, supra, </em>138 F.2d at 41, it was said that \u201cthe employer who pays compensation without an award [retains] his right to reimbursement <em>out of his own employee\u2019s recovery from third persons\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). In Potomac Electric Co. v. Wynn, <em>supra, </em>120 U.S.App.D.C. at 15, 343 F.2d at 298, this court stated that \u201cthe employer\u2019s interest in recoupment, if the employee ultimately succeeds in recovering from the third party, would presumably be protected <em>by a lien on the proceeds\" </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>See also </em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 411, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953); Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. United States, 290 F.2d 257, 258 (2d Cir. 1961). The legislative history of the most recent amendments to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933 make this result plain. The 1959 amendments to subsection 933<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> removed the necessity for an employee\u2019s electing between accepting the statutory compensation benefits and bringing suit against the third party. <em>See </em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Wynn, <em>supra. </em>The Senate Report on the amendments noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-9\">Although an employee could receive compensation under the act and for the same injury recover damages in a third-party suit, he would not be entitled to double compensation. The bill, as amended, provides that an employer must be reimbursed for any compensation paid to the employee <em>out of the net proceeds of the recovery.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">S.Rep.No. 428, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1959) (emphasis supplied). U.S.Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2134.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">There can be no doubt then under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b) and the cases interpreting it that American\u2019s only rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>in the circumstances of the present case run against Joyner and any recovery he may obtain in his third-party action. Only if American had obtained a formal award of benefits, and Joyner had not commenced a third-party action within six months of the entry of the award, would American have a substantive right directly against the third-party tortfeasor. This being the case, American is not a \u201creal party in interest\u201d in Joyner\u2019s suit against the third-party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">The appellees have placed considerable weight on the decision in City Stores Co. v. Lerner Shops of the District of Columbia, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 311, 410 F.2d 1010 (1969) as support for a contrary conclusion. In making his recommendation that American be joined under Rule 17(a), the pretrial examiner also relied on the <em>City Stores </em>decision, although he recognized that a somewhat different issue was raised in the present case. For the reasons which follow, we think that the situation facing the court in <em>City Stores </em>differed significantly from that of the present case, and that the <em>City Stores </em>decision does not require a different result than the one we have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\"><em>City Stores </em>dealt with a ease of equitable subrogation arising from common-law principles, where the rights of the subrogee were not governed by a statutory provision such as 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b). The court specifically found that on common-law principles, \u201cwhen an insurer pays a loss, it is by operation of law subrogated to the insured\u2019s <em>right of action against a third party.\u201d </em>133 U.S.App.D.C. at 312, 410 F.2d at 1011 (emphasis supplied). As we have seen, the effect of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b) on the facts of the case at hand is to cut off the subrogee\u2019s rights as against the third party. Thus, in <em>City Stores, </em>as opposed to the present case, the subro-gee <em>did </em>retain a substantive right against the third party, sufficient to make the subrogee a real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">The appellees have also raised a number of practical objections to a holding that American is not a real party in interest in this case. We need mention only two, and but briefly. Neither appear to pose any serious difficulties, and certainly they furnish no reason for avoiding a result which seems to us clearly required by controlling legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">The first is a suggestion that if American is not added as a party plaintiff, the third party defendants will face the possibility of having to defend two suits \u2014 the present one by Joyner and a possible second one by American, if for some reason American\u2019s claim is not satisfied out of Joyner\u2019s recovery, if any. However, this possibility is of course ruled out by our conclusion above that once Joyner filed his suit, American\u2019s only remaining substantive right was to be compensated out of Joyner\u2019s recovery. American no longer possesses any right of action in the present circumstances against the third-party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">The second is an assertion that otherwise American itself will be unprotected, and may eventually have to bring suit against Joyner to obtain its share of the proceeds of Joyner\u2019s recovery. The first answer to this objection is that our holding today does not necessarily preclude American from intervening in the suit to protect its rights, if <em>American </em>so chooses. All that we decide is that Rule 17(a) does not <em>require </em>that American be joined at someone else\u2019s behest. We are not now called upon to decide whether, for example, American could intervene by choice under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>second answer is that as a practical matter, there are other means of subrogees protecting themselves in cases such as the present one. American has filed an affidavit in this case that it \u201chas an agreement with the plaintiff [Joyner] that its interests will be protected in the event the pending tort action is successful * * and at oral argument it was stated that this was the usual method of proceeding. <em>See </em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 411, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">The order of the District Court denying the motion in opposition to the pretrial examiner\u2019s recommendation is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">. 44 Stat. 1440 (1927), as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.
