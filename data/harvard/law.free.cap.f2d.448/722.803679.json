Appellant also contends the evidence was insufficient to establish a submissible case on the issue of scienter, that is that he knew the money order had been stolen. We reject both contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">In brief, the undisputed evidence shows that on December 8, 1970, the money order in question was placed in a United States mail box; that on the same day the mail box had been pried open. On the following day, appellant entered a drug store in St. Louis, Missouri, and attempted to cash the money order. The proprietor of the drug store, being acquainted with appellant, refused to cash the money order because it was not endorsed by the payee named thereon. As appellant left the drug store, a police officer entered it. The proprietor immediately informed the officer that appellant had attempted to cash the money order, that he, the proprietor, believed it had been stolen and that \u201cthere is something wrong.\u201d The officer who, as stated, had seen appellant leave the store, immediately pursued the automobile occupied by appellant and by three other subjects. The automobile stopped a short distance from the drug store at the officer\u2019s command. Upon being questioned, the appellant denied that he had entered the drug store and that he knew anything about the incident. He was thereupon placed under arrest and the ensuing search revealed the money order on the person of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-18\">On the foregoing facts, we are in agreement with the district court that the officer was justified in stopping the automobile for the purpose of further investigation and, upon appellant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that he knew nothing about the incident coupled with the information the officer received from the proprietor, the officer was justified in arresting appellant and searching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the government was sufficient to submit the case to the jury. Appellant received a fair trial, the verdict was based upon substantial evidence, and, consequently, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
