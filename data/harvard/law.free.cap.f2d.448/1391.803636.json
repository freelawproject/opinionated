The entire transcript of the state court habeas corpus proceedings, however, was not produced by either party<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-20\">On the basis of Selz v. State of California, 9 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 702, and cases therein cited, we feel compelled to remand for an independent review of the entire transcript of the state evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-21\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1445-14\">. In denying the petition for a rehearing the district court said that, \u201cThe denial of the writ was based on the failure of Petitioner to allege with particularity in what manner the state post-conviction hearing and findings consequent thereto were inadequate\u201d and that it was \u201capparent that petitioner has a transcript of the state hearing but has failed to produce it as required by 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 2254(e) even after being given an opportunity to do so.\u201d There was no order, however, requiring production of the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
