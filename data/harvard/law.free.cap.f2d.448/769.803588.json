Appellant\u2019s claim against the Detroit officials and police officers is that he made various complaints to them concerning offenses committed against him, which complaints they refused to investigate or consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-24\">The District Court considered a motion for summary judgment on affidavits, briefs and a deposition of appellant consisting of 157 pages. The Court, in a written opinion, held that plaintiff\u2019s action against Chrysler was barred by the Michigan statute of limitations; that the conclusory statements in his complaint conflicted with his oral testimony in the deposition and could not refute the positive statements in defendant\u2019s affidavits; that there was no basis for a claim under the Civil Rights Act against the Michigan officers for failure to investigate the complaints made by plaintiff. We agree with the District Court that no genuine issue of fact was presented and that summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-25\">The motion to affirm is therefore granted and the judgment of the District Court is hereby affirmed. Rule 8, Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
