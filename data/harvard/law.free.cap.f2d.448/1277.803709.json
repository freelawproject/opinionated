The issue on appeal is whether false testimony on which the defendant\u2019s conviction was based was <em>'material </em>to the trial in which the defendant had previously testified. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-12\">The facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s testimony are fully set forth in this court\u2019s recent opinion in United States v. Edwards, 443 F.2d 1286 (8 Cir. 1971). It is unnecessary to repeat them here. In that decision William Carey Edwards, Jr.\u2019s conviction for perjury was affirmed. Edwards had falsely testified in the trial of Walter Patrick Peyson in December, 1969. Edwards was subsequently indicted for perjury under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. At his trial he did not take the stand but called, as part of his defense, the defendant Paris who attempted to verify Edwards\u2019 testimony in the Peyson trial. After Edwards\u2019 conviction the government then indicted Paris for perjury. Discussion of the facts and the law in the <em>Edwards </em>case demonstrate without doubt the materiality of Paris\u2019 testimony at the Edwards trial. If Paris\u2019 statements were believed by the jury, Edwards would have been acquitted. Under these circumstances it is specious to urge that Paris\u2019 testimony did not have an effective influence or bearing on the decision in the <em>Edwards </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
