He alleged that he had never been informed whether his mandatory release had been revoked although nearly five months had elapsed since his revocation hearing before the parole board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-18\">Appellant\u2019s full sentence expired on June 1, 1971, on which date he was released from federal custody. Thus the appeal is rendered moot and is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-12\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time \u25a0 fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
