We affirm upon the basis of such reported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-26\">The same material issues are raised in Maddox v. Sigler, 8 Cir., 445 F.2d 269, decided subsequent to the trial court\u2019s decision in the case before us. Maddox was charged with the same crimes arising out of the same transactions involved in the present appeal. Maddox at the State trial was represented by the same court-appointed counsel and entered a voluntary plea of guilty. We affirmed the dismissal on the basis of Judge Urbom\u2019s opinion reported at 325 F.Supp. 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-27\">The only distinction of substance between the <em>Maddox </em>case and our present case is that Nicholson makes the additional contention that he lacked mental capacity to enter a voluntary plea of guilty and that court-appointed eoun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>sel did not effectively represent him in that he failed to investigate and advise defendant as to a possible defense of insanity. The trial court, after an eviden-tiary hearing, determined that Nicholson was competent to enter a guilty plea and that his representation by counsel was adequate under existing standards. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
