Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716. We conclude that under the facts of this case the order, 316 F. Supp. 1174, banning symbols or indicia <em>expressing the school board\u2019s or its employees\u2019 </em>desire to maintain segregated schools and requiring that they \u201cshall be removed from the schools and shall not be officially displayed\u201d is fully warranted. So, too, do we find that the court properly directed the formation of a biracial committee, as previously <em>recommended </em>in an earlier order of the court. The order requiring the appointment of a black assistant principal for Covington High School, having a student body one-third black, is warranted in light of our earlier decision in Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir., 419 F.2d 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">It appearing that no stay of the district court\u2019s order was applied for and that there has been no delay caused by this appeal, appellants\u2019 request for double costs and attorney\u2019s fees is not granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
