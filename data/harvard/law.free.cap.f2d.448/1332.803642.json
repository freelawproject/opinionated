Matthew Byrne, Jr., United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1387-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1387-16\">Appellant was indicted and, after waiver of a jury trial, was convicted by the court for violation of 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462, refusing to submit to induction into the Armed Forces. Various errors are asserted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-17\">ADEQUACY OF FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-18\">Although the court could have been more specific in its findings, we have no difficulty in holding that it resolved each of appellant\u2019s complaints against his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-19\">IMPLIED POSTPONEMENT OF INDUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-20\">Here, appellant contends that the issuance of Form 150 on February 6, 1969, granted him 30 days to complete and return the form and thus constituted an implied postponement of his order to report for induction on February 19, 1969. He fails to mention a letter attached to the form which advised him that the board was required to issue the Form 150, but that it had to be returned no later than February 14, 1969. Also militating against the appellant\u2019s contention is the fact that on February 7th, he was personally advised to report for induction on February 19th. Manifestly, the thirty day period imprinted on the face of Form 150 was expressly modified by the attached letter. In this factual background, there is no implied postponement of the induction date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-21\">SPECIFIC INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-22\">Appellant advances the rather naive contention that he went \u201cto the very doors of the induction station with the intention of entering\u201d, and failed to report only \u201cafter receiving advice from law students * * * to the effect that the administrative process was still open and that [he] need not report that day.\u201d Consequently, he argues, that he did not \u201cwillfully and knowingly\u201d fail to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>with the order to report. The evidence is undisputed that he knew that he was to report for induction ,on February 19th. In fact, he reached the induction station with the intention of reporting. His reliance on the advice of law students is no defense. The record clearly demonstrates that he willfully and knowingly failed to comply with the board\u2019s order to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
