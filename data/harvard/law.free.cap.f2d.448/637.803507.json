A. evidencing approval of the establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ment of a branch bank in the Hickory Plaza Shopping Center, Catawba County, North Carolina, and enjoined Wach-ovia from opening the branch. Relief was granted because of the Comptroller\u2019s express declination to make the findings required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 53-62 (b) which, in First-Citizens Bank and Trust Company v. Camp, 409 F.2d 1086 (4 Cir. 1969), we held he was required to make in order to permit the establishment of a branch bank in North Carolina. The Comptroller and Wachovia appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">In addition to requesting us to reconsider our decision in <em>First-Citizens, </em>the Comptroller advances as a ground for reversal the argument that he is not bound to consider the North Carolina \u201cneed and convenience\u201d test for the establishment of a branch bank, because it is his duty to exercise his discretion under federal law to permit the establishment of branch banks in the light of federal policies expressed in the federal antitrust statutes to foster competition; and he has concluded that \u201c[t]he entry of Wachovia * * * into the Hickory/Catawba County area * * will bring another strong and able competitor to the Hickory banking market * * * [and] will stimulate the existing banks to maintain and improve their services in an effort to maintain their market shares.\u201d The short answer to this contention is that we perceive no conflict between the policies of the federal antitrust statutes and the North Carolina \u201cneed and convenience\u201d test for the establishment of a branch bank, particularly where, as here, the Comptroller has also found that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that Wachovia\u2019s entry will damage the stability of any banks in the area.\u201d See North Carolina ex rel. Banking Commission v. Bank of Rocky Mount, N.C. App., 182 S.E.2d 625 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We reaffirm our holding in <em>First-Citizens. </em>See, as additional support, First National Bank in Plant City v. Dickinson, 396 U.S. 122, 130, 131, 90 S.Ct. 337, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1969). And we reiterate that the Comptroller \u201cwas bound by North Carolina\u2019s \u2018need and convenience\u2019 and \u2018solvency of the branch\u2019 criteria\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 53-62(b). 409 F.2d at 1091. From this it follows, as the district judge concluded, that when the Comptroller expressly declined to make the findings required by \u00a7 53-62(b), although he made numerous other findings, he acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving Wachovia\u2019s application to establish a branch in the Hickory Plaza Shopping Center; and his action was correctly enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
