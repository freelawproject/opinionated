Friend was seated at the wheel of the vehicle (Mrs. Nedra Friend and one Rene Bud Wyman were passengers). He was preparing to drive away from a parking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">Appellants argue that the search was illegal, because the officers had no search warrant, and because it was not undertaken to secure \u201cthe fruits of or the implements used to commit\u201d the crime which precipitated the arrest. Appellants further assert that the search cannot be upheld as incident to a lawful arrest, since the trunk was not \u201cwithin the immediate control\u201d of any of the occupants of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-20\">Neither argument need be considered. The evidence relating to the search warranted the factual conclusion, not only that the officers had probable cause to believe that the ear contained contraband which was being illegally transported, but also that it was impracticable for them to secure a warrant. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-21\">2. <em>The constitutionality of 26 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 <em>5861(c) and (d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-22\">Appellants\u2019 self-incrimination challenge to the constitutionality of the National Firearms Act is wholly without merit. United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971); United States v. Jones, 446 F. 2d 12 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
