Stella received concurrent sentences on two counts of being an unregistered dealer in firearms, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(a), three counts of possessing unregistered firearms, \u00a7 5861(d), and one count of carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2). Hatfield was convicted on one count of possessing an unregistered firearm. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-23\">Antonio Amezquinta, a government informer, received a telephone call from defendant Stella who \u201cstated that he understood [Amezquinta] was interested in the purchase of some automatic weapons.\u201d A meeting between Amezquinta and Stella was held the next night and, after Stella agreed to sell various-caliber machine guns and ammunition, Stella led Amezquinta to Hatfield\u2019s house. Hatfield and Stella took the firearms from Hatfield\u2019s back yard, where they were stored, and loaded them into Amezquin-ta\u2019s car. This transaction forms the basis for one dealing and one possession count against Stella, and the one posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>sion count against Hatfield. We deem it unnecessary to discuss the later events which are the basis for the remaining counts against Stella.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Stella\u2019s defense was entrapment. He testified that he did not want to sell the guns but was induced to do so by Amezquinta. Hatfield claimed that he did not \u201cpossess\u201d the guns because he was simply storing them in his back yard for Stella. Our review of the record, considered in the light most favorable to the government, convinces us that the evidence was sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s conclusion that Stella was not entrapped and that Hatfield had knowing possession of the items and knowledge that the items possessed were firearms. Hatfield\u2019s statement that he had more \u201cgoodies\u201d to sell Amezquinta, together with his active participation in the loading of the guns into the car, supply an adequate basis for the jury\u2019s conclusion that he had the requisite knowledge and dominion and control. Knowing possession is all that is required. United States v. Freed, 1971, 401 U.S. 601, 607-610, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Stella argues that the court erred in various evidentiary rulings. He first says that the court unduly restricted his cross-examination of Amezquinta for bias. However, immediately after the restrictive ruling, Stella\u2019s counsel was permitted fully to cross examine Amezquinta as to his relationship with the government. Stella\u2019s other arguments relate to proof of \u201cstate of mind\u201d to support his entrapment defense and impeachment of a government witness who testified to arranging the initial contact between Stella and Amezquinta. All of this testimony and the defense of entrapment related solely to the dealer counts. Stella admitted possession of the guns and received concurrent sentences on the dealer and possession counts. We need not consider the allegedly erroneous rulings; they do not affect the conviction on the possession counts. United States v. Jack, 1971, 9 Cir., 439 F.2d 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> Hatfield presents a multitude of arguments, the most serious of which concerns an interpretation of the National Firearms Act. He argues that he could not \u201cpossess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record,\u201d \u00a7 5861(d), without first having had the firearm \u201ctransferred\u201d to him as that term is defined in the Act, which defines a \u201ctransfer\u201d as including \u201cselling, assigning, pledging, leasing, loaning, giving away, or otherwise disposing of.\u201d \u00a7 5845(j). Hatfield urges that a transfer for bailment does not fit within that definition. We need not consider the latter contention because Hatfield\u2019s major premise \u2014 -that a \u201ctransfer\u201d is necessary before one can be convicted of unlawful possession \u2014 is erroneous. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 5861 makes it unlawful to \u201creceive or possess a firearm transferred * * * in violation of the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Subsection (d) under which Hatfield was convicted, was added to make unlawful all forms of unregistered possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">We have considered each of Hatfield\u2019s other arguments and find each to be without merit. His counsel\u2019s post-trial ruminations have led him to argue that his trial representation of Hatfield was incompetent because he failed to ask for a severance. No doubt every trial lawyer who has lost a case can, when he holds his own mental post mortem, find some act of omission or commission that he regrets. The Book of Common Prayer has us confess: \u201cWe have left undone those things which we ought to have done, and we have done those things which we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us.\u201d Regret does not mean that counsel\u2019s representation of his client was incompetent. Posttrial hindsight, induced by regret, may be worse, not better than pre-trial foresight. We find no incompetence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
