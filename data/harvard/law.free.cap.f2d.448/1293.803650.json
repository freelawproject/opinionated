The District Court found that under the common law of Oregon (this being a case of diversity) the slogan is not a valid trademark and there was no unfair competition. (300 F.Supp. 274 (D.Or.1969)) Norm Thompson appeals from the adverse judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">About 1958, appellant began using the slogan \u201cEscape From The Ordinary\u201d in advertising goods such as clothing, sports equipment and articles for smokers, which it sold mainly by mail order throughout the United States. Between 1958 and 1968, it made sales totaling about ten million dollars and expended about two million dollars in advertising, in many instances using the slogan \u201cEscape From The Ordinary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">Commencing about 1954, General Motors had been using such slogans as \u201cGet Out Of The Ordinary\u201d, \u201cRocket Out Of The Ordinary\u201d, and \u201cTime To Get Out Of The Ordinary\u201d, in connection with its sales of Oldsmobiles. In 1968, it began to use \u201cEscape From The Ordinary.\u201d Norm Thompson does not sell automobiles. General Motors does not sell clothing and other goods purveyed by Norm Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-15\">The issues on this appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-16\">1. Whether the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding as facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-17\">a. That the slogan is descriptive, rather than a suggestive slogan, or a coined, arbitrary, or fanciful slogan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-18\">b. That appellant\u2019s use of the slogan has not endowed it with a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-19\">c. That appellee\u2019s use of the slogan is not likely to cause public confusion as to the source of appellant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-20\">2. Whether appellant is entitled to injunctive relief under the \u201cdilution theory\u201d of trademark protection, even if the findings of fact are sustained and despite the absence of competition between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-21\">In our review of the trial court\u2019s findings from disputed facts, we are subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d constraint imposed by Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> K-S-H Plastics, Inc. v.

Each, of course, turns on its own unique set of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-11\">The Supreme Court of Oregon, to which we look for authority in this diversity case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adheres to the general rule. It held in 880 Stores, Inc. v. Martinez, 227 Or. 147, 361 P.2d 809 (1961) that the name \u201c880 Store\u201d was purely descriptive of the price range of goods sold by a store chain, and not entitled to exclusive use protection. See also Truck Ins. Exchange v. Truck Ins. Exchange of 649 South Olive Street, Los Angeles, Cal., 165 Or. 332, 107 P.2d 511 (1940); Liquidators v. Clifton, 132 Or. 448, 286 P.2d 152 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-18\">There was ample evidence adduced at the trial to support the District Court\u2019s finding that \u201cEscape From The Ordinary\u201d was descriptive of the \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d goods vended by appellant. We need look only to evidence presented by appellant itself:</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-19\">1. Bernard A. Alport, appellant\u2019s president, described himself as a \u201cfinder of unique items\u201d and an \u201cexpert in selling things that people don\u2019t need but that they would like to have.\u201d Mr. Al-port named as exemplary of products sold by his company such items as an Afrikan Shikari hat, a buckskin shirt, a Buffalo Bill bowie knife, water buffalo shoes, leopard cloth cufflinks, Cowegan Indian sweaters, Irish whiskey cake, a knit suit for men, and a replica of the hat \u201creputedly worn by Sir Francis Chichester on his recent solo trip around the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-20\">2. Appellant\u2019s catalogs were liberally sprinkled with such adjectives as \u201crare\u201d, \u201cunusual\u201d, \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d in describing the articles touted in them. Mr. Alport admitted such representations were \u201ccharacteristic\u201d of the company\u2019s advertising copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-21\">3. Practically every catalog carried a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the \u201cNorm Thompson Story\u201d, a narration of company efforts to travel the world in search of unusual items \u201cresearched and tested by experts\u201d which, upon acquisition, had been \u201cimproved and developed\u201d by the company\u2019s key personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-22\">Appellant urges, however, that \u201cEscape From The Ordinary\u201d qualifies as a \u201csuggestive\u201d common law trademark, relying on 3 Callmann, supra, 154-55, \u00a7 71.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1349-23\">\u201cTrademarks can, of course, serve a function in advertising. Any adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>tisement, to be effective, must be suggestive, and the trademark which truly functions as an advertising medium, whether descriptive or arbitrary, must likewise be suggestive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHq4\">\u201cBetween the primarily descriptive and the clearly arbitrary mark, there is a middle ground wherein terms of mingled qualities are found. It cannot be said that they are primarily descriptive, or that they are purely arbitrary or fanciful without any indication of the nature of the goods which they denominate. Such terms, indeed, shed some light upon the characteristics of the goods, but so applied they involve an element of incongruity, and in order to be understood as descriptive, they must be taken in a suggestive or figurative sense through an effort of the imagination on the part of the observer. Many such suggestive terms have been approved as valid trade-marks by the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">The District Court considered and saw fit to disregard this \u201csuggestive\u201d contention. In its opinion (300 F.Supp. 274, 276) it found that: \u201c* * * [appellant] has used the slogan \u2018Escape From The Ordinary\u2019 purportedly suggesting a frame of mind in potential purchasers that they are getting something special or different when they buy the [appellant\u2019s] products * * * \u201d and that: \u201cCommon English words used in a combination can be a valid trademark if they are merely suggestive rather than primarily descriptive of the characteristics of one\u2019s goods,\u201d but ruled that the phrase was \u201cprimarily descriptive of the characteristics of [appellant\u2019s] goods * * * \u201d As we have concluded above, we can not hold the District Court\u2019s finding to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">\n<em>The finding that the slogan had not acquired a secondary meaning.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-8\">We also deem not clearly erroneous the District Court\u2019s finding that the appellant\u2019s use of the slogan had not endowed it with a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\">Although a merely descriptive term fails to endow its originator with the exclusive right to it, if it has by use and association acquired a \u201csecondary meaning\u201d, it may confer such exclusivity. 3 Callmann, supra, 337-340 \u00a7 77.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">Secondary meaning \u201ccontemplates that a word or phrase originally, and in that sense primarily, incapable of exclusive appropriation with reference to an article in the market, because geographically or otherwise descriptive, might nevertheless have been used so long and so exclusively by one producer with reference to his article that, in the trade and to that branch of the purchasing public, the word or phrase had come to mean that the article was his product; in other words, had come to be, to them, his trade-mark. So it was said that the word had come to have a secondary meaning, * * *\u201d G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, 198 F. 369, 373 (6th Cir. 1912), aff\u2019d and modified, Saalfield Pub. Co. v. G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., 238 F. 1 (6th Cir. 1917), cert. denied 243 U.S. 651, 37 S.Ct. 478, 61 L.Ed. 947 (1917). See also Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Procter and Gamble Company, 434 F.2d 794, 802 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-14\">In 88<em>\u00a2 </em>Stores, Inc. v. Martinez, 227 Or. 147, 152-153, 361 P.2d 809, 812 (1961) the Oregon Supreme Court said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-15\">\u201cIf a name acquires a secondary meaning, the originator of the name is entitled to exclude use of it by others to the extent that the imitator\u2019s use causes or is likely to cause confusion of source in the market. 3 Restatement, Torts, Ch. 35 (1938). Confusion of source results if the imitator\u2019s use of the name misleads present or prospective purchasers into believing that the imitator\u2019s goods or services are in fact those of the originator of the trade name, with the attendant consequences of diverting business from the originator or obtaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>benefits of the originator\u2019s advertising or otherwise interfering with his protectible business interests. 3 Restatement, Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 728-730, and especially Comment a to \u00a7 730 (1938).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">This language of the Oregon Supreme Court indicates that the exclusivity granted to the original user of a trade-mark, even though secondary meaning is established, depends upon potential or actual confusion in the trade area. That Court has held that confusion is one of the indicia of secondary meaning. In Lift Truck Parts and Services v. Bourne, 235 Or. 446, 450, 385 P.2d 735, 737 (1963) the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-5\">\u201cNo one clear test has emerged in the case law as a certain and satisfactory method of showing secondary meaning. The courts tend to consider a number of evidentiary matters, including the degree to which confusion, if any, exists within the particular market, the length of use of the name, amount of advertising, and survey-reaction tests.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">The evidence indicated that appellant had used the slogan in advertising in national publications and in its catalogs. However, on frequent occasions when so used, the slogan appeared rather inconspicuously in comparison to the company name \u201cNorm Thompson.\u201d Appellant\u2019s own expert witness, Dr. Donald D. Parker, Dean of the School of Business Administration at Portland State University, admitted that the type of advertising used by appellant would have little effect in areas of the United States other than Oregon to cause the reader to associate the phrase with Norm Thompson. Specifically, Dr. Parker allowed that the interrogation of 1000 persons arbitrarily selected from a street in Georgia would produce very few who would associate the phrase with Norm Thompson. Appellant\u2019s other efforts to show that the slogan had acquired a secondary meaning consisted of the introduction of six letters written to Norm Thompson by customers inquiring about a possible Thompson-General Motors affiliation. Such letters were too few in number to indicate more than that a paucity of people associated the phrase with Norm Thompson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">Additionally, appellant presented a witness who merely had \u201cwondered first of all how Oldsmobile could be using (the slogan), and the thought came across my mind that did they or did they not have permission to do so.\u201d One further witness, a friend of Mr. Alport living in Portland testified that \u201cI associate this phrase completely with Norm Thompson. I associate it with nothing else. He's used it a great deal.\u201d Such evidence is regarded as having little value in establishing secondary meaning because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-11\">\u201cAttestations from persons in close association and intimate contact with its (the trade-mark claimant\u2019s) business * * * do not * * * reflect the views of the purchasing public * * * * * *. 88\u00a2 stores, Inc. v. Martinez, 227 Or. 147, 159, 361 P.2d 809, 814 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-13\">The evidence on persons confused regarding possible connection between the two companies suggests a sparseness of people entertaining association of the slogan with Norm Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>We cannot hold that the District Court erred in finding the evidence was inadequate to sustain appellant\u2019s claim and burden of proof that the phrase had acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">\n<em>The finding of lack of confusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">We also hold not clearly erroneous the District Court\u2019s finding that use by General Motors of the slogan in the advertising of Oldsmobile automobiles is not likely to cause the public to confuse Norm Thompson as the source of its cars, or, vice-versa, to mislead the public into concluding that General Motors is a supplier of the products sold by Norm Thompson. The District Court found absence of confusion as to source saying: \u201cInasmuch as I have found that the phrase does not denote the source of (appellant\u2019s) goods, and thus does not acquire a secondary meaning, it cannot be held to cause public confusion of source when Oldsmobile uses the words.\u201d As we have discussed above, confusion within the particular market is one of the indicia of secondary meaning under Oregon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">Automobiles, in contrast to clothing and like goods, are so vastly different that it is difficult to regard confusion as possible. The marketing channels of the companies are also greatly dissimilar, appellant being predominantly in the mail order business, and appellee having a far-flung network of retail dealers commonly known to all segments of the American public. Furthermore, in all advertisements in which the slogan was used by each party, the name of the company invariably accompanied the slogan. The most that a prospective purchaser might have inferred from this, if indeed he bothered to consider the matter at all, is that two different and unrelated companies were using a common phrase in their advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">Appellant asserts, nonetheless, that consideration must be given to the likelihood of \u201cconfusion of business\u201d in the light of current business practices, including conglomerate corporate enterprises and wide product diversification; that the relevant public might when seeing cars, clothing, and sports equipment all advertised under the slogan \u201c* * * believe that there was a common sponsorship or ownership; e. g., General Motors had acquired Norm Thompson.\u201d Appellant bases this novel proposition principally on a footnote in Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Company, 314 F.2d 149 (9th Cir. 1969) f. n. 6, page 155, and on Carling Brewing Co., Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 297 F.Supp. 1330 (D.C., N.D.Ga. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">In that footnote 6 in <em>Fleisehmann, </em>appellant says \u201cthe Court quotes approvingly from Callmann\u2019s 2d ed. that even though there is no competition between two products bearing the same trademark, the party who originated the trademark should be free to use the trademark as he sees fit without any interference from another which might tarnish his reputation or prevent extension of the trademark to other goods.\u201d However, this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Fleisch-mann </em>was made expressly on \u201cconfusion as to the source of origin\u201d, where two manufacturers of alcoholic beverages used \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d on their products, since the uses were so related that they were \u201clikely to be connected in the mind of a prospective purchaser.\u201d <em>Fleisch-mann, </em>supra, 314 F.2d 159. Thus, <em>Fleisehmann </em>is no support to appellant\u2019s point; nor is the Callmann quotation which presupposes a valid trademark, something which is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">Similarly, the Court in <em>Carling </em>held that since most beer drinkers smoke cigarettes as they drink, the products are related and \u201cit is consequently not seen how consumer confusion as to source could be avoided.\u201d <em>Carling, </em>supra, 297 F.Supp. 1337. That Court\u2019s statement on \u201cthe general current trend of previously specialized American industries to diversify their activities and to engage in production of different types of products\u201d was only intended to note that the trend was a factor to be weighed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>considering confusion of sponsorship; i. e. source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">\n<em>The Dilution Theory.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">Finally, appellant contends that regardless of the absence of confusion or competition between the parties, injunctive relief should be given appellant on the \u201cdilution theory\u201d of trademark protection. Under the dilution theory \u201c* * * the defendant\u2019s continued use of an identical or similar trademark will inevitably dilute the distinctiveness of the plaintiff\u2019s mark. The gravamen of a dilution complaint is that the continuing use of a mark similar to the plaintiff\u2019s will inexorably have an adverse effect upon the value of the plaintiff\u2019s mark, and that, if he is powerless to prevent such use, the plaintiff\u2019s mark will be eventually deprived of all distinctiveness * * * This injury differs materially from that arising out of orthodox confusion; if the similarity between the marks in question provokes confusion, the result thereof is an immediate or imminent loss of sales, because the confusion tends to divert potential patronage from the plaintiff to the defendant. Such confusion creates an immediate injury, while dilution is a cancer which, if allowed to spread, will inevitably destroy the advertising value of the mark.\u201d 3 Callmann, supra, 954-955. This theory was apparently initially given recognition in the United States in an article, The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, 40 Harv.L.Rev. 813 (1927), by Frank I. Schechter, who adopted it from German law, and Schechter proposed that dilution of and in itself should give rise to a cause of action for trademark infringement. 3 Callmann, supra, \u00a7 84.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">The District Court held that Oregon has rejected the dilution theory, citing <em>88$ Stores, Inc., </em>supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are required \u201cto accord much deference to the opinion of the district judge with respect to the law of the state in which he sits.\u201d Bigjoe v. Pioneer American Ins. Co., 446 F.2d 28 (9th Cir. 1971). However, we need not belabor this issue for in view of our conclusions that the slogan is descriptive and has not acquired a secondary meaning, and therefore, is not a valid common law trademark, there exists nothing to which the protection of the dilution theory can be applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Procter and Gamble Company, 434 F.2d 794, 803 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">. Rule 52(a) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-12\">\u201c * * * Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-13\">A finding which is solely dependent upon the resolution of disputed facts and inferences to be drawn therefrom, cannot be characterized as a conclusion of law.

On the other hand, it is clear that other courts grant exclusivity to the user of a trade-mark attaining a secondary meaning regardless of the possibility of confusion among the public. Wilhartz v. Turco Products, 164 F.2d 731, 733 (7th Cir. 1947). 3 Callmann, supra, 349 \u00a7 77.3 does not consider confusion to be an element of secondary meaning, confining the required criteria to (1) length and manner of use, (2) nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the mark and (3) the efforts made in the direction of promoting a conscious connection, in the public\u2019s mind, between that name and a particular product <em>or </em>venture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1351-15\">.

Indeed it is especially disconcerting to read opinions which, despite state statutes clearly declaring that confusion is not a premise of dilution, still cling to the commonplace that dilution cannot be recognized as actionable unless the element of \u2018likely confusion\u2019 is present.\u201d While this appeal was pending, Oregon adopted an anti-dilution statute.
