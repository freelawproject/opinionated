Myers Co., Inc., bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">Creditors filed an involuntary petition in bankrupty against Myers on June 12, 1968, alleging that on May 29, 1968, while insolvent, Myers made certain preferential transfers to one of its creditors. Following hearings on June 24 and June 25, 1968, the referee adjudicated appellant bankrupt. Myers appealed the order of the referee to the district court which found \u201cconfusion surrounding the facts\u201d of the case, and remanded the matter to the referee to hear additional testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">Following a second hearing on September 25, 1968. Myers again was adjudicated bankrupt, and the referee\u2019s order was affirmed by the district court. On appeal, this court reversed, holding that Myers was denied procedural due process by the referee\u2019s refusal to permit it to introduce new evidence at the second hearing. 412 F.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">Hearings were held a third time on October 6 and November 10, 1969, and on January 29, 1970, the referee again adjudicated appellant bankrupt. Once again, Myers appealed to the district court, which affirmed the finding of the referee. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">During the hearings before the referee, accountants for Myers and for the creditors painted conflicting financial pictures concerning Myers\u2019 solvency on the date of the transfers in question. In adjudicating Myers bankrupt, the referee resolved this conflict in favor of the creditors, specifically finding that the testimony of Myers\u2019 accountant was not \u201ccredible.\u201d On review, the district court properly stated that the \u201cfindings of fact by the referee must be adopted by the reviewing court unless set aside under the \u2018Clearly Erroneous Rule.\u2019 \u201d Bankruptcy General Order 36, 11 U.S.C. A.; Schapiro v. Tweedie Foot Wear Corp., 131 F.2d 876 (3rd Cir. 1942); Calpa Products Co., Bankrupt, 249 F.Supp. 71 (E.D.Pa.1965), aff\u2019d, 354 F.2d 1002 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, Grasberger v. Calissi, 383 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 1204, 16 L.Ed.2d 209 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"AZ8\">The only issue presented by this appeal, therefore, is whether the district court clearly erred in confirming the fact findings of the referee in bankruptcy. Under Bankruptcy General Order 36, <em>supra, </em>and F.R.Civ.P. 52(a), this court is precluded from interfering with an order of the district court confirming fact findings of a referee in bankruptcy unless error is clearly demonstrated. In re Schoenburg, 279 F.2d 806 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 923, 81 S.Ct. 290, 5 L.Ed.2d 262 (1960); 2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 25.30 [2.1] at 1023-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-17\">Here, the referee found that the testimony of the company accountant was not credible. The district court concluded that the referee\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. Following an independent review of the record, we are not persuaded that the court clearly erred in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-18\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
