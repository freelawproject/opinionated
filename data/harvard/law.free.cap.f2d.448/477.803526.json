We affirm, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s final order and order on rehearing, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>appended hereto.

Since the relevant facts are undisputed, there is no need for an evidentiary hearing. Petitioner\u2019s motion for the same and for appointed counsel are denied. The petition, too, must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Petitioner was arrested March 14, 1969, by state officials in Montgomery, Alabama, and was extradited to Louisiana May 9, 1969, where he was held by Louisiana officials in connection with traffic violations and state charges of forgery and knowing receipt of stolen money orders. Bail of $20,000 was set on the state charges. On May 17, 1969, a detainer was filed against the petitioner with Louisiana officials, by local Texas authorities in connection with certain Texas charges. On August 4, 1969, a federal detainer was also lodged against the petitioner, based upon charges that he committed certain bailable federal offenses. He was indicted on the federal charges February 5, 1970, and bail was set at $3,000. He was returned to Alabama, tried in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, and convicted of violating 18 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 2314 (transportation of stolen securities in interstate commerce) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy). The state charges of forgery, and receipt of stolen money orders were <em>nol-prossed, </em>and petitioner was committed to serve his federal sentence June 25,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">Petitioner claims that under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3568 and Davis v. Attorney General, 425 F.2d 238 (5th Cir. 1970) he is entitled to credit on his federal sentence for the time he spent in custody between his original arrest and his federal commitment. However, the Court does not agree that during that period, petitioner was in custody \u201cin connection with the offense or acts for which [the federal] sentence was imposed.\u201d In <em>Davis </em>the petitioner was refused release on state bail because a federal detainer had been lodged against him. Since that detainer had been issued on a mandatory release violator\u2019s warrant, in <em>Davis </em>the prisoner could not have secured his release by obtaining admission to federal bail as well as state bail. Here, to the contrary, petitioner could have obtained his release by posting state bond, applying to be admitted to federal bail, and then posting federal bond or obtaining release on his personal recognizance or unsecured bond pursuant to Section 3(a) of the Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146. In short, petitioner was not in custody \u201cin connection with\u201d his federal offenses because, at any time during his pre-trial state custody, he could have been admitted to federal bail by taking appropriate steps under the Bail Reform .Act of 1966, Pub.L. 89-465, 80 Stat. 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">The thrust of <em>Davis </em>is to the effect that denial of state bail must be caused by the federal detainer. If state bail is granted, petitioner is then free to seek federal bail and no credit for state custody is allowed. As a corollary, it seems useless for a prisoner to make state bail if immediate federal custody \u2014not subject to bail \u2014 is to follow. Consequently, in those two instances the courts will grant credit towards a subsequent federal sentence for the \u201cjail time\u201d spent in state custody. However, some petitioners appear to contend that the mere presence of a state and federal charge at the same time automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>grants credit. It does not. charges are bailable, a prisoner is free to seek the right of bail in each instance. Failure to do so does not inure to receive double credit. Thus, <em>Davis </em>applies only where a prisoner continues in state custody solely because of the presence of a federal detainer issued in connection with a non-bailable federal offense, or a federal offense for which bail has been refused. If both</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">Under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3568, the Attorney General is to credit a prisoner only with those days spent in custody \u201cin connection with the offense or acts\u201d for which his federal sentence was imposed. It appearing that the time petitioner was in state custody between his arrest and federal commitment was not spent in custody \u201cin connection with the offense or acts\u201d for which his federal sentence was imposed, it follows that petitioner is not entitled to the credit he seeks, and the motion for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">This the 9th day of April, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">(Signed) SIDNEY 0.

The motion will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Only two points need discussion. Petitioner argues that the documentary evidence raises an issue of fact as to whether a federal detainer was filed with Louisiana officials on August 4, 1969, as determined by the Court, or on June 30, 1969. And he also urges that federal bail was not in fact set until February 9, 1970. Under the theory upon which the case was decided, the dates the detainer was filed, and federal bail was actually set are not crucial facts. The Court merely held that <em>Davis </em>does not apply where the federal detain-er is based on a bailable offense, because the petitioner is free to post state bail and then obtain admission to federal bail. Whether a prisoner chooses to take these steps, and when they actually are taken is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Here, petitioner could have posted his Louisiana bail any time after it was set, which apparently was in May, 1969. He would have had to make similar arrangements in connection with Texas charges, a detainer for which was filed with Louisiana officials May 17, 1969. Then, the only cause for holding him would have been the federal detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Assuming that the petitioner could have made all arrangements to post state bail by June or July, 1969, and even recalling that he was not actually indicted on the federal charges until February, 1970, once a federal warrant was the sole cause of his confinement he could have quickly obtained a preliminary hearing and either a complete discharge or admission to bail, under Fed. R.Crim.P. 5 and the Bail Reform Act of 1966, Pub.L. 89-465, 80 Stat. 217. It follows that petitioner\u2019s contentions as to the date the federal detainer was lodged against him and the date federal bail was finally set do not affect the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">Accordingly, the motion to vacate judgment is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">This the 12th day of May, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">(Signed) SIDNEY O.
