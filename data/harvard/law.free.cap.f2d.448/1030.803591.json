The Tax Court\u2019s opinion is reported at 52 T.C. 378 (1969). This court has jurisdiction of the appeal under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-23\">Taxpayer Bruce Cornwall Stratton is a foreign service officer for the Department of State. At the time pertinent herein, he was assigned to a permanent duty station in Karachi, Pakistan. In the fall of 1962, he and his family were authorized to travel at government ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>pense to the United States so that he could have consultation with the Department in Washington, D. C., and then avail himself of leave time. After arrival and consultation, taxpayer went on leave for several months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was on \u201chome leave\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for a portion of this period and on annual leave for the remainder. While on leave, taxpayer and his family traveled around the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">On his federal income tax returns for 1962 and 1963, taxpayer claimed, pursuant to \u00a7 162(a), Int.Rev.Code of 1954, deductions for the unreimbursed expenditures he incurred for transportation, meals and lodging for himself and his family during the period he was on home leave as ordinary and necessary business expenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commissioner disallowed the deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner, finding that the primary purpose of the Department of State in granting petitioner home leave was a personal one, to give him a vacation, and that from petitioner\u2019s point of view it was, in fact, treated as a pleasure trip in the nature of a vacation. The Tax Court further found that there was no evidence that Stratton was compelled to take his home leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-16\">When a traveling taxpayer engages in both business and personal activities, expenses for transportation, meals and lodging are deductible only if the trip is \u201crelated primarily to the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business\u201d and not \u201cprimarily personal in nature.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2(b) (1) (1958). \u201cWhether a trip is related primarily to the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business or is primarily personal in nature depends on the facts and circumstances in each case.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2(b) (2) (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-17\">The sole question presented for review is whether the Tax Court, under the facts and circumstances of this case, was clearly erroneous in finding that home leave is primarily personal in nature rather than primarily related to taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-18\">The Commissioner acknowledges, as did the Tax Court, that the legislative history of \u00a7 933 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, as amended, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1148 (1964),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> shows that Congress want<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>ed to insure, by way of the home leave provisions, that foreign service officers and employees would return to their native land regularly \u201cto renew touch with the American way of life and so become better representatives of this country abroad.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.2508, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 139 (1946). <em>See also </em>92 Cong. Rec. 9587, 9589 (1946) (remarks of Rep. Rogers and Rep. Vorys).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Commissioner maintains that home leave is a trip that is primarily personal in nature. He points out that taxpayer, while on home leave, performed no official acts, was accountable to no one, and was not required to complete any work by the time he returned to duty. He also notes that home leave time is \u201cearned\u201d and \u201ccredited\u201d to the employee\u2019s leave account according to the length of his service abroad rather than bearing any relation to the amount of time needed for orientation. It is further pointed out that taxpayer received no per diem or reimbursement of expenses from the government during this period, thus suggesting that the Department itself did not view home leave as a business trip. And finally, the Commissioner notes that the language of taxpayer\u2019s government travel authorization expressly stated that said travel was not at taxpayer\u2019s request or convenience \u201cexcept for leave [%. <em>e., </em>home leave] as allowed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">On the other hand, the taxpayer argues that he was \u201cordered\u201d to take home leave as a mandatory duty assignment which he carried out on behalf of his employer, the Department of State. As previously mentioned, the Tax Court found no evidence that Stratton was in fact compelled to take his home leave. That finding, however, is clearly erroneous. Section 933(a) of the Foreign Service Act, <em>as amended, </em>provides that the Secretary of State \u201cmay order\u201d to the United States on statutory leave of absence any officer of the Service who has completed 18 months of continuous service abroad and \u201cshall order\u201d as soon as possible after completion of three years of service. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1148(a) (1964). A State Department regulation provides that \u00a7 933(a) \u201cmakes it <em>compulsory </em>that such employee be so ordered on home leave as soon as possible after completion of 3 years of such service.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Dept, of State Foreign Affairs Manual (Rev. August 8, 1962), \u00a7 453.1-1 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">The Tax Court found comfort in the fact that the State Department regulations also provide for \u201cdeferral\u201d of home leave. Foreign Affairs Manual, \u00a7 455.2-2.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relying on this provision, it found that Stratton failed to show that financial inability or an unwillingness to assume the burden would not have been a sufficiently compelling reason to justify such deferral. This reliance on the deferral provision is misplaced. The regulation merely affects the timing of home leave. There is no provision that the obligation can be avoided entirely. In fact, the regulation requires that a request for deferral be accompanied by a proposed date of departure by month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>and year. It also states that in order to justify a recommendation for deferral of home leave \u201c* * * specific and considered reasons <em>shall </em>be given. Unspecified \u2018personal reason\u2019 or \u2018post needs\u2019 are not considered sufficiently compelling for the Department to consider <em>requests for exceptions to established policy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). Moreover, if total avoidance was allowed, it would be inconsistent with the legislative purpose in providing for mandatory home leave in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">To be sure, home leave is akin to a \u201cvacation.\u201d In fact, that is probably what Congress intended. By what better method could a foreign service officer reorient himself with the American way of life in a short period of time than by osmosis, through travel, observation, reading, and communication with people, unburdened by the mundane duties of his everyday job?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Department realizes direct, albeit intangible, benefits in terms of the effectiveness of its employees by virtue of just such \u201cvacations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">However, the fact that both the Department and its foreign service officers, and probably Congress as well, view home leave to be in the nature of a vacation, does not alter the fact that it was also a compulsory job requirement. Unlike other taxpayers, Stratton did not have a choice as to where he could spend a substantial portion of the family treasury. He did not have the option of investing his money or spending it on a new car, a boat, a trip to another country abroad, or an expensive hobby. Instead, he was mandatorily required to take a vacation in the United States. It may not be a particularly onerous burden to many foreign service officers, but it still is an unavoidable expense imposed by the employer and by statute for reasons pertaining directly to the employee\u2019s trade or business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">Thus, we hold that the travel ex,-penses, including food and lodging, attributable solely to taxpayer Bruce Cornwall Stratton while he was on home leave were related primarily to his trade or business as a foreign service officer within the meaning of \u00a7 162(a), Int.Rev. Code of 1954.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We feel constrained to add, however, that implicit in our decision in this instance is the fact that it was the Congress that has determined to require the travel involved. In the context of a private employer\u2019s requirement that certain executives travel on leave to various countries in order to better perform their duties, such a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>quirement significantly becomes more suspect as a device for tax avoidance than would a similar requirement imposed on government employees by the Congress of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">The expenses attributable to Mrs. Stratton and the children, however, are not deductible. The income tax regulations provide that when a taxpayer\u2019s wife and other members of the family accompany him on a trip, expenses attributable to their travel are not deductible unless it can be adequately shown that their presence on the trip has a \u201cbona fide business purpose\u201d over and above the performance of incidental services. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.162, 2(c) (1958). Their expenses must be ordinary and necessary in connection with the business of Mr. Stratton, and not ordinary and necessary in connection with the business of his employer. United States v. Disney, 413 F.2d 783, 786-787 (9th Cir. 1969). Such a showing was not made in the Tax Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Stratton testified that an employee\u2019s family accompanies him on home leave as a matter of practice in all cases. He further stated that, since the spouse frequently has more \u201cpublic relations\u201d work than the employee, her reorientation is also important. R.T. 11. No other evidence was offered in support of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">Mrs. Stratton and the children are not employed by the Department. There is no mandatory requirement either by statute or regulation, that they accompany the employee on home leave. The reason that the family customarily does accompany the employee is no doubt due in large measure to the fact that the Secretary of State is authorized to pay their travel expenses to and from this country. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1136 (1964). However, the fact that these expenses are so paid does not clearly indicate that the Department, as a matter of policy, or that Congress in adopting \u00a7 1136, felt that the family\u2019s reorientation to the American way of life was necessary to the conduct of Stratton\u2019s trade or business as a foreign service officer. At best, it represents an accommodation by the Department to enable the family to fulfill its <em>personal </em>needs in reaequainting itself with the homeland at the same time that the employee is renewing his knowledge for business reasons.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, the asserted \u201cpublic relations\u201d duties of Mrs. Stratton are unspecified and, without further support in the record, must be considered to be incidental to her husband\u2019s business within the meaning of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2(c), <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">The judgment of the Tax Court is reversed and the case is remanded for recomputation of taxpayers\u2019 income tax deficiency in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">. The length of Stratton\u2019s leave is uncertain.

Section 933 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 corresponded to the provisions of existing law except that the Secretary was authorized to order an officer or employee to return to this country after two years abroad instead of three. This change was made not only to effect one of the \u201cprime objectives\u201d of the Act, <em>i. e., </em>reorientation, but also for medical reasons for personnel stationed at \u201ctropical or unhealthful posts.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.2508, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 139 (1946).

Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2 (b) (2) (1958) provides that the amount of time spent on personal activity compared to the amount spent on activities directly relating to the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business is an important factor in determining the nature of the trip. The test, however, is not very helpful in the context of this case because Stratton\u2019s single activity, home leave traveling, has both personal and business-related facets simultaneously. Renewing his knowledge of American life is directly related to his trade or business, but it is primarily achieved through personal activities like vacation traveling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">.

Thomas, 289 F.2d 108 (5th Cir. 1961), relied upon by the Tax Court and the Commissioner, are distinguishable. In those caess it was held that the expenses of convention pleasure trips to far away cities which were in the nature of a bonus for past services constituted income to the employee which was not deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense.

As mentioned at the outset, Stratton was on home leave part of the time and on annual leave the remainder.
