BYRNE, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Aqrn\">This is an appeal by appellant Oba from his conviction upon a plea of guilty to Counts One and Two of an indictment charging him with possessing an unlawfully made firearm and with unlawfully transferring the same firearm in violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c) and (e), respectively. At the time of pleading guilty, Oba retained, with permission of the Court, two legal questions for appeal, viz., (1) Did the indictment fail to state facts sufficient to constitute an offense, and (2) Would the National Firearms Act, as applied to him, force him to incriminate himself as to future acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">On appeal, appellant contends that the object described in the indictment (\u201cseven sticks of dynamite wrapped with copper wire and equipped with a length of black dynamite fuse, together with dynamite caps * * * \u201d) does not come within the definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d found in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 (f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The thrust of appellant\u2019s argument is that the object is, intrinsically, not a weapon and that it can only be labelled a \u201cdestructive device\u201d if that is the ultimate subjective intent of the possessor or transferor.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">On June 19, 1968, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (Pub.L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197 (1968)) was signed by the President. Title IV of the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921-928, which related to the control of firearms in commerce, defined \u201cdestructive device\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-19\">\u201cThe term \u2018destructive device\u2019 means any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas bomb, grenade, mine, rocket, missile, or similar device; and includes any type of weapon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of any explosive and having any barrel with a bore of one-half inch or more in diameter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Specifically excluded from this definition were devices \u201cnot designed or redesigned or used or intended for use as * * * weapon (s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Later that year, the Congress, in order \u201cto provide for better control of the interstate traffic in firearms\u201d enacted the Gun Control Act of 1968. The bill which was approved by the Conference Committee and later the Congress, included amendments to the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5801-5862, as well as to the Omnibus Act. This bill\u2019s formulation as to what constitutes a \u201cdestructive device\u201d is set forth in Footnote 1. The same definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d was applied to the amended Omnibus Act as well as the revised National Firearms Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">A clear reading of the Statute coupled with an examination of the indictment to which appellant entered a guilty plea, demonstrates that the object was a destructive device. Subparagraph (3) of \u00a7 5845(f) provides that a \u201cdestructive device\u201d includes \u201cany combination of parts either <em>designed </em>or <em>intended </em>for use in <em>converting any device </em>into a destructive device as defined in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Simply stated, a device may be \u201cconverted\u201d into a destructive device as defined in Subparagraphs (1) and (2) by way of \u201cdesign or intent.\u201d See S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Congress, 2d Sess., P. 47 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Here in his guilty plea appellant admitted that the device consisted of seven sticks of dynamite wrapped in copper wire and equipped with fuse and blasting caps.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He stated that his intent was to dynamite the City of Eugene, Oregon and admitted that the purpose of the device was to bomb and destroy the property of others. He also stated that in Eugene, Oregon, in May of 1969, he transferred the device to one Robert Caufield with instructions to detonate it on certain premises in Eugene, Oregon. In sum, that the said object was a \u201cdestructive device\u201d as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(f) is beyond controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">In light of the nature of this device and its admitted purpose, it seems absurd to even question its inclusion within the definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d approved by Congress, or to assert that it is not a weapon. The definition excluded \u201cany device, although originally designed for <em>use </em>as a weapon, which is <em>redesigned </em>for use as a signaling, pyrotechnic, line throwing, safety, or similar device.\u201d (Emphasis added). Here, appellant\u2019s own admission establishes that the weapon in issue had not been redesigned for any such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">As an adjunct to this discussion, we point out that the exception created by Congress, i. e., \u201cThe term \u2018destructive device\u2019 shall not include any device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon,\u201d in substance constitutes an affirmative defense, which, if asserted, must be negated beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution. Here, the appellant\u2019s guilty plea resulted in the waiving of such defense, thus relieving the government of this prosecutorial burden. Hughes v. United States, 371 F.2d 694 (8th Cir. 1967); United States v. Ptomey, 366 F.2d 759 (3rd Cir. 1966) ; Davis v. United States, 347 F.2d 374 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Turning to appellant\u2019s claim that the National Firearms Act, as amended, violated his privilege against self-incrimination, our analysis need go no further than pointing out that the Supreme Court has ruled to the contrary. In United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>606, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 1116, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971), the Court held \u201cthat the amended Act does not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d In so holding, the court specifically rejected the contention set forth before us that compliance with the transfer provision of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5812(a) and the tax payment provision of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5811(a) is an open invitation to the prosecutorial agencies of government to one day use this information to secure a conviction for a later act of criminality. Because of the prophylactic language of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848(a) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the \u201cpractice\u201d of the Internal Revenue Service of not making available to such agencies, state as well as federal, information resulting from such compliance, the court was of the view that such a contention was wholly without viability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC4\">\u201cThe argument, however, is that furnishing the photograph and fingerprints will incriminate the transferee in the future. But the claimant is not confronted by \u2018substantial and \u201creal\u201d \u2019 but merely \u2018trifling or imaginary hazards of <em>incrimination\u2019 </em>\u2014 first by reason of the statutory barrier against use in a prosecution for prior or concurrent offenses, and <em>second </em>by reason of the unavailability of the registration data, as a matter of administration, to local, state, and other federal agencies. Marchetti v. United States, supra, [390 U.S. (39)] 53-54, 88 S.Ct. [697] 705 [19 L.Ed.2d 889]. Cf. Minor v. United States, 396 U.S. 87, 94 [90 S.Ct. 284, 287, 24 L.Ed.2d 283]. Since the state and other federal agencies never see the information, he is left in the same position as if he had not given it, but \u2018had claimed his privilege in the absence of a * * * grant of immunity.\u2019 Murphy v. Waterfront Comm\u2019n, 378 U.S. 52, 79, [84 S.Ct. 1594, 1610, 12 L.Ed.2d 678], This, combined with the protection against use to prove prior or concurrent offenses, satisfies the Fifth Amendment requirements respecting self-incrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">401 U.S. at 606, 91 S.Ct. at 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">See, United States v.

The \u201cfirearm\u201d is described in the indictment as \u201ca destructive device consisting of seven sticks of dynamite wrapped with copper wire and equipped with a length of black dynamite fuse, together with dynamite caps.\u201d Appellant contends that, this is not a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of the Act and therefore the indictment does not state facts sufficient to constitute an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">Appellant argues that the Act applies only to gangster-type weapons and major military ordnance \u2014 two objectively recognizable types of weaponry not commonly associated with lawful private activity; that the object described in the indictment is commercial blasting material assembled in the manner in which it is ordinarily assembled for use in law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ful industrial demolition,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2and not a weapon of the types identified in the statutory definitions; and that the district court erred when it held that commercial blasting material assembled for detonation in the usual way was converted into a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of the statute because the appellant intended to use it for unlawful purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Only one court has considered the question of statutory interpretation raised by appellant. In United States v. Schofer, 310 F.Supp. 1292 (E.D.N.Y. 1970), the court held that commercial dynamite, fuses, and caps did not constitute a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of the statute, regardless of the possessor\u2019s intent. Judge Dooling said (310 F.Supp. at 1297-1298):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-5\">\u201cThe statute\u2019s terms indicate that it was not intended to reach such ordinary commercial materials through \u2018intent\u2019 alone. The language implies \u2022 at minimum the presence of parts \u2018intended\u2019 to \u2018convert\u2019 any \u2018device\u2019 into a destructive device akin to those referred to in \u00a7 5845(f) (1) and (2), all of which have definite non-industrial characters. The articles here could be assembled only into the familiar industrial blasting charge; the risk of anti-social use here was not inherent in the articles or in any suitability they had for \u2018conversion\u2019 to a non-industrial weapon or \u2018mine,\u2019 but in the potential perversion of their use. The potential is rather that of the parked motor vehicle that can be made a lethal weapon by perversion of its purpose. Since the statute is aimed at the kind of evil articles it describes, and not at evil perversions of the use of articles of innocent commerce without alteration of their nature or mode of operation, it must be concluded that the articles were not within the statute and that the indictment is ill-founded.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">Judge Dooling\u2019s conclusion that items of the kind in question are not \u201cfirearms\u201d is fully supported by the purpose, language, and history of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">The National Firearms Act imposes heavy taxes and severe controls upon transactions involving the \u201cfirearms\u201d to which the Act applies \u2014 except transactions with the United States, a state or its political subdivisions, or an official police organization. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5851, 5853. Every importer, manufacturer, and dealer in such \u201cfirearms\u201d must register annually (\u00a7 5802) and pay a special occupational tax (\u00a7 5801). A tax of $200 is imposed on each \u201cfirearm\u201d made (\u00a7 5821), and upon each subsequent transfer (\u00a7 5811). Written application must be made to the Secretary of the Treasury and prior approval obtained before a \u201cfirearm\u201d may be made (\u00a7 5822), and before each subsequent transfer (\u00a7 5812). Each manufacturer, importer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>and maker is required to register each \u201cfirearm\u201d he manufactures, imports, or makes; and each subsequent transferor of a \u201cfirearm\u201d must register the transfer to the transferee (\u00a7 5841). The manufacturer, maker, or importer must identify each \u201cfirearm\u201d by a serial number, or by other means specified by the Secretary (\u00a7 5842). Importers, manufacturers, and dealers must keep records and render returns to the Secretary regarding importation, manufacture, making, receipt, sale, or other disposition of \u201cfirearms\u201d (\u00a7 5843). Those who fail to comply with the Act ini any way (\u00a7 5861) are subject to lengthy prison terms and heavy fines (\u00a7 5871), and to the forfeiture of the \u201cfirearm\u201d involved (\u00a7 5872).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The Act is obviously designed to discourage any dealing in \u201cfirearms\u201d covered by the Act, except with governmental entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the National Firearms Act applies only to two narrow, precisely defined groups of highly dangerous weapons which Congress thought to be, in themselves, so amenable to antisocial use by private parties as to justify the strictest regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Prior to 1968, the Act was commonly known as the \u201cMachine Gun Act.\u201d It applied to carefully identified weapons (short-barreled shotguns and rifles, machine guns, certain \u201cdeceptive\u201d weapons concealable on the person, and gun silencers) which were \u201cused principally by persons engaged in unlawful activities.\u201d Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 87, 88 S.Ct. 722, 725, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968). At that time the \u201cprimary purpose of [the Firearms Act] was to make it more difficult for the gangster element to obtain certain types of weapons. The type of weapon with which these provisions are concerned are the types it was thought would be used primarily by the gangster-type element.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 914, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1959), quoted at 390 U.S. at 87 n. 4, 88 S.Ct. at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">The Crime Control Act of 1968 amended the National Firearms Act to broaden its coverage in two respects. First, a number of weapons \u2018 were added to the list of \u201cgangster-type\u201d weapons covered by the Act, namely, machine gun kits and parts, smoothbore pistols and revolvers designed to fire shotgun shells, and concealable combination rifles and shotguns. Second, the coverage of the Act was extended to include an entirely different type of weapon: \u201ca destructive device.\u201d This second addition was prompted by the influx or surplus military weapons into this country from other nations. S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 24 (1968); 114 Cong.Rec. 26888 (1968) (remarks of Senator Dodd); 35 Brooklyn L.Rev. 433, 438. <em>Cf. </em>S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 77-78. It was intended to bring within the Act items of heavy military ordnance that had no legitimate private use and constituted a substantial threat to public safety, like the gangster-type weapons theretofore covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">The \u201cfirearms\u201d covered by the Act were referred to in committee hearings, committee reports, and on the floor of Congress as falling into these two classes: \u201cgangster-type weapons,\u201d and \u201cdestructive devices\u201d described as \u201cmilitary-type weapons\u201d or \u201cprimarily weapons of war,\u201d having, it was repeatedly said, no appropriate private use.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Sena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>tor Hruska, presenting the amended definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d to the Senate, stated: \u201cThere is universal agreement that rockets, bazookas, antitank guns, heavy-field artillery, and the like should be strictly controlled, for there are no legitimate sporting uses for these weapons. Since 1934, automatic weapons, such as machine guns and sawed-off rifles and sawed-off shotguns have been effectively regulated. * * * [Destructive devices would be placed within this regulatory framework.\u201d 114 Cong.Rec. 26896 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">There is additional evidence that in extending the National Firearms Act to \u201cdestructive devices,\u201d Congress intended to add only military ordnance having little or no appropriate civilian use, and not such common commercial explosives as those involved here. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1967, a predecessor proposal which was before the Senate less than six months before the passage of the Crime Control Act of 1968, included a definition of destructive devices not unlike that later added to the National Firearms Act by the Crime Control Act of 1968. In the course of debate on the Omnibus Act of 1967, the following exchange occurred between Senator Metcalf of Montana and Senator Dodd, a member of the Judiciary Committee representing the proponents of the Act (114 Cong.Rec. 12448 (1968)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-7\">\u201cMr. METCALF. Let me ask a question before our time runs out. The Senator has included explosive devices under the destructive portions of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-14\">Mr. DODD. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-15\">Mr. METCALF. Does that mean that dynamite for mines or construction companies, and so forth, is included ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-16\">Mr. DODD. No, it does not, Senator. What I had in mind was things like hand grenades and other types of mines and bombs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-17\">Mr. METCALF. Antipersonnel mines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-18\">Mr. DODD. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-19\">Mr. METCALF. So that a legitimate prospector\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-20\">Mr. DODD. He is not included under the provisions at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-21\">Mr. METCALF. He could get dynamite?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-22\">Mr. DODD. This provision has nothing to do with that type of business. It specifically excludes such items which would be used in commercial construction or business activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b952-24\">The language of the National Firearms Act strongly supports the inference that the Act is applicable only to the gangster-type weapons and military ordnance specifically described in the Act, and does not extend to ordinary commercial blasting materials such as those involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-25\">The operative provisions of the Act apply only to \u201cfirearms,\u201d a term defined in meticulous detail in section 5845(a), printed in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>subparagraphs of section 5845(a) list specific weapons, plus gun silencers or mufflers, all clearly adapted to criminal activity and inappropriate for lawful use. The government does not contend that the commercial explosive involved in this case comes within any of these subparagraphs of section 5845(a) describing gangster-type weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">\u201cA destructive device\u201d is added to the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d by subparagraph (8) of section 5845(a). The government argues that appellant\u2019s logger dynamite, fuse, and caps constituted such a device. \u201cDestructive device\u201d is defined in section 5845(f).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Without exception, the devices listed in this statutory definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d are specific, objectively identifiable, highly destructive items of military ordnance having no proper use in private hands. Subparagraph (1) of section 5845(f) lists an explosive, incendiary, or poison gas bomb, grenade, rocket, or missile of substantial power; a mine; or a \u201csimilar device\u201d (which must be taken to mean a military weapon similar to those listed. See S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 47). Subparagraph (2) of section 5845(f) also describes a specific military-type weapon \u2014 a gun having a barrel with a bore more than one-half inch in diameter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">Obviously appellant\u2019s assembly of commercial dynamite, fuse, and caps is not a weapon of the type described in sub-paragraph (2). Neither does the government contend that it can be classified as one of the items of military ordnance listed in subparagraph (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">The government\u2019s argument for coverage rests instead upon subparagraph (3) of the definition of \u201cdestructive device,\u201d which reads: \u201cany combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into a destructive device as defined in subparagraphs (1) and (2) and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">The government\u2019s position appears to be that every \u201chomemade\u201d explosive device having substantial destructive power is brought within the Act by subpara-graph (3) of section 5845(a), subject only to an affirmative defense that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>particular device was \u201cneither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Agl\">The government\u2019s brief flatly states: \u201cthe device described in the indictment plainly falls within the definition of destructive devices since, when combined, the parts could have been used destructively. There is no need to show that the device was intended for such use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">By pleading guilty, the government asserts, appellant waived the right to show, by way of affirmative defense, that the device was not designed for use as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">There are two major difficulties with this interpretation of subparagraph (3) of section 5845(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">1. The most obvious difficulty is that subparagraph (3) itself does not bring <em>any </em>device within the statute; instead it brings within the statute a collection of parts from which a device may be assembled. Moreover, the device referred to is one to which the statute would otherwise apply. Subparagraph (3) expressly provides that the device that may be assembled from the collection of parts must be \u201ca destructive device as defined in subparagraphs (1) and (2).\u201d Thus, unless the completed device would be one of the military-type weapons described in subparagraphs (1) and (2), the \u201ccombination of parts\u201d from which the device is to be assembled is no more within the statute than the completed device would be. The evident purpose of subparagraph (3) is simply to foreclose a means of easy evasion by making it clear that the statute covers not only the completed devices described in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) but also any collection of parts from which those same devices may be assembled.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Thus, subparagraph (3) does not apply to the present case at all, for the indictment describes a completed device rather than a collection of parts from which a device might be assembled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And even if subparagraph (3) did apply, it would add nothing to the government\u2019s case, for unless the completed device described in the indictment is within subparagraphs (1) and (2) it cannot be within subparagraph (3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The legislative history indicates that the words of subparagraph (3) were intended to convey, in this respect, what they plainly say. As initially drafted, the language of subparagraph (3) was consistent, in one respect, with the meaning the government now attributes to this subparagraph. In the early draft the subparagraphs were lettered \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d and \u201cC\u201d rather than numbered; and what is now subparagraph (3) listed as an included \u201cdestructive device\u201d the following: \u201c(C) any combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting any device into a destructive device.\u201d <em>See </em>S.1854, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967). The General Counsel of the Treasury pointed out that this language \u201cwould define a type of destructive device in terms of \u2018destructive device\u2019 without the term itself having been completely defined.\u201d He suggested that the words \u201cas defined in subparagraph (A) and (B),\u201d be added to this third subparagraph of the definition. The suggestion was adopted, thus making it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>clear that the term \u201cdestructive device\u201d included only those completed weapons listed in the first two subparagraphs of the definition, and combinations of parts from which those specific weapons could be assembled. Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Committee on the Judiciary, U. S. Senate, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (July-Aug. 1967) Federal Firearms Act 1087, 1089.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">2. A second major difficulty with the government\u2019s interpretation is that if subparagraph (3) were read, as the government reads it, to bring within the Act any combination of parts which, \u201cwhen combined, * * * could have been used destructively,\u201d the coverage of the Act would be expanded in an absurd and wholly unintended manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The sum of the parts would exceed the whole. A completed weapon would not be within the statute unless it was listed in the definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d but a combination of the parts of this same weapon <em>would </em>be within the Act if the combined parts could be used destructively \u2014 which would be true of virtually every conceivable weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Moreover, since the government expressly rejects the notion that the character of a weapon as a \u201cfirearm\u201d is determined by the intent of the maker or possessor, this miscellany of weapons and devices, drawn into the Act as \u201cdestructive devices\u201d because they are capable of destructive use, \u201cwould be subject to all provisions of the act\u201d (S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 26). The miner or lumberjack who assembled dynamite, caps, and fuse for use in the normal course of his work would be required to register as a manufacturer and pay the prescribed tax, make written application to the Secretary of the Treasury for permission to assemble the materials, mark the assembled materials for identification as directed by the Secretary, register them with the Secretary, and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">It is no answer to suggest, as the government does, that a defendant charged under the criminal sections of the Act may prove as an affirmative defense that the device involved was not \u201cdesigned nor redesigned for use as a weapon\u201d but rather for ordinary industrial blasting. Aside from the fact that \u201cdesigned\u201d quite clearly refers here to the physical structure of the device and not to the maker\u2019s subjective intent, it is simply not reasonable to assume that Congress intended to subject all those who use ordinary commercial explosives to this extremely rigorous regulatory scheme, enforceable by heavy criminal penalties, subject only to their ability to establish an affirmative defense in a criminal prosecution for violating the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">A further word should be said of the government\u2019s view, mentioned earlier, that by pleading guilty appellant waived any contention that the device involved was not within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>The government\u2019s position rests upon its interpretation of the statute as embracing any device that may be used destructively through the term \u201cdestructive device,\u201d and as giving an affirmative defense to the innocent possessor of explosives for commercial purposes through the provision excluding \u201cany device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"arc-dedup-0\">As the government points out, the legislative history makes it clear that the latter provision does indeed create an affirmative defense. S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 47 (1968). But appellant does not rely upon this defense. He contends, rather, that the government\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdestructive device\u201d is wrong. If appellant\u2019s interpretation is correct, as it seems to be, the device described in the indictment is not a \u201cdestructive device\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and the indictment therefore does not charge an offense under the statute. The question of affirmative defenses is never reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the indictment does not charge an offense would not be waived even by an unconditioned plea of guilty. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b) (2); Kolaski v. United States, 362 F.2d 847, 848 (5th Cir. 1966); Hopkins v. United States, 344 F.2d 229, 234 (8th Cir. 1965); Michener v. United States, 170 F.2d 973, 975 (8th Cir. 1948). Moreover, it is clear on this record that appellant intended to preserve the contention, and not to waive it; the guilty plea was tendered by appellant and accepted by the court on that express condition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number><em>See </em>United States v. Doyle, 348 F.2d 715, 719 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Turning to the majority opinion, it will be noted that the majority\u2019s reading of subparagraph (3) of section 5845(f) differs from that of the government in at least one major respect. The majority reads subparagraph (3) as meaning that a device may be \u201cconverted\u201d into a \u201cdestructive device\u201d by the <em>intention </em>of the defendant to use the device to destroy the property of others unlawfully, an interpretation that the government explicitly rejects. <em>See </em>note 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The majority\u2019s reading of subpara-graph (3) is, at best, strained. The context demonstrates that the \u201cintention\u201d referred to in that subparagraph is a purpose to convert a device into a \u201cdestructive device as defined in subpara-graphs (1) and (2),\u201d and not a general intention to create a device to destroy the property of others.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, whether one emphasizes \u201cdesigned\u201d (with the government) or \u201cintended\u201d (with the majority), subparagraph (3) cannot be interpreted to bring within the statute any \u201cdestructive devices\u201d other than those specifically identified in subparagraphs (1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The majority relies upon the first two exclusionary provisions in section 5845 (f), namely, that \u201cThe term \u2018destructive device\u2019 shall not include,\u201d first, \u201cany device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon\u201d or, second, \u201cany device, although originally designed for use as a weapon, which is redesigned for use as a signaling, pyrotechnic, line throwing, safety, or similar device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALz\">The majority\u2019s point regarding the first exclusion is not clear. \u201cAs an adjunct to\u201d its discussion, the majority recites this provision of the statute and notes that it provides an affirmative defense that appellant waived by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">If the majority means to suggest that by pleading guilty appellant waives his contention that the device described in the indictment does not come within the statute, the suggestion is untenable, for reasons already discussed (V).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">If the majority\u2019s position is that the exclusion of \u201cany device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon\u201d supports the majority\u2019s view that the <em>intention </em>of the defendant may convert ordinary commercial explosives into a \u201cdestructive device\u201d within the statute, that position is also untenable, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">First, the legislative proceedings affecting the language of the first exclusion indicate that Congress deliberately excluded intention as a consideration in determining whether a device is subject to the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The government agrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>with this conclusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, the exception says \u201cdesigned nor redesigned,\u201d and if \u201cdesign\u201d means \u201cintent,\u201d \u201credesigned\u201d is meaningless. Third, subpara-graph (3) uses both words: \u201cdesigned\u201d or \u201cintended.\u201d Fourth, serious Fifth Amendment problems would be created, comparable to those noted below. Finally, it would materially weaken the statute if a possessor of an unregistered grenade, bazooka, or mortar, for example, could defend by asserting that he did not intend to use it as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">But even if it were concluded, despite these considerations, that the first exception means that an intention <em>not </em>to use a device as a weapon <em>excludes </em>that device from the Act, this would not support the majority\u2019s proposition that an intention to <em>use </em>a device as a weapon would <em>subject </em>that device to the Act. Otherwise, every weapon \u2014 including every sporting rifle and shotgun \u2014 that the owner intended to use as such would be within the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">As to the second exception, the majority quotes the statutory language: \u201c \u2018any device, although originally designed for <em>use </em>as a weapon, which is <em>redesigned </em>for use as a signaling, pyrotechnic, line throwing, safety, or similar device\u2019. (Emphasis added).\u201d And then comments: \u201cHere, appellant\u2019s own admission establishes that the weapon in issue had not been redesigned for any such use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">The majority\u2019s meaning is obscure. Here again, however, the suggestion seems to be that \u201cdesigned\u201d means intended, and that the exclusion of weapons \u201credesigned\u201d for non-weapon use means that any device that the possessor intends to use as a weapon is within the Act. If this is the majority\u2019s meaning, or if the majority is again suggesting that appellant\u2019s guilty plea involved an admission that bars his contention that the indictment did not allege an offense, what has already been said in discussing the first exception is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Finally, as the government points out (note 13), substantial self-incrimination problems would be raised if a maker (or transferor) of a device were required to admit that he intended to use it destructively \u2014 as, of course, he would be if his device became a \u201cdestructive device\u201d subject to the statute only if he possessed that intent. Persons required to register a present intention to commit a criminal act would seem to face \u201csubstantial and \u2018real,\u2019 and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.\u201d Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 53, 88 S.Ct. 697, 705, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>In this case appellant was charged in Count II with transferring the dynamite, fuse, and caps without registering the transfer, as required by section 5812(a). These commercial blasting materials were not subject to the Act unless they were made so by appellant\u2019s intention that they be used to destroy property. Persons required to register only if and when they have such an intention would seem to constitute \u201cpersons \u2018inherently suspect of criminal activities.\u2019 \u201d Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 96, 88 S.Ct. 722, 730, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968). Hence, \u201cit can scarcely be said that the risks of criminal prosecution confronted by prospective registrants are \u2018remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 88 S.Ct. at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">*- * *</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">At the minimum, the National Firearms Act did not apply to appellant\u2019s alleged conduct with the clarity required of a penal statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-6\">. The government does not dispute this characterization of the object involved. The complaint describes the explosive material as \u201cDupont Logger Dynamite\u201d; and it is a matter of common knowledge that the combination of dynamite, fuse, and caps described in the indictment is that commonly employed in industrial demolition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\">. In holding that appellant\u2019s intent to use the assembled commercial blasting material unlawfully made the material a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of the statute, the trial court said, \u201cThere\u2019s certainly nothing unusual in the law to characterize an object one way or another depending on the intent of the possessor. Many articles in the criminal law have one legal characteristic or another, depending on the intent of the possessor. And indeed in this particular act, the statutory definition itself uses the word \u2018intend.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b950-18\">. Alternatively, Judge Dooling held that the intention referred to in section 5845 (f) (3) would be an indispensable element of the offense, and the indictment would be invalid on its face because this intent was not alleged. 310 F.Supp. at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-19\">The majority distinguishes <em>Schofer </em>on the ground that the dynamite, fuse, and blasting caps had not been assembled into a single device as they had in the present case.

Thus the fact that the dynamite, fuse, and caps involved in <em>Sehofer </em>had not yet been assembled makes that case a stronger one for coverage under subparagraph (3) rather than the contrary, as the majority suggests. <em>See </em>note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">. This distinguishes the \u201cfour empty bottles, a number of cloth strips and two gallon can of gasoline\u201d involved in United States v. Davis, 313 F.Supp. 710, 711 (D. Conn.1970). That was, indeed, a mere collection of unassembled parts. Moreover, the device that defendant Davis intended to assemble from those parts was a \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d \u2014 an effective though crudely made, military weapon, having no legitimate use in private hands. A Molotov cocktail is objectively regoniza-ble as an \u201cincendiary * * * bomb\u201d within subparagraph (1), and is therefore a \u201cdestructive device\u201d within the Act. Because the device defendant Davis intended to assemble was a \u201cdestructive device\u201d within subparagraph (1), and <em>only </em>for that reason, the materials were \u201cintended for use\u201d in assembling a \u201cdestructive device\u201d within subparagraph (3) and were therefore within the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b955-7\">. The source of subparagraph (3) is reasonably clear, and lends additional support to this interpretation. It was copied from a proposed amendment to section 5845(b), expanding the prior definition of \u201cmaehinegun\u201d to include \u201cany combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting a weapon into a ma-chinegun.\u201d According to the Senate report, this addition covered \u201cany combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting a weapon other than a ma-chinegun into a maehinegun; for example, so-called conversion kits. * * * This is an important addition to the definition of \u2018maehinegun\u2019 and is intended to overcome problems encountered in the administration and enforcement of existing law.\u201d S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 45-46 (1968). <em>See also </em>Conf.Rep.No.1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 34 (1968). Thus in section 5845(b) the purpose of the new language was to reach parts that could be used to convert other weapons into ma-chineguns, rather than to reach some new and different kind of \u201cmaehinegun.\u201d By analogy, the purpose of the same language in subparagraph (3) of section 5845(f) was to reach parts that could be used to convert other devices into \u201cdestructive devices\u201d as already defined, rather than to bring some new variety of \u201cdestructive device\u201d within the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b956-5\">.

When the court asked whether appellant was pleading guilty \u201cbecause you are guilty and for no other reason,\u201d appellant replied, \u201cYes, sir, <em>but with the right to appeal\u201d </em>(R.T. 76) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">Appellant added the words \u201cwithout waiver of right to appeal\u201d (C.T. 41) to his \u201cPetition to Enter Plea of Guilty\u201d filed that day. Appellant\u2019s counsel also added the words \u201cwithout waiver of right to appeal\u201d to his accompanying certificate (C.T. 42). The court then entered an order accepting the guilty plea \u201cas prayed for in the petition and as recommended in the certificate of his lawyer\u201d (C.T. 42). Although the petition was changed in some respects to satisfy objections by the government (R.T. 76-77), the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>made no objection to appellant\u2019s reservation, in court and in his petition, of his right to appeal on the grounds urged in his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b957-9\">. There is an obvious reason for assigning a decisive role to a defendant\u2019s specific intention to assemble a \u201cdestructive device\u201d from a collection of parts that is entirely consistent with a general congressional purpose that the Act apply only to objectively identifiable gangster- and military-type weapons. The objective physical characteristics of disassembled parts may not reflect the nature of the assembled device \u2014 a glass container, a strip of cloth, and gasoline, for example, do not necessarily signal the presence of an unassembled Molotov cocktail. The defendant\u2019s intention removes the ambiguity, establishing the character of the combination of parts as an unassembled, or disassembled, gangster- or military-type weapon of the kind described in sub-paragraph (1) or (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">If the parts themselves are designed to convert a device into a \u201cdestructive device,\u201d then the language of subparagraph (3) makes it clear that intention is irrelevant \u2014 a combination of parts of such a design is within the statute without regard to the possessor\u2019s intent. Thus the parts of a fragmentation grenade constitute a \u201cdestructive device\u201d without proof that the possessor intended to assemble the device.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b957-16\">. Title IV of the Omnibus Grime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which replaced the Federal Firearms Act, excepted from its definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d any \u201cdevice which is not designed or rede<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>signed <em>or used or intended </em>for use as a weapon\u201d (emphasis added). Title I of the Gun Control Act of 1968 amended that definition to except \u201cany device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon.\u201d Title II of the Gun Control Act, with which we are here concerned, used exactly the same language. Thus, Congress specifically deleted the exception for a device \u201cnot * * * intended for use as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. The government states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-8\">\u201cIt is evident that the purpose of the deletion was to avoid self-incrimination problems of the kind [found] in <em>Haynes </em>[Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968)]. Thus, if a maker of a device applying to register it was required to admit that the device was intended for a destructive use, he might well have been required to incriminate himself in order to comply with the registration provisions. Under the present language, possible self-incrimination problems have been avoided by focusing on the design of the device, no matter what the actual intent of the registrant might be. When a defendant now raises the affirmative defense that the device he unlawfully possessed or transferred was not designed or redesigned for use as a weapon, the government need only disprove that allegation without having to establish the defendant\u2019s own intended use\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 11-12).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">In the government\u2019s view, then, \u201cappellant\u2019s compliance with the Act would only have indicated that he intended the device * * * to be designed or redesigned for use as a weapon. It would not have indicated that he in fact ever intended to use the device in such a manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
