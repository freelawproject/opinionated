Rayfiel, J., James Foye appeals from a conviction of the crime of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d) and 2, for which he received a sentence of 15 years. The appeal raises only the issue whether Foye\u2019s oral statements were improperly admitted against him. Appellant argues that he was not afforded \u201cappropriate safeguards to insure that all statements made were the product of free choice.\u201d However, it is quite clear that he was fully advised of his constitutional rights before he made the statements to which he objects. We would have affirmed from the bench were it not for the fact that the minutes of the pretrial suppression hearing were unaccountably never transcribed. Now that we have received the minutes, our earlier impression based upon what we had been told they contained is only confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
