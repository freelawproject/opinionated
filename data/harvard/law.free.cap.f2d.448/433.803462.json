Federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The jury returned a verdict of $25,000 in favor of Mr. and Mrs. Guest against Bailes, the appellant. District Judge Robert L. Taylor overruled the motion of Bailes for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">As grounds for reversal Bailes contends: (1) that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict of the jury; and (2) that the District Court committed reversible error by refusing to admit the testimony of two witnesses as to statements heard by them at the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-22\">The accident occurred on April 17, 1970, in Knox County, Tennessee, at the intersection of Simpson Road and Chapman Highway. A Peugeot automobile driven by Alva Jay Guest, son of appel-lees, traveling north on Chapman Highway collided head-on with a Chevrolet automobile driven by Bailes traveling south. At the point of the accident Chapman Highway is a four-lane asphalt roadway with the lanes divided by painted lines. The automobiles came to rest in the inside southbound lane in which Bailes had been driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-23\">There were three eye witnesses to the accident who testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-24\">Virgil Ogle testified that he was driving a two-ton truck with enclosed bed traveling in the outside southbound lane on Chapman Highway; that he was slowing down to turn right on Simpson Road; that a \u201cblue or green Dodge or Plymouth\u201d immediately behind the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u201cstarted pulling out to the [inside southbound] lane\u201d in which Bailes was driving; that through his rear view mirror he observed the Bailes automobile go across the yellow center line into the northbound inside lane in which Guest was driving; but that due to his turning movement he did not see the collision or know in which lane it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Mrs. Elizabeth Litton testified that she was traveling west on Simpson Road and had stopped at the Chapman Highway intersection waiting to cross; that she observed the Bailes automobile cross the center line of Chapman Highway and collide with the Guest automobile in the inside northbound lane in which Guest was driving; but that she did not notice at the moment of the collision the location of the \u201cbluish-green\u201d automobile which had been following the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Bailes, the appellant, testified that he was traveling in the inside southbound lane of Chapman Highway; that he did not at any time cross the center line; that the Guest automobile crossed the center line into his lane of traffic causing the collision; and further, that neither the truck nor the \u201cbluish-green\u201d automobile behind the truck were in any way involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The testimony of Bailes on the latter point was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cQ Immediately before this collision occurred do you recall where this bluish car was in relation to this truck that it was following ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201cA It was traveling right behind that truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, were either the truck or the car involved in the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I don\u2019t reckon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did they have anything \u2014 did either the truck or car have anything to do with the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: They were on the outside lane and I was on the inside lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, the car and truck weren\u2019t involved in the accident, as I understand it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-15\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">Thus, a question of fact was presented as to whether Bailes or Guest crossed the center line into the other\u2019s lane of traffic. We hold that this was a question for submission to the jury and that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Kroger Co. v. Giem, 215 Tenn. 459, 467-468, 387 S.W.2d 620; Sneed v. Henderson, 211 Tenn. 572, 578, 366 S.W.2d 758; Stehn v. Bernarr McFadden Foundations, Inc., 434 F.2d 811, 813 (6th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">The woman driver of the \u201cbluish-green\u201d automobile which had been following immediately behind the truck could not be identified or located to testify as a witness at the trial. Witnesses Ogle and Litton testified that they heard statements made by her at the scene. The District Court sustained objections to the admissibility of these statements as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">[Cross-examination of witness Ogle by appellant\u2019s counsel.]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-19\">\u201cQ Immediately after this accident, sir, did you go to this car that was traveling immediately behind you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-20\">\u201cA The car pulled in behind my truck and stopped behind it on Simpson Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-21\">\u201cQ And what happened there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-22\">\u201cA I talked to the girl that was driving it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-23\">\u201cQ Did she make some statement to you concerning what occurred ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-24\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-25\">\u201cQ Were her statements, did her statements have any bearing on what you had seen concerning this red Chevrolet automobile crossing the center line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-26\">\u201c[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: Your Honor, we object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-27\">\u201cTHE COURT: That would not be competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-28\">\u201c[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>[Cross-examination of witness Litton by Appellant\u2019s counsel.]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">\u201cQ Did you ever talk to that woman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cQ Were you present when she had a conversation with Mr. Ogle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201c[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: It doesn\u2019t matter what \u2014 it is hearsay \u2014 what these witnesses had to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">\u201c[Appellant\u2019s counsel] : We are not asking what was said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: What do you have in mind, counsel, by asking questions like that? What do you have in mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">\u201cMaybe I can intelligently rule on the objection if you will tell me what you have in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">\u201c[Appellant\u2019s counsel] : Your Hon- or, I have in mind the fact that this bluish car with this woman driving it was traveling this immediate distance behind this truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Ask her. You can\u2019t get at that by asking questions like the last one you asked. You have a right to ask her what you just stated to the Court.\u201d ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-15\">\u201cQ And in your presence, in the presence of Mr. Ogle, did you hear the driver of the bluish car\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-16\">\u201c[Appellees\u2019 counsel] : Your Honor, I object to anything that she heard, anything said by witnesses. That is hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: It would be self-serving and hearsay, too. Yes, the objection is well taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-21\">Bailes contended in his motion for a new trial and now contends on appeal that such statements were part of the res gestae and that the exclusion of this evidence constituted reversible error. This contention comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-22\"> Rule 43(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., permits an attorney to make an offer of what he expects to prove by the answer to a question to which an objection has been sustained.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No such offer was made in this ease. Such an offer of proof is not mandatory under Rule 43(c). However, since the District Court was not informed of the substance or significance of the excluded answers, and the record on appeal does not indicate what the answers would have been,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this Court will not reverse on the possibility that the exclusion was harmful error. Marrone v. United States, 355 F.2d 238, 240-241 (2d Cir.); Johnson v. Hill, 274 F.2d 110, 115 (8th.Cir.); 5 J. Moore, Federal Practice, j[ 4311 at 1381-82 &amp; nn. 2 &amp; 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-23\">Further, Bailes\u2019 attorney did not urge the admissibility of the statements under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule at trial. Thus there was no evidence presented at trial as to the emotional state of the declarant or as to whether the excluded statements were uttered in an exclamatory manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-24\">The burden of proof as to whether statements fall within the res gestae exception is on the party seeking to introduce them. Annotation, 53 A.L. R.2d 1245, 1260 &amp; n. 10. The trial record does reveal that the statements were made in conversation with witness Ogle subsequent to the accident. Whether such statements were a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the res gestae is a matter to be decided initially by the District Court, whose determination, in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, is conclusive on appeal. Annotation, 53 A.L.R.2d 1245, 1260-62. We hold that the trial record is void of any indication of prejudicial error with regard to the District Court\u2019s exclusion of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Bailes further asserts that the District Judge committed reversible error by interrupting the examination of witnesses by his attorney. We have examined the record and find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-18\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 43(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-19\">\u201cRecord of Excluded Evidence. In an action tried by a jury, if an objection to a question propounded to a witness is sustained by the court, the examining attorney may make a specific offer of what he expects to prove by the answer of the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-20\">. Bailes\u2019 counsel stated in his appellate brief and at oral argument that the ex-eluded answers were contained in the pre-trial discovery depositions of the witnesses. However, these depositions were not offered into evidence at trial and are not a proper part of the record on review. Rommel-McFerran Co. v. Local Union 369, 361 F.2d 658, 661-662 (6th Cir.) ; Worsham v. Duke, 220 F.2d 506, 509 (6th Cir.) ; 4 J.
