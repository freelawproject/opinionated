In a complaint with multiple counts it is alleged that plaintiff was denied due process in failing to be rehired and placed under contract as a director of institutional research. Plaintiff complains that she was not given proper notice and hearing as allegedly required under Iowa law and was not given the reason for the board\u2019s failure to place her under a year\u2019s contract for the school term commencing July 1, 1969. The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter and for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">Plaintiff and defendant submitted to the trial court affidavits and exhibits pertaining to the factual sequence of events. See 2 Moore, Federal Practice if 12.09 at 2287 (2d Ed. 1970). It is undisputed that plaintiff was originally hired by the school district on a \u201ctemporary,\u201d \u201cpart time\u201d basis (at her preference) to accomplish specific internal research tasks. This work commenced on August 22, 1968, and was to end June 30, 1969. Plaintiff was informed that at the end of the year a contract would be given to her for a new position. She relates in her complaint that this would have \u201cconstituted a promotion from a staff position to a position of higher administrative responsibility.\u201d On March 27, 1970, the board voted to hire her in the <em>\u201cnew\u201d </em>position for $17,300. Her appointment was thereafter opposed by Dr. Frank Malone, the assistant superintendent. She was not offered the new contract and her services were terminated on June 30, at the expiration of her part time job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">Plaintiff relies on Drown v. Portsmouth, 435 F.2d 1182 (1 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 972, 91 S.Ct. 1659, 29 L.Ed.2d 137, and Ferguson v. Thomas, 430 F.2d 852 (5 Cir. 1970), wherein it has been held that a teacher, though without tenure or contract, is entitled to be given the reason for her non-retention and in some instances to be afforded an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is not necessary to express an opinion on the rationale of these cases since we find plaintiff fails to bring herself within their governing principles. Plaintiff\u2019s alleged expectancy of employment in a new position is factually distinguishable from those cases which recognize a protected interest in an expectancy to <em>continuation </em>in public employment. In the instant case plaintiff had no \u201cexpectancy of interest\u201d in continuation of her part time staff job. It is not disputed that this work was \u201ctemporary\u201d and \u201cpart time.\u201d Plaintiff relies on the alleged oral representation of the superintendent, and the board\u2019s resolution to hire her for a <em>new </em>position. Whether this might afford sufficient factual basis for a breach of contract suit is not before us. Sufficient here is the fact that her position as a temporary employee affords her no right on which she might base a constitutionally protected \u201cexpectancy of interest.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this sense plaintiff enjoys no preferred position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>over any other unsuccessful applicant who applies for a teaching position and is not hired. The principles of <em>Drown </em>and <em>Ferguson </em>are factually distinguishable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">. In view of our decision, affirming dismissal, we need not reach the question of whether the present suit states a claim for relief against the school itself. See Board of Trustees of Arkansas A &amp; M College v. Davis, 396 F.2d 730 (8 Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 962, 89 S.Ct. 401, 21 L.Ed.2d 375.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">. See also Sinderman v. Perry, 430 F.2d 939 (5 Cir. 1970), cert. granted, 403 U.S. 917, 91 S.Ct. 2226, 29 L.Ed.2d 694 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1308-14\">. There is no suggestion, other than pure speculation on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, that the board\u2019s action was arbitrary, capri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>cious and unreasonable, or even a reckless exclusion or vilification of an individual from employment. Cf. Freeman v. Gould Special School Dist., 405 F.2d 1153 (8 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 843, 90 S.Ct. 61, 24 L.Ed.2d 93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1309-15\">. iWe find this court\u2019s decision in Freeman v. Gould, supra, similarly inapposite as authority here. In <em>Freeman </em>the issues of procedural due process were not involved ; the plaintiffs were notified of the reasons for their non-retention and were afforded a hearing. Moreover, the state action here essentially involves an exercise of the \u201chiring\u201d rather than \u201cfiring\u201d function of the school board. See, 44 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 836, 840 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
