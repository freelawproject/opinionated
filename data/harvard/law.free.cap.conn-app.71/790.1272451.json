We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In 1993, the defendant\u2019s brother, Angel Resto, and the victim, Andrew J. Scott,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were associated in a narcotics distribution business in the Waterbury area. Resto and Scott would obtain large quantities of cocaine, which they processed into crack cocaine at Scott\u2019s apartment at 224 Main Street in the Oakville section of Watertown. They then distributed the crack cocaine from the apartment to street level dealers. In 1994, the defendant, who at that time was a seventeen year old student at a Waterbury high school, became involved in the narcotics distribution business operated by Resto and Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In October, 1994, the defendant and Resto heard rumors that when Scott previously had been arrested, he gave the police information concerning the drug dealers with whom he did business to receive more lenient treatment for himself. As a result, they became concerned that if Scott were arrested again, he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>inform the police of their involvement in the narcotics distribution business. They decided that Scott had to be killed to prevent him from informing on them. Resto offered the defendant $10,000 \u201cto take care of\u2019 Scott. The defendant agreed and obtained a .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol and ammunition for that purpose. Thereafter, the defendant and Resto drove by Scott\u2019s apartment several times, in effect, surveilling the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">On October 17, 1994, Resto drove the defendant to Scott\u2019s apartment. The defendant knocked on the door, and Scott let him in. After the defendant entered the apartment, Scott spoke to his two year old daughter in another room. Scott left the child in the other room and joined the defendant in the kitchen. The defendant asked Scott if he could use the bathroom, and Scott said that he could. As the defendant left the room, Scott went to the sink to wash dishes. While Scott\u2019s back was turned, the defendant approached him and shot him in the back of his head from about six inches to two feet away. Scott fell to the floor, and the defendant proceeded to fire six more shots at him, emptying the pistol\u2019s magazine in the process. The bullet that entered Scott\u2019s head lodged beneath his skull, but did not penetrate his brain. Two of the bullets that the defendant fired at Scott as he lay on the floor, however, pierced his aorta, causing death. The defendant fled from the apartment, leaving Scott\u2019s daughter alone with her father\u2019s bleeding body.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The defendant went to a nearby convenience store and called Resto from a pay telephone, asking him to pick him up. Soon thereafter, Resto arrived at the store. The defendant entered Resto\u2019s vehicle and told him that he had killed Scott. After he returned to Waterbury, the defendant threw the pistol that he used to kill Scott in a dumpster near his home on Austin Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>On October 18,1994, the day after the shooting, Mary Ann Kellas, the assistant director of the day care center that Scott\u2019s daughter attended, called Scott\u2019s apartment to inquire why the child had not come to the center for two days. When no one answered her call, Kellas and Elizabeth Byrd, an employee of the day care center, went to Scott\u2019s apartment to determine if there was a problem with the child. They arrived at the apartment at around noon and, as they stood at the door, they heard Scott\u2019s daughter crying inside. They called to her and asked her to open the door. When the child opened the door, she was dressed only in a dirty diaper and was covered with feces and blood. She also was crying and saying, \u201cMy daddy, my daddy.\u201d From their vantage point at the door, Kellas and Byrd could see Scott lying on his back on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood. The two women took the child out of the apartment and asked a neighbor to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">At about 12:45 p.m., Officer Rosearme Sabol of the Watertown police department was dispatched to the scene. When she arrived, she observed Kellas and Byrd at the apartment door trying to keep Scott\u2019s daughter, who was hysterical, from going back inside. Sabol entered the apartment, checked Scott\u2019s body and determined that he was dead. She noted that the kitchen faucet was running and that a stove burner was on and glowing red. Sabol then secured the crime scene and called the detective bureau.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Detectives from the Connecticut state police major crime squad and the Watertown police department arrived at the scene to investigate the homicide and collect evidence. Sergeant David Wagner of the state police collected seven .25 caliber cartridge casings from the kitchen. He also discovered in the apartment a number of items that indicated that Scott was involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>narcotics distribution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sergeant Ronald Blanchard of the Watertown police department found an address book that included an entry under the name \u201cAngel.\u201d The telephone number listed by that name was for a pager owned by Resto.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The United States Customs Service provided Blanchard with information that Resto and Scott had been involved with each other in drug trafficking. With that information, Blanchard obtained a search warrant for Resto\u2019s apartment at 103 Walnut Street in Naugatuck. During his search of the apartment, Blanchard seized sixteen .25 caliber cartridges, which were subsequently matched with the cartridge casings recovered from Scott\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After obtaining that evidence, Blanchard contacted Sergeant Neil O\u2019Leary, a detective with the Waterbury police department, requesting his assistance in trying to locate Resto. They were unable, however, to locate Resto at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In early December, 1994, the defendant made a telephone call to his Mend, Mouzbon Maksuti,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and told her that the police had searched Resto\u2019s apartment. He also told her that there was more to the story and that he wanted to speak to her about it in person. They agreed to meet that evening at a doughnut shop where Maksuti worked. That evening at the doughnut shop, the defendant made Maksuti promise that she would not tell anyone what he was about to tell her. He then told her that Resto had paid him $10,000 to kill \u201ca Watertown guy\u201d because he was a \u201csnitch.\u201d The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>dant also described the manner in which he committed the murder, telling Maksuti that he approached the victim from behind as he was washing dishes and shot him six or seven times. He stated that after he shot the victim, he looked into his eyes and then ran out of the apartment, went into a wooded area and vomited. The defendant also told Maksuti that he keeps seeing the victim\u2019s eyes and \u201call the blood\u201d and that he could not sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">A few months later, the defendant met with Maksuti again and told her that if he had known how he would feel, \u201che would never have killed the guy.\u201d After the defendant confided in Maksuti about the killing, she wrote him several letters in which she discussed their relationship. In one of those letters, she alluded to the defendant\u2019s admission that he had killed a man in Watertown.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In 1995, O\u2019Leary was assigned to the statewide narcotics task force, which was investigating drug trafficking in Waterbury. In December, 1995, while O\u2019Leary was conducting the surveillance of a residence at 106 Hill-house Road in Waterbury, he recognized Resto, who was participating in the drug trafficking at that location. On February 14,1996, investigators from the task force executed search warrants at 106 Hillhouse Road and at Resto\u2019s residence on Mulloy Road in Waterbury. Later that day, Resto was arrested on the basis of the evidence seized during those searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In addition, at approximately 5:30 p.m., the defendant and some other persons suspected of trafficking narcotics were brought to the Waterbury police station for questioning. At the station, O\u2019Leary advised the defendant of his constitutional rights and questioned him about his involvement in drug trafficking as well as the Scott homicide. The defendant consistently denied any knowledge of Scott\u2019s murder. During the questioning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>however, the defendant acknowledged that he owned a .25 caliber pistol and gave the police permission to search for it in his apartment. The police subsequently searched the apartment and discovered a pistol. An examination of the firearm disclosed, however, that it was not the pistol that was used to kill Scott. The defendant left the police station at approximately midnight and returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">During their search of 106 Hillhouse Road, the police discovered one of letters that Maksuti had written to the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That letter indicated that Maksuti had information concerning Scott\u2019s murder. On the morning of February 15, 1996, O\u2019Leary, after reading the letter, had Maksuti picked up and brought to the Waterbury police station. When O\u2019Leary questioned Maksuti about the murder, she informed him that the defendant had admitted to her that he killed a man in Watertown. On receiving that information, O\u2019Leary contacted Blanchard and notified him that he was questioning a person who had information about the Scott homicide. O\u2019Leary then had the defendant picked up and brought to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">When the defendant arrived at the station, O\u2019Leary again advised him of his constitutional rights and questioned him about Scott\u2019s homicide until Blanchard and Detective Thomas Kolatsky of the Watertown police department arrived. After their arrival, Kolatsky and Sergeant Michael Ricci of the Waterbury police department interviewed Maksuti who told them that the defendant had admitted to her that he killed a man in Watertown. Maksuti then gave the officers a signed and sworn written statement that referred to the defendant\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>After reading Maksuti\u2019s statement, Blanchard interviewed the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When Blanchard asked the defendant about his involvement in the Scott homicide, he said, \u201cI did it, I shot him.\u201d Blanchard and Kolatsky then brought the defendant to the Watertown police station where he gave a written statement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In his statement, the defendant again admitted that he murdered Scott.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When the defendant finished giving his statement, Blanchard printed it and gave it to the defendant to read. After reading it, the defendant indicated that it was accurate and signed the statement. Blanchard then signed the statement as a witness and Kolatsky notarized the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">After Blanchard provided the defendant with some food, he told the defendant that he believed that he was holding back some information about the homicide. After thinking about it, the defendant agreed to give another statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In his second statement, the defendant gave some additional information and implicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Resto.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant signed the statement, and it was notarized by Blanchard\u2019s supervisor, Chief Inspector John Gavallas. The defendant was arrested and charged with Scott\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">At trial, both Maksuti and the defendant recanted their sworn statements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the jury convicted the defendant of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court sentenced the defendant to a term of fifty-two and one-half years imprisonment. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The defendant first claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly permitted the state, during jury selection, to exercise its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner as to two minority venirepersons in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Before analyzing the defendant\u2019s claims with respect to the two challenged venirepersons, we first suirana-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>rize the applicable law and standard of review. \u201cIn <em>Batson </em>[v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986),] the United States Supreme Court recognized that a claim of puiposeful racial discrimination on the part of the prosecution in selecting a jury raises constitutional questions of the utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . The court concluded that [although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at all, as long as that reason is related to his [or her] view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried . . . the Equal Protection Clause [of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution] forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>[237 Conn. 238, 243-44, 676 A.2d 384 (1996)]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\u201cUnder Connecticut law, [o]nce a [party] asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, the [opposing party] must advance a neutral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] is then afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the [opposing party\u2019s] articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual. . . . [T]he trial court then [has] the duty to determine if the [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] has established purposeful discrimination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> . . . The [party asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the <em>Batson </em>claim] carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury selection process in his or her particular case was tainted by purposeful discrimination. . . ,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\u201cWe have identified several specific factors that may indicate that [a party\u2019s removal] of a venireperson through a peremptory challenge was . . . motivated [by race or gender]. These include, but are not limited to: (1) [t]he reasons given for the challenge were not related to the trial of the case ... (2) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] failed to question the challenged juror or only questioned him or her in a perfunctory manner ... (3) prospective jurors of one race [or gender] were asked a question to elicit a particular response that was not asked of the other jurors ... (4) persons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race [or gender] as the challenged juror were not struck ... (5) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] advanced an explanation based on a group bias where the group trait is not shown to apply to the challenged juror specifically . . . and (6) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude members of one race [or gender], . . . Moreover, [although the racial composition of the jury impaneled is certainly not dispositive of the issue . . . it is a factor that we must consider in assessing the . . . explanation [of the party who exercises the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory challenge], . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>\u201cIn assessing the reasons proffered in support of the use of a peremptory challenge . . . [a]n explanation . . . need not ... be pigeon-holed as wholly acceptable or wholly unacceptable . . . and even where the acceptability of a particular explanation is doubtful, the inquiry is not at an end. In deciding the ultimate issue of discriminatory intent, the judicial officer is entitled to assess each explanation in light of all the other evidence relevant to prosecutorial intent. The officer may think a dubious explanation undermines the bona fides of other explanations or may think that the sound explanations dispel the doubt raised by a questionable one. As with most inquiries into state of mind, the ultimate determination depends on an aggregate assessment of all the circumstances. . . . <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>[951 F.2d 22, 26 (2d Cir. 1991)]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">\u201cFinally, the trial court\u2019s decision on the question of discriminatoiy intent represents a finding of fact that will necessarily turn on the court\u2019s evaluation of the demeanor and credibility of the attorney of the party exercising the peremptory challenge. <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 365, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991); <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98 n.21; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>supra, 951 F.2d 25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>[206 Conn. 391, 395, 538 A.2d 210 (1988)]. Accordingly, a trial court\u2019s determination that there has or has not been intentional discrimination is afforded great deference and will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>[227 Conn. 301, 323-24, 630 A.2d 593 (1993)]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 406-407.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 218-24, 726 A.2d 531, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 969, 120 S. Ct. 409, 145 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1999). Nonetheless, because of the constitutional implications of the alleged defects in the jury selection process, in reviewing the defendant\u2019s claims under the state constitution, we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>subject the findings of the trial court to the same \u201cindependent and scrupulous examination of the entire record that we employ in our review of constitutional fact-finding . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 701, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995); see also State v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 68-69, 634 A.2d 879 (1993). We invoke that heightened review, however, \u201cwithin the broader context of the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>supra, 224-25 n.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">With those principles in mind, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s contention that contrary to the court\u2019s finding, the state exercised its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner as to two minority venirepersons. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to both of the challenged venirepersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Venireperson L<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">After the voir dire of venireperson L, an African-American male, the state exercised a peremptory challenge to strike him from the jury panel. The defendant raised an objection under <em>Batson-, </em>see footnote 16; and, in accordance therewith, the court instructed the prosecutor to explain her reasons for striking L. The prosecutor stated that she had based her decision on the fact that she found it \u201cunusual\u201d that L, who was a full-time college student, was willing to neglect his studies to serve on a jury.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> She commented that in questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>venirepersons, she had never had a college student say that he so much wanted to sit on a case that he was willing to neglect his studies. She also indicated that her concerns about L were \u201ccompletely affirmed\u201d by the fact that his uncle had been prosecuted for a drug related crime and by his statement that he felt \u201cas if a lot of people have been falsely charged\u201d with crimes. The prosecutor concluded by stating that her reasons for excusing L were \u201cabsolutely . . . race neutral.\u201d Thereafter, the court excused L without further comment or objection by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Once the state met its burden of providing race neutral reasons for excusing the venireperson, \u201cit was incumbent upon the defendant to persuade the trial court that the state\u2019s reasons were insufficient or pretextual. To have done so, the defendant could have advanced reasons that are salient to a showing of pretext.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 280, 717 A.2d 168 (1998). The defendant\u2019s failure to provide the court with such reasons may be treated as acquiescence in the validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Id. \u201cGiven the defendant\u2019s silence, the only inference that the trial court could have drawn was that the defendant accepted the state\u2019s explanation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Salvatore, </em>57 Conn. App. 396, 406, 749 A.2d 71, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 921, 755 A.2d 216 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The record, moreover, fully supports the court\u2019s finding that the state\u2019s reasons for excusing L were legitimate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> L testified that his uncle had been prosecuted for a drug related crime.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cCourts consistently have upheld the use of peremptory challenges to excuse a venireperson with a close relative who has been prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>cuted because of the real possibility that the venire-person may harbor resentment against prosecuting authorities generally.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 231. In addition, L\u2019s opinion that \u201ca lot of people have been falsely charged\u201d with crimes was an equally valid basis for the prosecutor\u2019s concern about his serving as a juror. Indeed, L\u2019s response fairly implies an unacceptable bias against the judicial system of a quality that a prosecutor, on the basis of her experience, judgment and intuition, could legitimately use a peremptory challenge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 331. Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s comment that on the basis of her experience, it was \u201cunusual\u201d that a full-time student would so much want to sit on a case that he would be willing to neglect his studies also supports a finding that the state exercised the challenge for a valid, race neutral reason. Accordingly, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim that the state\u2019s exclusion of L was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Venireperson R</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The state exercised another peremptory challenge against venireperson R, an African-American male. During voir dire, R indicated that he was disabled, a \u201ccommunity activist\u201d and a member of the Berkeley Heights Tenant Council Association, which he said deals with tenant issues as well as other issues that affect the community. When asked by the prosecutor if he had ever had to contact the police in his role as a community activist, R responded that he had talked to the police \u201con different issues\u201d and their response was \u201c50 percent good, 50 percent poor.\u201d He explained that he believed that the police responded \u201cpoorly\u201d to drug related issues in that they \u201cdidn\u2019t respond. They don\u2019t respond to all the people\u2019s calls when they\u2019re called.\u201d He also indicated that that he thought that the police were \u201cnot totally on top of it.\u201d Despite his belief about the inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>quate police response to drug related issues, he stated that this would not make it difficult for him to be fair if chosen as a juror. The prosecutor then asked R about his exposure to crime. R testified that he had never known anyone who was a victim of a crime, who witnessed a crime or who might have been arrested and charged with a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">When the state exercised a peremptory challenge to remove R from the panel, defense counsel requested that \u201cthe state be required to articulate\u201d pursuant to <em>Batson. </em>In response, the prosecutor observed that one of the jurors who already had been accepted was African-American and that there was no systematic effort on her part to exclude minority jurors. She then stated that she had several reasons for challenging R. Specifically, she indicated that she found it difficult to believe that he had been totally unaffected by crime, even though he lived in a \u201cvery high crime complex.\u201d The prosecutor also indicated that she was concerned about R\u2019s negative attitude with respect to the police because the state\u2019s case depended very heavily on police testimony. Finally, the prosecutor stated that the state was concerned with R\u2019s belief that the police responded inadequately to drug related issues because the case was \u201cgoing to produce evidence relating to drug dealing on both sides, the victim\u2019s side as well as the defense side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The defendant claimed that those reasons were insufficient to establish a legitimate, nonracial basis for the state\u2019s peremptory challenge against R. In particular, defense counsel maintained that R\u2019s responses during voir dire indicated \u201cquite clearly\u201d that his negative police experiences \u201cwould not affect his objectivity in relation to evaluating the testimony of police officers\u201d and that the state\u2019s concerns \u201chardly [rose] to the level of an articulable basis for a peremptory challenge . . . .\u2019\u2019He also implied that the state was systematically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>excluding minority jurors and requested that the court seat R as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The court upheld the state\u2019s use of the peremptory challenge to excuse R, concluding that it did not \u201csee any systematic exclusion of any minorities in this particular case.\u201d The court also noted that during voir dire, defense counsel asked R only one question.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">We agree with the state that the record fully supports the court\u2019s finding that the state\u2019s reasons for excusing R were legitimate.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In his testimony, R indicated that he had a negative opinion concerning police performance, especially with respect to drug related crime. In light of the state\u2019s considerable dependency on police testimony in this case and the fact that the crime charged was drug related, the state\u2019s concerns here were reasonable and properly served as a valid, nondiscriminatory basis for excusing R. Although R stated that he would not allow those considerations to affect his impartiality as a juror, \u201ca prosecutor is not bound to accept the venireperson\u2019s reassurances, but, rather, is entitled to rely on his or her own experience, judgment and intuition in such matters.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Hodge, supra, 248 Conn. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">In addition, the prosecutor\u2019s opinion that she found it difficult to believe R\u2019s testimony that he had been totally unaffected by crime, even though he lived in a high-crime complex, was a legitimate reason for excusing R. \u201c[T]he fact a prosecutor distrusts a juror or finds [the juror\u2019s] responses not to be credible [may] be a sufficiently race-neutral reason for using a peremptory challenge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 326-27; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 14, 608 A.2d 63 (\u201cvenireperson\u2019s assessment of his own prejudices <em>may be </em>untrustworthy for a variety of reasons\u201d), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 942, 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992). The record, therefore, supports the court\u2019s implicit finding that the state\u2019s reasons for excusing R were not pretextual. Accordingly, after an independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record, we conclude that the court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim with respect to R was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly failed to dismiss the selected jurors and the remaining venire, and begin anew the jury selection process after it found a <em>Batson </em>violation as to a third minority venireperson, N. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. The state exercised another peremptory challenge against venireperson N, a Hispanic male. During voir dire, N indicated that he worked as a bartender at a cafe in Danbury and frequently traveled to New York City to interview for acting parts. He stated that he \u201cgave up a leading role in a Broadway show\u201d to be in court that day. When questioned by the prosecutor about whether working until 3 a.m. as a bartender would pose a problem for him being at court on time, N replied, \u201cIt could be tough.\u201d N further stated that the inconvenience of serving on the jury depended on the trial\u2019s duration. The prosecutor then asked him if he thought his work schedule would make serving on the jury \u201ca little difficult.\u201d N responded, \u201cIt might make it difficult, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">The court asked N which days might be problematic for him, and he said that he \u201cwould be home somewhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>around three or four in the morning\u201d on Friday if the trial continued until then. The court asked N if he would be tired if that occurred, and he replied, \u201cRight now, I\u2019m sitting on four hours of sleep, but I feel fine.\u201d The court reminded N that the trial could continue until Monday and that he would have to be in court that morning after working late on Sunday night. N indicated that he was aware of that possibility. The court also asked N whether he thought his work schedule would be \u201ca major impediment to [his] sitting on [the] case . . . .\u201d N replied, \u201cI will basically do what I have to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">At the conclusion of the voir dire, the state exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse N. Defense counsel objected pursuant to <em>Batson </em>and requested that N be seated on the jury unless the state could provide an \u201carticulable basis\u201d for exercising the peremptory challenge. In response, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[T]he reason I excused this individual is that he does not have a lot of life experiences in terms of a work environment. He has worked as a bartender, as an actor. His life tends to be a little haphazard with regard to some structure. He said he would be getting home at four o\u2019clock . . . [a]nd that concerned me. The idea [that] he\u2019s going to New York looking for jobs. He says he gives up a lead in a Broadway role. All of those issues . . . make him a difficult juror for a very serious case.\u201d Defense counsel contended that there was no basis for the state to excuse N and again requested that he be seated as a juror. Thereafter, the court stated that it was \u201cgoing to grant [the defendant\u2019s] motion\u201d and, without further comment, ordered that N be seated as the twelfth juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">On the day the presentation of evidence was scheduled to begin, defense counsel, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 400,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> sought to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>selected jurors and the remaining venire and begin anew the jury selection process. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Noting that the defendant was relying on dicta, the court stated that <em>Gonzalez </em>was confined to its facts and that to apply it to this case \u201cworks ... an injustice and detracts again from judicial efficiency,\u201d especially in light of the fact that the defendant obtained the remedy that he specifically had requested. At that time, the court also stated that the defendant\u2019s other <em>Batson </em>challenges were completely meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">On November 19,2001, this court, suasponte, ordered the trial court to articulate \u201cthe legal reasoning and factual basis for (1) its ruling with respect to the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson . . </em>. challenge to the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge to excuse venireperson [N] and (2) its subsequent decision to seat [N].\u201d On January 4, 2002, the court filed its articulation,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and stated that \u201c[t]here was no systematic exclusion of a racial group in this case\u201d and that it found a <em>Batson </em>violation as to N because it \u201ccould not exclude the possibility that the state\u2019s challenge of [N] was pretextual.\u201d The court also indicated that it granted the defendant\u2019s motion to seat N \u201cas a remedy for any perceived impropriety,\u201d and that \u201cin the worst case scenario for the prosecution, only one peremptory challenge was even suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The defendant now claims that the court\u2019s decision to seat N constituted an implicit finding that the defendant had \u201csustained his burden of proving that the state\u2019s use of its peremptory challenges was due to an impermissible racial motive\u201d and that this, \u201cin and of itself,\u201d required the court to dismiss the selected jurors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>the remaining venire, and begin anew the jury selection process. The defendant also claims that the court\u2019s implicit finding supports his contention that the \u201cvoir dire was rife with racial bias\u201d and that \u201c[o]nce the court found that the strike against [N] was racially motivated, it should then have reviewed the strikes against [L] and [R] and found that they, too, were impermissible.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Initially, we note that we should not consider the appropriate remedy for a <em>Batson </em>violation unless we determine that the state actually committed such a violation in this case. See id. After reviewing the record and the court\u2019s articulation, we are persuaded that the defendant failed to meet his burden of showing that the state\u2019s peremptory challenge of N was racially motivated. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s determination that the state committed a <em>Batson </em>violation was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">To prevail on his <em>Batson </em>challenge, \u201cthe defendant bears the burden of persuading the trial court by a preponderance of the evidence that the state\u2019s use of the peremptory challenge was tainted by purposeful racial discrimination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 640-41, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989). Thus, when ruling on a <em>Batson </em>challenge, the court has \u201cthe duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 323; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399-400 (defendant must show that but for prosecutor\u2019s invidious purpose, juror would not have been challenged).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">In ruling on the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge with respect to the state\u2019s excusa! of venireperson N, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to seat N without making any findings regarding purposeful discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>tion. The defendant asserts that the court\u2019s seating of N constitutes an implicit finding that the defendant had established purposeful discrimination. In its articulation of its ruling, the court clarified that it seated N because it \u201ccould not <em>exclude the possibility </em>that the state\u2019s challenge was pretextual.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The mere possibility that the state\u2019s peremptory challenge was pretextual, however, is not a sufficient basis to find a <em>Batson </em>violation. <em>Batson </em>mandates much more than that. Either purposeful racial discrimination has been proven or it has not; there is no hybrid position. The court also indicated that it decided to seat N \u201cas a remedy for <em>any perceived </em>impropriety\u201d and that it was \u201cacting with an <em>abundance of caution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) As we read the applicable law, seating a juror as a remedy for \u201cperceived impropriety\u201d and for precautionary reasons is not part of a proper <em>Batson </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The record, moreover, indicates that the state\u2019s reasons for excusing N were legitimate and not pretextual. The prosecutor\u2019s concerns with respect to N\u2019s late night work schedule were well founded and, under the circumstances, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for exercising aperemptory challenge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, 170 </em>Ariz. 301, 306, 823 P.2d 1309 (App. 1991) (\u201c[s]triking a prospective juror because of perceived or anticipated fatigue is acceptable\u201d). Indeed, N himself stated that his work schedule might make serving on the jury \u201cdifficult.\u201d In addition, it was appropriate for the prosecutor to consider N\u2019s general experience, work history and \u201chaphazard\u201d life in ascertaining his suitability as a juror. See <em>State v. Hodge, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 257; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 305-306. Finally, the fact that at the time <em>of the Batson </em>challenge, the state already had accepted a minority venireperson and that \u201cin the worst case scenario for the prosecution, [this was the] only . . . peremptory challenge [that] was even suspect,\u201d lends additional support to our conclusion that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>did not engage in purposeful discrimination as to N. The defendant therefore failed to meet his burden of showing that the state\u2019s peremptory challenge of N was racially motivated. Accordingly, the court\u2019s determination that the state committed a <em>Batson </em>violation was clearly erroneous and its subsequent decision to seat N was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendant was entitled to no relief on his <em>Batson </em>challenge and the fact that he received the relief that he requested, i.e., the seating of N on the jury, renders the court\u2019s error harmless as to the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly refused to charge the jury on intoxication as it related to the state\u2019s burden of proving specific intent. Specifically, he claims that there was \u201csufficient evidence to charge the jury on intoxication.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. At trial, the state introduced two sworn statements in which the defendant admitted killing the victim and provided a detailed description of the manner of the killing. The defendant concluded one of those statements by stating: \u201cI wish to say that I had been drinking vodka that day before I shot Andy Scott. I would not normally have done that if I was not drinking.\u201d When the defendant later testified, he recanted his sworn statements. Although he admitted that he had signed both statements, he denied that he provided the police with the information that was in those statements. He also testified that he signed the statements without reading them and that he signed them only because the police told him that it would benefit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">At the close of evidence, the defendant requested that the court give the jury \u201ca standard instruction on intoxication, consistent with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7.\u201d At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s request to charge, defense counsel argued that even though the defendant had recanted his sworn statements, the intoxication issue fairly was raised by the defendant\u2019s purported comment that he would not have shot the victim had he not been drinking vodka that day. The state contended that the defendant\u2019s mere claim that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>drinking was not sufficient to warrant an instruction on intoxication. The court denied the defendant\u2019s request to charge on intoxication, and the defendant excepted to the court\u2019s refusal to grant his request.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The defendant claims that his statement regarding his drinking vodka might have raised a reasonable doubt as to the existence of his specific intent to commit murder. \u201c[Wjhile intoxication is neither a defense nor an affirmative defense to a murder charge in Connecticut, evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication is relevant to negate specific intent which is an essential element of the crime of murder.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 239, 710 A.2d 732 (1998); see also General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7. \u201c[A]n instruction on intoxication [therefore] would be warranted [in the present case] if sufficient evidence was introduced to justify it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Folson, </em>10 Conn. App. 643, 651, 525 A.2d 126 (1987). \u201cBecause the state has the burden of proving the element of specific intent, the quantum of evidence essential to warrant consideration of the effect of intoxication on the defendant can be no greater than that which might have raised a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the specified mental state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>44 Conn. App. 818, 822, 692 A.2d 846, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 902, 697 A.2d 363 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">\u201cWe have previously held that it is not necessary for a defendant to present evidence of the effect of an intoxicating substance on him to require an instruction on intoxication and specific intent. The jury is permitted to infer from the fact that an intoxicating substance was ingested that an incapacity to form a specific intent resulted. . . . This does not mean, however, that only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the slightest evidence of the possibility of intoxication is sufficient to require a court to give a requested charge on intoxication and specific intent.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In the present case, the only evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time of the murder was his statement that he had consumed vodka on the day he shot the victim. Even putting aside the self-serving aspect of the defendant\u2019s statement, it yields no reasonable inference as to the amount of vodka that the defendant allegedly consumed and when he consumed the vodka vis-a-vis the time the murder occurred. The statement, therefore, provides no basis, other than pure speculation, for the jury to infer that the defendant was intoxicated to the point of incapacity to form the specific intent to murder the victim. Moreover, we can find no further indication in the record to support an inference that the defendant was intoxicated at the time the murder occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Under those circumstances, the court reasonably determined that there was not such \u201ca quantum of evidence\u201d as would allow the jury to form a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s specific intent to murder the victim on the basis of an intoxication claim. See id., 822-23. To conclude otherwise would require a court, on the slightest reference of possible intoxication, to give a requested charge on intoxication. Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to supporting the requested jury charge; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Folson, </em>supra, 10 Conn. App. 651; we conclude that the court properly refused to charge the jury on intoxication.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly refused to charge the jury on his \u201csole theory of defense\u201d and that, coupled with the court\u2019s \u201cpartisan bolstering of the state\u2019s case, separately and together, denied [him] a fair trial.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. As previously indicated, at trial, the state introduced two sworn statements in which the defendant had admitted killing the victim. It also introduced Maksuti\u2019s sworn statement in which she stated that the defendant had admitted to her that he killed a man in Watertown. Both the defendant and Maksuti later recanted their statements. During cross-examination of Sergeant Blanchard, defense counsel asked whether it was the Watertown police department\u2019s policy to videotape certain suspects and why the defendant\u2019s confessions were not audiotaped or videotaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">During closing argument, defense counsel vigorously attacked the reliability of the defendant\u2019s and Maksuti\u2019s sworn statements. In particular, he questioned the credibility of the police officers who testified regarding the process that was used to obtain the statements and the fact that there was no recordation of that process. He stressed that the jury should focus on the process by which the state obtained the statements, and the circumstances and atmosphere in which they were obtained, and not on the statements\u2019 contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">In his request to charge, the defendant requested the court to give the jury a cautionary instruction regarding confession evidence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The court declined to give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>requested cautionary instruction. In its instructions to the jury, the court first gave general instructions on the jury\u2019s duty to determine witness credibility and to assess the weight of the evidence. It then gave specific instructions on assessing the credibility of testimony given by expert witnesses, police officers and the defendant. The court also instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThere is no law in the state of Connecticut requiring police officers to audiotape or videotape the statements of any person, be they a witness or a suspect. The general policy in Connecticut is not to videotape or audiotape such statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">At the conclusion of the court\u2019s jury instructions, defense counsel excepted to the court\u2019s instruction that the general policy in Connecticut is not to tape statements and requested that the court give a curative instruction directing the jury to disregard its comment on that issue. The court refused to give a curative instruction. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, based, in part, on the court\u2019s failure to give the cautionary instruction regarding confession evidence and the court\u2019s improper comment with respect to Connecticut\u2019s general policy on taping statements. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">The defendant first claims that the court violated his right to present a defense and to due process by refusing to give his requested cautionary instruction regarding confession evidence. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>\u201c[A] fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. ... A defendant who asserts a recognized legal defense, the availability of which is supported by the evidence, is entitled as a matter of law to a theory of defense instruction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>254 Conn. 184, 193, 756 A.2d 274 (2000). \u201cWhen a defendant admits the commission of the crime charged but seeks to excuse or justify its commission so that legal responsibility for the act is avoided, a theory of defense charge is appropriate. A defendant must, however, assert a recognized legal defense before such a charge will become obligatory. A claim of innocence or a denial of participation in the crime charged is not a legally recognized defense and does not entitle a defendant to a theory of defense charge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 88-89, 621 A.2d 728 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Applying those principles, we determine that the defendant\u2019s \u201ctheory of defense,\u201d namely, that he was innocent and that the statements introduced into evidence by the state were unreliable, is not a legally recognized defense under our law and, therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a theory of defense charge. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim that his right to present a defense and his due process rights were violated by the court\u2019s refusal to give his requested cautionary instruction regarding confession evidence is without merit.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The defendant next claims that the court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding the general policy of Connecticut police departments not to audiotape or videotape statements constituted partisan bolstering of the state\u2019s case and deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial before an impartial jury. He also claims that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s improper comment. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . [I]n appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">\u201cIn determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>251 Conn. 671, 713-14, 741 A.2d 913 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\u201cIt is clear that [t]he trial court should submit no issue to the jury which is foreign to the facts in evidence, or upon which no evidence was offered, and it should not submit to the jury considerations which find no support in the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>225 Conn. 650, 659, 626 A.2d 287 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Initially, we agree with the defendant that the challenged comment was improper because it was not supported by any evidence in the record. We do not agree, however, that the court\u2019s single comment, when viewed in the context of the entire charge, deprived the defendant of a fair trial, misled the jury or was partisan in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Although the court\u2019s comment was improper, viewed in context, it cannot be argued, without sheer speculation, that \u201cit cemented police credibility\u201d or \u201cdevastated the entire defense,\u201d as the defendant claims. By properly instructing the jury that Connecticut law does not require the police to tape statements of witnesses and suspects,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the court appropriately indicated that the jury could not reasonably infer that the police somehow had acted improperly with respect to Maksuti\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s statements solely on the ground that the police did not audiotape or videotape them. The defendant, nevertheless, argues that although the police are not required to tape statements, without the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>\u201cgeneral policy\u201d comment, the jury may have found that it was \u201csuspicious\u201d that the police did not tape the statements. The defendant\u2019s argument is unconvincing because the policies followed by other police departments clearly have no bearing on this case, and it is quite difficult to comprehend, absent speculation, how the jury would find \u201csuspicious\u201d the fact that the police in the present case did not tape the statements unless it was their departments\u2019 specific policy to do so. Moreover, to argue, as the defendant does, that once the jury \u201clearned\u201d of the general policy, \u201cits doubts about the prosecution were eliminated,\u201d is disingenuous and totally unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The court\u2019s \u201cgeneral policy\u201d comment merely stated that in Connecticut, the general policy of police departments is not to tape statements of witnesses and suspects. We find nothing in the court\u2019s single comment that diminished, let alone \u201cdevastated,\u201d the defendant\u2019s defense. In addition, the defendant\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s comment \u201cgreatly exacerbated\u201d the court\u2019s \u201cimproper refusal to charge on [his] theory of defense\u201d is without merit because, as we have shown, the court\u2019s refusal to charge was completely proper. We conclude, therefore, that when the challenged comment is considered in light of the charge as a whole, it is not reasonably possible that the jury was confused or misled by the court\u2019s improper instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim regarding the court\u2019s \u201cgeneral policy\u201d comment is that it was partisan and that in making it, the court became \u201cthe state\u2019s most powerful advocate.\u201d Again, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">We recognize that \u201c[d]ue process requires that a criminal defendant be given a fair trial before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced jury in an atmosphere of judicial calm.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 10, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>\u201cA trial court has broad discretion to comment on the evidence adduced in a criminal trial. ... A trial court often has not only the right, but also the duty to comment on the evidence. . . . The purpose of marshaling the evidence, a more elaborate manner of judicial commentary, is to provide a fair summary of the evidence, and nothing more; to attain that purpose, the [trial] judge must show strict impartiality. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>69 Conn. App. 57, 75-76, 797 A.2d 1122, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 929, 798 A.2d 972 (2002). \u201cAny claim that the trial judge crossed the line between impartiality and advocacy is subject to harmless error analysis.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>51 Conn. App. 328, 335, 723 A.2d 327 (1998), cert. denied, 248 Conn. 901, 732 A.2d 177 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We perceive nothing partisan or partial in the court\u2019s \u201cgeneral policy\u201d comment. The defendant\u2019s argument that in making the comment, the court became \u201cthe state\u2019s most powerful advocate\u201d is wholly without merit on the record before us. Moreover, even if we characterize the court\u2019s comment as partisan, it was harmless in the context of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Despite the defendant\u2019s efforts to attribute grave consequences to the court\u2019s \u201cgeneral policy\u201d comment, such consequences simply do not reasonably follow from his unconvincing arguments. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a new trial because the court\u2019s \u201cpartisan bolstering of the state\u2019s case\u201d denied him a fair trial. We are satisfied that the court\u2019s charge as a whole was adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury in arriving at a fair verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt. Specifically, he claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>the court improperly defined a reasonable doubt as (1) \u201csuch doubt as in serious affairs that concern you, you would heed. That is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of great importance,\u201d (2) \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt,\u201d and (3) a doubt that was \u201creasonable in light of the evidence after a fair comparison and careful consideration of the entire evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim of instructional error regarding the burden of proof presents us with a question involving a claim of fundamental constitutional rights.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 687, 701 A.2d 1 (1997). \u201cIt is fundamental that proof of guilt in a criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>[reasonable doubt concept] provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014that bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law. ... At the same time, by impressing upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused, the [reasonable doubt] standard symbolizes the significance that our society attaches to the criminal sanction and thus to liberty itself. . . . [Consequently, the] defendants in a criminal case are entitled to a clear and unequivocal charge by the court that the guilt of the defendants must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\u201cWhen determining whether it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, we will review the charge as a whole and consider its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 296, 780 A.2d 53 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The defendant first challenges the court\u2019s statement that reasonable doubt is \u201csuch doubt as in serious affairs that concern you, you would heed. That is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of great importance.\u201d The court\u2019s language nearly was identical to reasonable doubt instructions we recently affirmed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>65 Conn. App. 672, 686, 783 A.2d 517 (2001), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Orta, </em>66 Conn. App. 783, 796, 786 A.2d 504 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 907, 789 A.2d 997 (2002). We conclude that this language, when considered in the context of the court\u2019s reasonable doubt charge as a whole, did not dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number><em>The </em>defendant <em>next </em>challenges the court\u2019s statement that reasonable doubt is \u201careal doubt, an honest doubt.\u201d That claim requires little discussion. Our Supreme Court consistently has held that the definition of reasonable doubt as \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt\u201d does not dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof when viewed in the context of an entire charge. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>260 Conn. 339, 371, 796 A.2d 1118 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 297; <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>253 Conn. 210, 248\u201419, 751 A.2d 800 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The defendant finally challenges the court\u2019s statement that reasonable doubt is doubt that \u201cis reasonable in light of the evidence after fair comparison and careful examination of the entire evidence.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 686, we found \u201cnothing inherently unfair\u201d in a nearly identical instruction. Moreover, we see no reasonable possibility that the challenged language, when read in the context of the entire charge regarding reasonable doubt, misled the jury in its understanding of the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> See Batson v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 96-98, 106 S.

In that trial, on October 9, 1997, the jury returned a guilty verdict. When the jury was polled, however, one juror could not render a verdict, and the court ordered that deliberations continue. On October 14, 1997, a juror was excused, and the defendant elected not to proceed with a jury of eleven. Accordingly, the court declared a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> \u201cUnder federal law, a three step procedure is followed when a <em>Batson </em>violation is claimed: (1) the party objecting to the exercise of the peremptory challenge must establish a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) the party exercising the challenge then must offer a neutral explanation for its use; and (3) the party opposing the peremptory challenge must prove that the challenge was the product of purposeful discrimination. . . . Pursuant to [its] supervisory authority over the administration of justice, [our Supreme Court has] eliminated the requirement, contained in the first step of this process, that the party objecting to the exercise of the peremptory challenge establish a prima facie case of discrimination. . . .

The defendant cannot escape the fact that he received the precise remedy that he requested for any <em>Batson </em>violation as to N. His contention that <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 400, <em>mandates </em>that a court must begin the jury selection process anew when it sustains a <em>Batson </em>challenge is incorrect because the language that he relies on for that proposition is dictum. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>29 Conn. App. 304, 354, 615 A.2d 149 (1992) <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting and concurring). In <em>Jones, </em>then judge, now Supreme Court Associate Justice Flemming L. Norcott, Jr., stated in his dissenting and concurring opinion that \u201c[a] split of authority exists as to whether a court, after finding a <em>Batson </em>violation, always must dismiss those jurors selected, along with the rest of the venire, andbegin the process anew.\u201d Id., 354 n.29 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting and concurring). Although Judge Norcott concluded that under the circumstances in <em>Jones, </em>beginning the jury selection process anew was the appropriate remedy to give effect to the mandate of <em>Batson; </em>id., 354 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting and concurring); those same circumstances are not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">\u201cThe rationale behind striking the entire jury pool is to provide the complaining party with a proper venire and not one that has been partially or totally stripped of potential jurors through the use of discriminatory peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>State, </em>595 So. 2d 38, 40 (Fla. 1992). Here, seating N was the more appropriate remedy because even if the state had improperly used its peremptory challenge with respect to N, that had no effect on the composition of the pool, and, therefore, the defendant was not deprived of a proper venire. See id. Indeed, under the circumstances in the present case, we perceive no benefit in striking the entire panel and incurring the additional time and expense of beginning the jury selection process anew.

Therefore, contrary to the dictum in <em>Gonzalez, </em>we believe that when a defendant is found to have sustained his burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>showing a <em>Batson </em>violation, the better practice is to leave it to the discretion of the trial court to fashion the appropriate remedy, depending on the circumstances of the particular case.

In determining what weight you consider it is entitled to, you consider all the circumstances under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>which it was procured so far as these circumstances have been made clear to you by the evidence. They include, among other things, the fact that the accused was in the police station at the time.

Whether the jury instructions on credibility should specifically address any of the factors that the defendant urges is a matter best left to the trial court\u2019s discretion, and the refusal to give such an instruction is improper only if, under the circumstance, it was an abuse of discretion.

It is, in other words, a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence. It is doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in light of the evidence after fair comparison and careful examination of the entire evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all doubt. The law does not require absolute certainty on the part of the jury before it returns a verdict of guilty. The law requires that after hearing all the evidence, if there is something in the evidence or lack of evidence that leaves in the minds of the jurors, as reasonable men and women, a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except guilt and is inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b844-10\"> \u201cThe defendant invokes both the United States constitution and the constitution of the state of Connecticut in support of his claims in his brief.
