On appeal, the defendant claims (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support each of his convictions, (2) that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal after the state\u2019s casein-chief, (3) that the juiy\u2019s verdict was legally inconsistent, (4) that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct by the defendant and (5) that the court improperly admitted certain out-of-court statements made by the defendant. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant facts. At the time of the incident giving rise to the conviction at issue in this appeal, the defendant was a member of the \u201c20 Love\u201d street gang, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Charlie Ray Logan. At that time, there was strife between the Love organization and the \u201cLatin Kings,\u201d a competing street gang. In the defendant\u2019s words: \u201cBack then, it was like a war on the streets. The Latin Kings shot at us and we shot back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In the evening of September 29, 1995, the defendant and Logan were riding bicycles on the streets of Hartford. At approximately 8 p.m., they rode past four young women at the comer of Alden and Dean Streets, where one of the women, Darlene Cardona, resided. At the time, the women had known the defendant for roughly two years through the local school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Shortly thereafter, Cardona\u2019s boyfriend, who was apparently not involved in any way in the crime or in the defendant\u2019s subsequent trial, arrived and the three other women, Arlene Reyes, Madeline Rodriguez and Jessica Rodriguez,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> left the residence to visit a local grocery store on Franklin Avenue. After visiting the grocery store, the women walked to a friend\u2019s house, at 53-55 Franklin Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">At roughly 8:30 p.m., the three women were sitting on a blue Cadillac parked in the driveway at the residence, facing the street. Four young men, Javier Mateo, Carlos Santiago, Jose Roldan and Jose Ortiz, were standing around the car. Jessica Rodriguez heard some noise and stood up, observing the street. As the defendant and Logan rode their bicycles past the residence on Franklin Avenue, each brandished a handgun and each fired four rounds at the group gathered by the car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carlos Santiago felt a bullet graze his neck. He ducked to avoid further gunfire and crawled away. Jose Ortiz was shot through the left thigh. Jose Roldan caught a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>round in the left knee, where it lodged. He managed to stagger away, onto Maple Avenue, where he entered a building and called an ambulance. Javier Mateo\u2019s flank was turned to the street during the shooting. One bullet passed through his left thigh. Another bullet entered his right flank, passed through his abdomen and chest, and exited from his left armpit. The defendant and Logan fled the scene on their bicycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Meanwhile, Cardona and her boyfriend heard the shots from her porch on Dean Street, followed by screams. In a matter of seconds, she observed the defendant and Logan fleeing from the scene on Dean Street, \u201ccuffing something\u201d in their sweatshirts. Cardona heard someone scream \u201cJavi,\u201d the name of her friend. To avoid danger, she waited until the defendant and Logan passed by before rushing to the scene on Franklin Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Javier Mateo was rushed to Hartford Hospital. The bullet had perforated his heart, leading to cardiac arrest. Although briefly resuscitated, he died after roughly one hour in the operating room.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">After seeing his own picture in the news the following day, the defendant fled to Florida. Approximately three years later, the defendant returned to Hartford and surrendered himself to the police on an outstanding warrant. He gave a statement to the police implicating himself as one of the shooters. The state then brought the charges leading to the convictions at issue in this appeal. Further facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">We first turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm and assault in the first degree. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">We review the following points of law because such an insufficiency claim is grounded in principles of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>process. The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution protects a criminal defendant from conviction absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each fact necessary to constitute the elements of the crime. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). Because a \u201cjury may occasionally convict even when it can be said that no rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201d a defendant is entitled to challenge his conviction on that basis with a motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 317, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the [evidence] so construed . . . the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Senquiz, </em>68 Conn. App. 571, 575-76, 793 A.2d 1095, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201c[T]he inquiry into whether the record evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not require a court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence . . . established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u201cIt bears emphasis that [i]n evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the [jury] is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. ... As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [jury], would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Best, </em>56 Conn. App. 742, 752-53, 745 A.2d 223, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 902, 753 A.2d 937 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In his specific claim, the defendant argues that the eyewitness identifications of him were of questionable reliability because the witnesses had a motive to lie about the defendant\u2019s involvement and had an opportunity to collude before giving statements implicating him. The defendant suggests that \u201cwhen viewed in a critical fight,\u201d the evidence is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">This argument suggests a standard of review in diametric opposition to the one we are bound to employ. We must view the evidence in the fight most favorable to sustaining the verdict, not \u201ca critical fight.\u201d Although there was a brief opportunity for the witnesses to converse prior to their statements to the police, we are in no position to infer that they fabricated their identifications and later testimony. \u201cIt is . . . the absolute right and responsibility of the jury to weigh conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Thus, the issue of the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime is peculiarly an issue of fact to be resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>67 Conn. App. 249, 256, 786 A.2d 1189 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 566 (2002). Several eyewitnesses, and the defendant\u2019s own statement, iden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tilled the defendant as one of the shooters. The jury was entitled to believe that evidence and find the defendant guilty beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Pursuant to the \u201cwaiver rule,\u201d discussed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Calonico, </em>256 Conn. 135, 138, 770 A.2d 454 (2001), we decline to review this claim. \u201cThe waiver rule prohibits appellate review of the sufficiency of the state\u2019s prima facie case if the defendant presents evidence after the motion is denied. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>28 Conn. App. 34, 41-42, 611 A.2d 878, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 919, 614 A.2d 826 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 916, 113 S. Ct. 1271, 122 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1993). Thus, when the state does not concede that it failed to establish a prima facie case and the defendant presented evidence, we must rely on the trial court\u2019s determination. See id.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zoravali, </em>34 Conn. App. 428, 442, 641 A.2d 796, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 921 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal after the state closed its case-in-chief. The court denied this motion. By setting forth evidence of his own, the defendant waived the right to challenge the court\u2019s judgment as to the sufficiency of the evidence at that point. The only proper challenge to the sufficiency of evidence at that point is addressed to the entirety of the evidence, including evidence that the defendant has set forth. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>52 Conn. App. 531, 532-33 n.2, 727 A.2d 747, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 905, 733 A.2d 224 (1999). We dealt with that claim earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Next, the defendant claims that the jury\u2019s verdict is legally inconsistent. The defendant did not raise this claim at trial. Therefore, it is unpreserved. He has not briefed any argument as to why we should entertain review under the plain error doctrine or under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ingly, we decline to review this claim. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. App. 777, 787-88, 664 A.2d 291, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 918, 665 A.2d 610 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1084, 116 S. Ct. 799, 133 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct in the form of a false identification card belonging to the defendant and testimony concerning his gang affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">As a threshold matter, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cIt is well settled that [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . [Its] ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling .... Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was ... a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Griffin Health Services Corp., </em>249 Conn. 523, 546-47, 733 A.2d 197 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">First, we consider the court\u2019s admission of the false identification card. The defendant argues that the court improperly admitted evidence that he fled the state after the alleged crime and used a false identification card bearing a different name to evade the criminal justice system. Specifically, the defendant contends that the evidence of evasive conduct related to another incident and was thus irrelevant to his consciousness of guilt for the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Next, we consider the rules of evidence pertinent to this claim. In our courts, \u201c[e]vidence that is not relevant is inadmissible.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-2; see generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>1 B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 67a. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u201cEvidence that an accused has taken some kind of evasive action to avoid detection for a crime, such as flight ... is ordinarily the basis for a charge on the inference of consciousness of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>27 Conn. App. 654, 663, 610 A.2d 672, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 914, 614 A.2d 829 (1992). The fact that the evidence might support an innocent explanation as well as an inference of a consciousness of guilt does not make an instruction on flight erroneous. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>232 Conn. 455, 472-73, 656 A.2d 646 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>64 Conn. App. 80, 88, 778 A.2d 253, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 911, 782 A.2d 1249 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">It is true that the probative value of the evidence \u201cdepends on the circumstances\u201d of each case. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 11.5.4. Supposing that there is a particular level of prejudice associated with the evidence of evasion, the court would have discretion to exclude it if the circumstances indicate that the probative value is too slight to outweigh the prejudicial impact. See generally Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3. Nevertheless, the trial court is not required to exclude relevant evidence on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In the present case, the court was well within its discretion in admitting evidence that the defendant had procured a false identification badge. The record establishes that the defendant procured a false identification badge in North Carolina following his flight from this state after seeing his picture in the news. According to the testimony of Detective James C. Rovella, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>defendant stated that he used the identification badge \u201cfor identification.\u201d The defendant argues that he used the false identification card in another incident, unrelated to the charges at issue in this appeal. Even with this additional use of the card, the court was within its discretion in considering the evidence probative on the question of evading the criminal justice system. The court properly determined that procuring the false identification card during flight made evasive activity \u201cmore probable . . . than it would be without [that] evidence.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1. Even if the jury reasonably could have inferred on the state of this record that the defendant had used the identification badge <em>exclusively </em>in an unrelated activity, it was entitled to make contrary inferences. The court was well within its discretion in considering the badge relevant to the question of whether the defendant had made efforts to evade capture.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Next, we turn to the gang affiliation claim. At trial, the state was permitted to introduce evidence that the defendant was a member of the \u201c20 Love\u201d street gang, which was \u201cat war\u201d with the \u201cLatin Kings\u201d street gang. The defendant contends, as he did at trial, that this evidence was irrelevant to any material issue, serving only as improper bad character evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our disposition of this issue. The defendant told Detective Rovella that he was \u201changing around\u201d with the \u201cwrong crowd\u201d in 1995. He further stated that this crowd was the 20 Love street gang and that he was a member. In his written statement explaining the circumstances of the alleged crime, the defendant wrote the following: \u201cBack then, it was like a war on the streets. The Latin Kings shot at us and we shot back.\u201d According to Rovella, the defendant \u201ccarefully chose\u201d these words and explained to the detective that he wanted to omit a specific reference to his 20 Love gang affiliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>because he thought that it would cast him in a more adverse light.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">This evidence was properly admitted as probative on the elements of mens rea at issue in this case. The law in Connecticut regarding the admission of evidence of prior misconduct is well established. \u201cAs a general proposition, evidence of guilt of other crimes, because of its prejudicial nature, is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crimes with which he is charged. . . . Such evidence is admissible for other purposes, however, such as when it is particularly probative in showing such things as intent, an element in the crime, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal activity, to name some exceptions to the rule. . . . The trial judge, however, must determine in the exercise of judicial discretion that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial tendency.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 23, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). \u201cBecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 638, 660, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987). Thus, we afford every reasonable presumption in favor of the ruling of the trial court. See id.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>46 Conn. App. 640, 652, 700 A.2d 710, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 941, 704 A.2d 797 (1997). As the sole explanation of the defendant\u2019s motivation for committing the alleged crime, gang affiliation was \u201cparticularly probative in showing . . . motive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 651. The defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court improperly admitted statements that he made to the police. The defendant contends that (1) testimony concerning his inquiries about the evidence against him and (2) his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>written confession should not have been admitted. The defendant claims that his statements were involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s inquiries into the strength of the evidence against him, he argues that these statements were involuntary as the result of \u201cimpermissible interrogation.\u201d The defendant preserved this claim by timely objection at trial. There is no evidence in the record whatsoever to indicate that the police took any action to elicit the defendant\u2019s inquiries into the evidence against him. Officer Peter Getz testified at trial that the defendant volunteered these inquiries, unprompted. Getz did not \u201cspeak to him pertaining the case at all,\u201d prior to these statements. The fact that the defendant was in custody does not, by itself, render his volunteered statements inadmissible. See generally <em>Miranda </em>v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 478, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) (\u201c[v]olun-teered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that his written confession to the Hartford police was involuntary also fails. The defendant argues that he did not understand his <em>Miranda </em>warnings or \u201cappreciate the gravity of the situation\u201d because he had been awake since the night before and was \u201cstill intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The state concedes that the defendant was in custody at the time when the statements were taken. Thus, \u201cour resolution of his claim requires us to determine whether he made a valid waiver of his rights. Pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, a statement made by a defendant during custodial interrogation is admissible only upon proof that he . . . waived his rights [under <em>Miranda] </em>.... To be valid, a waiver must be voluntary, knowing and intelligent. . . . The state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. . . . Whether a purported waiver satisfies those requirements is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the particular case. . . . Although the issue is therefore ultimately factual, our usual deference to fact-finding by the trial court is qualified, on questions of this nature, by the necessity for a scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain whether such a factual finding is supported by substantial evidence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u201cWhether the defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived his rights under <em>Miranda </em>depends in part on the competency of the defendant, or, in other words, on his ability to understand and act upon his constitutional rights. . . . Factors which may be considered by the trial court in determining whether an individual had the capacity to understand the warnings include the defendant\u2019s experience with the police and familiarity with the warnings . . . his level of intelligence, including his IQ . . . his age . . . his level of education ... his vocabulary and ability to read and write in the language in which the warnings were given . . . intoxication . . . his emotional state . . . and the existence of any mental disease, disorder or retardation. . . . Furthermore, [a] defendant\u2019s express written and oral waiver is strong proof that the waiver is valid. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>60 Conn. App. 219, 244-45, 759 A.2d 518, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 906, 762 A.2d 911 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>52 Conn. App. 599, 610-11, 728 A.2d 1, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 913, 733 A.2d 229, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 939, 120 S. Ct. 348, 145 L. Ed. 2d 272 (1999).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>65 Conn. App. 59, 72-73, 782 A.2d 149, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 923, 782 A.2d 1251 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Under all of the circumstances indicated in the record, the state has sustained its burden of establishing that the statement was given voluntarily. With respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>to the defendant\u2019s contention that he was too intoxicated to appreciate the gravity of the situation, the state introduced evidence that the defendant did not appear to be intoxicated. Officer John Wesoly, who had driven the defendant to the Hartford police station shortly before his confession, stated that the defendant did not have slurred speech or any odor of drugs or alcohol emanating from his person. Wesoly stated that, aside from some nervousness, the defendant did not behave abnormally or as an intoxicated person would. The defendant himself told the police that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time. The defendant made an express written waiver of the constitutional rights implicated in his statement. He read one section aloud, thus establishing that he is literate. Rovella read each of the warnings aloud to the defendant, and the defendant stated that he understood each of them and placed his initials in the margin next to each of the five warnings. Rovella also testified that, based on his experience, there was no evidence of intoxication. The defendant was coherent and did not slur his speech. The defendant carefully crafted three out of four paragraphs in the statement that followed with no assistance from the police. We conclude, having reviewed that statement, that it does not appear to be the product of an intoxicated mind. The defendant was offered food and drink, which he refused. With respect to exhaustion, the defendant never indicated that he was tired.

While I agree that the defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed, I write sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>rately because I do not agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the waiver rule as it pertains to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The defendant in this case moved for a judgment of acquittal after the state had closed its case. Following the court\u2019s denial of that motion, the defendant set forth evidence of his own. In this situation, the waiver rule provides that \u201cif a defendant elects to introduce evidence after the trial court denies his or her motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the state\u2019s case, appellate review encompasses the evidence in toto, including evidence introduced by the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Calonico, </em>256 Conn. 135, 139, 770 A.2d 454 (2001). In accordance with this rule, appellate review examines \u201cthe evidence in toto in order to review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal after all of the evidence [has] been presented.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">While the majority recognizes the principles embodied in the waiver rule, I believe that it has not applied the rule to the defendant\u2019s second claim. The majority declines to review the defendant\u2019s second claim on the basis of its conclusion that it already has reviewed the sufficiency of all the evidence in its resolution of the defendant\u2019s first claim, in which he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm and assault in the first degree. The majority\u2019s resolution of the first claim, however, does not review the sufficiency of <em>all the evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">While the majority initially casts the first claim as a general challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, it clearly states later that the defendant\u2019s <em>specific claim </em>is that the eyewitness identifications of him were unreliable. The majority then goes on to analyze the credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>of the eyewitnesses. The analysis is limited to this one aspect of the evidence and goes no further. On the basis of the defendant\u2019s specific claim and the majority\u2019s subsequent analysis, it is clear to me that the defendant\u2019s claim, properly stated, is that there was insufficient evidence to convict him because the eyewitness identifications were unreliable. This does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence generally nor does it require, or indeed even allow, the majority to review all the evidence presented in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The defendant cannot be deprived of appellate review of his second claim based on the resolution of the first claim because the second claim, according to the waiver rule, requires an examination of <em>all the evidence in toto. </em>Since the defendant\u2019s first claim challenged only one limited aspect of the evidence, namely, the eyewitness identifications, the majority did not review all the evidence in its resolution of the claim, but rather examined only these identifications. I conclude that the majority\u2019s review of the evidence in claim one is not adequate to meet the waiver rule\u2019s requirement that we examine <em>all the evidence in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In addition, I note that the waiver rule cannot be used to decline review. While I understand the majority\u2019s use of the phrase in this particular case, where it perceives the first and second claims to be essentially the same, I believe it is incorrect to state that we decline review \u25a0under the waiver rule. The waiver rule requires a complete evidentiary review; it provides no authority to decline review. In the present case, therefore, if the majority had in fact reviewed all the evidence in claim one, it should have concluded that review of the second claim was unwarranted because the issue already had been fully addressed in claim one and that further review in this particular case would be merely dupli-cative.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>My differences with the majority\u2019s application of the waiver rale notwithstanding, however, I also conclude that the defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed. After a review of the defendant\u2019s second claim under the waiver rale, in which I examined all the evidence presented at trial, it is my opinion that the court properly denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal and that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the defendant guilty of the crimes charged. I therefore agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
