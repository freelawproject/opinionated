A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF TYLENOL<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The plaintiffs claims are different from those previously asserted against the defendants about the safety of Tylenol. While previous cases have questioned whether Tylenol can cause liver damage, this case and others in this MDL question the extent of such damage and the quickness with which it can occur. A historical overview of the regulation and science of Tylenol is helpful in explaining the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">a. TYLENOL, ACETAMINOPHEN, AND LIVER DAMAGE <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Extra Strength Tylenol is an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever; consumers do not need a prescription to buy it. The active ingredient in Extra Strength Tylenol is acetaminophen, which is an analgesic and antipyretic or pain reliever and fever reducer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant McNeil manufactures and markets many different Tylenol products, including Extra Strength Tylenol and Regular Strength Tylenol. The two products differ in that one tablet of Extra Strength Tylenol contains 500 mg of acetaminophen while a tablet of Regular Strength Tylenol contains only 325 mg of acetaminophen per tablet. Johnson &amp; Johnson is the parent company of McNeil and is involved in managing its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">Acetaminophen was first synthesized as a pain reliever in the 1890s and has been available OTC since the 1960s.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tylenol is one of more than 600 acetaminophen-containing products on the market in the United States in OTC and prescription formulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Acetaminophen is one of the most widely used OTC drugs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Twenty percent of Americans \u2014 60 million people\u2014 ingest an acetaminophen-containing product each week.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Food and Drug Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ministration (FDA), which regulates OTC drugs, has found acetaminophen to be a \u201csafe and effective OTC analgesic\u201d when taken in recommended doses and used according to the label.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, acetaminophen has been known to cause severe liver damage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">i. Acetaminophen\u2019s Link to Acute Liver Failure</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Acetaminophen is different from other OTC pain relievers in two ways: 1) it is the only one to have an antidote, and 2) its maximum total daily limit is the same for both OTC and prescription products.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Acetaminophen is a \u201cdose-related toxin,\u201d meaning it can be safely used at certain doses but harmful at higher doses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result, there is evidence that it has a \u201cnarrow therapeutic margin\u201d \u2014 i.e., there is lit-tie difference between the- current maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen and the doses that could cause liver injury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The parties debate how narrow this margin is.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">A simplistic explanation of how the body metabolizes acetaminophen helps frame the issues in this case. Typically, gluta-thione \u2014 an antioxidant found in the liver\u2014 will bind to the toxic parts of acetaminophen, to neutralize them and prevent them from harming the body.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These neutralized toxins are then excreted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, if the body does not have enough gluta-thione, those toxins can build up in the liver,- causing acute liver failure (ALF). Glutathione stores may be low when a person is malnourished or when the liver has been neutralizing a lot of toxins at once.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u25a0 \u201cAcute liver failure (ALF) is a rapid deterioration of the organ\u2019s ability to function.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Patients who experience ALF can fall into a coma or die.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> They may require a liver transplant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A person who has recovered from ALF may still be at risk of redeveloping it, if the person again consumes too much acetaminophen.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">If acetaminophen-induced ALF is recognized quickly, acetaminophen\u2019s antidote (N-acetylcysteine or NAC) can be given to a patient to supply glutathione and prevent or decrease liver injury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, persons who have developed ALF from an unintentional acetaminophen overdose may not realize their liver injury because symptoms of ALF are not readily apparent or may look like the symptoms the acetaminophen is being used to treat (i.e., flu symptoms).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">ii. FDA Actions to Address Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Failure</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">The majority of acute liver failure eases in the United States are related to the use of acetaminophen.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Each year, acetaminophen is responsible for hundreds of deaths and liver transplants, in addition to tens of thousands of hospitalizations.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> These acetaminophen-induced liver injury patients include both people who are intentionally trying to harm themselves (i.e., attempting suicide) and those who take acetaminophen for therapeutic reasons (i.e., to treat physical pain).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> There is evidence that patients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>taking acetaminophen at 4 g per day \u2014 the recommended maximum daily dose until recently \u2014 may be at risk of developing acute liver'failure.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Medical literature began questioning the safety of acetaminophen at or just above therapeutic levels as far back as the 1980s.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> During the 1990s, members of the medical community continued to raise concerns about acute liver failure occurring in patients at or even lower than the maximum daily dose of 4 grams.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Throughout this same time period, McNeil was also actively engaged in' research and development of a drug or combination of ingredients that would reduce or eliminate acetaminophen\u2019s potentially toxic effects on the liver.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In 2002, the FDA convened an Advisory Committee to discuss ways to prevent liver injury caused by unintentional acetaminophen overdose.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> During the .Committee Meeting, the FDA presented findings from medical literature: 1) that hepatotoxicity may occur \u201cat recommended doses of APAP,\u201d 2) that such cases were linked to risk factors such as alcohol use and/or fasting, and 3) that some cases of unintentional overdose led to death.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The FDA also presented its own findings from a review of its own internal Adverse Event Reporting (AER) database. The FDA found hepatotoxicity (i.e., liver damage) in persons who have ingested less than 4 grams/day and who had risk factors like alcohol and \u201cpoor nutritional status.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As a result, the American Association of the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and the FDA offered specific recommendations for enhancing safety warnings and instructions for acetaminophen-based products.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">In 2006, the FDA proposed a rule to strengthen warnings regarding the risk of liver damage from taking acetaminophen.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>After receiving and reviewing public comments, the FDA promulgated a final rule outlining the liver warnings it found to be necessary.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This final rule, issued in 2009, is explained further below.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In February 2008, the Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity Working Group for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the FDA met to discuss ways to address unintentional acetaminophen overdose.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Group outlined several recommendations, including a reduction in the maximum tablet strength from 500 mg to 325 mg.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The reduction in tablet strength was intended to reduce the overall recommended daily dose of Tylenol from 4,000 mg to 3,250 mg.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> This recommendation was made over the objection of an unnamed acetaminophen manufacturer which asserted the data did not support a need for the change; the Group looked at Adverse Events Reports (AERs) showing that daily doses of 4 g presented a risk for some individuals.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Survey data also showed that \u201cpeople routinely and knowingly take more than the recommended dose of OTC pain relievers.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In June 2009, a joint meeting of several FDA Advisory Committees was held to discuss the issue of liver injury related to acetaminophen use.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The joint committee recommended that the warning on acetaminophen products be further strengthened and the recommended dose reduced.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Asb\">b. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR TYLENOL</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">OTC drugs are approved by the FDA through two separate routes: the New Drug Application (NDA) process and the monograph system.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> During the forty or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>so years Extra Strength Tylenol has been available OTC, it has been regulated under both FDA regulatory processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">i. New Drug Application v. Monograph Process</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The NDA process requires specific products be approved for sale with specific labeling.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The monograph system allows for the marketing of OTC drugs containing particular ingredients, which were already on the market before the FDA established the monograph system in 1972.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> These active ingredients, which include acetaminophen, were ones which had been found to be generally safe and effective through general usage.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Therefore, they were allowed to remain on the market OTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Because Extra Strength Tylenol\u2019s active ingredient is acetaminophen, it was automatically regulated by the monograph system as of 1972. In 1975, the FDA approved Extra Strength Tylenol as \u201csafe and effective for use as recommended in the submitted labeling,\u201d pursuant to a New Drug Application (NDA 17-552)<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In the FDA\u2019s letter approving Extra Strength Tylenol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>for OTC sale and use under the NDA, the FDA also noted that \u201cupon publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER of the OTC Monograph for acetaminophen, revision of the labeling or other action affecting the marketing of [Extra Strength Tylenol] may be required.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In 1998, McNeil voluntarily withdrew the NDA for Extra Strength Tylenol.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Since that time, Extra Strength Tylenol has been marketed pursuant to the monograph system only.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The monograph system is essentially an expanded version of administrative notice- and-comment rulemaking, which required two rounds of proposals and comments as opposed to just one. The monograph process includes four main steps: 1) a review by panels of qualified experts which then recommend the conditions under which the drug can be used, 2) publication of a the expert panel\u2019s recommendations as a proposed rule in the Federal Register for public comment on safety and effectiveness, 3) FDA review of the comments on the experts\u2019 proposed rule and publication of a tentative final monograph (TFM) with a second opportunity for comments on the TFM, and 4) publication of the final monograph which includes the FDA\u2019s findings on when a drug is considered to be generally safe and effective for use.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.10. A drug is considered \u201csafe\u201d under the monograph system when it has \u201ca low incidence of adverse reactions or significant side effects under adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use as well as low potential for harm which may result from abuse under conditions of widespread availability.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.10(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">ii. Regulation of Acetaminophen Under the Monograph System</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">In 1972, acetaminophen was listed as \u201can effective analgesic\u201d under the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation program implemented by the FDA, which was the first phase of what would become the monograph process.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In 1977, the FDA published a Proposed Rule for Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic (IAAA) Products reflecting the Advisory Panel\u2019s report on this category of ingredients.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> This Rule categorized acetaminophen as a Category I active ingredient, meaning that it was \u201cgenerally recognized as safe and effective\u201d or GRASE. That proposed rule made clear that warnings on products containing those ingredients were still important: \u201c[b]ecause OTC products can be purchased by anyone [and] the public generally does not regard those products as medicines which, if used improperly, can result in injurious or potentially serious consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The rule explained: \u201cThe consumer should be informed of any possible signs of known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>toxicity or any indication requiring discontinuation of the use of the drug so that appropriate steps may be taken before more severe symptoms become apparent.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Specifically, the Proposed Rule noted: \u201cacetaminophen has no [ ] sign of toxicity or \u2018safety valve\u2019 to alert the consumer [to the development of ALF].\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> For this reason, the Proposed Rule recommended that all products containing acetaminophen contain the warning, \u201cDo not exceed recommended dosage because severe liver damage may occur.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The Proposed Rule-also stated that a single dose of acetaminophen (2 tablets) containing 500 mg \u2014 i.e., Extra Strength Tylenol \u2014 should be taken every 6 hours while a single dose of 325 mg tablets could be taken every 4 hours.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On November 16, 1988, the FDA issued a Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Anti-rheumatic (IAAA) products, including acetaminophen.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In the TFM, the FDA reviewed comments on the 1977 Proposed Rule and determined which parts remained valid and which it declined to adopt. Though the FDA made its recommendations for regulating IAAA products, the TFM was still considered a proposed regulation subject to additional comments.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In the TFM, the FDA continued to categorize acetaminophen under Category I: GRASE.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> It adopted the Panel\u2019s recommended dosing as well.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Specifically, products containing acetaminophen were expected to have the following dosing instructions for adults: \u201c325 to 650 milligrams every 4 hours or 325 to 650 milligrams every 3 hours or 650 to 1,000 milligrams every 6 hours, while symptoms persist, not to exceed 4,000 milligrams in 24 hours or as directed by a doctor.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> It also \u201ctentatively decided not to adopt the liver warning recommended by the Panel\u201d though the FDA was \u201caware that liver damage can occur from acetaminophen overdosage.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The FDA has not yet issued a Final Monograph for IAAA products. These products, including those containing acetaminophen, continue to operate under the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM). During the relevant timeframe of this case, Extra Strength Tylenol was only regulated by the TFM.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The FDA has explained: \u201cUnder a TFM, manufacturers market products at their own risk and are able to make voluntary adjustments [to their product\u2019s label] taking into account the information presented in the proposed TFM.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Until that final regulatory determination is made \u2014 if it ever is \u2014 the defendants remain responsible for all aspects of the Tylenol label.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">c. EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL LABELING FROM 1977 TO 2010</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">From 1977 until 1994, the label on Extra Strength Tylenol bottles remained virtually unchanged. Over the next ten years, McNeil petitioned the FDA three times to allow them to add additional warnings to the Extra Strength Tylenol label. In 1994, McNeil sought approval from the FDA to add a warning that taking Extra Strength Tylenol with alcohol or other products containing acetaminophen could cause liver damage.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The FDA approved this request.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> During the approval process, the FDA informed McNeil that the Extra Strength Tylenol label was not in conformity with the TFM because it instructed consumers to take 2 caplets \u201cevery 4-6 hours\u201d as opposed to every 6 hours.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>1998, the FDA promulgated a final rule requiring that an alcohol warning be included on all acetaminophen products.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In 2001, McNeil again petitioned the FDA to add a warning stating: \u201c[t]aking more than the recommended dose (overdose) could cause serious health problems.\u201d <footnotemark>73</footnotemark> After an advisory committee meeting with the FDA about acetaminophen labeling and safety, McNeil submitted a second request to further strengthen its proposed warning change by replacing \u201cserious health problems\u201d language with specific language warning of overdose and liver damage.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The FDA approved that change in 2003.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> In 2004, McNeil introduced a Tylenol warning that contained the following overdose/organ-specific liver damage language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">Taking more than the recommended dose (overdose) may cause liver damage. In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away. Quick medical attention is critical for adults as well as for children even if you do not notice any signs or symptoms.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">In 2006, the FDA proposed new organ-specific warnings for all OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic (IAAA) drug products \u2014 including acetaminophen.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Using the notice and comment procedure found in the Administrative Procedures Act, the FDA put forth a proposed rule about the warnings, allowed for public comment, and then issued a \u201cFinal Rule\u201d on April 29, 2009.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> This \u201cFinal Rule\u201d set the minimum requirements for acetaminophen labeling regarding liver damage warnings.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The 2009 Final Rule was designed \u201cto inform consumers about the risk of liver injury when using acetaminophen.\u201d <footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The 2009 Final Rule is codified at 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.326.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The 2009 Final Rule requires that all OTC products containing acetaminophen must include the following language on their label:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">Liver warning [heading in bold type]: This product contains acetaminophen. Severe liver damage may occur if you take [bullet] more than [insert maximum number of daily dosage units] in 24 hours, which is the maximum daily amount [bullet] with other drugs containing acetaminophen [bullet] 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day while using this product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">Do not use with any other drug containing acetaminophen (prescription or nonprescription). If you are not sure whether a drug contains acetaminophen, ask a doctor or pharmacist.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATi\">The rule requires that the liver warning be the first warning under the \u201cWarnings\u201d heading for the label.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">During the notice and comment period for the 2009 Final Rule, the FDA considered whether to add a warning about the adverse effects acetaminophen may have on persons who are fasting or malnourished. The FDA declined to adopt a \u201cfasting\u201d warning because it did not find sufficient evidence was presented to support such a requirement.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The new liver warnings were required to be on all products by April 29, 2010. 74 Fed. Reg. 19385 (Apr. 29, 2009). Following the implementation of the 2009 Final Rule, McNeil changed the Extra Strength Tylenol label to include the following warnings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">Liver warning: This product contains acetaminophen. Severe liver damage may occur if you take more than 8 caplets in 24 hours... with other drugs containing acetaminophen, [or] 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day while using this product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">Do not use with any other drug containing acetaminophen (prescription or nonprescription) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">Overdose warning: Taking more than the recommended dose (overdose) may cause liver damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">Do not take more than directed (see overdose warning).<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">The previous label included the following warnings: \u201cAcetaminophen may cause liver damage,\u201d \u201cDo not use with any other product containing acetaminophen,\u201d \u201cOverdose warning: taking more than the recommended dose (overdose) may cause liver damage,\u201d and \u201cdo not take more than directed (see overdose warning).\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>II. OVERVIEW OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">a. FACTS REGARDING DENICE HAYES\u2019S DEATH</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Plaintiff Rana Terry brings this wrongful death and products liability action on behalf of her deceased sister\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Her sister Denice Hayes died on August 31, 2010.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Denice was a single woman living with another sister Rebecca Hayes; the two had lived together for most of her life, up until the time of Denice\u2019s death.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Denice was not working at the time of her death due to health problems.

Rebecca was unaware of the difference between Extra Strength Tylenol\u2019s dosage and that of Regular Strength Tylenol.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> However, she purchased Tylenol over its generic version because she and her sister thought Tylenol was a better, safer product.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The two sisters often watched television together and viewed ads for Tylenol.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> According to Rebecca, Denice believed Tylenol was easier on the stomach based on advertising about the product.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">In August 2009, Denice underwent gastric bypass surgery to rectify her ongoing health problems.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> After the surgery, she lost 180 pounds; she was able to stop taking her medications for high blood pressure and diabetes.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> She used painkillers less than before because her back and leg pain had lessened.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> In June 2010, she then had a fall which exacerbated her back pain.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>In mid-August 2010, Denice underwent lumbar laminectomy surgery.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> She was instructed by her doctor to take Regular Strength Tylenol in conjunction with Lor-cet, a prescription drug containing acetaminophen, and was not to exceed four grams of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> Denice took Extra Strength Tylenol from August 12, 2010 to August 29, 2010 at \u201cappropriate times and in appropriate amounts.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> She allegedly took tablets from a medium-sized bottle Rebecca had purchased the previous \u2022 August to treat Denice\u2019s gastric bypass surgery pain.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> That bottle was shared by the two sisters during that year.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Denice allegedly used that bottle until it ran out.

The plaintiff claims the defendants are liable for Den-ice\u2019s death because they failed to warn consumers about the risk of injury and/or death Tylenol could cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The defendants move for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff cannot offer sufficient evidence at trial to support her failure-to-warn claim. The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs failure-to-warn claim is impliedly preempted.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Crv. P. 56(a). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d when \u201ca reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party\u201d based on the evidence in the record. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A factual dispute is \u201cmaterial\u201d when it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">A party seeking summary judgment initially bears responsibility for informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that \u201cit believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof on a particular issue at trial, the moving party\u2019s initial Celotex burden can be met simply by demonstrating to the district court that \u201cthere is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s case.\u201d Id. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548. After the moving party has met jits initial burden, the adverse party\u2019s response must cite \u201cparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Summary judgment is therefore appropriate when the non-moving party fails to rebut by making a factual showing that is \u201csufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court must draw \u201call justifiable inferences\u201d in favor of the non-moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. The court must decide \u201cnot whether.. .the evidence unmistakably favors one side or the other but whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented.\u201d Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505. If the non-moving party has produced more than a \u201cmere scintilla of evidence\u201d demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact, then the court may not credit the moving party\u2019s \u201cversion of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the [moving party\u2019s] evidence far outweighs that of its opponent.\u201d Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">IV. Plaintiff Has Offered Sufficient Evidence for Her Failure-To-Warn Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">I previously determined that Alabama law governs all of the plaintiffs claims. See Choice of Law Decision, May 20, 2015 (Doc. No. 41, 42).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">a. Alabama Products Liability Law (AEMLD)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Product liability cases in Alabama are governed by the Alabama Extended Manufacturer\u2019s Liability Doctrine (AEMLD). The AEMLD is a hybrid liability doctrine which follows the tenets of Restatement 402A but allows defendants to pursue traditional tort defenses like assumption of the risk, lack of causation, or contributory negligence. See Casrell v. Altec Indus., Inc., 335 So.2d 128, 131-34 (Ala.1976); Atkins v. Am. Motors Corp., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>335 So.2d 134, 137-43 (Ala.1976).<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> The AEMLD may be applied to wrongful death cases. Casrell, 335 So.2d at 134; Atkins, 335 So.2d at 144. To establish liability under the AEMLD, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am71\">(1) he suffered injury or damages to himself or his property by one who sells a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the plaintiff as the ultimate user or consumer, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">(2) Showing these elements, the plaintiff has proved a prima facie case although</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from, or entered into any contractual relation with, the seller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Casrell, 335 So.2d at 132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">\u201cUnder the AEMLD, a manufacturer has the duty to design and manufacture a product that is reasonably safe for its intended purpose and use.\u201d Townsend v. Gen. Motors Corp., 642 So.2d 411, 415 (Ala.1994). This does not mean that the manufacturer is expected to insure against all harm or \u201cto produce an accident-proof or injury-proof product.\u201d Id. \u201cProof of an accident and injury is not in itself sufficient to establish liability under the AEMLD; a defect in the product must be affirmatively shown.\u201d Id. (citing Casrell, 335 So.2d 128; Atkins, 335 So.2d 134). See also Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Haven Hills Farm, Inc., 395 So.2d 991, 994-95 (Ala.1981); Thompson v. Lee, 439 So.2d 113, 115 (Ala.1983); Brooks v. Colonial Chevrolet-Buick, Inc., 579 So.2d 1328, 1332 (Ala.1991); Verchot v. Gen. Motors Corp., 812 So.2d 296, 301 (Ala.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">Under the AEMLD, \u201cthe important factor is whether [the product] is safe or dangerous when the product is used as it was intended to be used. However, danger may be obviated by adequate warning.\u201d Yarbrough v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 628 So.2d 478, 481 (Ala.1993)(quoting Casrell, 335 So.2d at 133 (Ala.1976); Atkins, 335 So.2d 134 (quotation marks omitted)). When a drug manufacturer \u201chas reason to anticipate that danger may result from a particular use, as where a drug is sold which is safe only in limited doses, [the manufacturer] may be required to give adequate warning of the danger... and a product sold without such warning is in a defective condition.\u201d Atkins, 335 So.2d at 147 (quoting Restatement 402A Comment as an appendix to its decision to adopt AEMLD); see id. at 143, n. 5 (\u201cAlthough our holding modifies the Restatement\u2019s theory of strict liability, the Comment, in large measure, retains its utility; therefore, we attach the official Comment to s 402A as an appendix hereto.\u201d). \u201c[A] seller is not required to warn with respect to products, or ingredients in them, which are only dangerous, or potentially so, when consumed in excessive quantity, or over a long period of time, when the danger, or potentiality of danger, is generally known and recognized.\u201d Id. at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">b. The Elements of a Failure-to-Warn Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">To establish liability under the AEMLD, the plaintiff must show that her sister was injured by the defendants\u2019 product sold to hei \u201cin a defective condition unreasonably dangerous...as the ultimate user or consumer.\u201d Casrell, 335 So.2d at 132-33. \u201cShowing these elements, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>plaintiff has proved a prima facie case although [the defendants have] exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of [their] product, and [the decedent had] not bought the product from, or entered into any contractual relation with, the seller.\u201d Id. Under the AEMLD, \u201c[a] manufacturer is under a duty to warn users of the dangerous propensities of a product only when such products are dangerous when put to their intended use.\u201d Gurley By and Through Gurley v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., <em>505 </em>So.2d 358, 361 (Ala.1987). Specifically, the plaintiff must show that the warning provided was defective or inadequate in order to establish this breach of duty. See Deere &amp; Co. v. Grose, 586 So.2d 196, 198 (Ala.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">i. Adequacy of Warning</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The defendants argue that the plaintiff has not offered sufficient evidence to show that a different, more adequate warning would have prevented the decedent\u2019s death. To be adequate, a warning \u201cneed not be the best possible warning\u201d nor \u201cwarn of every potential danger.\u201d Gurley, 505 So.2d at 361. But, the manufacturer does have a duty to warn of potential hazards of foreseeable misuse if the dangers of misuse are ones of which the general public is unaware. See Yarbrough, 628 So.2d at 481; Gurley, 505 So.2d at 361 (\u201cThe objective of placing a duty to warn on the manufacturer of a product is to acquaint the user with a danger of which he is not aware, and there is no duty to warn when the danger is obvious.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">The plaintiff offers evidence that the label was inadequate.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> The plaintiff offers several reasons why a jury could find the label was inadequate. First, the plaintiff points out that the Extra Strength Tylenol label, at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, recommended that consumers take two tablets every 4 to 6 hours. The TFM offered dosing instructions of two tablets every 6 hours. Under the defendants\u2019 dosing instructions, a consumer could potentially take more acetaminophen over a 24-hour period than was recommended by the TFM. The TFM is not a final rule; therefore, the defendants\u2019 dosing instruction would not be <em>per se </em>negligent. However, the defendants\u2019 decision to instruct consumers to take more acetaminophen than recommended by the TFM, without also warning of the potential risk of taking too much, could lead a reasonable jury to find that Extra Strength Tylenol\u2019s label was inadequate.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">Second, the plaintiff argues that the Extra Strength Tylenol label was deficient because it did not disclose the risk of severe liver damage or death from taking Extra Strength Tylenol at or just above the recommended dose.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> The plaintiff has offered evidence from her own experts that Tylenol may be unsafe at recommended dosage levels.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> She also has of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>fered testimony from the defendant\u2019s own experts that they recommend their patients take below the recommended daily dose of Tylenol and emphasize to patients to take no more than the maximum daily dose, though Tylenol is advertised as \u201csafe and effective.\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Lastly, the plaintiff argues that the label did not warn consumers about the risk of liver damage to those who were fasting or malnourished. To support this argument, the plaintiff offers scientific evidence, as far back as the 1990s, to suggest that fasting may put a consumer of Tylenol more at risk of hepatotoxicity.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> The 2009 Final Rule itself also indicated that those who are fasting or malnourished may have lower glutathione stores, putting them at possible risk of liver damage. See 2009 Final Rule, 74 Fed. Reg. 19385, 19397 (Apr. 29, 2009)(\u201cMalnourished individuals have been shown to have reduced gluta-thione levels (Refs. 37, 38, and 39). Therefore, it is possible that low glutathione levels may increase the risk for liver injury because there would be less available to bind to NAQPI. Low glutathione levels may [be] a surrogate for identifying a population at increased risk of liver injury with acetaminophen, but it was unclear how much of the deficiency is necessary.\u201d). Drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that the defendants did not adequately warn of this risk as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Even if Denice did take more than the recommended dose, this error would not necessarily defeat the plaintiffs claim. \u201c[P]roof that a product was used as intended is not an element of a prima facie case under the AEMLD.\u201d Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Harris, 630 So.2d 1018, 1028 (Ala.1993). Instead, \u201ca user\u2019s misuse of an allegedly defective product is an affirmative defense to liability under the AEMLD, which the defendant must plead and prove.\u201d Id. (citing Kelly v. M. Trigg Enters., Inc., 605 So.2d 1185, 1192 (Ala.1992)). \u201cWhere a warning has been provided, a question arises as to whether the warning was adequate, and adequacy of the warning is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d Brasher v. Sandoz Pharm. Corp., Nos. CV-98-TMP-2648-S, CV-98-TMP-2650S, 2001 WL 36403362, at *13 (N.D.Ala. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Sept. 21, 2001)(citing Toole v. McClintock, 999 F.2d 1430, 1433 (11th Cir.1993)).<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The plaintiff offers evidence that even if Denice took more than the recommended dose, this error was foreseeable. There is evidence that the defendants were well aware that consumers often unintentionally took too much Tylenol, leading to liver damage. See, e.g, Summary of Studies Examining Consumer Use of Acetaminophen at 2 (PI. Ex. 34)(offering evidence from 2000s, including survey conducted by McNeil itself, that upwards of half of acetaminophen users misuse or take more than the recommended dose). This was a topic of concern in the medical community for several years before Denice died. In addition, the plaintiff argues that the information presented by the defendants about the risks of Tylenol \u2014 both on the label and in advertisements \u2014 would lead a reasonable consumer to be unaware that acute liver failure or death was a possible result of taking too much Tylenol over a short period of time.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> From what has been provided, a reasonable jury could find that the Tylenol label did not adequately warn consumers of the risk of taking Tylenol at or just above the recommended dose.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The plaintiff also offers evidence that an adequate label would have prevented Denice\u2019s death. The plaintiffs cause of death is listed as acetaminophen-induced liver failure.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> She was treated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the hospital before she died for this condition. The plaintiff offers an expert report from Timothy Davern, II, M.D. who has studied ALF for many years. See Expert Report of T. Davern M.D. (PI. Ex. 20). Dr. Davern points to parts of Denice\u2019s medical record which show she was not experiencing liver or renal problems prior to June 2010. See Expert Report of T. Davern M.D. (PI. Ex. 20)(discussing how Ms. Hayes\u2019 liver was \u201cnormal in size\u201d at the time of her gastric bypass surgery in August 2009 and how a colonoscopy in June 2010 produced benign results). After reviewing her medical history, he concluded that Deniee\u2019s ALF \u201cwas caused by acetaminophen poisoning related to Tylenol ingestion for therapeutic purposes.\u201d Expert Report of T. Davern M.D. (PI. Ex. 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In addition, Rebecca testified she would not have purchased Extra Strength Tylenol if she were aware of the risks of liver failure and death.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> The plaintiff offers evidence that Denice, who was not a risk taker, stopped taking Lorcet because she was concerned about its side effects.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark>\u2019 Drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that the defendants breached their duty to warn of known risks of Extra Strength Tylenol, making the label inadequate. Furthermore, a jury could find that an adequate label would have prevented Denice\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">ii. Proof for Causation: Read and Heeded</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">To prove causation, the plaintiff will also have to show at trial that Denice would have read and heeded an adequate warning and that an adequate warning would have prevented the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> See Yarbrough v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 628 So.2d 478, 482 (Ala.1993)(\u201cA negligent-failure-to-adequately warn case cannot be submitted to a jury unless there is some evidence that the allegedly inadequate warning would have been read and heeded and would have kept the accident from occurring.\u201d (quoting Gurley v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 505 So.2d 358, 361 (Ala.1987)); Deere &amp; Co. v. Grose, 586 So.2d 196, 198 (Ala.1991)(same); Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Harris, 630 So.2d 1018, 1030 (Ala.1993).

Sept. 21, 2001)(\u201cUnder Alabama law, to prevail in a warnings claim, the plaintiffs also must demonstrate a causal link between the allegedly inadequate warning and the injury. In cases such as these, that means that the plaintiffs must demonstrate that, had the defendant given an adequate warning, it would have been read and heeded by the prescribing physicians.\u201d); Garrison v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 30 F.Supp.3d 1325, 1335-1337 (M.D.Ala. 2014); Barnhill v. Teva Pharms.

In response, the plaintiff has offered evidence that Denice followed warnings on labels. Her sisters testified in their depositions that Denice would read labels, not take medication which would harm her, and would follow doctor\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> There is evidence in her medical record that Denice was generally compliant with her doctor\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> Doctor\u2019s notes indicate Denice told her doctor she had taken her last dose of Tylenol the night before she was admitted to the hospital on August 29, 2010.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> There is also no evidence to show that Denice was intentionally trying to commit suicide or overdose to harm herself.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The defendants argue that there is no evidence that anyone actually saw Denice take the recommended dose of Tylenol or that she actually read and heeded the warnings on the label.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> Denice was being cared for by several family members so no one person can verify the dosage she took.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> However, the plaintiff plans to offer testimony by the decedent\u2019s sisters and doctors that she was compliant with her doctor\u2019s medical directions.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Denice\u2019s sister Rebecca lived with her for most of her life; she can speak to her sister\u2019s habits. This information is admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 406. Whether this information about habit is credible is for a jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that Denice would have read and heeded adequate warnings. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that the Extra Strength Tylenol label did not adequately warn of acute liver failure and possible death. It is for a jury to decide if the Tylenol label adequately advised users of known risks of Tylenol.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">V. Genuine Disputes of Material Fact Exist</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">The parties agree on all material facts except two. These two disputes are genuine and require this case to proceed before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">a. Regarding the Label</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">First, the parties dispute which label was on the bottle of Extra Strength <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Tylenol used by Denice before she died. The plaintiff contends the bottle was purchased in August 2009. The defendants claim the bottle was purchased in August 2010.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> This dispute is material because the label on Extra Strength Tylenol changed in early 2010. The new label added one word but that word is important. While the old label warned that an overdose of Extra Strength Tylenol could cause liver damage, the new label warned that an overdose could cause \u201csevere\u201d liver damage. If Denice relied on the warnings in the 2009 label, a reasonable jury could find that the lack of the warning of \u201csevere\u201d liver damage could have made that label inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">While cleaning out Denice\u2019s belongings after her death, Denice\u2019s sisters discarded both the bottle of Extra Strength Tylenol and the bottle of Lorcet.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> According to Rebecca, she had purchased a medium-sized bottle of about 100 to 120 caplets of Extra Strength Tylenol in August 2009.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> That bottle was shared by the two sisters during the following year.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> Denice allegedly used that bottle in August 2010 until it ran out. Rebecca purchased another bottle of Extra Strength Tylenol for her sister on August 28, 2010.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> Denice may have taken doses from this bottle before going to bed. She then was taken to the hospital the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Which warning Denice viewed is a question for the jury to answer. A jury will need to make credibility determinations about the family members\u2019 rendering of Denice\u2019s final days to answer this question. For this reason, this dispute is genuine and must be decided by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">b. Regarding the Cause of Death</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">The parties also dispute Denice\u2019s cause of death. The plaintiff, relying on Denice\u2019s medical records from doctors treating her before her death and on expert opinions, cite acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure as the cause of death.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> The defendants, relying on experts who reviewed Denice\u2019s medical records, claim that Den-ice died from multi-system organ failure likely caused by sepsis. What caused the decedent\u2019s death is a genuine dispute of material fact. This alone defeats summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">VI. The Plaintiffs Claims are Not Impliedly Preempted</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs claims are preempted \u201cunder implied conflict principles.\u201d<footnotemark>150</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>a. Implied Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Preemption is a concept based on the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution that provides a conflicting state law will be trumped by its federal counterpart. See Mut. Pharm. Co. v. Bartlett, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2466, 2472-73, 186 L.Ed.2d 607 (2013)(citing U.S. Const., Art. 'VI, cl. 2). Even if a federal statute does not expressly preempt a state law, the state law may be impliedly preempted where it is \u201cimpossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\u201d Id. at 2473 (quoting English v. Gen. Elec. Co., 496 U.S. 72, 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65 (1990)(quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> There is a general presumption against preemption. See, e.g., Deweese v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. (Amtrak), 590 F.3d 239, 246 (3d Cir.2009)(citing Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">\u201cImpossibility pre-emption is a demanding defense.\u201d Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 573, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009). The Third Circuit has cautioned against \u201clightly inferring]\u201d preemption where \u201cstate compensatory regimes have traditionally played an important role.\u201d Fellner v. Tri-Union Seafoods, L.L.C., 539 F.3d 237, 249 (3d Cir.2008). Whenever possible, preemption analysis should attempt to reconcile the state law and federal law with one another. See Deweese, 590 F.3d at 248. \u201c[S]tate tort law and other similar state remedial actions are often deemed complementary to federal regulatory regimes\u201d and fall \u201csquarely within the realm of traditional state regulation.\u201d Fellner, 539 F.3d at 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">b. The 2009 Final Rule and Wyeth v. Levine</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">The defendants argue that they were preempted from adding a \u201cfasting\u201d or \u201cmalnourishment\u201d warning because the 2009 Final Rule did not include such a warning. McNeil argues that it \u201ccannot unilaterally supplement or change its label with language inconsistent with the 2009 Final Rule.\u201d Defendants\u2019 Statement of Material Facts, Doc. No. 49-31 at \u00b6 43. See also Jones Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 58-59. This argument assumes that Ms. Hayes read the 2010 label \u2014 which included the 2009 Final Rule warnings \u2014 and not the 2009 pre-Fi-nal Rule label. Which label Ms. Hayes viewed is a question for the jury to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Even assuming that Ms. Hayes viewed the post-Final Rule label warnings, the defendants\u2019 preemption argument fails. The Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009). Wyeth argued that it could not comply with both state and federal law because the FDA\u2019s approval process required it to use the exact text on a proposed drug label. Id. at 567, 129 S.Ct. 1187. The Supreme Court explained that reliance on this approved text was not enough for Wyeth to escape liability for a deficient label. Id. \u201c[I]t has remained a central premise of federal drug regulation that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.\u201d Id. at 570-71, 129 S.Ct. 1187. Brand-name drug manufacturers are \u201ccharged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.\u201d Id. at 571, 129 S.Ct. 1187 (citing 21 CFR \u00a7 201.80(e), \u00a7 314.80(b); 73 Fed. Reg. 49605).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Specifically, the Supreme Court found that FDA regulations offer drug manufacturers a process by which to change their drug labels without using the formal administrative rulemaking process. Id. at 566, 129 S.Ct. 1187. \u201c[T]his \u2018changes being effected\u2019 (CBE) regulation provides that if a manufacturer is changing a label to \u2018add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction\u2019 or to \u2018add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\u2019 it may make the labeling change upon filing its supplemental application with the FDA; it need not wait for FDA approval. \u00a7\u00a7 314.70(c)(6)(iii) (A), (C).\u201d Id. at 568, 129 S.Ct. 1187. \u201c[A]bsent clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to .[the drug\u2019s] label, we will not conclude that it was impossible for Wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements.\u201d Id. at 571, 129 S.Ct. 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The Supreme Court opined in dicta that a failure-to-warn claim may be preempted if a drug manufacturer submitted a CBE change and the FDA rejected it. Id. at 571, 129 S.Ct. 1187. The defendants focus on this language, claiming that the FDA\u2019s exclusion of a \u201cfasting\u201d or \u201cmalnourishment\u201d warning in the 2009 Final Rule indicates a rejection of such a warning and is analogous to the Court\u2019s hypothetical. I do not interpret the FDA\u2019s actions as the defendants do.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">The 2009 Final Rule explained that the FDA only received three submissions regarding the fasting warning. See 74 Fed. Reg. 19397 (Apr. 29, 2009). The FDA could not \u201cmake a conclusion about the risk of liver injury due to acetaminophen in malnourished individuals.\u201d IcL The 2009 Rule did not require a fasting warning but stated the FDA would reconsider that position if new data became available. Id.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>decline to add a warning because public comments did not offer sufficient scientific evidence is a vastly different proposition than the FDA rejecting a warning because it is scientifically inaccurate, flawed, or confusing.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> The FDA\u2019s decision is far from \u201cclear evidence\u201d in itself that the FDA would not approve a label change if McNeil offered evidence that it was warranted.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> See Wolfe v. McNeil, 773 F.Supp.2d 561, 568-69 (E.D.Pa.2011)(finding that FDA\u2019s decision not to adopt a citizen\u2019s request for a warning was not clear evidence of preemption because the FDA indicated stronger warnings were needed but disapproved of the proposed language), <em>compared with, </em>Robinson v. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, 615 F.3d 861, 873 (7th Cir.2010)(finding clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a label change because the \u201cFDA decided not to require such a warning because it would confuse rather than inform\u201d); Dobbs v. Wyeth Pharms., 797 F.Supp.2d 1264, 1276-80 (W.D.Okla.2011)(finding implied preemption when the FDA had repeatedly rejected a proposed label alteration submitted by the drug manufacturer).<footnotemark>155</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Auf-\">c. No Clear Evidence That McNeil Was Prevented from Changing the Label</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">Furthermore McNeil\u2019s own actions show that it was not impossible for McNeil to change the Extra Strength label.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> As Wyeth made clear, the onus has always been on McNeil to ensure its label <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>accurately reflects the risks of Extra Strength Tylenol.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> If McNeil had knowledge and notice that a \u201cfasting\u201d or \u201cmalnourishment\u201d warning was needed to supplement or strengthen Extra Strength Tylenol\u2019s existing warnings, it could have made a CBE application.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> See Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 573, 129 S.Ct. 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Nonetheless, the defendants argue that they could not have voluntarily changed the label on Extra Strength Tylenol because the CBE procedure is only available for drugs regulated by the NDA process. This argument is logical given that Extra Strength Tylenol was only governed by the monograph process, not the NDA process, at the time of the decedent\u2019s injury and death. The CBE procedure is affiliated with the NDA process, not the monograph process. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.70 (\u201cSupplements and other changes to an approved application\u201d); Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 578-79 (explaining the CBE process).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">A close look at the history of Extra Strength Tylenol\u2019s label changes contradicts McNeil\u2019s argument. In 1994, McNeil petitioned the FDA to add an alcohol warning and a concomitant use warning (i.e., \u201cDo not use with other products containing acetaminophen\u201d) to the Extra Strength Tylenol label; it used the CBE process in accordance with 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.70 for NDA 17-552.<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> In its request for this label revision, McNeil indicated that the label change would be incorporated in the labeling \u201cfor all of [its] acetaminophen containing products for adults distributed under the OTC drug monographs.\u201d<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">In 1998, McNeil withdrew the NDA for Extra Strength Tylenol (NDA 17-552). When it made this withdrawal, McNeil indicated that it would \u201ccontinue to submit acetaminophen Adverse Drug Experience reports under NDA 19-872.\u201d<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> NDA 19-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>872 is the application for Tylenol Extended Relief Caplets.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">In 2001, after petitioning the FDA, McNeil added a warning stating: \u201c[tjaking more than the recommended dose (overdose) could cause serious health problems.\u201d <footnotemark>163</footnotemark> This CBE petition was made under NDA 19-872 for Tylenol Extended Relief formula. McNeil indicated it would include the new warning on Tylenol Arthritis Pain Extended Relief \u201cas well as other Tylenol acetaminophen products that are distributed under the OTC drug monographs.\u201d<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> It reiterated this point again in its petition saying: \u201cThese sam\u00e9 changes will be made to all other Tylenol products distributed under the OTC monographs.\u201d<footnotemark>165</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">In 2002, at an advisory committee meeting with the FDA discussing acetaminophen labeling and safety, McNeil sought to further strengthen its Tylenol labels by replacing \u201cserious health problems\u201d language with specific language warning of overdose and liver damage.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> The FDA approved that change in 2003.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> In 2004, McNeil introduced the stronger warning regarding overdose/organ-specific liver damage' on all Tylenol products.<footnotemark>168</footnotemark> Despite the defendants\u2019 insistence that changing the Extra Strength Tylenol label would be impossible, they already have done it.<footnotemark>169</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Furthermore, Extra Strength Tylenol was and still is regulated by the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) which is only a proposed rule. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 310, 343, 369 at 42604 (TFM)(P1. Ex. 48); FDA letter to McNeil, 11/17/11 (PI. Ex. 4). As explained by the FDA itself: \u201cUnder a TFM, manufacturers market products at their own risk and are able to make voluntary adjustments taking into context the information presented in the proposed TFM.\u201d<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> See FDA letter to McNeil, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>11/17/11 (PI. Ex. 4).<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> If the defendants became aware of information that fasting and malnourishment posed a serious health risk to Tylenol consumers, the onus was on them to seek a label revision.<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> McNeil\u2019s own former Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Anthony Temple, M.D. admitted as much during his deposition.<footnotemark>173</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">There is no clear evidence that the defendants could not comply with both state law tort principles and FDA regulations.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claims are not impliedly preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">VII.

The agency declined at that time to include an alcohol warning because the proposed evidence was \"conflicting and insufficient.\u201d 53 C.F.R. 46218 (Nov. 16, 1988). Nonetheless, the defendants were later held liable for not including such a warning. See, e.g., Benedi v. McNeil-P.P.C., Inc., 66 F.3d 1378, 1382 (4th Cir.1995)(\"Benedi filed suit against McNeil in March 1994, and the case went to the jury on theories of breach of implied warranty and negligent failure to warn. After a three-day trial, the jury awarded Benedi $7,850,000 in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages.\u201d). McNeil also voluntarily added an alcohol warning, despite the FDA\u2019s previous decision to not require one. See McNeil CBE Letter to FDA, Jun. 16, 1994 (PL Ex.

While this evidence would typically be excluded under the Federal Rules of Evidence as a subsequent remedial measure, this information can be used to rebut the defendants' defense of impossibility. See Fed. R. Evid. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"ACFI\">McNeil also volunteered to change its label during the 2009 FDA Advisory Committee meeting, agreeing to implement \"dose titration\u201d instructions. See McNeil's Presentation to Joint Meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee, Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee, Jun. 29-20, 2009, Powerpoint (PL Ex. 22); Statement of Edward Kuffner, M.D., McNeil\u2019s Vice President of OTC Medical Affairs and Clinical Research, at the 2009 Advisory Committee Meeting (Pl. Ex. 50)(\"McNeil is recommending changing the current dosing directions on both the 325-milligram and 500-milligram formulations, seen here on your left, from take two tablets every four to six hours while symptoms last, to the proposed directions shown on the right, take one tablet, and if pain or fever does not respond to one tablet, two tablets may be needed. This dose titration model is identical to the directions on the current over-the-counter ibuprofen label. This significant change will encourage patients to use the lowest effective dose and should, therefore, decrease overall acetaminophen exposure within the general population.\u201d). From the evidence provided, the FDA approved this change. See Correspondence from FDA to McNeil President, June 10, 2010 (Plaintiff\u2019s Ex. 51). Though these instructions were never implemented, McNeil has put forth no evidence that the FDA was the obstacle to making this change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"170\">\n<p id=\"b769-5\">. The defendants argue that Extra Strength Tylenol has been classified as \"generally recognized as safe and effective\" (GRASE) because it was assigned to Category I under the proposed rule. The defendants imply I should give this categorization some weight. During the initial step of the monograph process, the available OTC drug ingredients were recommended by the panel of experts to be a Category I: GRASE, Category II: not GRASE, or Category III: unclear if GRASE or not. See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ CentersOffices/CDER/ucml 18349.pdf; http:// www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApproval Process/HowDrugsareDevelopedand Approved/ucm317137.htm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">This categorization appears to be nothing more than that \u2014 a way to organize the available drug ingredients. Those ingredients found to not be GRASE were not permitted to continue through the monograph process. See 58 Fed. Reg. 27636 (\"Status of Certain Additional Over-the-Counter Drug Category II and III Active Ingredients\u201d)(May 10, 1993)(\"As mentioned, no substantive comments or new data were submitted to support reclassification of any of these active ingredients to monograph status. Therefore, before a final rule on each respective drug category is published, the Commissioner has determined that these ingredients are not generally recognized as safe and effective and that any OTC drug product containing any of these active ingredients not be allowed to continue to be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The TFM is a proposed rule, not a final regulation. See TFM 21 C.F.R. 343 at 35346 (\"Based upon the conclusions and recommendations of the Panel, the Commissioner <em>proposes, upon publication of the final regulation...\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); 53 C.F.R. 46204 (\"In order to conform to terminology used in the OTC drug review regulations (21 CFR 330.10), the present document is designated as a \"tentative final monograph.\u201d Its legal status, however, is that of a proposed rule.\u201d). The inclusion of the categorization of acetaminophen as GRASE in the TFM would not be binding until a Final Monograph/Rule was promulgated. See FDA/CDER, Guidance for FDA Staff and Industry, Marketed Unapproved Drugs \u2014 Compliance Policy Guide, Sec. 440.100 Marketed New Drugs Without Approved NDAs or ANDAs, Sep. 19, 2011, at 13 (\"Drugs marketed in accordance with a final monograph are considered to be generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/ GRAE) and do not require FDA approval of a marketing application.\u201d)(Doc. 49-20)(Ex. C attached to J. Jones Report, Def. Ex. S).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">I do not read this categorical assignment as any sort of approval of Extra Strength Tylenol's safety and efficacy in every situation by the FDA. The regulations which outline the monograph process are titled \"Procedures for classifying OTC drugs as generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded, and for establishing monographs.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.10. The monograph process itself is intended to determine under what conditions OTC drugs are GRASE. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.10(a)(8). (\"rrjhe Commissioner shall publish in the Federal Register a final order containing a monograph establishing conditions under which a category of OTC drugs or a specific or specific OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and not mis-branded.\u201d). See also Gerald Dal Pan, M.D., Director of Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, CDER/FDA, Powerpoint, Jun. 29, 2009 at 19 (PL Ex. 21)(OTC Monograph ...

Under what conditions' the usage of acetaminophen would be GRASE remain open because a final monograph/rule was never issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Even if the TFM gave some implicit approval of acetaminophen as GRASE, Extra Strength Tylenol could not be considered GRASE because the defendants were marketing it with dosing instructions that did not conform to the TFM. Under either scenario, this categorization does little to change the legal analysis of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"171\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\">.
