The decedent\u2019s sister asserted a wrongful death claim against Johnson &amp; Johnson and McNeil \u2014 the makers of Tylenol \u2014 on behalf of her estate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the Alabama wrongful death statute is unconstitutional under BMW of N. Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996), and its progeny. They have moved for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, I will deny their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">I. The Alabama Wrongful Death Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In Alabama, a wrongful death action is statutory and does not exist at common law. See, e.g., Downtown Nursing Home, Inc. v. Pool, 375 So.2d 465, 466 (Ala.1979). The Alabama wrongful death statute, Ala. Code. \u00a7 6-5-410(a)(1975), is like no other in the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIn Alabama, only punitive damages are available in wrongful death actions, and these damages may be awarded against a defendant based on its negligent conduct.\u201d Alabama Power Co. v. Turner, 575 So.2d 551, 556 (Ala.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 953, 111 S.Ct. 2260, 114 L.Ed.2d 713 (1991).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute does not allow for compensatory damages or consideration of the decedent\u2019s losses. See, e.g, Roe v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 613 F.3d 1058, 1065 (11th Cir.2010); Ajla. Pattern Jury Inst. 11.28. The focus of a wrongful death claim under Alabama law is on the defendants\u2019 conduct. See, e.g., Atkins v. Lee, 603 So.2d 937, 943 (Ala.1992)(quoting Ala. Pattern Jury Inst. 11.28).The Alabama legislature and courts have made clear: the statute is intended to protect lives by imposing damages on tort-feasors causing death. See, e.g., Hatas v. Partin, 278 Ala. 65, 175 So.2d 759, 761 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>(Ala.1965).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By making a wrongful death \u201cexpensive,\u201d Alabama seeks to deter similar tortious conduct. See Louis Pizitz Dry Goods Co. v. Yeldell, 274 U.S. 112, 116, 47 S.Ct. 509, 71 L.Ed. 952 (1927)(explaining that the Alabama statute was an \u201cattempt to preserve human life by making homicide expensive\u201d); Tillis Trucking Co., Inc. v. Moses, 748 So.2d 874, 889 (Ala.1999)(ex-plaining that the goal of the statute is \u201cpreservation of life because of the enormity of the wrong, the uniqueness of the injury, and the finality of death\u201d)(citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"> \u201cIn calculating a damage award, an Alabama Wrongful Death Act jury is instructed to consider: (1) the finality of death, (2) the propriety of punishing the defendant, (3) whether the defendant could have prevented the victim\u2019s death, (4) how difficult it would have been for the defendant to have prevented the death, and (5) the public\u2019s interest in deterring others from engaging in conduct like the defendant\u2019s.\u201d Roe v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 613 F.3d 1058, 1065 (11th Cir.2010)(citing Tillis Trucking, 748 So.2d at 889). \u201cBecause the policy of [Alabama] is to regard human life as being beyond measure in terms of dollars, the jury must disregard the decedent\u2019s wealth or lack of wealth, it must disregard the decedent\u2019s potential for accumulating great wealth or lack of potential to accumulate wealth; and it must disregard his or her talents and education, or lack of them, as well as his or her station in life.\u201d Campbell v. Williams, 638 So.2d 804, 811 (Ala.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The statute and its punitive scheme date back to the late 1800s.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Louis Pizitz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Dry Goods Co., Inc. v. Yeldell, 274 U.S. 112, 114, 47 S.Ct. 509, 71 L.Ed. 952 (1927)(\u201cThe legislation now challenged has been on the statute books of Alabama in essentially its present form since 1872.\u201d); Savannah &amp; M.R. Co. v. Shearer, 58 Ala. 672, 680 (1877). The United States Supreme Court first considered its constitutionality in 1927. In Louis Pizitz Dry Goods Co., Inc. v. Yeldell, the defendant challenged the statute\u2019s constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment, claiming it was \u201cunreasonably oppressive, arbitrary, unjust, violative of the fundamental conceptions of fair play....\u201d 274 U.S. 112, 114, 47 S.Ct. 509, 71 L.Ed. 952 (1927)(quo-tation marks omitted). The main issue was whether an employer could be vicariously liable under the statute. Id. at 113-14, 47 S.Ct. 509. The Court recognized the statute\u2019s unique character: \u201cThis statute authorizes the recovery of damages from either a principal or an agent, in such amount as the jury may assess, for wrongful act or negligence causing death...the damages, which may be punitive even though the act complained of involved no element of recklessness, malice, or willfulness, may be assessed against the employer who, as here, is personally without fault.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Nonetheless, the Court found that imposing \u201cpunitive\u201d damages for mere negligence was not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">As interpreted by the state court, the aim of the present statute is to strike at the evil of the negligent destruction of human life by imposing liability, regardless of fault, upon those who are in some substantial measure in a position to prevent it. We cannot say that it is beyond the power of a Legislature...to attempt to preserve human life by making homicide expensive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Id. at 116, 47 S.Ct. 509. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he distinction between punitive and compensatory damages [was] a modern refinement.\u201d Id. at 116, 47 S.Ct. 509.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court ultimately upheld the statute to be constitutional, despite its unique nature. Id. at 116, 47 S.Ct. 509. The Supreme Court has not revisited Louis Pizitz since. It remains good law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The Alabama statute has remained virtually unchanged.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Alabama Legislature has declined to alter its unique character, even during tort reform efforts in the late 1980s and 1990s.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Alabama Supreme Court has continually upheld the statute as constitutional.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">II. Appellate Review of Punitive Damages in Alabama</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Like other punitive damage awards in Alabama, jury verdicts in wrongful death cases are subject to a post-verdict review. See, e.g., Lemond Const. Co. v. Wheeler, 669 So.2d 855, 857, 862-63 (Ala.1995). Alabama juries are given considerable discretion in fashioning punitive damage awards. See, e.g., Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539 So.2d 218, 222 (Ala.1989).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Trial judges, however, are required to review punitive damage awards to determine if they are \u201cexcessive as a matter of law or [are] the result of passion, bias, corruption, or other improper motive.\u201d Lemond, 669 So.2d at 862. See also Hammond v. City of Gadsden, 493 So.2d 1374, 1378-79 (Ala.1986). Trial judges must \u201creflect in the record the reasons for interfering with a jury verdict, or refusing to do so, on grounds of excessiveness of the damages.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Hammond, 493 So.2d at 1379. The trial judge should ensure that the punitive damages award is tailored to both the wrongful act and the tortfeasor. Green Oil Co., 539 So.2d at 223. Punitive damages \u201cmust not exceed an amount that will accomplish society\u2019s goals of punishment and deterrence.\u201d Id. at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The Alabama Supreme Court has enumerated a non-exhaustive list of factors trial judges should consider during post-verdict review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">1) The reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm actually done as well as the harm that could have resulted from the defendant\u2019s conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">2) The degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct, including the duration of the conduct, the defendant\u2019s degree of awareness of its hazardousness, any concealment or the potential hazard, and the frequency of similar past conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">3) The profitability of the wrongful conduct and the punitive damages\u2019 effect on this profit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">4) The financial position of the defendant;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">5) All the costs of litigation, so as to encourage plaintiffs to bring wrongdoers to trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">6) Whether criminal sanctions have been imposed and would mitigate the award;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">7) Whether other civil damages have been awarded against the defendant for the same conduct and would mitigate the punitive damages award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">Hammond, 493 So.2d at 1379; Green Oil Co., 539 So.2d at 223-24. Appellate courts are then expected to review the jury verdict and the trial judge\u2019s decision on the appropriateness of the award. See Pac. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 20-21, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991)(\u201cBy its review of punitive awards, the Alabama Supreme Court provides an additional check on the jury\u2019s or trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">In 1991, the Supreme Court approved Alabama\u2019s scheme of post-verdict review as providing adequate due process under the Constitution. Haslip, 499 U.S. at 21-23, 111 S.Ct. 1032.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See also BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 567, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996)(\u201cThe court\u2019s excessiveness inquiry applied the factors articulated in Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539 So.2d 218, 223-224 (Ala.1989), and approved in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 21-22, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 1045-1046, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). 646 So.2d at 624-625.\u201d). The Supreme Court found that the post-verdict review by the trial and appellate courts provided a \u201cfull panoply of [ ] procedural protections.\u201d Haslip, 499 U.S. at 23, 111 S.Ct. 1032. While the Court did not talk specifically about Alabama\u2019s wrongful death statute, and that statute was not involved in the case, Haslip did cite positively to Louis Pizitz and did nothing to disturb it. Haslip, 499 U.S. at 14, 15, 17, 111 S.Ct. 1032. The defendants argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Supreme Court precedent after Haslip has rendered the wrongful death statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">III. Facial Constitutional Challenge Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">There are no pertinent facts. This motion involves a purely legal question: whether Alabama\u2019s wrongful death statute is consistent with the due process limitations on punitive damages established in post-Haslip Supreme Court decisions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendants challenge Alabama\u2019s wrongful death statute on its face, not \u201cas-applied.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cA party asserting a facial challenge \u2018must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u2019 \u201d Heffner v. Murphy, 745 F.3d 56, 65 (3d Cir.2014)(quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987)(citation and quotation marks omitted)). This is the \u201cmost difficult challenge to mount successfully.\u201d Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095. Facial challenges to legislation in the non-First Amendment context are generally disfavored. See U.S. v. Mitchell, 652 F.3d 387, 406 (3d Cir.2011)(en banc); National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 580, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (3d Cir.1998)(citations omitted); Lutz v. City of York, Pa., 899 F.2d 255, 271 (3d Cir.1990)(citing Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">IY. Supreme Court Precedent on Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The defendants argue that Alabama\u2019s wrongful death statute is unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment based on Supreme Court precedent BMW of N. Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996), and State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from imposing a \u2018grossly excessive\u2019 punishment on a tortfeasor.\u201d Gore, 517 U.S. at 562, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (citing TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 454, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993)). See also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 417, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003)(\u201cTo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of property.\u201d)(citation omitted). Gore and State Farm both discuss when a punitive damages award may be \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d and, therefore, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">a. BMW v. Gore</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">BMW v. Gore was a consumer protection case out of Alabama involving nondisclosure of an automobile paint defect. 517 U.S. 559, 568, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). At trial, the plaintiff introduced evidence that such non-disclosure was part of BMW\u2019s nationwide corporate policy. Gore, 517 U.S. at, 563-64. The jury awarded the plaintiff $4000 in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages. Id. at 565,116 S.Ct. 1589. As required by Alabama law, the trial judge reviewed the punitive damages award and found it was not excessive. Id. at 566, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">On appellate review, the Alabama Supreme Court found that award was appropriate based on the Green Oil factors. Id. at 566-67, 116 S.Ct. 1589. However, the court reduced the award to $2 million because the jury had improperly computed the damages based on the defendant\u2019s conduct in other states where non-disclosure was not <em>per se </em>illegal. Id. at 567, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari in order to provide further guidance on the issue of \u201cexcessiveness.\u201d Id. at 568, 116 S.Ct. 1589. The Court agreed with the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s determination that punitive damages awards should not \u201cimpose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors\u2019 lawful conduct in other States.\u201d Id. at 568-72, 116 S.Ct. 1589. \u201cThe award must be analyzed in the light of the same conduct, with consideration given only to the interests of Alabama consumers, rather than those of the entire Nation.\u201d Id. at 574, 116 S.Ct. 1589. The Court specifically discussed the constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s punitive damages scheme \u2014 of allowing juries great discretion in fashioning a punitive damages award and then giving courts authority to review the award under Green Oil post-verdict. Id. at 565-69, 116 S.Ct. 1589. The Court noted Haslip, as approving these factors, and did not disturb its holding. Id. at 566-86, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (discussing appropriate guideposts and citing to Haslip throughout).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Nonetheless, the Court found that the reduced award still violated due process because the defendant was not given \u201cfair notice\u201d of the severity of the penalty Alabama might impose. Id. at 574, 116 S.Ct. 1589. The Court offered three \u201cguideposts\u201d for determining when a defendant has been given adequate notice of a potential award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">1) The degree of reprehensibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">2) The disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-13\">3) The difference between the remedy and the civil penalties authorized to be imposed or which have been imposed in comparable cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">Id. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1589.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court then elaborated on each \u201cguidepost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Describing \u201creprehensibility\u201d as \u201cthe most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award,\u201d the Court explained that \u201csome wrongs are more blameworthy than others.\u201d Id. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1589. Non-violent crimes are less reprehensible than violent crimes. Id. at 576, 116 S.Ct. 1589. Intentional conduct, especially when targeting those who are vulnerable, is more blameworthy than accidental conduct. Id. \u201c[T]rickery and deceit... are more reprehensible than negligence.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). Repeated unlawful conduct would be more reprehensible than mere malfeasance. Id. at 576-77, 116 S.Ct. 1589. Finding that these \u201caggravating factors\u201d were not present, the Court held that BMW\u2019s conduct was \u201cpurely economic\u201d and \u201cevinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for the health and safety of others.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In discussing the second \u201cguidepost,\u201d the Court described \u201cthe disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award\u201d as a \u201cratio\u201d between compensatory and punitive damages. Id. at 580-82, 116 S.Ct. 1589. As suggested in Haslip, the Court reiterated the notion that a single-digit ratio may be indicative of a constitutionally appropriate award. Id. at 581, 116 S.Ct. 1589. The Court found that a ratio of 500 to 1 in Gore suggested the award was \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d Id. at 582, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Nonetheless, the Court recognized that higher ratios may still be constitutional when compensatory damages are minimal but the defendant\u2019s conduct is \u201cparticularly egregious.\u201d Id. at 582, 116 S.Ct. 1589. Higher ratios also may be justified when \u201cthe injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine.\u201d Id. Following Haslip, the Court declined to adopt a \u201cmathematical bright line.\u201d Id. at 583, 116 S.Ct. 1589. When a ratio is substantially high, it may \u201craise a suspicious judicial eyebrow\u201d but does not invalidate an award <em>per se. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Lastly, the Court explained that available sanctions for comparable misconduct \u2014 i.e., civil statutory fines and criminal penalties \u2014 should be considered. Id. at 583, 116 S.Ct. 1589. The Court found that the $2 million punitive damages award was much in excess of the maximum civil penalties permitted in Alabama ($2000) and other states ($5000 to $10,000). Id. at 584, 116 S.Ct. 1589. The Court suggested that \u201ca history of noncompliance with known statutory requirements\u201d may also affect whether an award is grossly excessive. Id. at 585,116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Ultimately, the Court reversed and remanded Gore because the punitive damages award was \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d based on its application of the \u201cguideposts.\u201d Id. at 585-86, 116 S.Ct. 1589.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">b. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">In 2003, State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, the Supreme Court revisited BMW. It offered additional guidance on Gore\u2019s \u201cguideposts.\u201d State Farm, 538 U.S. 408, 418-29, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003). The Court reiterated that the \u201creprehensibility\u201d guidepost is \u201cthe most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.\u201d Id. at 419, 123 S.Ct. 1513. The Court again explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>that \u201creprehensibility\u201d is based on the following \u201caggravating factors:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">\u2022 Whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u2022 Whether the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u2022 Whether the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u2022 Whether the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u2022 Whether the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">More specifically, the Court explained that a jury \u201cmay not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred.\u201d Id. at 422, 123 S.Ct. 1513. \u201cLawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant\u2019s action in the State where it is tor-tious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d Id. In addition, only similar conduct should have some bearing on reprehensibility. Id. at 427, 123 S.Ct. 1513.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The Court \u201cdecline[d] again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed.\u201d Id. at 425, 123 S.Ct. 1513. Though \u201c[s]ingle-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process,\u201d the Court did not limit analysis under the second guidepost to a single-digit ratio. See id. (\u201cWhile these ratios are not binding, they are instructive.\u201d). The Court restated that punitive damages awards require a case-by-case analysis. Id. \u201cThe precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.\u201d Id. Overall, the second guidepost required courts to \u201censure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.\u201d Id. at 426, 123 S.Ct. 1513.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">To the last guidepost, the Court added that \u201c[t]he existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.\u201d Id. at 428, 123 S.Ct. 1513. But courts should avoid using punitive damages to impose criminal penalties, which are subject to heightened protections and a higher burden of proof. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">Four years later, the Court added a final caveat to the Gore \u201cguideposts:\u201d punitive damages could not punish defendants for harm caused to non-parties. Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 349, 353, 127 S.Ct. 1057, 166 L.Ed.2d 940 (2007). However, similar harmful conduct towards others can be considered in determining how reprehensible the defendants\u2019 conduct was.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>c. Alabama\u2019s Interpretation of the Gore \u201cguideposts\u201d as applied to the Wrongful Death Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Though the Alabama wrongful death statute is meant to make \u201chomicide expensive,\u201d the Alabama Supreme Court has recognized that this does not equate to a jury\u2019s \u201cunbridled discretion in determining the amount of damages to impose in death cases.\u201d Cherokee Elec. Coop. v. Cochran, 706 So.2d 1188, 1194 (Ala.1997). Wrongful death verdicts must also comply with the Gore guideposts. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">The wrongful death\u2019s statute\u2019s constitutionality has been upheld by the Alabama Supreme Court on several occasions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See, e.g., Tillis Trucking Co., Inc. v. Moses, 748 So.2d 874, 889 (Ala.1999)(citing several Alabama Supreme Court cases rejecting challenges to wrongful death constitutionality). The Alabama Supreme Court has specifically reviewed its constitutionality in light of Gore and found it still to be good law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>d. Constitutional Arguments<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWd\">1. Reprehensibility</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The defendants argue that the first \u201cguidepost\u201d can\u2019t be met because the Alabama wrongful death statute does not require \u201creprehensible\u201d conduct. The defendants imply that merely negligent conduct cannot also be reprehensible. They argue that it would be impossible for a jury and reviewing court to calculate an award based on mere negligence, as opposed to intentional or wanton negligence. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\u25a0 The Supreme Court has found that punitive damages for a negligent death may be appropriate. See Louis Pizitz Dry Goods Co. v. Yeldell, 274 U.S. 112, 116, 47 S.Ct. 509, 71 L.Ed. 952 (1927)(\u201cWe cannot say that it is beyond the power of a Legislature, in effecting such a change in common law rules, to attempt to preserve human life by making homicide expensive. It may impose an extraordinary liability such as the present, not only upon those at fault but upon those who, although not directly culpable, are able nevertheless, in the management of their affairs, to guard substantially against the evil to be prevented.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Because an act is negligent does not mean it can\u2019t also be reprehensible. See Gore, 517 U.S. at 576, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (\u201c[T]rickery and deceit...are <em>more reprehensible </em>than negligence.\u201d (citation omitted)(emphasis added)). \u201cReprehensibility\u201d is simply another word for \u201cculpability.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cReprehensible\u201d conduct can be \u201copen to criticism or rebuke; blameworthy.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The goal of the \u201creprehensibility\u201d guidepost is to ensure that the award reflects \u201cthe enormity of [the] offense.\u201d Gore, 517 U.S. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1589. \u201cThis principle reflects the accepted view that some wrongs are more blameworthy than others.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">\u201cReprehensibility\u201d requires an evaluation of how blameworthy conduct may be: less culpable conduct such as negligence may be less reprehensible requiring a lower damages award; more culpable conduct such as gross negligence, recklessness, gross recklessness, or intentional actions may be more reprehensible requiring a higher award. See Roe v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 613 F.3d 1058, 1065 (11th Cir.2010)(citing Ala. Power Co. v. Turner, 575 So.2d 551, 554-55 (Ala.1991); Alabama Pattern Jury Instructions: Civil 11A.28 (2d ed.))(\u201cIn assessing punitive damages [under the Alabama wrongful death statute], the worse the defendant\u2019s conduct was, the greater the damages should be.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">This sort of evaluation is no different than what jurors and judges do all the time.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Juries evaluate how badly a defendant behaved and award damages accordingly. See, e.g., Alabama Pattern Jury Instructions: Civil 11A.28 (2d ed.). In an analogous area of law \u2014 criminal sentencing \u2014 judges calculate punishments based on varying degrees of culpability.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Just as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>a street level illegal drug dealer may be considered less culpable than a ringleader, so too could a merely negligent legal drug producer be held less liable than a producer who intentional misrepresents risks about a drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">2. Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The defendants next argue that the second Gore guidepost cannot be applied because the wrongful death statute does not provide compensatory damages. Without compensatory damages, they claim, the court would be unable to gauge the reasonableness of the punitive damages based on a ratio of punitive to compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The Supreme Court has offered the ratio of compensatory damages to punitive damages as an indicium of reasonableness. However, the Court has also repeatedly declined to formulate a \u201cmathematical bright line\u201d ratio for determining whether a particular punitive damages award was \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d See Gore, 517 U.S. at 582-83, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (\u201cOnce again, \u2018we return to what we said... in Haslip: \u201cWe need not, and indeed we cannot, draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case. We can say, however, that [a] general eoncer[n] of reasonableness... properly enter[s] into the constitutional calculus.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">I cannot say that the absence of a ratio would necessarily render the entire evaluation under the \u201cguideposts\u201d unconstitutional. While the Supreme Court has explained that punitive damages should bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages, this relationship is but one factor to consider.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Whether a punitive damages award is \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d also depends upon many other things: the possible harm that could have resulted from the defendant\u2019s conduct, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>conduct was carried out in bad faith, whether trickery was involved, and how much a defendant might have profited from his conduct.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Even when a ratio can be used, the Supreme Court has explained that it may not always be useful in gauging how culpable a defendant\u2019s conduct may be. For example, conduct that is reckless but causes little actual harm may require a substantial punitive damages award to prevent future bad acts. See TXO Production Corp., 509 U.S. at 459-60, 113 S.Ct. 2711 (\u201cFor instance, a man wildly fires a gun into a crowd. By sheer chance, no one is injured and the only damage is to a $10 pair of glasses. A jury reasonably could find only $10 in compensatory damages, but thousands of dollars in punitive damages to teach a duty of care. We would allow a jury to impose substantial punitive damages in order to discourage future bad acts.\u201d)(citations and quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">In this case, even if compensatory damages were available, they may not be an effective means for calculating punitive damages. The decedent was not working at the time she died.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> She was employed for many years, but her health conditions made work increasingly difficult; she left the workforce several years before her death.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> She was unmarried and living with her sister.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> She had no dependents. A superficial overview of the facts makes clear: she would be entitled to little or no compensatory damages.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">Assuming that the plaintiff has a valid wrongful death claim, she would only be able to recover some single-digit multiple of a small compensatory damages award, under the defendants\u2019 theory. She essentially would only be entitled to a small punitive damages award. Yet, if Ms. Hayes had died several years earlier, when she was working, she might be entitled to more punitive damages simply because her compensatory damages would be higher. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Under either scenario, the defendants\u2019 conduct could have been the same. What the plaintiffs life circumstances are at the time she died should not drastically alter what punitive damages may be available, to prevent future deaths like hers. The defendants\u2019 conduct is the focus of a punitive damages analysis, not the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">This is exactly why Alabama has set its statute up in the way it has. It recognizes that one tort victim\u2019s life should not be valued any more than another victim\u2019s life when both were subject to the same conduct by a tortfeasor. There is an inherent unfairness to claiming one person\u2019s life is worth more than another. This principle is especially important in this context. Those taking Extra Strength Tylenol for extended periods may be the ill, the elderly, the disabled, the vulnerable. Under our traditional measure of compensatory damages, these also may be the same people whose lives may be considered \u201cless valuable.\u201d To say that the defendants\u2019 conduct should be any less punishable because it caused harm to someone more vulnerable seems illogical and goes against the goals of punitive damage awards.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">e. The Alabama Wrongful Death Statute Is Not Facially Unconstitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Punitive damage decisions require case-by-ease analysis. \u201cIn our federal system, States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case.\u201d BMW of N. Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 568, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). \u201c[A] jury imposing a punitive damages award must make a qualitative assessment based on a host of facts and circumstances unique to the particular case before it.\u201d TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 457, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993). Whether a punitive damages award can be considered violative of due process can only be established through actual application of a punitive damages scheme. See Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 436, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001)(recog-nizing that \u201cgross excessiveness\u201d is a \u201cfluid concept[]\u201d which takes its \u201csubstantive content from the particular contexts in which the standard are being expressed; that because such concepts acquire content only through case-by-case application, independent review is necessary\u201d). Like other concepts that are punitive in nature\u2014 \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d \u2014 a determination of whether a punitive damages award is unconstitutional can only be done \u201cas applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">The Alabama Supreme Court has recognized that a ratio factor cannot be applied to wrongful death awards because the statute does not provide for compensatory damages.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The court has explained \u201cone could say that it does not apply as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>mathematical ratio, but, if one considers the purpose behind this factor, it applies in the sense of proportionality between the punitive-damages award and the harm that was caused or was likely to be caused by the defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d Tillis Trucking Co., Inc. v. Moses, 748 So.2d 874, 889 (Ala.1999). \u201c[A] punitive-damages award in a wrongful-death case may nonetheless be compared and evaluated, though perhaps not in a strictly mathematical sense, by means of a \u2018proportional evaluation\u2019 of the awarded amount, the conduct of a defendant, and the resulting harm from that conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Boudreaux v.

Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 506, 128 S.Ct. 2605, 171 L.Ed.2d 570 (2008)(discussing the flaws of having a hard cap on punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">When a statute does not impose a cap on punitive damages, the method for determining punitive damages is considered to be \"common law.\u201d See Haslip, 499 U.S. at 10, 111 S.Ct. 1032 (\"Without statutory (or at least common-law) standards for the determination of how large an award of punitive damages is appropriate in a given case, juries are left largely to themselves in making this important, and potentially devastating, decision....\u201d). \u201cUnder the traditional common-law approach, the amount of the punitive award is initially determined by a jury instructed to consider the gravity of the wrong and the need to deter similar wrongful conduct. The jury\u2019s determination is then reviewed by trial and appellate courts to ensure that it is reasonable.\u201d Id, at 15, 111 S.Ct. 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"AcW\">As the Supreme Court explained in Haslip, \"the common-law method for assessing punitive damages is [not] so inherently unfair as to deny due process and be <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. \u2018If a thing has been practised for two hundred years by common consent, it will need a strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to affect it.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 17, 111 S.Ct. 1032. See also TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 457, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993)(\"Punitive damage awards reached using \u2018fair procedures\u2019\u2014 decisions made using an impartial collective deliberation process \u2014 are \u2018entitled to a strong presumption of validity.\u2019 \u201d). \u201cIn view of this consistent history, we cannot say that the commonlaw method for assessing punitive damages is so inherently unfair as to deny due process and be per se unconstitutional. \u2018If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>a thing has been practised for two hundred years by common consent, it will need a strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to affect it.\u2019\u201d Haslip, 499 U.S. at 17, 111 S.Ct. 1032 (citations omitted). Under Haslip, this argument holds little weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
