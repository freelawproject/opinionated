At the decease of my said wife, I give, bequeath, and devise the use and improvement of all my estate, real and personal, to my children, viz. Charlotte P. Hall, wife of Osborn B. Hall, Samuel W. Cutter, Louisa M. Carter, wife of John H. Carter, Sarah Ann Hunnewell, wife of Edwin Hunnewell, Benjamin L. Cutter, Theodore A. Cutter, Henry E. Cutter, and William S. Cutter; and on the decease of either of the above named children leaving a child or childi*en, the proportion of such deceased child\u2019s income shall be given to said child or children, and on the decease of either of the above named children leaving a widow but no child, the proportion of such deceased child\u2019s income shall be given to said widow while she remains the widow of such deceased child, and on the decease of either of the above named children leaving no lawful issue or widow, the proportion of such deceased child\u2019s income shall be given to the surviving brothers and sisters in equal propertions, and on the decease of all the above named children I give, bequeath, and devise all my estate, real and personal, to my grandchildren who may be then living, to be equally divided between them:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-13\">\u201c Provided, however, that the proportion to be paid to any widow of a deceased son shall continue to be paid from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>income of the whole estate, each share contributing its equal part so long as she or they remain such widow.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avz\">The testator appointed an executor \u201c to carry out the provisions of this will,\u201d giving him power to sell any portion of the real estate: <em>\u201c </em>such sale of real estate is to be deemed by my said executor to be for the benefit of my family, and consent to such sale must be first given in writing by my said wife if living and by a majority of my before named children who may be living at the time of such sale.\u201d The executor is further directed to \u201c invest the proceeds of such sale in some safe manner, or in other real estate for the benefit of my family.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">The bill alleged that the testator died in 1864, leaving a widow, since deceased, and as his only heirs and next of kin Charlotte P. Hall, who has since died leaving no issue, Samuel W. Cutter, now deceased, Louisa M. Carter, Sarah Ann Hunnewell, who has since died leaving as her only issue a daughter, Charlotte Wellington, Benjamin L. Cutter, who has since died leaving no issue, Theodore A. Cutter, Henry E. Cutter, and William S. Cutter; that Samuel W. Cutter had died leaving a son, Samuel Cutter, and a daughter, now Mary E. McMahon; that the last named Samuel Cutter, being a grandson of the testator, had died leaving a widow, Maud Estelle Cutter, and three minor children, viz. the said Frank Revenue Cutter, Mary Cutter, and Samuel Wheelock Cutter, said last named minor children being great-grandchildren of the testator; that it was contended in behalf of the last named great-grandchildren that they were entitled to receive the share of the income of the trust estate to which their father, Samuel Cutter, would be entitled if living ; that it was also contended that such share should be paid to the children of the testator now living; and that there was a possibility that said share should be paid to Mary E. McMahon, and that Maud Estelle Cutter might make some claim thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">A decree was entered by a single justice \u201c that the respondent Mary E. McMahon is entitled to receive the whole of that share in the income of the trust estate to which her father, Samuel W. Cutter, would be entitled were he living, such share being now one sixth of the entire income of the trust estate; that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the duty of the trustee to pay over to said Mary E. McMahon one sixth part of the annual income of the trust estate; that Samuel W. Cutter, May Cutter, and Frank R. Cutter, minor children of Samuel Cutter, deceased, are not entitled to receive any part of the income of the trust estate \u201d ; and \u201c that the sum of fifty dollars be allowed to counsel for Mary E. McMahon, and the sum of fifty dollars to counsel for Arthur H. Brooks, guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Samuel W. Cutter, May Cutter, and Frank R. Cutter, minor children, as counsel fees and expenses, said sums to be paid to them by the petitioner out of the funds of the estate in his hands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-3\">The minor respondents, Frank Revenue Cutter, May Cutter, and Samuel Wheelock Cutter, by their guardian <em>ad </em>litem, Arthur H.

He gives to his wife the furniture which is in his dwelling-house, and also gives to her the use and improvement of all his real estate and personal property during her life. At the decease of his wife, he gives a life estate to his children, naming them, and makes a provision for the case of a child dying leaving a child or children, and for the case of a child leaving a widow. On the death of all the children mentioned, he gives all of his estate, real and personal, to his grandchildren who may then be living, to be equally divided between them. He also appoints an executor and trustee \u201c to carry out the provisions of this will.\u201d To the executor is given power to sell any portion of the real estate; \u201c such sale of real estate is to be deemed by my said executor to be for the benefit of my family, and consent to such sale must be first given in writing,\u201d by the widow if living, and by a majority of the children living at the time of the sale. The executor is further directed to u invest the proceeds of such sale in some safe manner . . . for the benefit of my family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The testator died in 1864, leaving a widow and eight children surviving him, three of whom were married. The widow died <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>in 1878. Since the testator\u2019s death, five of his children have died, two leaving issue, and three leaving no issue. One of the two leaving issue was a son, Samuel W. Cutter, who left a son Samuel and a daughter Mary, now Mrs. McMahon. Samuel, the grandson of the testator, is now dead, leaving a widow arid three minor children. His sister also survived him. The question before the court is whether the income of his father\u2019s share should be paid to his sister or to his three minor children, who were the great-grandchildren of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">The language of the will seems to us reasonably plain. After the provision giving the children of the testator a life interest, it is provided, leaving out the provision for a widow of a child : \u201cand on the decease of either of the above named children leaving a child or children, the proportion of such deceased child\u2019s income shall be given to said child or children.\u201d Mrs. McMahon is now the only surviving child of Samuel W. Cutter, and is therefore entitled to the income.</p>\n<p id=\"AT8\">One ground upon which the great-grandchildren of the testator contend that they are entitled to the income is, that the will provides for the case of the death of any one of the testator\u2019s children \u201cleaving no lawful issue or widow,\u201d in which event \u201c the proportion of such deceased child\u2019s income shall be given to the surviving brothers and sisters in equal proportions.\u201d The word \u201c issue \u201d may, undoubtedly, not be restricted to children, <em>(Hills </em>v. Barnard, 152 Mass. 67, 73,) but we have no occasion in this case to consider whether the testator in that particular clause intended children or a more remote descendant, for Mrs. McMahon does not claim under this clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">It is further contended that, as the word \u201c children \u201d may be interpreted to mean grandchildren, <em>(Bowker </em>v. <em>Bowker, </em>148 Mass. 198,) so the word \u201cgrandchildren\u201d may be interpreted to mean great-grandchildren, and that when the fund comes to be divided, if there are no grandchildren then living, the great-grandchildren may take under the will. But whatever construction may be given if there are no grandchildren when the last child of the testator dies, it is manifest that the testator did not intend to go beyond grandchildren, if there were any of this class living when the principal came to be disposed of. The estate is then to be divided, not <em>per stirpes </em>but <em>per capita. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The language is \u201c to my grandchildren who may be then living, to be equally divided between them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We are therefore of opinion that the decree of the single justice, so far as it relates to the questions argued before us, should be affirmed. So much of the decree as relates to an allowance to counsel for fees and expenses is to be settled by a single justice, as we do not understand that the allowance made includes the services of counsel on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
