Benedict, and Finlay and Macaulay; that an assessment was laid by the officers of the company before the injunction was issued, and notice thereof was sent by mail to the policy'holders liable to the assessment, demanding payment thereof, and notifying. them that, unless the assessment was paid within fifteen days after notice, all liability of the company for loss wmuld cease, such a vote having been passed by the directors of the company on January 28, 1895, and that among those so notified were Finlay and Macaulay, who failed to pay the assessment within fifteen days after notice thereof, and have never paid it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-3\">At the hearing before <em>Holmes, </em>J., appeared Benedict, Finlay and Macaulay, and the National Wall Paper Company, represented by counsel, and claimed the right to be allowed to prove their claims and to share in the assets of the defendant corporation under some appropriate order of the court. Benedict and Finlay and Macaulay had previously appeared before the auditor to whom was referred the question of the amount of the proposed assessment, and had prayed that their claims might be included therein. In accordance with the recommendation of the auditor, an assessment of $250,000 was afterwards levied under an order of this court dated March 5, 1896, in respect of losses existing before the petition was filed. The funds in the receiver\u2019s hands were raised by this assessment. The parties mentioned in the petition paid their shares of the assessment, except as therein set forth. The judge ruled that no losses incurred after the filing of the bill were entitled to share \u00edq the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dividend, and ordered a decree to that effect upon the petition. The parties represented by counsel excepted, and, at their request, the judge reported the case for the consideration of the full court, such decree to be entered as equity might require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-3\"><em>W.

The bill was filed March 19, 1895, and on the same day an injunction was issued, which was made perpetual, May 28, 1895, and a receiver was then appointed. The bill was filed by the insurance commissioner, acting under St. 1894, c. 522, \u00a7 7. It has been held heretofore, in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Shenango Glass Co. </em>166 Mass. 238, that a creditor should be enjoined from enforcing an attachment made against this company after the filing of the bill, the reasons assigned being that \u201c the rights of all parties to share in the property of the corporation are fixed as of the date of the filing of the bill in equity,\u201d and that the rights of the receiver to the possession of the property \u201c for the purposes of distribution relate back to the commencement of the proceedings.\u201d It is sought to distinguish the present case from that, on the ground that there the creditor sought to gain a preference to himself by the attachments, while here the claimants only seek to be allowed to share with the creditors generally. It has, however, been held heretofore that the rights of creditors are fixed as of the date of the proceedings, or, as was said in <em>Atlas Bank </em>v. <em>Nahant </em>Bank, 23 Pick. 480, 489, at least by the issuing of an injunction. <em>Burdon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Safety Fund Association, </em>147 Mass. 360, 368. <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>United Order of the Golden Lion, </em>159 Mass. 9, 12. <em>Garham </em>v. <em>Mutual Aid Society, </em>161 Mass. 357, 365, 367. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United Reserve Fund Association, </em>166 Mass. 450. The case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Arena Publishing Co., ante, </em>22, rests on special grounds. This rule must be considered as established in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
