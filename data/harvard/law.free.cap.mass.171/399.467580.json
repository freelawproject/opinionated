At the trial in the Superior Court, before Hardy, J., there was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff, a girl twelve years of age, with her brother who was fifteen years of age, entered the defendant\u2019s carpenter shop to purchase a basket of wood, for which she paid five cents to one of the defendant\u2019s workmen; that she and others had bought wood at the plaintiff\u2019s shop on numerous occasions prior to the accident, and that the defendant\u2019s workman had placed the money received therefor in a drawer where change was kept with which to buy small supplies for the shop; that the plaintiff and her brother entered a bin about three feet high partly filled with wood, for the purpose of filling her basket, by a step which she had been in the habit of using whenever she had bought wood at the shop ; that while they were in the bin a workman of the defendant placed some boards diagonally across the top of the bin obstructing the plaintiff\u2019s access to the step by which she entered it; that about eighteen inches from one side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>bin, parallel with it, and extending a large part of the length of the bin was a table, on which there was a revolving knife, projecting about a sixteenth of an inch above the surface thereof; that when in rapid motion the knife might look as if it were at rest; that the plaintiff left the bin by climbing over it at the corner next to this table, which seemed to her to be the best way to get out; and that in so doing she rested her hand on the knife, which she thought was a piece of iron at rest, and was injured. The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that he did not know that wood had been sold to the plaintiff or others h}' the basket; that he had given express orders to his foreman and workmen to sell no wood by the basket, and to allow no children in the shop ; that the bin was easily accessible on a side other than that by which the plaintiff left it; and that it was impracticable to cover the knife because it was in such constant use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAk\">The defendant requested that the following rulings be given :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\"><em>\u201c </em>1. There is no evidence on the part of the plaintiff to show that she was anything more than a licensee at the most.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">\u201c 2. There is no evidence sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care when she was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">\u201c 3. There is no evidence sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the defendant or his servants were negligent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">\u201c 4. Upon all the evidence in the case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">The judge refused to give the first ruling, but gave the second, third, and fourth rulings, and directed a verdict for the defendant ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">The case was argued at the bar in March, 1898, and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-10\"><em>J. F. Wheeler &amp; R. G. Mc</em>Clung, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-11\"><em>W. F. </em>Wharton, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b424-12\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1N1\">The evidence would warrant a finding that the plaintiff was invited to come to the defendant\u2019s shop to buy waste wood, and, after having paid the price of a basketful, to enter the bin for the purpose of taking the wood; and that, having paid the price on the day of the accident, she was properly in the bin with her brother for the purpose of filling her basket. The evidence also tended to show that while there her usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>way of getting out was cut off by the act of one of the defendant\u2019s workmen in placing boards across the bin, and thus covering the corner where there was a step or something which served for a step, which she was in the habit of using in getting into and out of the bin; and that therefore she took another way of getting out, and in doing this received the injury by placing her hand upon a revolving knife which projected about a sixteenth of an inch above the surface of a table standing near the bin. She testified that she thought this knife to be a still piece of iron, and there was aether testimony that when in rapid motion it might look as if it was at rest. Whether the course which she took to get out of the bin was inconsistent with due care on her part was a question for the jury. Being without assistance, advice, or caution, it cannot be held, as matter of law, that upon undisputed facts she was careless, or that the defendant was free from fault in allowing her under such circumstances to get out by a way which exposed her to injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><em>Exceptions </em>sustained,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
