After the upper limb fell to the ground the plaintiff remained standing on the lower limb with one leg around the trunk of the tree; and Grant then ordered the wire to be pulled back through the tree, and together with some of the other men'began to pull upon it; when the wire was pulled it caught upon the limb, and the plaintiff called out to stop pulling, but before he had time to get into a safe position the limb broke and the plaintiff fell to the ground and was injured. For the purpose of showing that the method of doing the work under the direction of Grant was unsafe and unusual, and as bearing upon the plaintiff\u2019s due care, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked of an electrical expert whether in his opinion the method of dealing with the wire was a proper one; and he also asked of the same expert what was the usual method of running a wire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>from one pole to another when there was a tree between the poles. Both . questions were excluded, and the plaintiff duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-3\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiff requested the following ruling: \u201c If the jury find that Grant gave negligent orders, when acting as superintendent, to the plaintiff or the other workmen, just preceding the injury of the plaintiff, orders not consistent with due care, \u2014 and that the giving of these orders caused the men handling the wire, which was then in contact with a part of the tree upon which the plaintiff was standing, to so handle and operate that wire that the plaintiff\u2019s position was rendered unsafe and dangerous, and the plaintiff was injured by reason of said orders of Grant being executed, \u2014 the jury would be authorized in finding that the negligence of Grant contributed to produce' the injury of the plaintiff, even though after he, Grant, gave the orders, he went to work with his own hands to help pull the wire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">The judge refused so to rule, and directed a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">The case was argued at the bar in March, 1898, and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-6\"><em>J. E. Cotter &amp; A. P. </em>French, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-7\"><em>A. </em>Hemenway, ( <em>G. C. Dickson </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b421-8\">Barker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYI\">Assuming that Grant\u2019s principal duty was-that of superintendence, he was also a workman laboring with his own hands, and the defendant is not made answerable to the plaintiff for Grant\u2019s negligence except in the exercise of his superintendence. We are of the opinion that the evidence would not justify a finding that any negligence in his exercise of superintendence contributed to' the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">A wire had been passed through the branches of a tree into which the plaintiff was sent to cut off a limb. When cut, this lodged upon another lower down, and then the plaintiff, standing upon the lower limb, made a second cut in the one which had fallen from above, and it fell to the ground. Assuming that it was his duty to remain longer in the tree, there is nothing to justify a finding that the order then given to pull the wire back was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The wire was not then caught, and the plaintiff was himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>then in a position to see what would probably be the effect of pulling the wire back. This order is the only act of Grant which could be found to be an act of superintendence connected with the accident. His helping the other workmen to pull was merely the act of a workman, and had in it no element of superintendence. When the wire was pulled, it caught upon the limb, the limb shook, and the plaintiff then called out to stop pulling, but before he had time to get into a safe position the limb broke. It is plain that the plaintiff was in a position to know and to judge of his own safety, and if the pulling back of the wire, which was naturally the next thing in order after the limb which he had been sent into the tree to cut off had finally fallen, would put him in peril, he himself should give warning. Grant could not be found negligent in not perceiving the danger which the plaintiff himself did not perceive, and of which he did not give warning. When the danger became apparent, it was too late to avert the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">We also think that the refusal of the court to admit the opinion of an electrical expert as to whether the method of dealing with the wire was a proper one, and what the usual method is of running a wire from one pole to another when there is a tree between the poles, was correct. That the wire was intended for the transmission of electricity was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The work of stringing wares from one pole to another through branches of an intervening tree is one within the range of ordinary intelligence and observation, involving only matters of ordinary knowledge and experience, such as men in general understand and comprehend without expert assistance, and as to which technical experience would not be instructive.
