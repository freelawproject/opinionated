Sts. c. 191, for labor furnished in the erection of a schoolhouse. At the trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Mason, </em>C. J., it appeared that the estate upon which the lien was claimed was at the time the labor was furnished held by the town of Revere for public school purposes. The judge, at the request of the respondent, ruled that no lien could be maintained upon property so held, and found for the respondent; and reported the case for the determination of this court. If the ruling was wrong, the lien was to be established for 1251.15, with costs; otherwise, judgment was to be entered on the finding.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-11\">J. <em>E.

Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 1, give a lien for labor upon a schoolhouse held by a town for public school purposes. Such a lien seems to have been enforced in <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Newbury School District, </em>3 Allen, 307, but it does not appear whether the exceptions were broad enough to present this question, and the question is not adverted to in the decision. In Kansas under like circumstances a lien was held to be created, although it was assumed that, by reason of another statute, no process could be issued to enforce it while the building remained the property of the school district. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>School District, </em>17 Kans. 104. See <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>Parish of Grant, </em>30 La. An. 361. But the general current of decisions is against the lien when the property upon which it is asserted is held for public uses. <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>East Provi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>dence, </em>17 R.

The right to take such property on execution is denied on similar grounds. <em>Meriwether </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>102 U. S. 472, 501, 513, 525, 526. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>60 Penn.

Waltham, </em>170 Mass. 160; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Massachusetts General Hospital, </em>120 Mass. 432. When we add to the almost unanimous course of decision elsewhere, our own St. 1892, c. 270, which gives a laborer an action against a town on conditions similar to those attached to liens, a statute hardly explicable except on the assumption that it gives the only remedy available, we feel bound to construe Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 1, as not intended to apply to buildings like the schoolhouse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the finding.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
