The defendant filed a petition in bankruptcy in the United States District Court within and for the District of Massachusetts, under U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7\u00a7 4972-5132, on July 26, 1873, which contained a schedule sworn to by the defendant, purporting to set forth a correct list of each and every one of his creditors, but from which he intentionally omitted the name of the plaintiff and any statement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. On March 21, 1874, the defendant met the plaintiff, and paid him ten dollar\u2019s on account of this note. On October 5, 1874, the defendant received his discharge in bankruptcy. The plaintiff did not know anything of the bankruptcy proceedings prior to the beginning of this action, which proceedings were regular and conformable to law, except so far as the failure of the defendant to make any return of the plaintiff\u2019s claim may be an irregularity. The statute of limitations had not run in favor of the defendant, by reason of his absence from the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\">If a discharge in bankruptcy under the foregoing circumstances was a valid defence, judgment was to be entered for. the defendant; otherwise for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-6\"><em>R.

The only respect in which this case differs from other eases in which a similar question has been considered by this court consists in the fact of the payment. See <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>144 Mass. 390; <em>Kempton </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>130 Mass. 236; <em>Black </em>v. Blazo, 117 Mass. 17; <em>Way </em>v. Howe, 108 Mass. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">But that did not constitute a new promise in writing within Gen. Sts. c. 105, \u00a7 3, now Pub. Sts. c. 78, \u00a7 3, which were then in force. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>161 Mass. 16. And the fact that the payment may have been made with fraudulent intent does not avoid the discharge. <em>Fuller </em>v. Pease, 144 Mass. 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
