After the services were rendered he told the plaintiff to make the charge to his father. There was evidence that twice during the lifetime of the minor the plaintiff sent a statement of his charge for the services to the defendant, and received no reply. Once a statement was sent by mail, postage paid, with a request printed on the corner of the envelope to return to the plaintiff if not called for within five days, and this letter did not come back to the plaintiff.

At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Wardwell, </em>J., the defendant, who testified that he did not know the condition of his son\u2019s teeth, or that the work was performed, requested the judge to rule \u201c that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.\u201d The judge ' refused so to rule, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions, which appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-6\"><em>J.

The defendant\u2019s son, a boy nineteen or twenty years of age, suffering with toothache, living in his father\u2019s family, would naturally be supposed to be authorized by his father in applying to a dentist for surgical treatment. <em>Angel </em>v. <em>McLellan, </em>16 Mass. 28. After the services were rendered, he told the plaintiff to make the charge to his father. This was a representation by him that he was authorized by his father to procure the services on his father\u2019s credit. There was evidence that twice during the lifetime of the minor the plaintiff sent a statement of his charge for the services to the defendant and received no reply. Once the statement was sent by mail, postage paid, with a request printed on the corner of the envelope to return to the plaintiff if not called for within five days, and this letter did not come back to the plaintiff. It was \u00e1 question of fact for the jury whether the circumstances were such that the defendant would have been likely to make some answer if the bill had been contracted without his authority. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>If they answered this question in the affirmative, they properly might draw an inference against the defendant. <em>Sturtevant </em>v. Wallack, 141 Mass. 119, 123. They might disbelieve such parts of the defendant\u2019s testimony as tended to show that he was not liable, and from all .the circumstances of the case they might believe that he authorized his son to procure the services on his credit, either by an express statement or by a course of conduct which impliedly covered the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">Whether there was any evidence to charge him on the ground of his neglect to furnish his son the dental services that he needed, it is unnecessary to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"AYT\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
