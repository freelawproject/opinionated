There was further evidence tending to show that, seasonably after the fire, the plaintiffs rendered to the defendant proofs of loss, in which the building damaged by fire was described as a \u201c frame building 2-|- stories high, occupied as a chip factory, situate No. 8 Washington St., Lynn, Mass.\u201d; that the parties having failed to agree as to the amount of the loss, they entered into an agreement of reference on October 22, 1895, according to the terms of the policy ; that one referee was chosen by each of them; that these two referees accepted the appointment, appointed a third referee, and, the third referee having failed to accept his appointment or to act with the others, they proceeded to-make an award; that the defendant\u2019s agent, in forwarding the award of the referees to the plaintiffs, stated that \u201cit did not occur to me at the time of signing the agreement for submission that your policy had been can-celled, and that therefore there was no occasion for the Manchester Fire Assurance Company to enter into any reference for the determination of the amount of loss to your property. Aside from that, and if your policy had not been cancelled, the paper sent herewith is \u2014 as the statute and your policy require \u2014 an agreement for submission to <em>three </em>people. If there had been outstanding a valid policy of the Manchester Assurance Company at the date of your loss, the amount of loss \u2014 unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>it had been agreed upon by the parties \u2014 could <em>only </em>have been ascertained by reference to <em>three </em>referees, <em>all </em>of whom must take part in ascertaining the amount of the loss. It appears from this paper that the person selected by the other two to act as a third referee never accepted his appointment, he was never sworn, and did not act with the other two. Under these circumstances, any award of the other two is, of course, invalid. The company would therefore refuse to be bound by the same, even if your policy had not been cancelled before the loss.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-3\">The judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant, and reported the case for the determination of this court.

The description of the building corresponded in other respects with that contained in the policy, and there is nothing to show that the defendant was misled or prejudiced by the error. It received the proof without objecting then, or during the subsequent negotiations, to the mistake in the number, and the jury might have found that it had waived any objection to the proof which it might have had on that ground. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Exchange Ins. Co. </em>12 Gray, 265. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Washington Ins. Co. </em>12 Allen, 391. <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Agawam Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We do not find it necessary to consider whether there was evidence tending to show that the defendant waived the provision in the policy in regard to arbitration in case the parties were unable to agree as to the amount of loss, since we are of opinion that the policy was duly cancelled before the fire occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">It is admitted that Madden was the agent of the defendant, and that as such agent he had authority to issue, deliver, and cancel the policy in suit; but the plaintiffs contend that, in procuring the policy and delivering it to him for cancellation, Miss Wentworth acted as his agent, and not as their agent. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>uncontroverted that the plaintiffs applied to one Breed to secure insurance on the building, and that he in turn applied to Madden, who issued the policy. After the policy was issued and delivered, the defendant company requested Madden to cancel it and promptly return it to the main office. Thereupon Madden \u2022went to Breed\u2019s office and told Miss Wentworth, who was the clerk in charge, that he was instructed to cancel the policy, and asked her to get it and bring it to him for cancellation, which she did. Breed had procured other insurance for the plaintiffs. It is evident, we think, that Miss Wentworth must be regarded in Breed\u2019s absence as representing him, and that in applying at Breed\u2019s office for the policy Madden treated Breed as the party who had represented and acted for the plaintiffs in procuring the insurance, and as the proper person through whom to make application for its return for cancellation. It would only be by a fiction of law, therefore, that Breed or his clerk could be regarded as Madden\u2019s agent, or as representing anybody except the plaintiffs in delivering up the policy for cancellation. And we see nothing that requires such a fiction to be imported into the case, or which will justify any other conclusion than that Miss Wentworth was the agent of the plaintiffs. That being so, the plaintiffs\u2019 instructions to her, which were not disclosed to Madden, could not affect the validity of the cancellation. <em>Parker &amp; Young Manuf.
