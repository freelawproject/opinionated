The defendant demurred to both counts of the declaration, alleging as ground therefor \u201c that the performance of the alleged promise and agreement of the defendant was contingent upon the prior performance of a certain condition, and that it nowhere appears in either of said counts that such condition had been performed or complied with.\u201d In the Superior Court the demurrer was sustained ; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-4\"><em>M. </em>Holbrook, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-5\"><em>Z.

There is in it no contract on the part of the defendant that he will purchase such claims, and pay therefor in notes or cash as set forth in the agreement. The question then is whether the defendant\u2019s signature to the supplemental line, which reads, \u201c I authorize the above offer, and agree to carry the same out if secured within the time named,\u201d imports an absolute or a conditional liability on his part, and if the latter, whether the cause of action, if any, has been well pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It is clear, we think, that the liability is a conditional one. The defendant authorizes and agrees to carry out the stipulations contained in the body of the agreement, \u201c if secured within the time named \u201d in it. That is plainly a conditional undertaking, and, according to well settled rules of pleading, the condition should have been set out as a part \"of the contract, and performance of it averred, or the want of performance excused. <em>Newcomb </em>v.

Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 2, cl. 10. The allegation- that \u201c the plaintiff has done and performed all things on its part in said agreement contained to be done and performed, and that it has kept all of the conditions of said agreement,\u201d is not sufficient. The condition should also be set out.</p>\n<p id=\"AW8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
