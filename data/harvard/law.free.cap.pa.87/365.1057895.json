King, to recover damages for injuries sustained by her from falling into an opening in the sidewalk, at a cellar window of a building of the defendant, on Liberty street, in the city of Allegheny. The opening in the sidewalk was for the purpose of light and ventilation, and was also used for taking in coal. It was about fifteen inches in width, three feet in length and projected from the wall of the house about sixteen inches. It was several feet deep and did not appear to have any cover or guard. Such openings are customary for the like buildings in the city of Allegheny. Mrs. Thompson the plaintiff, a washerwoman, on the evening of the accident was carrying home, assisted by her son, a small lad, a basket of clothes. Mrs. Thompson was on the inside, and in passing the house of the defendant stepped into the above-described opening and thereby received a serious injury. The street was lighted as usual, and there was also a light in a window immediately over the opening.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-10\">At the trial, before Ewing, P. J., the plaintiffs offered to prove by Mrs. Thompson, the length of time she was unable to work and the expense to which she was subjected from the injury caused by the accident, to be followed by evidence, that for some time prior to the injury the husband of witness had been in bad health and she had been obliged to support herself and family. Admitted under objection. First assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-11\">Also, to prove the amount of the physician\u2019s bill, and that Mrs. Thompson herself employed him, and was liable personally to pay the bill.

Second assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-12\">The fifth point of the plaintiffs, and the answer of the court thereto, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-13\">If the jury should be of the opinion that plaintiffs are entitled to recover, they may allow the expenses of the care, including medical attendance and nursing, compensation for the physical and mental suffering caused by the injury, for the loss of time, and for any permanent or continuing reduction of power to earn money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-14\">Ans. \u201c The point is affirmed. If the jury find that prior to the accident Mrs. Thompson had been supporting herself by her own earnings, and that she contracted for her nursing and attendance of physician, otherwise it is refused, except as affirmed in the general charge.\u201d Fourth assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The defendant\u2019s second and fourth points and the answers thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">2.

The plaintiff in error, Robert H. King, was the owner of the premises where the accident occurred. There was an opening in the sidewalk at the cellar window of the house, for the purpose of light and ventilation, which was used for taking in coal. This opening was about fifteen inches in width and less than three feet in length, thus projecting into the pavement from the front wall of the house fifteen or sixteen inches. The opening appeared to have been of the usual character for like buildings in the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Upon the trial of the case in the court below the plaintiff (Mrs. Thompson) was permitted to testify, against the objection of the defendant, as to the length of time she was unable to work from the injury caused by the accident, and the expense to which she was subjected; also the amount of the physician\u2019s bill for medical attendance ; that she had employed the physician herself; to be followed by evidence that her husband had been in bad health, and that she had been obliged to support herself and family. The admission of \u2022 this evidence forms the subject of the first and second specifications of error. The fourth, alleging error in the answer of the court to the plaintiff\u2019s fifth point, raises the same question. These three specifications may be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">As this suit was brought for the use of the wife, it is manifest no recovery can be had for any loss the husband may have sustained, and for which he alone could bring suit. It is equally clear that the husband is entitled to the earnings of his wife, and is liable for her support and maintenance. If, by reason of the accident, the earning power of the wife was diminished, the loss, in a legal sense, is the loss of the husband. If physicians\u2019 bills, medicines and expenses of nursing were incurred, the husband would be liable for their payment. This is the general rule. The exception is where the wife has been declared a <em>feme sole </em>trader, under the Act of 22d February 1718,1 Sm. Laws 99; Purd. Dig. 692, pi. 1, or the Act of 4th May 1855, Pamph. L. 430, Purd. Dig. 692, pi. 5, or is entitled to claim the immunities of a <em>feme sole </em>trader under said acts by reason of the causes enumerated therein. There was nothing in the case to bring Mrs. Thompson within the protection of either Act of Assembly. ' We have nothing but the offer to show that for some time prior to the injury her husband had been, in bad health, and that she had been obliged to support herself and family. The evidence in support of the offer was not printed in the paper-book. Assuming the offer to have been fully sustained, it does not come up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>to the requirements of the Act of 1855. Its language is: \u201cWhensoever any husband, from drunkenness, profligacy or other cause, shall neglect or refuse to provide for his wife, or shall desert her, she shall have all the rights and privileges secured to a <em>feme sole </em>trader, under the Act of 22d of February 1718.\u201d It requires something more than mere temporary inability, by reason of sickness of the husband, to support his wife, to bring the wife within the protection of this act. There must be a desertion or a neglect or refusal on the part of the husband \u2014 something that involves the wilful non-performance of a duty on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The fifth specification alleges that the court erred in not instructing the jury as requested in the defendant\u2019s second point, which was as follows: \u201c If the jury find that the area in front of the cellar window was such as was usual and customary in the city of Allegheny for lighting and ventilating cellars, and reasonably necessary for those purposes, then the defendant is not guilty of negligence- or nuisance in maintaining it.\u201d This point ought to have been, affirmed. If the opening was merely the usual and customary opening of cellar windows in Allegheny, and was reasonably necessary for the purposes of light and ventilation, it certainly could not be held to- he a nuisance; nor could it fairly be said that the owner was- guilty of negligence in maintaining it. We must take a reasonable view of this question. If it has been customary time out of mind for property-holders in Allegheny to have such openings, it involves a tacit assent on the part of the municipal authorities, as well as a general acquiescence on the part of the public. More than this, if such openings exist at nearly every house, such fact must have been known to this plaintiff as well as others. And if reasonably necessary for light and ventilation, the property-owner is not chargeable with negligence for placing and keeping it there. The jury might have found against the custom, and that the opening was not necessary for the purposes indicated. But the- question should have been submitted to them, and it was error not to affirm the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The defendant\u2019s fourth point called upon- the court to instruct the jury that, \u201c If the sidewalk was ten feet wide, and there was a paved space seven or eight feet wide between the curb and trees on one side, and the cellar window opening or area on the other side, whereon persons using the sidewalk could pass with ease and safety, and that the way was lighted by a lamp in the window immediately at the opening, and by gas lamps in the street, sufficient to enable the plaintiff to have avoided the accident of which she complains, then she was guilty of negligence, and cannot recover.\u201d The court having refused to charge as thus requested, we must assume the jury would have found the facts as stated in the point. It has been held in a number of cases, the most recent of which is Hoag <em>v. </em>The Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railroad Co., 4 Norris 293, that where the facts are ascertained the court may pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>upon the question of negligence as a matter of law. What are the facts here? A sidewalk ten feet wide; a paved space from seven to eight feet wide between the curb and trees on the one side and the opening at the cellar window on the other; the street lighted by a lamp in the window, and gas lamps in the street sufficient to have enabled the plaintiff to avoid the accident. It is really difficult to see how the plaintiff succeeded in getting into the hole. The testimony does not enlighten us. It must be borne in mind that the opening came out only about sixteen inches from the cellar wall. In order to fall in the plaintiff must have walked so close to the house as to touch it with her dress. She was also within the line of the doorsteps, which usually project twice the distance into the sidewalk that the opening did. No prudent person walks within sixteen inches of the houses when passing over the sidewalks of a city. It cannot be done without peril. Even where a street is dimly lighted the line of the houses is always visible. It is proper enough to hold owners of property to a reasonable care over it; yet, at the same time, persons using public streets ought also to exercise some little caution. Without it, there is hardly a street in Allegheny or Pittsburgh where, by reason of some slight inequality in the pavement, a trifling hole, or a loose stone, the passer-by may not fall and sustain injury. The defendant\u2019s fourth point ought to have been affirmed without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<author id=\"b370-7\">Gordon and Trunkey, JJ.</author>\n<p id=\"AL7\">Believing the fourth point was well refused, we dissent from so much of this opinion as reverses the court on that point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
