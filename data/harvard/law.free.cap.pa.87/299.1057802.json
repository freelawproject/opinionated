Kramer for arson, charged with burning the Exchange Hotel in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. The three counts of the indictment charged that defendant had set fire to said building on the 23d of May 1877. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-12\">At the trial it was shown on the' part of the Commonwealth that about 1 o\u2019clock on the morning of the23dof May 1877, fires were discovered in the east and west basements of the hotel; that the defendant, who was an inmate of the hotel, had been seen in these \u25a0basements on the day before, and that he had no business therein, and that hi? bed was unocchpied on the night of these fires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-13\">The Commonwealth then offered to prove that during tlm day and evening of the 25th of May 1877, the defendant,Jwhen requested and directed to leave the hotel 'by persons in charge, declined to leave, and made several excuses and unfounded pretexts for remaining, and when peremptorily ordered to go, in the evening of that day, went up stairs twice under false pretenses of getting his clothing and other property, and was in an upper room detected with a light, and upon his leaving the same in- apparent confusion of mind, a large quantity of matches were found in the said room, one box\" of which had been ignited and was still warm, and the said room .contained combustible materials \u2014 to be accompanied and followed by proof of suspicious conduct of said Kramer during said day and evening, and sundry contradictory and false statements by him, as to his conduct, purposes, possession of matches, and firing the same. This evidence offered to show that the said Kramer attempted and intended the burning of the hotel on the 25th of May as bearing upon the question of the identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the person perpetrating the burning on the 23d, and as proof of a continuous connected attempt and purpose to fire the said' hotel by the said Kramer, and also in part as conduct by defendant evincing conscious guilt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-6\">Objected' to,, because, the evidence was of an attempt to commit a felony on a different day and at a different place from that heretofore alleged and proven before the court, to wit, on the 23d of May 1877. \u2022 And. because there was- no evidence before the court which connected' Kramer with the burning of the 23d of May, and- the evidence offered as to the iiicidents occurring on the 25th does not tend to connect him with .or prove him guilty of the transaction of .the ;28d., \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">The court, Elwell, P. J., overruled .the objections and admitted the testimony, saying:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">\u201cI.acknowledge the force\u2019of the argument that a party charged with one' single offence shall not be required to answer to numerous offences, and that the giving of evidence of a different offence might have a tendency to prejudice the jury against the defendant. . Nevertheless, in a case situated just as this is, while acknowledging that rule (and.I feel disposed to enforce it upon the-minds-of the- -\u2022 jury), there is some evidence here which we will be obliged to submit to the jury. Whether it will be sufficient to convict, or whether we would allow a verdict to stand, is not the question \u2014 we would be obliged to submit it to the jury. And this evidence now offered \u2019 .may have some bearing upop the\u2019question-of the first alleged firing. In that point of view, it would most certainly be evidence\u2014 that is to say, the Commonwealth can show the conduct of -the defendant both before the offence was committed and after \u2014 show his conduct of a nature bearing upon the question of the act alleged; they can show his declarations before, his admissions afterwards ; and, if they can show, by any evidence either before or afterwards, a purpose in the mind <em>&gt;of </em>the defendant to destroy this building, that would be competent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-10\">Verdict: Guilty in manner and form as .indicted, and after a motion for a new trial was discharged, the prisoner was sentenced, when he took this writ, assigning for errPr, inter alia, the admission of the above testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-11\"><em>A.

That this proposed testimony in one of its parts, upon a possible construction of the facts, pointed to a renewed attempt by Kramer to fire the building or indicated preparation therefor, did not render-the offer inadmissible. \u201c It is admissible to produc\u00e9 evidence of a distinct crime .to prove <em>scienter </em>or to make out the <em>res gestee, </em>or to exhibit a chain of circumstantial evidence of guilt in respect to the act chargedWhart.

The assign--men't most relied on,, the third, is not sustained. The offer ivas not *to prove an independent offence on the trial of a \u00f3ase having no connection with it, as in Shaffner <em>v. </em>'Commonwealth, 20 P. F. .Smith \u2022 60,.but it'ay as to prove acts immediately after the first attempt 'to burn the hotel, which tended to show a guilty purpose in Kramer\u2019s mind, such as Avould mak.e it quite probable that he was the same' person Avho had made the former attempt. It was a circumstance in the chain of proof. . The fact that it indicated an attempt to fire the building again did not w\u00e9aken the proof of purpose, because if accomplished, it Avould be a distinct offence. . The'purpose of the first attempt failed because of the extinguishment of the fire, and though it had burned sufficiently to constitute the offence of arson as a complete crime, yet the purpose Avas not complete, for that Avas to consume the building entirely. Being saved, it was clearly the subject of a r\u00e9neAved purpose, and the evidence of this reneAved purpose tended strongly to show that the person Avas the same who made both attempts,-.. The language of the opinion in Shaffner <em>v. </em>CommonAvealth, is directly in favor of this view. It is there said: \u201cto make one criminal act evidence of another, a connection between them must have existed in the mind of the actor, linking them together for some'.purpose h\u00e9 intended to accomplish ; or it must be necessary to identify the person of the actor, by a connection which shows that, he who committed the one must have done the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-I5\">Sentence affirmed -and the record remitted for execution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
