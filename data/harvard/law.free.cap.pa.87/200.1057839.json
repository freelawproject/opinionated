Gallagher, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-16\">/Robert C. Gallagher died in 1872, leaving a will, wherein he made certain provisions for his widow, Jane Gallagher, devised certain real estate to his sister, Sophia Oswald, and bequeathed all the residue of his estate, excepting certain specific legacies, to his nephews and nieces, in proportions named therein. There was no issue of Robert C. and Jane Gallagher, and the widow refused to accept the provisions of the will and claimed the one-half of the real estate for life, under the intestate law. The value of the widow\u2019s interest in the land devised to Sophia Oswald was $1000, or $60 per annum, and in the distribution of the estate she^claimed that a fund sufficient to raise $60 should be set apart retained, so that she might enjoy the property devised to her free frpm any encumbrance, as she contended the testator intended she should.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-17\">The court, Junkin, P. J., made a decree that the assets should be marshalled, and that an amount sufficient to make her whole should be taken from the residuary legatees and devisees, and in an opinion said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-18\">\u201c It is certain that testator intended that his sister should enjoy in fee the real estate devised to her, and it is equally certain that she was among the first objects of the testator\u2019s bounty ; and that she is restricted in the enjoyment of her devise is apparent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-19\">\u201c The case is novel, in this, that the encumbrance did not exist in the testator\u2019s lifetime, nor was it created by him. It springs out of a right which he could not control, is a mere encumbrance, leaving the fee simple in the devisee. It is not a debt created by the testator, nor a lien which his personal estate is bound to discharge. It is an estate in the land itself, and can such a charge be removed? In principle, how does a dower charge differ from a mortgage, or any other charge which defeats the enjoyment of the lands devised, or subjects the devisee to the expense of removing it ? Such a charge (mortgage or judgment), where it is the debt of the testator, would be paid out of the residuary estate at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>expense of the residuary legatees, unless the testator has directed otherwise.-? But this rule does not apply as between devisees (all devises are specific), and specific legatees, as see O\u2019Neal <em>v. </em>Mead, 1 P. Wms. 694; Tipping <em>v. </em>Tipping, 1 Id. 730; Long <em>v. </em>Short, 1 Id. 403; Hoff\u2019s Appeal, 12 Harris 200, 206. This last case is authority for the proposition that a lien on devised land will be discharged out of the residuary fund; so is Long <em>v. </em>Short, 1 P. Wms. 403. [_But should this principle fail in its application to this estate, there remains the general rule, as laid down in Sandoe\u2019s Appeal, 15 P. F. Smith 314, to wit: 1. Where a widow elects not to take under a will, her substituted devises and bequests are a trust in her, for the benefit of the disappointed claimants, to the amount of their interest therein : 2. A court of equity will sequester the benefit intended for the wife to secure compensation to those whom her election disappoints. Then add the general rule, that specific legatees and devisees shall be first satisfied, and any deficiency or loss must fall upon the residuary legatees, and we think this question is decided. Sophia Oswald, as a devisee of the half lot and house, is deprived of one-half the benefits of the devise while the widow lives, and the rule requires that she be made whole, at the expense of the residuary legatees, and we must marshal the assets to effect that result. ,._</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">From the foregoing decree this appeal was taken7?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-7\"><em>Edmund S.

It was not encumbered by any debt of the devisor. Jane Gallagher, the widow, had an estate in the land devised, which vested the instant that her husband, the testator, died, and the devisee took the land subject thereto. The interest of the widow is not payable out of the personal estate of the decedent in relief of the devisee: Hoff\u2019s Appeal, 12 Harris 200. The statutory interest of the widow is not like dower at common law ; it is an estate in the land: Gourley <em>v. </em>Kinley, 16 P. F. Smith 270. It is not a lien on the land: Schall\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 170.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-8\">No paper-book nor oral argument <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AR3\">June 3d 1878,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered</p>\n<author id=\"Aqv\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">We discover no substantial error in this case.
