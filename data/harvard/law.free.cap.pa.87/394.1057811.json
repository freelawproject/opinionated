Watson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4s\">It is not alleged that O\u2019Neill ever requested the bank to sell the stock, or ever offered to sell it for them; or that the bank, in any shape, manner or form, contributed to the accident which caused a depreciation in the value of the stock. It is not alleged that O\u2019Neill, if he had himself held the stock, would have sold it at such a ruinous discount, nor would any man of ordinary prudence or care do so. The beneficial interest was in the defendant, subject to a mortgage or pledge to the plaintiffs, and remained at the risk of the defendant.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AYT\">October 21st 1878,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered</p>\n<author id=\"b395-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqh0\">The negligence of the plaintiff in this case was simply delay, prompted by no notice, or any fact to indicate to him a necessity to sell the collateral, not only for his own benefit but for that of his debtor; and the cause of loss was an accident unforeseen, and not likely to be foreseen. The stock itself was at its par value for the $5000, while its market value was but about $1400. Had the plaintiff sold the stock without notice to or from the defendant, it might have raised a serious question as to the plaintiff\u2019s liability for the sacrifice. It was in the power of the defendant to have caused a sale by the plaintiff at any time, or else to hold the stock at his own risk. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
