The insurance was effected through Adam Becker, a sub-agent, who held his appointment from George Dart, who was the general agent of the company in this state. Roth died May 12th 1871, and on the 4th of October 1871 his wife took out letters of administration and brought this suit, which came on for trial in 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-13\">At the trial, before White, A.

The defendant\u2019s counsel objected, and the court admitted the testimony for the reason given for admitting that of the former witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-12\">The witness then proceeded to state what in substance was testified to by the preceding witness, Weidman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-13\">The court, inter alia, charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-14\">\u201c You will probably be satisfied from the evidence that Adam Becker and John Spieler were guilty of a fraud upon the estate of John Roth, by receiving and appropriating to their own use the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ceeds of the policy; and also guilty of a fraud upon the defendant company, by pretending that John Spieler was a bona fide assignee for value of the policy. The evidence would indicate that John Spieler was a tool in the hands of Becker; that he was not a bona fide assignee, hut signed all the papers Becker presented him, with an understanding that he was to be paid a part of the proceeds. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">\u201c But if the defendant company, or its general agent, Dart, had not actual knowledge that the assignment to Spieler was fraudulent, but had knowledge of such suspicious facts and circumstances as would have put a man of ordinary prudence upon inquiry, when the fraud might have been discovered, and they did not inquire into the matter, the payment to Spieler, or Becker for him, will not protect the company. If the facts and circumstances known to the company, or to Dart, their general agent, created a reasonable suspicion that something was fraudulent or wrong about the assignment, such a suspicion that a man of ordinary prudence would have refused to pay the money until he had satisfied himself it was right, it would have been the duty of the company, before paying over the money to the assignee, to have inquired into the facts of the case; and if they paid over the money without such inquiry when, if made, the fraud might have been discovered, they cannot now set up such payment as a defence to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">\u201c The plaintiff cannot recover unless, 1.

W. Aeheson, </em>for plaintiff in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-g\">All connection between Adam Becker and the plaintiff in error had ceased long prior to the trial of the case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Becker and Speiler, in October 1873. He was then an entire stranger to the insurance company. His testimony at that trial and his private statements to Mr. Gilmore, shortly before the criminal trial, were merely narratives of a past transaction, and we submit were clearly inadmissible: Huntingdon Railroad <em>v. </em>Decker, 1 Norris 119; Fawcett <em>v. </em>Bigley, 9 P. F. Smith 411; Bigley <em>v. </em>Williams, 30 Id. 107 ; Benford <em>v. </em>Sanner, 4 Wright 10; Tassey v. Church, 4 W. &amp; S. 141; 2 Wharton on Ev., sect. 1206 ; 1 Greenlief on Ev., sect. 111. The primary question in the cause, was whether the alleged fraud had been committed. It was essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case that the fraud should be established, and so the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>court ultimately charged. The evidence offered was the only evidence which tended to show it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-6\">The papers made out Spieler\u2019s right to the money, and on their face, were a complete justification of the company\u2019s settlement with him. Every presumption was in the company\u2019s favor, and to negative that presumption, the defect relied on was that when Roth signed his name, the assignment was in blank, and Spieler\u2019s name was written in after Roth\u2019s death, and the evidence to establish this consisted of statements made by Adam Becker two years after the company had settled the loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-7\">Had it ever so clearly appeared by competent evidence that Roth executed the assignment in blank, it by no means follows that the assignment would be null and void if Roth delivered to Spieler or to Becker the policy so assigned in blank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-8\">Instruments signed in blank and having the names afterwards inserted are valid: Stahl <em>v. </em>Berger, 10 S. &amp; R. 170 ; Seigfried <em>v. </em>Levan, 6 Id. 310 ; Wiley <em>v. </em>Moor, 17 Id. 438; Costen\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 292; Building Association <em>v. </em>Sendmeyer, 14 Wright 67.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-9\"><em>J.

Plow can this be done ?]</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-11\">The power to pay losses rested in Becker. The money was paid to him and he kept it. The claim, therefore, that he is no longer their agent does not release the compfeny. The money in the custody of Becker was in the custody of the company. If the money was paid to him and he was authorized to pay it to the party entitled thereto, and he knew that Spieler had no insurable interest in this contract can the company be relieved of this act of its agent ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-12\">[Asnbw, C. J. \u2014 The question is whether the act of the agent was within the line of his authority.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-13\">He attested the assignment, and we claim that this fraud brings the case within the ruling of the above authorities cited, and the doors should be thrown open.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-14\">[Sharswood, J. \u2014 If his evidence relates to a past transaction.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-15\">It all relates to a continued transaction.

Without something to show that the case was, in fact, not as it appeared by this paper; that a fraud had been perpetrated upon Roth\u2019s estate by the insertion of Spieler\u2019s name into the assignment after Roth\u2019s death, and that of this the defendant had notice before payment of the money, the plaintiff has no standing to maintain this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">In order to the establishment of a condition of affairs, such as above indicated, the court admitted proof of the declarations of Adam Becker, the sub-agent of the defendant, through whom the risk was taken, that the assignment had been executed in blank, and that he had subsequently to Roth\u2019s death inserted Spieler\u2019s name as assignee of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">To this ruling of the court the defendant excepted, and gave as reasons therefor the following: First, these declarations were not made by Becker at a time when he was acting as agent of the company in the execution of the policy, but long after that execution, when testifying as a witness in a case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>himself and Spieler. Second, the insertion of Spieler\u2019s name after Roth\u2019s death was an act committed for his own purposes, not in the line of his agency, and, as a consequence, his declarations concerning the same, could not affect the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">The first of these reasons is supported by the cases of Fawcett <em>v. </em>Bigley, 9 P. F. Smith 411, and Bigley <em>v. </em>Williams, 30 Id. 107, in which it is held that the narrative of an agent of a past transaction cannot be received in proof in a suit against the principal; the second is so obviously sound that authority to support it is unnecessary. As between the parties to this suit, the declarations of Becker are the declarations of a stranger to the issue, and can affect the case no more than those of any other third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">It is urged that these declarations were legitimately part of the case, inasmuch as they went to establish the fraud of Becker; it is true, they do tend to prove such fraud, and as against himself, they would be relevant; but this proof is to affect, not him, but the company ; it is the prime factor in the plaintiff\u2019s case, without it she cannot recover, and as it is foreign to the company\u2019s transactions, it must be treated as the proof of any other substantive fact, which requires for its establishment direct evidence, not the declarations of a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">The remaining exceptions are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">The judgment is reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
