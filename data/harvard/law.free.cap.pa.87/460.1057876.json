That there is a fatal vai'iance between the claim and scire facias in this case and the evidence offered to sustain it. The claim is for materials furnished for and about the erection and construction of certain buildings; the proof, so far as it goes, is that materials were furnished for repairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-15\">2. That more than six months having elapsed since the time the materials are alleged to have been furnished, the claim filed cannot be amended, and the plaintiff must stand on the claim as filed, and has failed to prove that any materials were furnished for or about the erection or construction of the building mentioned in the scire facias.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-16\">The court granted a nonsuit and subsequently refused to take it off, which action of the court was assigned for error by the plaintiff, who took this writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-17\"><em>JR.

No amendment had been made, if indeed any could be made, after the expiration of the six months allowed for filing the claim. The scire facias answers as a statement of-claim, and takes the place of a declaration, and being for erection and construction presented a claim for <em>original </em>erection. The evidence for materials furnished was for the <em>repairs </em>of a house already built. It is evident the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>did not agree; <em>non constat </em>that the plaintiff had not a claim for each \u2014 one for construction and the other for repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
