We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Chesarek\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">\u00b63 Chesarek was charged with DUI in the Justice Court. He pleaded not guilty on February 7, 1996, and trial was set for August 7, 1996, approximately 182 days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">\u00b64 On August 5,1996, Chesarek moved to continue the trial date due to his counsel\u2019s unavailability for trial and filed a waiver of his right to a speedy trial for any delay attributable to his requested continuance. The Justice Court rescheduled the trial for December 10 and, on December 5, reset the trial for December 30,1996, <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u00b65 On December 23, 1996, Chesarek moved to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. The Justice Court denied the motion to dismiss, tried Chesarek <em>in absentia </em>and found him guilty of DUI. Sentence and judgment were entered and stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b66 Chesarek timely appealed to the District Court and moved to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court. He argued that his speedy trial rights had been violated twice: first, because the original trial date was in excess of 180 days after the entry of his plea, thereby violating the 6-month time period within which misdemeanor trials must be held under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA; and second, because the State of Montana (State) was responsible for a total of 202 days of pretrial delay prior to the ultimate December 30 trial date, the 6-month limit for trials on misdemeanor charges was exceeded no matter how the statutory 6-month period was calculated. After briefing, the District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b67 A jury subsequently found Chesarek guilty of DUI, the District Court entered sentence and judgment, and Chesarek appeals from the denial of his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Did the District Court err in denying Chesarek\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b68 The District Court did not address Chesarek\u2019s argument that the original trial date was untimely under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, and rejected his second argument, concluding that Chesarek\u2019s motion to continue the original trial date in the Justice Court past the 6-month statutory limit effectively rendered the time limit in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, inapplicable. On that basis, the District Court denied Chesarek\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court. Chesarek asserts that the District Court erred. He reiterates on appeal the same two arguments raised in that court and also advances a third argument under the <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, speedy trial test.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u00b69  Whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Keating </em>(1997), [285 Mont. 463], 949 P.2d 251, 256 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">\u00b610  We recently resolved Chesarek\u2019s first argument on appeal that the original August 7, 1996, trial date in the Justice Court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>not meet the requirements of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, because it was 182 days after the entry of his plea and, therefore, his right to a speedy trial was violated. In State <em>v. Hayes, </em>1998 MT14, [287 Mont. 210], 953 P.2d 700, we interpreted the \u201c6 months\u201d language contained in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, to mean 6 calendar months rather than a specific number of days. <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. More specifically, we determined that the 6-month period set forth in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, begins to run the day after the entry of the plea and expires 6 months later. <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6 8 (citations omitted). Thus, as applied in the present case, the statutory 6-month period began on February 8, 1996 \u2014 the day after Chesarek pleaded not guilty to the DUI charge \u2014 and expired on August 8, 1996. Chesarek\u2019s original trial date of August 7, 1996, fell within that 6-month period and, as a result, we conclude that the original trial date was timely under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, and did not violate Chesarek\u2019s right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b611  In his second argument on appeal, Chesarek contends that \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, remained applicable in the Justice Court notwithstanding his motion for a continuance. Under this theory, Chesarek\u2019s motion for a continuance of the original trial date in the Justice Court merely tolled the running of the statutory 6-month period until December 10, after which it began running again and ran for 20 days before the trial occurred on December 30. Thus, according to Chesarek, the total pretrial delay chargeable to the State was 202 days \u2014 adding the 182 days which ran prior to the original trial date and the 20 days from the December 10 end of his continuance-related speedy trial waiver to the rescheduled trial on December 30 \u2014 and that time exceeds the 6 months allowed for trial of misdemeanor charges under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b612  Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">[a]fter the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">We observe, at the outset, that the 6-month period for trial of a misdemeanor charge is only a general rule under the statute. If \u201cgood cause\u201d can be shown for why the trial was not held within 6 months, the court need not dismiss the case. Moreover, \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, explicitly states that the 6-month time period after which a dismissal is required applies only where a trial \u201chas not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion ....\u201d Here, Chesarek moved for a continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, the expiration of the 6-month period no longer requires dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b6 13 Our cases, while not factually identical, are in accord. In <em>State v. Crane </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 235, 238, 784 P.2d 901, 903, we quoted <em>State v. Ronningen </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 358, 362, 691 P.2d 1348, 1350, in holding that, if a defendant requests the postponement, \u201cthe six-month trial deadline does not apply\u201d and, therefore, the statute has no application. Chesarek cites to no authority to the contrary. Accordingly, we conclude that the generally applicable mandatory dismissal language in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, no longer applied after Chesarek moved to continue the August 7 trial date in the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b614  Finally, Chesarek argues that he was denied his right to a speedy trial under the so-called <em>Barker </em>test enunciated by the United States Supreme Court and adopted by this Court in <em>State ex rel. Briceno v. Dist. Ct. of 13th Jud. Dist., Etc. </em>(1977), 173 Mont. 516, 568 P.2d 162. In this regard, we have carefully examined the District Court record and determined that Chesarek\u2019s <em>Barker </em>argument\u2014 which balances the length of and reason for the delay, assertion of the speedy trial right and prejudice to the defense \u2014 was not presented to the District Court as an alternative basis for his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. His motion was premised entirely on alleged violations of his \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, speedy trial right and, indeed, his brief stated that \u201c[t]here is no balancing test in the lower courts.\u201d A party may not raise an argument for the first time on appeal or change his theory from that advanced in the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. City of Billings </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 341, 347, 927 P.2d 9, 13 (citations omitted); <em>State v. Fisch </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 520, 524,881 P.2d 626, 629 (citation omitted). Therefore, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b615 Having concluded that the first trial date was within the 6-month period required by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, and that the 6-month limitation did not continue to apply after Chesarek\u2019s motion for a continuance, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Chesarek\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
