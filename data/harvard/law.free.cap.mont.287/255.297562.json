We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b62 In 1992, the Harnes entered into a written contract with Deadmond for the construction of a new home in Jefferson County. The contract provided that Deadmond would deliver possession of the home to the Harnes by August 24,1992 and was contingent upon the Harnes\u2019 obtaining financing. The Harnes obtained approval of the financing on July 8,1992 and moved into their substantially complete home on Labor Day weekend. During construction and after taking possession of the home, the Harnes reported several defects in the construction of the home. For example, a glulam beam in the basement was misplaced, a change in the stairway design resulted in less headroom than required by the building code, a living room wall appeared bowed, and the basement flooded as a result of the foundation and drainage design. The Harnes informed Deadmond of the problems and requested that he repair the defects. Deadmond asserted at trial that he responded by ordering the repair of several of the problems. However, the Harnes were unsatisfied with the results and filed suit against Deadmond asserting negligent construction, unfair trade practice in violation of the MCPA, breach of contract, fraud, deceit and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b63 The matter proceeded to trial and after presenting four days of testimony, counsel began closing arguments. Defense counsel opened his argument by discussing the MCPA. He characterized the statutory scheme as having been passed by the Montana legislature to \u201cget the scammers and the swindlers who are preying upon Montana consumers.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to this argument asserting that it was not an appropriate characterization of the law. The court overruled the objection. Defense counsel concluded his argument by asserting that he was representing Deadmond because Deadmond had built a house for his family fifteen years prior and did a good job. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to defense counsel \u201ctestifying\u201d and vouching for the veracity of his client. The District Court overruled the objection, and defense counsel continued to relate his personal experience with Deadmond. After a few minutes, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel interrupted the argument again. This time the court instructed defense counsel that he had gone too far, that his time had expired, and that he must conclude his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b64 The jury returned a verdict in the amount of $7,000 in favor of the Harnes as a result of negligent construction by Deadmond. The jury, however, did not award damages under any of the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>causes of action, including the MCPA. During post-trial motions, Deadmond requested an award of attorney fees as a result of his successful defense of the MCPA cause of action. The District Court entered an amended judgment awarding Deadmond attorney fees in the amount of $11,255. The Harnes appeal from the amended judgment, and the jury verdict. The Harnes present two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">1) Did the improper and prejudicial closing argument by Deadmond\u2019s counsel constitute reversible error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">2) Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees to Deadmond pursuant to the Montana Consumer Protection Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We conclude that the first issue is dispositive and thus do not reach the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b65  Improper argument requires reversal only when prejudice has resulted which prevented a fair trial. <em>Moralli v. Lake County </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 23, 32, 839 P.2d 1287, 1292 (citing <em>Gunnels v. Hoyt </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 265, 276, 633 P.2d 1187, 1194). The Harnes assert that the comments made by defense counsel during closing argument were so improper and prejudicial as to deprive them of a fair trial. The Harnes base their claim of prejudice on two arguments made by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u00b66 First, during jury voir dire, defense counsel, in determining if any of the potential jurors knew him, stated that he served three terms in the Montana House of Representatives, the third year in a leadership position. Defense counsel then was able to tie this legislative experience into his closing argument. He began his argument with a discussion of the Montana Consumer Protection Act. The following discussion took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Let me start by talking about the Consumer Protection Act. ... This is a law passed by the Montana legislature to get the scammers and the swindlers who are preying upon Montana consumers. Okay? It\u2019s passed to get the bait and switchers. It\u2019s passed to get those people who are out preying on, on people and trying to get their business inappropriately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-h\">PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL: Your Honor, that\u2019s not what the law says. So I would object on the basis that it\u2019s not an appropriate representation of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I can argue the law, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">COURT: Yes, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Defense counsel then proceeded to tell the jury about an example he had heard of where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">people were coming through and they were telling elderly people that they were spraying some water coating on their roofs so their roofs wouldn\u2019t leak. And they got up there, and they charged these people; and they sprayed just untreated water on the roof. Okay? That\u2019s an example of scamming the consumer.... And I would just hate to see, if nothing else happens in the jury room, I would hate to see Mr. Deadmond have to have that on his record, that he was convicted of scamming consumers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The Harnes assert that this portion of the closing argument by defense counsel was improper and prejudicial not only as a mischaracterization of the law, but also because it was clothed in defense counsel\u2019s prior representation that he served in the legislature thus lending more credence to his statement as to what the legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b67 As further evidence of the prejudicial effect of these statements by defense counsel, the jury, after it had begun deliberations, sent a note to the court stating \u201c[a]s to Instructions 8, 9, 13, and 14 [the MCPA instructions],we are uncertain what unfair trade practices entail. We need a layman\u2019s term answer.\u201d The only jury instruction which purported to define unfair trade practice was Instruction No. 8. Instruction No. 8 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">You are instructed that, under the Montana Consumer Protection and Unfair Trade Practices Act, an unfair or deceptive trade practice occurs when the injury satisfies three tests: It must be substantial; it must not be outweighed by any counterveiling [sic] benefits to consumers or competition that the practice produces; and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Although Instruction No. 8 addressed the type and scope of injury that must result from an unfair trade practice, it did not directly state what type of practice constitutes an unfair trade practice. Understandably, the jury was confused as to what exactly, in lay terms, constituted an unfair trade practice. Counsel could not agree on a clarification, so the District Court instructed the jurors that they were required to rely on the instructions given and the court would not instruct them further. The jury was thus left with defense counsel\u2019s \u201cscammer and swindler\u201d argument as the only thing approximating a layman\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u00b68  The Harnes also argue that defense counsel obstructed their ability to obtain a fair trial by improperly characterizing the MCPA as a criminal offense by stating that he would hate to see Deadmond have it \u201con his record, that he was convicted of scamming consumers.\u201d The Harnes sought a civil remedy under the MCPA. While Deadmond, if determined to be a violator of the act may have suffered civil penalties pursuant to \u00a7 30-14-142, MCA, or potential damage to his business, Deadmond would not \u201cbe convicted\u201d or have \u201ca record\u201d as defense counsel implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b69  The second alleged prejudicial statement occurred toward the end of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument when the following statements were offered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: About 15 years ago I was a young attorney out of law school. I\u2019d hung out my shingle, and I went to work. And I didn\u2019t make very much money. And my family was growing bigger than my practice was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL: Objection, Your Honor. This is personal testimony not allowed in closing. He\u2019s about to verify the veracity of Mr. Deadmond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">COURT: Oh, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Thank you, Your Honor. And I needed a house. So I went down to a local builder to see if he could build me just a basic square house. And he gave me a price, and it was too much, more than I could afford. Someone told me about Wendell Deadmond. And I looked up Wendell Deadmond and said, \u201cCan you get me a house?\u201d And he drew me a plan and a house that was affordable that I could get into. I\u2019m still living in that house today. I\u2019ve added onto it. And I\u2019ve finished the basement, and my family\u2019s still growing. But I\u2019m living in that house today 12 years later. I\u2019m his attorney today because I was first his customer those many years ago. Did I have defects in the house? Yeah, I did. I called him up. He sent someone out on several times to address this problem and that problem and this problem\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: \u2014and that problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">COURT: Yeah, I think you\u2019re going a little farther\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGU\">PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL: \u2014it is testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">COURT: And your time\u2019s up anyway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The Harnes argue, as they did below, that defense counsel was improperly vouching for the credibility of his client by, in effect, \u201ctestifying\u201d to the jury about his own favorable experience with Deadmond. This Court has not had occasion to examine the effect of counsel testifying regarding his own experience with his client; however, the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct clearly forbid this type of action by an officer of the court unless the attorney is acting as a witness. Rule 3.4, adopted to ensure fairness to the opposing party and counsel, states: \u201cA lawyer shall not... in trial, ... assert personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness, or state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil litigant....\u201d Rule 3.4, M.R.Prof.Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b610  This Court has recognized the importance of Rule 3.4 in the context of a criminal proceeding. In <em>State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 897 P.2d 1063, we held that it is highly improper for the prosecutor to characterize either the defendant or witnesses as liars or offer personal opinions as to credibility. We recognized that when prosecutors make improper comments in the presence of the jury, \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s personal views inject into the case irrelevant and inadmissible matters or a fact not legally proved by the evidence, and add to the probative force of the testimony adduced at the trial the weight of the prosecutors\u2019 personal, professional, or official influence.\u201d <em>Stringer, </em>897 P.2d at 1071-72. As a result, we warned, \u201c[t]his Court has been unequivocal in its admonitions to prosecutors to stop improper comment and we have made it clear that we will reverse a case where counsel invades the province of the jury....\u201d <em>Stringer, </em>897 P.2d at 1072. The same principles apply in the civil context when counsel, using the weight of his personal, professional, or official influence, improperly offers his opinion as to the justness of a cause or the credibility of a witness, particularly when the witness is his own client. Defense counsel\u2019s arguments to the jury in the present case violated the clear prohibition of Rule 3.4 and resulted in unfairness to the Harnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b611 Civil cases reviewing misconduct by counsel, including improper statements during closing argument, have focused on whether the misconduct was cured by an instruction from the court. In <em>Gunnels v. Hoyt, </em>defense counsel, during closing arguments, improperly alluded to evidence not in the record. We determined that the subsequent instructions given by the district court prevented any prejudice that may have resulted to the plaintiff. <em>Gunnels, </em>633 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>at 1194. We further concluded that the misconduct of defense counsel did not rise to the level of reversible error. <em>Gunnels, </em>633 P.2d at 1195. Similarly, in <em>Moralli, </em>we held that misconduct by plaintiff\u2019s counsel was \u201csufficiently cured by the District Court\u2019s instruction regarding the comment.\u201d <em>Moralli, </em>839 P.2d at 1293. In this case, however, the District Court did not admonish or otherwise instruct the jury not to consider the improper arguments made by defense counsel. As a result, the jury was left to consider the improper arguments. We conclude that the arguments made by defense counsel were improper, prejudicial, and constitute reversible error. Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
