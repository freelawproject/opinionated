Millhollin (Millhollin) appeals from the judgment entered by the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Rosebud County, on its order granting the motion for summary judgment filed by The Conveyor Company (TCC) and denying his summary judgment motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that TCC did not breach its contract with Millhollin and in granting TCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">\u00b63 Millhollin invented a device for aligning conveyor belts which he called a Conveyor Belt Return Training Device (Belt Trapper). He applied for a United States patent for the invention in 1991, and the patent was issued on April 27, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">\u00b64 In 1992, Millhollin and TCC entered into an Agreement regarding the Belt Trapper. Millhollin granted TCC the exclusive right to make, use and sell the Belt Trapper in both the United States and foreign countries and, in return, TCC agreed to pay Millhollin a royalty on each Belt Trapper it sold, plus a percentage of the price of all replacement parts and accessories it sold, with a guaranteed minimum payment to Millhollin in each of the first five years covered by the Agreement. During both the United States patent application process and the negotiation of the Agreement, Millhollin was represented by Bozeman attorney Richard Conover (Conover).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00b65 Article VI of the Agreement gave TCC the right to pursue additional patent applications, both foreign and domestic, at its own expense. In the event TCC chose not to file any patent applications, Millhollin retained the right to do so at his own expense. The Agreement further required TCC to assign any patent applications it filed to Millhollin.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b66 TCC decided to file foreign patent applications for the Belt Trapper in Europe and Canada. It requested Conover to file the applications because of his familiarity with the earlier United States patent application. Conover filed the requested European and Canadian patent applications and TCC paid the fees and expenses he incurred. Eventually, however, TCC decided to use a different attorney to pursue the foreign patent applications because it believed the fees and expenses charged by Conover were too high. TCC informed Conover of its decision to terminate his services via a letter which also stated that a check for the balance due him was being sent to its corporate attorney, Robert Dwyer (Dwyer), who would forward the check to Conover after TCC received all of the files pertaining to the foreign patent applications from Conover. Acting on instructions from Millhollin, Conover refused to turn the patent application files over to TCC. As a result, Dwyer did not forward payment for the remainder of Conover\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b67 Millhollin subsequently sent TCC a written notice of default which asserted that TCC was in breach of Article VI of the Agreement by failing to pay the expenses incurred in its pursuit of the foreign patent applications; the notice gave TCC 30 days to remedy the alleged breach by paying Conover\u2019s bill in full. Because the patent application files still had not been received from Conover, TCC did not make payment within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b68 Thereafter, Millhollin declared that the Agreement was terminated, pursuant to Article XII, and filed this declaratory judgment action requesting the District Court to declare that the Agreement was properly terminated. He also requested an award of damages, including reimbursement of the amount he paid Conover for the patent application-related expenses which TCC had not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b69 TCC and Millhollin both moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted TCC\u2019s motion and denied Millhollin\u2019s, concluding that TCC had not breached the Agreement and that, even if a breach had occurred, it was not sufficiently material to justify termination of the Agreement. Judgment was entered and Millhollin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b610  We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo, </em>using the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria as the district court. <em>Clark v. Eagle Systems, Inc. </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 279, 283, 927 P.2d 995, 997 (citations omitted). Pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P, the moving party must establish, in light of the pleadings and other evidence before the court, the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Clark, </em>927 P.2d at 997-98 (citations omitted). Only when this initial burden has been met must the nonmoving party come forward with evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Clark, </em>927 P.2d at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b6 11  Ordinarily, our review in summary judgment cases begins with a determination of whether the moving party established the absence of disputed and material fact issues. <em>See, e.g., Montana Metal Buildings, Inc. v. Shapiro </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 471, 475, 942 P.2d 694, 696-97. Here, however, Millhollin does not contend that a genuine issue of material fact exists. He argues only that the District Court erred in concluding that TCC did not breach the Agreement and that it was entitled to summary judgment on that basis. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Albright v. State, by and through State </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 196, 205, 933 P.2d 815, 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in concluding that TCC did not breach its contract with Millhollin and in granting TCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that basis?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\u00b613 In concluding that TCC did not breach the Agreement, the District Court determined that Article VI of the Agreement granted TCC the primary right to pursue the foreign patent applications, which right necessarily included the right to possession of the files created by an attorney, at TCC\u2019s expense and direction, during the patent application process. On that basis, the District Court concluded that TCC \u201chad the right to legally tender payment to attorney Conover conditioned on receipt of the files for which it had paid\u201d and that this conditional tender of payment was not a breach of the Agreement between TCC and Millhollin.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">\u00b614  Millhollin raises several arguments in support of his overall contention that the District Court\u2019s conclusions were erroneous. He first argues that TCC\u2019s tender of payment was not legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>sufficient to avoid breaching the Agreement because a tender of payment in fulfillment of a contractual obligation cannot be qualified or conditional. His underlying legal premise, however, is incorrect. A tender of payment may be conditional as long as the attached condition is one on which the tenderer has the right to insist. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-1-1211, MCA; <em>Advance-Rumely Thresher Co., Inc. v. Hess </em>(1929), 85 Mont. 293, 301, 279 P. 236, 238; 74 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Tender </em>\u00a7 24 (1974). Thus, whether TCC\u2019s conditional tender of payment to Conover was sufficient to avoid breaching the Agreement depends on whether TCC had the right to insist that Conover deliver the patent application files to TCC, and this question leads directly to Millhollin\u2019s second assertion of error regarding the District Court\u2019s conclusion that TCC did not breach the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b615 Millhollin asserts that, as the inventor of the Belt Trapper, he retains complete ownership of the invention, the patent applications and the patent application files and, because of his sole ownership, TCC had no right to possession of the files. Thus, he contends that TCC did not have the right to insist on delivery of the foreign patent application files as a condition of its paying the outstanding fees and expenses related thereto and, as a result, TCC\u2019s conditional tender of payment was not sufficient to avoid breaching the Agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b616  Prior to obtaining a patent on an invention, an inventor possesses inchoate rights to the exclusive use of the invention and to apply for a patent thereon. <em>Hendrie v. Sayles </em>(1878), 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 546, 551, 25 L.Ed. 176, 178; <em>Gayler v. Wilder </em>(1850), 51 U.S. (10 How.) 466, 467, 13 L.Ed. 504, 511. Once obtained, a patent confers upon the patentee the right to exclude others from manufacturing, using or selling the invention during the life of the patent. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154; <em>Bell Intercontinental Corp. v. United States </em>(Ct. Cl. 1967), 381 F.2d 1004, 1010. A patent has the attributes of personal property and is owned by the holder of the patent. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 261; <em>see, also, Cammeyer v. Newton </em>(1876), 94 U.S. (4 Otto) 225, 226, 24 L.Ed. 72, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"AsFM\">\u00b617  However, an inventor may assign ownership of an invention, a patent or a patent application to another. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 261; <em>Kenyon v. Automatic Instrument Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1947), 160 F.2d 878, 882. For an agreement to constitute an assignment granting ownership title to an invention or patent, it must confer on the assignee the rights to make, use and sell the invention. <em>Kenyon, </em>160 F.2d at 882. In other words, the agreement must indicate the inventor\u2019s intent to transfer all of his pr her substantial rights in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>invention to the assignee. <em>Bell Intercontinental, </em>381 F.2d at 1011. A transfer by the inventor of anything less than the full rights to make, use and sell an invention constitutes only a license and does not give the licensee any ownership title in the invention or patent. <em>Kenyon, </em>160 F.2d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b6 18  Millhollin asserts that his Agreement with TCC is merely a license granting TCC the right to use the Belt Trapper, rather than an assignment transferring ownership of the invention and related patents to TCC. We note that Millhollin refers to the Agreement as the \u201cLicense Agreement\u201d in an attempt to buttress his argument. However, the document at issue here is clearly entitled \u201cAgreement\u201d and not \u201cLicense Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b6[19  Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">whether the transfer of an interest or right under a patent is an assignment or a license, does not depend upon the name by which it is called, but upon the legal effect of its provisions. No particular form is required for an assignment but the instrument of transfer must be unambiguous and show a clear and unmistakable intent to part with the patent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\"><em>Kenyon, </em>160 F.2d at 882 (citing <em>Waterman v. MacKenzie </em>(1891), 138 U.S. 252, 256, 11 S.Ct. 334, 335, 34 L.Ed. 923, 925-26). Thus, a contract which conveys the right to make, use and sell an invention for the entire term of the patent is an assignment vesting title to the entire patent in the assignee without regard to its heading as a \u201clicense contract.\u201d <em>Kenyon, </em>160 F.2d at 883. Consequently, Millhollin\u2019s references to the Agreement as a \u201cLicense Agreement\u201d do not establish that it created a license rather than an assignment of title; nor does the fact that the Agreement itself repeatedly refers to the \u201cLicensed Product\u201d establish that it is a mere license. Rather, the extent of the rights conferred under the Agreement is determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"AL5\">\u00b620  While language in an agreement by which an inventor grants exclusive rights to make, use and sell an invention is the primary indicator of an inventor\u2019s intent to assign ownership of an invention or patent, there are additional factors which are indicative of an intent to assign ownership. For example, an inventor\u2019s conveyance of the right to sue patent infringers is a fundamental characteristic of an assignment. <em>Sybron Transition v. Nixon, Hargrave, et al. </em>(W.D.N.Y. 1991), 770 F.Supp. 803, 808 (citing <em>Waterman, </em>138 U.S. at 255, 11 S.Ct. at 335). A transfer of the right to manufacture, use and sell an invention for the full term of the patent on that invention, rather than a transfer for a period less than the remaining life of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>patent, also is indicative an assignment rather than a mere license to use. <em>Bell Intercontinental, </em>381 F.2d at 1020. Further, an agreement which does not allow the grantor to terminate at will prior to the expiration of the patent indicates that the grantor intends an assignment of the invention or patent. <em>Bell Intercontinental, </em>381 F.2d at 1022. Retention by the grantor of the right to terminate the agreement upon the grantee\u2019s default or the occurrence of some other subsequent event beyond the grantor\u2019s control, however, is not inconsistent with an assignment of ownership. <em>Bell Intercontinental, </em>381 F.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b621 With these considerations in mind, we examine the Agreement here to determine the extent of the rights conferred by Millhollin to TCC. Of primary note is Article II of the Agreement, where Millhollin \u201chereby grants to [TCC] the exclusive rights to make, use and sell the [Belt Trapper] in the United States and throughout the world.\u201d The Agreement also provides, in Article VII, that the Agreement will \u201ccontinue in effect until the last patent... obtained anywhere in the world and covering the [Belt Trapper] expires.\u201d Along the same lines, Article XI grants TCC the rights to bring patent infringement lawsuits, to have exclusive control over prosecuting infringement suits and to retain all proceeds resulting from any infringement suits. Finally, the Agreement provides that it may not be terminated by either Millhollin or TCC except upon a failure by the other party to fulfill obligations under the Agreement or upon the occurrence of either of two specified events which are not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b622 Millhollin\u2019s grant to TCC of the exclusive right to make, use and sell the Belt Trapper for the entire term of any patents on the invention, combined with the grant of the right to bring patent infringement suits and Millhollin\u2019s failure to retain a right to terminate the Agreement at his discretion, manifests an intent by Millhollin to \u201csurrender all his substantial rights to the invention\u201d and assign those rights to TCC. <em>See Bell Intercontinental, </em>381 F.2d at 1011. Indeed, in <em>Bell Intercontinental, </em>one of the agreements at issue contained provisions nearly identical to the Agreement here in that it granted the exclusive right to manufacture, use and sell the invention, the agreement was to continue until the expiration of the last patent that might issue on the invention, the grantee had the right to bring patent infringement suits and retain any recovery from such suits, and the grantor had no unilateral right to terminate the agreement. <em>Bell Intercontinental, </em>381 F.2d at 1011-13. There, the United States Court of Claims determined that the grantor had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>divested itself of all control and ownership in the invention and assigned ownership of the invention to the grantee for the life of all patents issued thereon. <em>Bell Intercontinental, </em>381 F.2d at 1013. Here, based on the terms of the Agreement before us, we conclude that Millhollin similarly assigned his ownership of the Belt Trapper to TCC.</p>\n<p id=\"AK3\">\u00b623  Millhollin\u2019s assignment to TCC of the ownership of the Belt Trapper has two significant results. First, when ownership rights to an invention are assigned prior to obtaining a patent thereon, the assignee will receive the legal title to the patent when it is subsequently issued. <em>Filmtec Corp. v. Allied-Signal, Inc. </em>(Fed. Cir. 1991), 939 F.2d 1568, 1572 (citing <em>Gayler, </em>51 U.S. at 467). Thus, when the United States patent on the Belt Trapper was granted in April of 1993, legal title to that patent vested in TCC. Additionally, Millhollin\u2019s assignment to TCC of his entire interest in the Belt Trapper carried with it the inchoate right to file patent applications on the invention, even absent any corresponding provision in the Agreement. <em>See Toner v. Sobelman </em>(E.D. Pa. 1949), 86 F.Supp. 369, 380 (citations omitted). Consequently, Millhollin has not only assigned ownership of the Belt Trapper to TCC, he has also divested himself of control and ownership of the patents and patent applications related to the Belt Trapper.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b624  As additional support for his argument that he retained complete ownership of the Belt Trapper, the patents and the patent applications, Millhollin points out that Article VI, Paragraph B of the Agreement provides that all patent applications filed by TCC shall be assigned to Millhollin. However, the fact that the patent applications \u201cshall be assigned\u201d to him does not support his assertion that he \u201cretained\u201d ownership of the patent applications. Rather, the term \u201cshall be assigned\u201d connotes a present ownership of the applications in TCC and only a future ownership in Millhollin. Indeed, the patent applications had not been assigned to Millhollin at the time the dispute at issue here arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b625 Millhollin\u2019s argument in this regard is also unpersuasive in light of Article XII, Paragraph D of the Agreement, which provides that, in the event the Agreement is terminated as a result of a default by TCC, TCC shall assign to Millhollin, among other things, all patents and patent applications pertaining to the Belt Trapper. Again, the provision that TCC \u201cshall assign\u201d the patent applications to Millhollin implies that TCC is the present owner of the applications. Absent an assignment to Millhollin, TCC retains its ownership interest in, and control over the prosecution of, the patent applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u00b626 We conclude that the terms of the Agreement between TCC and Millhollin constituted an assignment to TCC of the ownership rights in the patent applications at issue here and that TCC accordingly maintained full control over the manner in which the applications were pursued. As a result, Millhollin\u2019s argument that TCC had no right to insist on possession of the application files, based on his erroneous assertion that he owned the patent applications and related files, fails. On this basis, we further conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that TCC had the right to tender payment to Conover conditioned on Conover delivering possession of the application files to which it was entitled to TCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\u00b627 Most of Millhollin\u2019s remaining arguments in support of his assertions of error by the District Court are premised on his flawed contention that he maintained ownership of the patent applications and related files. As a result of our conclusion that Millhollin has assigned ownership of the Belt Trapper, the existing United States patent and all patent applications to TCC, we need not address those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b628 Millhollin\u2019s final argument is that the application files could not be turned over to Dwyer, TCC\u2019s corporate attorney, without Millhollin\u2019s permission because transferring the files would have created a serious conflict of interest for Dwyer. Millhollin contends that, if the files were given to Dwyer to complete the patent application process, Dwyer would be required to act in a dual representative capacity as an attorney for both TCC and Millhollin, which could not be allowed without Millhollin\u2019s consent. Millhollin did not raise this argument in the District Court and, as a result, we decline to address it on appeal. <em>See Matter of R.B.O. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 272, 283, 921 P.2d 268, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b629 We conclude that Millhollin has failed to establish any error in the District Court\u2019s determination that TCC had the right to tender payment of the amount due to Conover conditioned on Conover delivering possession of the patent application files to TCC. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in concluding that TCC did not breach the Agreement with Millhollin and in granting TCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
