We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Hayes\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court based on its interpretation of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\u00b63 Hayes was charged with DUI in the Justice Court. He pleaded not guilty on May 28,1996, and trial was set for November 27, 1996. On the day before trial, Hayes moved to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. He argued that the 6-month period for trial of a misdemeanor charge set forth in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, should be calculated as 180 days and, under such a calculation, his right to a speedy trial had been violated. The Justice Court denied the motion, tried Hayes <em>in absentia, </em>found him guilty of DUI and entered sentence and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\u00b64 Hayes timely appealed to the District Court and moved to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in the Justice Court. After briefing, the District Court denied the motion. Hayes subsequently pleaded guilty to the DUI charge, reserving his right to appeal the speedy trial issue. The District Court entered judgment and Hayes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in denying Hayes\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial in Justice Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b66 The District Court rejected Hayes\u2019 argument that the statutory speedy trial period should be interpreted to mean 180 calendar days, concluding that the \u201c6 months\u201d set forth in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, means that a misdemeanor charge generally must be tried within 6 months. On that basis, it denied Hayes\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b67  Whether a defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights have been violated is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Keating </em>(1997), [285 Mont. 463], 949 P.2d 251, 256 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b68 Under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, a misdemeanor charge ordinarily must be dismissed if \u201cnot brought to trial within 6 months\u201d after the entry of a plea. We previously have held that the statutory 6-month period begins to run on the day following the event which triggers the running of the time limitation and expires 6 months later. <em>See State v. Belgarde </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 500, 507, 798 P.2d 539, 544 (citing State <em>v. Ronningen </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 358, 691 P.2d 1348). Applying that interpretation to the facts of this case, the 6-month time period began to run on May 29,1996 \u2014 the day after Hayes pleaded not guilty \u2014 and expired November 29, 1996 \u2014 6 months later. Hayes\u2019 trial was scheduled for, and held on, November 27, 1996, and, as such, the trial was timely for purposes of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b69 Hayes argues, however, that <em>Belgarde </em>and <em>Ronningen </em>did not specifically focus on the definition of \u201c6 months\u201d as that time period is set forth in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. He suggests that other cases refer to a precise number of days, rather than 6 months, and contends that those cases support his \u201cmore logical\u201d position that 6 months means 180 days, calculated as 6 months containing 30 days each. His arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">\u00b610 It is technically accurate to say that we did not specifically focus on the meaning of the \u201c6 months\u201d language contained in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, in <em>Belgarde </em>or <em>Ronningen. </em>The reason, however, is relatively clear. We interpret statutes by declaring what is contained therein; we do not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, says \u201c6 months.\u201d It does not say 180 days or 6 months of 30 days each, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>and we may not delete the language used and substitute other language. Given the number of statutes in which the legislature has chosen to state a time period in days rather than in months, it is abundantly clear that, when the legislature desires to do so, it is aware of how to accomplish that goal. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-13-110, 46-14-202, and 46-15-323, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b6 11 Moreover, we interpret statutes according to the plain meaning of the language used. <em>State v. Gatts </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 42, 47, 928 P.2d 114, 117 (citation omitted). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1007 (6th ed. 1990) defines \u201cmonth\u201d as \u201ccalendar month [;]\u201d it clarifies that \u201cmonth\u201d means the time from any day of a month in the calendar to the corresponding day of the next month. Thus, for example, 1 month would be from the 29th day of May to the 29th day of June. Correspondingly, 6 months would be from the 29th day of May to the 29th day of November. We conclude that the \u201c6 months\u201d language in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, means 6 calendar months.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b612 Nor are the cases on which Hayes relies of any help to him here. As discussed above, we have not heretofore technically defined the meaning of \u201c6 months\u201d as contained in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. Therefore, any earlier discussion of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, in terms of number of days is superseded by our conclusion above that 6 months means 6 calendar months. Moreover, the only \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, case to which Hayes cites in this regard is <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 139, 822 P.2d 1086. There, while we observed that 142 days had elapsed between the arrest and the original trial date in the justice court, our holding was that \u201cthe State has met its burden of showing why Nelson was not tried in Justice Court within the six months allowed under [the statute] <em>.\u2019\u2019Nelson, </em>822 P.2d at 1088. <em>Nelson </em>is not authority for defining the statutory period as being comprised of a certain number of days. The remainder of the speedy trial cases advanced by Hayes involved speedy trial issues in the district courts, rather than in the justice courts, and we analyze those cases under the 4-part speedy trial test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 523, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2188, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, 112-13, not the 6-month statutory period. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bartnes </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 522, 527, 764 P.2d 1271, 1274. \u00b6 13 Finally, we note \u2014 and reject \u2014 Hayes\u2019 argument that it is \u201cmore logical\u201d that the statutory \u201c6 months\u201d means 180 days, calculated as 6 30-day months, than that it means 6 calendar months. The Gregorian calendar commonly used in the United States and Montana contains 12 calendar months of unequal numbers of days. Only 4 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>those months \u2014 September, April, June and November \u2014 contain 30 days. Seven other months contain 31 days, and February contains either 28 or 29 days depending on which year it is in. Given that only one-third of the calendar months in the year contains 30 days, there is little \u201clogic\u201d in Hayes\u2019 argument that 6 months means 180 days calculated as 6 30-day months.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b6 14  The District Court having correctly concluded that the \u201c6 months\u201d contained in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, means 6 months and not 180 days, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Hayes\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
