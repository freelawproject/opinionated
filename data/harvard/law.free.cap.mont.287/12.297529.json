Specifically, he appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial following testimony which violated an order <em>in limine. </em>We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Partin\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The State of Montana (State) charged Partin with committing the offense of forgery by allegedly altering the payee line of a check to include his name, signing the back of the check, and cashing it. Prior to trial, Partin\u2019s counsel orally moved the District Court <em>in limine </em>to exclude expected testimony from the State regarding other crimes or acts based on the State\u2019s failure to provide Partin with a <em>Just </em>notice of intent to use such evidence. In particular, the motion sought to preclude any reference to the fact that certain handwriting samples were on file at the Billings Police Department due to a prior arrest of Partin. The State did not oppose the motion and, indeed, assured the District Court it did not intend to go into Partin\u2019s criminal history or record. The prosecutor also stated that she had spoken to Detective Dave Comfort, the State\u2019s handwriting expert, about avoiding any mention of Partin\u2019s prior arrest during his testimony comparing the writing on the check at issue to prior handwriting samples from Partin, and that she would stop him should he begin to verge into such \u201cprior crimes\u201d testimony. The District Court granted the motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">At trial, Ron Hill (Hill) testified that he had written, and mailed, the check at issue to AAA Drywall in September of 1995. He further testified that the payee line of the check had been altered to include \u201c/W. Partin.\u201d He stated that, in response to notification by AAA Drywall that it had not received the check, he called the bank to stop payment on the check and was informed that the check had already been cashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The bank teller who cashed the check testified that she did not remember the transaction, but that her teller stamp on the check indicated she had cashed it on September 9, 1995. She also had written a social security number on the check, reflecting that she had seen some form of identification containing the customer\u2019s social security number and signature. According to the teller, the identification may have been, but was not necessarily, a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">After being qualified as an expert in handwriting analysis, Detective Comfort testified that he had compared both the added writing on the payee line and the signature on the back of the check with several handwriting samples provided by Partin, two of which had been admitted into evidence. The State then asked Detective Comfort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>to identify the source of other handwriting samples he had used for his analysis and he responded that they were fingerprint cards from Partin\u2019s previous arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Detective Comfort\u2019s statement regarding the prior arrest violated the District Court\u2019s grant of the motion <em>in limine </em>and constituted other crimes evidence. Out of the jury\u2019s presence, the State contended that evidence of a prior arrest was not, technically, other crimes evidence. The prosecutor urged that a cautionary instruction would correct any error because the jury \u201cwon\u2019t necessarily be biased against the defendant just by the fact [Detective Comfort] mentioned [Partin] was arrested in the past.\u201d The District Court expressed disappointment with Detective Comfort\u2019s testimony and ascribed it to nervousness. The court subsequently gave a cautionary instruction admonishing the jury to consider only the facts and not prior crimes allegedly committed, and that Detective Comfort should not have testified that there had been a prior arrest of Partin.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The trial continued and Detective Comfort ultimately opined that it was probable that Partin altered the front of the check. He also testified that it was highly probable that Partin endorsed the back of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Partin then testified on his own behalf, denying that he altered the front, or signed the back, of the check. He testified that his roommate had stolen various items, including his wallet, from his house in August of 1995, and that his driver\u2019s license, and perhaps his social security card, were in the wallet. This theft was reported to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The jury found Partin guilty of the offense of forgery, a felony, and the District Court subsequently sentenced him and entered judgment. Partin appeals from the denial of his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\n<em>STANDARDS REGARDING MISTRIAL MOTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">We recently clarified the standard to be applied by a district court in determining whether to grant a motion for a mistrial. Observing that we had not consistently stated that standard in earlier cases, we held that a district court should grant a motion for a mistrial \u201cwhen there is <em>either </em>a demonstration of a manifest necessity, <em>or </em>where the defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>State v. Ford </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 353, 359-60, 926 P.2d 245, 249; <em>see also State v. Walker </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 346, 352, 930 P.2d 60, 63-64; and <em>State v. Romero </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 58, 75, 926 P.2d 717, 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>We have not previously determined when a district court should apply the manifest necessity standard as opposed to the denial of a fair and impartial trial standard. That subissue was addressed, however, in a special concurring opinion in <em>Romero, </em>926 P.2d at 730 (Leaphart, J., concurring), in which three other justices joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Justice Leaphart noted, at the outset, that <em>United States v. Perez </em>(1824), 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165, 165-66, was the source of the manifest necessity component of the standard and that, in <em>Perez, </em>the mistrial was declared by the court, not requested by the defendant. <em>Romero, </em>926 P.2d at 730. He observed that, in <em>United States v. Dinitz </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 600, 606-607, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 1079, 47 L.Ed.2d 267, 273, the United States Supreme Court limited the application of the manifest necessity standard to situations where a court declares a mistrial without the consent of the defendant. The rationale for limiting application of the heightened manifest necessity standard is that double jeopardy implications arise in the context of a mistrial declared without the defendant\u2019s request or consent. <em>Romero, </em>926 P.2d at 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In the context of a defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, however, Justice Leaphart relied on <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416, in reasoning that double jeopardy considerations do not arise when a defendant has chosen to terminate the proceedings against him. <em>Romero, </em>926 P.2d at 730-31. Thus, Justice Leaphart concluded that, where the defendant moves for a mistrial, the \u201cmotion should be granted where the ends of public justice so require or where the defendant will be denied a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Romero, </em>926 P.2d at 731. Other courts are in accord with Justice Leaphart\u2019s reasoning, applying the manifest necessity standard when the trial court declares a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent and the denial of a fair trial standard when the defendant moves for a mistrial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ardolino </em>(Me. 1997), 697 A.2d 73, 79; <em>State v. Friel </em>(Me. 1985), 500 A.2d 631, 634; <em>Smith v. State </em>(Ga. 1994), 439 S.E.2d 483, 485; <em>Byrd v. State </em>(Ga. 1992), 420 S.E.2d 748, 749; <em>State v. Sonen </em>(S.D. 1992), 492 N.W.2d 303, 306; <em>State v. Delfs </em>(S.D. 1986), 396 N.W.2d 749, 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We adopt the rationale set forth in Justice Leaphart\u2019s special concurring opinion in <em>Romero </em>and conclude that the more stringent manifest necessity standard applies when a trial court considers declaring a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s request or consent. We further conclude that the denial of a fair and impartial trial standard applies when a trial court determines whether to grant a mistrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>either moved for \u2014 or consented to \u2014 by the defendant. Thus, the fair and impartial trial standard applies to the District Court\u2019s ruling on Partin\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on inadmissible testimony which violated the order <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">With regard to this Court\u2019s standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial, the parties advance different positions based on two separate lines of authority. The State relies on recent language in <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 248-49 (citing <em>State v. Greytak </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 401, 404, 865 P.2d 1096, 1098) \u2014 reiterated in <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 63, and <em>Romero, </em>926 P.2d at 728 \u2014 that, in reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial, we determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the court\u2019s ruling is erroneous. In contrast, Partin urges us to apply the standard of review set forth in <em>State v. Seaman </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 466, 475, 771 P.2d 950, 956 (citing <em>State v. Scheffelman </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 408, 411, 733 P.2d 348, 350), which is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion. Thus, before addressing the merits of the present appeal, we must resolve the threshold issue of our standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The problem with the <em>Ford </em>standard \u2014 whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the trial court\u2019s ruling is erroneous \u2014 is that clear and convincing evidence is an <em>evidentiary </em>standard. Indeed, we recently defined clear and convincing evidence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201c[c]lear and convincing proof is simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, is somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure \u2014 that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\"><em>Matter of J.L. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 284, 289, 922 P.2d 459, 462 (quoting <em>In Interest of S.M.Q. </em>(Kan. 1990), 796 P.2d 543, 545); <em>see also Wareing v. Schreckendgust </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 196, 206, 930 P.2d 37, 43 (citation omitted). Such an evidentiary standard relating to a party\u2019s burden of proof in the district court is not a proper standard for this Court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial. As a result, we will no longer use the \u201cclear and convincing evidence that the trial court\u2019s ruling is erroneous\u201d standard of review applied in <em>Ford, Walker, Romero, </em>and earlier cases. In accordance with the <em>Seaman </em>and <em>Scheffelman </em>line of cases, we will review a district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ruling on a motion for a mistrial to determine whether the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Partin\u2019s motion for a mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">It is undisputed in this case that Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to fingerprint cards from Partin\u2019s prior arrest as the source of handwriting samples violated the District Court\u2019s order <em>in limine </em>and, therefore, was inadmissible. Partin moved for a mistrial, arguing that the testimony had such a prejudicial impact that a cautionary jury instruction could not cure the error. The State contended that Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to the prior arrest did not necessarily indicate a prior conviction and that a cautionary jury instruction was sufficient to cure any error. The District Court denied Partin\u2019s motion and the question before us is whether, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the court abused its discretion in determining that Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest did not deny Partin a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The general rule is that, where there is a reasonable possibility that inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction, a mistrial is appropriate. <em>See Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64 (citations omitted). In determining whether a prohibited statement contributed to a conviction, the strength of the evidence against the defendant\u2014 together with the prejudicial effect of the testimony and whether a cautionary jury instruction could cure any prejudice \u2014 must be considered. <em>See Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 63-64; <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">We begin by addressing the strength of the evidence against Partin in the context of whether there is a reasonable possibility that Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to a prior arrest might have contributed to Partin\u2019s conviction. No eyewitnesses tied Partin to the offense. Although Hill testified that the check had been altered and the bank teller testified that she cashed the check, neither one could identify Partin or link him to the check. Therefore, Detective Comfort\u2019s testimony regarding the handwriting analysis he performed was the only link between Partin and the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">On direct examination, Detective Comfort testified to the consistencies between the handwriting samples and the writing on the check and concluded that, in his opinion, it was probable that Partin altered the payee line of the check and highly probable that Partin signed the back of it. He further testified that he uses a six-step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>grading scale which ranges from a positive match downward through a high probability, a probability, a possibility, and some indications to no indications of a match. Therefore, Detective Comfort was able to assign only the second highest grade to the results of his analysis of the endorsement on the back of the check. He also testified that his analysis indicated that Partin\u2019s signature was \u201cconsistent with the writing on the back of the check\u201d before going on to testify that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that Partin had endorsed the check. During cross-examination, various inconsistencies between the handwriting samples and the writing on the check were pointed out. The inconsistencies included the fact that the signature on the handwriting samples turned into a straight line, while the signature on the check turned into a \u201csquiggly\u201d line. In addition, the handwriting samples all contained an \u201ca\u201d that was absent from the signature on the back of the check. Indeed, Detective Comfort testified that it was possible someone else could have endorsed the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">After the close of the State\u2019s case, Partin testified on his own behalf that he did not steal the check, alter the payee line, or endorse the back and cash it. He also testified that his roommate had stolen his wallet \u2014 which contained his driver\u2019s license and possibly his social security card \u2014 and that he reported the theft to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The lack of eyewitness testimony connecting Partin to the check in any way, together with Detective Comfort\u2019s handwriting analysis producing a less than positive match, result in evidence against Partin which is far short of being overwhelming. Furthermore, the inconsistencies in Detective Comfort\u2019s analysis and the other weaknesses in his results were effectively highlighted during cross-examination. Finally, Partin testified that he did not forge the check and advanced an alternative explanation which was not inherently incredible. Overall then, the evidence against Partin was conflicting and relatively weak.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The prejudicial effect of Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest must also be considered. <em>See Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64. In this regard, we have recognized that the introduction of other crimes evidence inevitably involves prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 344, 349, 912 P.2d 801, 804 (citation omitted). Indeed, such evidence is introduced by the prosecution for the very purpose of prejudicing the defendant. The State argues, however, that a prior arrest is not technically other crimes evidence and, therefore, reference to a prior arrest will not necessarily result in prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>We have stated, without analysis, that testimony about the existence of a pending charge in another state is not other crimes evidence. <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 249. We also have held that an officer\u2019s statement that he recognized the defendant from past forgery investigations was other crimes evidence requiring a <em>Just </em>notice. <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64. Finally, we have determined that <em>Just </em>does not apply to testimony regarding other wrong acts when the testimony was inadvertent because the prosecution did not intend to offer such evidence. <em>State v. Brush </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 247, 250, 741 P.2d 1333, 1335. We need not resolve this apparent conflict in our cases here, however, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">First, if the State desired to take the position that the prior arrest was not other crimes evidence, it should have done so in response to Partin\u2019s pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude reference to a prior arrest. It not only did not do so, it acquiesced in the motion. Then, having elicited the very testimony it agreed was inadmissible, the prosecutor responded to Partin\u2019s motion for a mistrial by arguing the purported distinction between other crimes evidence and testimony referencing only a prior arrest. The State repeats that argument on appeal, but we will not countenance such position-shifting by addressing that argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Second, regardless of whether Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest is other crimes evidence under <em>Just </em>and Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., testimony that a defendant has been arrested on a prior occasion is inherently prejudicial. If it were not, there would be no reason for a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude such evidence. Further, the prosecutor\u2019s acquiescence in \u2014 and the District Court\u2019s grant of \u2014 the motion <em>in limine </em>in this case reflect that all involved conceded the prejudicial effect of evidence that Partin had been arrested on a prior occasion. This is especially true when, as in this case, the only evidence directly linking Partin to the check at issue is the testimony of the very officer who also disclosed the previous arrest, and the only defense witness is the defendant. Under such circumstances, the reference to the prior arrest may have buttressed the officer\u2019s other testimony and, at the same time, impugned the defendant\u2019s credibility and character. On this record, we conclude that Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Regarding the extent of the prejudice, the State argues that Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest is no more prejudicial than the officer\u2019s reference to other charges pending against the defendant in <em>Ford. </em>Because we determined that reference had only a slight prejudicial effect and affirmed the denial of that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>motion for a mistrial, the State contends we should do the same in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In <em>Ford, </em>the victim testified that Ford had sexually assaulted him and that, when confronted the next day, Ford admitted what he had done. <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 246-47. The victim\u2019s cousin and uncle provided similar descriptions of the confrontation between the victim and Ford. <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 247. The investigating officer testified that, before he searched Ford\u2019s residence, he asked for consent to search and told Ford that there were charges pending in another state. <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 247. The defendant objected and the trial court overruled the objection. The defendant subsequently moved for a mistrial; the trial court denied the motion, but gave a cautionary instruction. <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 247. On that record, we determined that the reference to other pending charges had little, if any, prejudicial effect. <em>Ford, </em>926 P.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In <em>Ford, </em>the evidence against the defendant was very strong. Here, as discussed above, the evidence against Partin was weak and conflicting. There were no eyewitnesses to any involvement by Partin with the check at issue. Nor was there testimony corroborating Detective Comfort\u2019s opinion that the writing on the check was Partin\u2019s and, as discussed above, the weaknesses in Detective Comfort\u2019s handwriting analysis and opinion were highlighted effectively during cross-examination. Since the stronger the evidence against the defendant, the less likely it is that a reference to other charges or a prior arrest will have a prejudicial effect, we conclude that the reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest had a greater prejudicial effect than the reference to other charges in <em>Ford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Finally, we turn to the question of whether the District Court\u2019s cautionary instruction could cure the prejudicial effect of Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest. Generally, \u201can error in the admission of evidence may be cured if the jury is admonished to disregard it.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64 (citations omitted). A general rule is not carved in stone, however, and if this one were, every improper introduction of evidence \u2014 no matter how egregious and prejudicial and without regard to any pretrial exclusion \u2014 could and would be cured by a cautionary instruction. Where the question before us boils down to whether there is a reasonable possibility that inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction, we must evaluate the applicability of the general rule regarding curative instructions carefully.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In <em>Walker, </em>another felony forgery case, an officer referenced past forgery investigations involving the defendant at a point during trial when another officer had testified that three bank employees identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fied the defendant in a photo line-up. <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64. In addition, the three bank employees provided in-court identifications of the defendant. <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64. The defendant objected to the reference to the past forgery investigations and, during the ensuing discussion in chambers, moved for a mistrial. The prosecutor admitted that no <em>Just </em>notice had been given. <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 63. The district court denied the motion for a mistrial and admonished the jury not to consider the reference to past investigations. <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 63. We determined on appeal that, in light of all the evidence presented and the prompt cautionary instruction, the officer\u2019s reference to past forgery investigations did not contribute to the conviction; in doing so, we implicitly concluded that any prejudice from the improper testimony was cured by the instruction. <em>Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Clearly, the admonition to the jury in <em>Walker </em>was not the only factor we considered in determining that the prejudicial effect of the reference to past investigations had been overcome. The strong evidence against the defendant \u2014 including that of three eyewitnesses \u2014 was an important underpinning for our conclusion that the prejudice was cured. <em>See Walker, </em>930 P.2d at 64. Here, unlike in <em>Walker, </em>the evidence was weak and conflicting and no eyewitnesses tied Partin to the check at issue. Furthermore, in <em>Walker </em>the reference to the other charges did not violate a pretrial order excluding such testimony. In this case, the reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest violated the District Court\u2019s order <em>in limine </em>to which the State had agreed. Under such a circumstance, and given the status of the evidence, resolving any doubt about the efficacy of the cautionary instruction in favor of the prosecution would be inappropriate. As a result, we conclude that the cautionary instruction did not overcome the prejudicial effect of Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Based on the record before us here, we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that Detective Comfort\u2019s reference to Partin\u2019s prior arrest might have contributed to Partin\u2019s conviction and, as a result, that Partin was denied a fair and impartial trial. We hold, therefore, that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Partin\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
