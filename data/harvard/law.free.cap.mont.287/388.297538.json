Sunset Point, a condominium developer, brought suit against the named defendants seeking to recover damages incurred when problems with the exterior surface of certain condominium units developed. In its complaint, Sunset Point alleged counts for breach of contract, breach of warranty, indemnity, negligence, and strict liability in tort against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b62 Defendants Melton and Fischer filed a motion for summary judgment on July 17,1996, as did Stuc-O-Flex International, Inc. On September 5,1996, Sunset Point filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to add Perma-Chink Systems, Inc., as an additional defendant. In an October 15,1996, order, the District Court denied Sunset Point\u2019s motion to amend the complaint and granted Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment. The District Court additionally granted partial summary judgment in favor of Melton and Fischer. It is from that portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying its motion to amend the complaint to add an additional defendant, and granting Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment, that Sunset Point presently appeals. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b63 The sole dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b64 On November 7, 1989, Sunset Point entered a contract with Melton and Fischer, hiring them to act as general contractors for a condominium project located on Flathead Lake, south of Bigfork, Montana. On April 3,1990, Melton and Fischer executed a construction subcontract with Wolstein, d/b/a Stuc-O-Flex Systems, pursuant to which Wolstein was to apply Stuc-O-Flex, a synthetic stucco product, to the exterior surface of the condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b65 In 1990, Wolstein purchased the Stuc-O-Flex product he subsequently applied to Sunset Point\u2019s condominiums from manufacturer and seller, Perma-Chink Systems, Inc. In October 1991, StucO-Flex International, Inc., incorporated and agreed to assume Perma-Chink\u2019s assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b66 When construction was completed, Sunset Point sold the condominium units to various homeowners. Sometime prior to July 1991, the exterior surface of the condominiums developed problems, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the Sunset Point Homeowners contacted Sunset Point and demanded repairs. Sunset Point tendered the homeowners\u2019 demands to the defendants. Defendants rejected Sunset Point\u2019s tender. Sunset Point then hired architect Raymond Cortner to inspect the condominiums. In June 1994, Sunset Point spent $79,365.50 on necessary repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"AeU\">\u00b67 On August 23,1994, Sunset Point filed suit against Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., and Wolstein, d/b/a Stuc-O-Flex Systems, as well as against Melton and Fischer, d/b/a Melton Fischer Construction, seeking to recover the $79,365.50 in costs incurred repairing the condominiums. Wolstein defaulted on January 19, 1995, and Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., filed a motion for summary judgment on May 23,1995. In a December 11, 1995, order, the District Court denied Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion on the basis that the record contained insufficient facts upon which it could premise a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b68 Following completion of additional discovery and supplementation of the record, Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., filed a second motion for summary judgment on July 17, 1996. Melton and Fischer similarly filed a motion for summary judgment on July 17, 1996. On September 5, 1996, Sunset Point filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint adding Perma-Chink as an additional defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b69 On October 15,1996, the District Court issued an order granting Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment, and denying Sunset Point\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The court additionally granted Melton and Fischer\u2019s motion for summary judgment in part, and denied it in part. Sunset Point subsequently reached a settlement with Melton and Fischer with respect to all claims, and on January 7, 1997, stipulated to Melton and Fischer\u2019s dismissal from the case. On April 29, 1997, Sunset Point obtained a default judgment against Greg Wolstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b610 On May 19, 1997, Sunset Point filed its notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s October 15, 1996, order granting Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment and denying Sunset Point\u2019s motion to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b6 11  This Court\u2019s standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, 663 (citing <em>Motarie v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156; <em>Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P.2d 782, 785). This Court reviews a summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>order entered pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 446, 930 P.2d at 663 (citing <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b612 In proving that summary judgment is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove by more than mere denial and speculation that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of material fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. [This Court] reviews the legal determinations made by the district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b613  Moreover, the \u201cmoving party has the burden of showing a complete absence of any genuine issue as to all facts considered material in light of the substantive principles that entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Kolar v. Bergo </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 262, 266, 929 P.2d 867, 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err in granting Stuc-O-Flex Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u00b615 In its October 15, 1996, order, the District Court granted summary judgment in Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, favor with respect to each of the five counts asserted against it in Sunset Point\u2019s complaint. In so doing, the court concluded the evidence of record did not support Sunset Point\u2019s assertion that Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., could be held vicariously liable for Wolstein\u2019s actions pursuant to a theory of either actual or ostensible agency and, therefore, held Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., was entitled to summary judgment on the claims leveled against it for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence. The District Court additionally granted Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment with respect to Sunset Point\u2019s claim for indemnity, concluding that Sunset Point could in no event establish a claim for liability against Stuc-O-Flex, Inc. Finally, the District Court ordered summary judgment in Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, favor with respect to Sunset Point\u2019s claim for strict liability in tort, concluding there existed no evidence of record supporting Sunset Point\u2019s assertion that the StucO-Flex product was in any way defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u00b616 As it is potentially dispositive of Sunset Point\u2019s claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and partially dispositive of its claim for negligence, we turn first to the question of whether the District Court erred in concluding the evidence of record did not support Sunset Point\u2019s assertion that Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., could be held vicariously liable for Wolstein\u2019s actions pursuant to a theory of either actual or ostensible agency, and that there existed no genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">A. <em>Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b617 In Count I of its complaint, Sunset Point asserts that it contracted with Wolstein and Melton Fischer for the application of Stuc-O-Flex to the exterior walls of its condominiums, and alleges \u201c[d]efendants Wolstein and Melton Fischer\u201d breached that contract by failing to \u201cdo all work in a first-class and workmanlike manner and to the entire satisfaction of the Owner, Contractor and Architect.\u201d In Count II of its complaint, Sunset Point alleges breach of warranty, asserting that \u201cdefendants Wolstein and Melton Fischer\u201d breached the fifteen-year warranty included in the construction subcontract. Finally, in Count IV of its complaint, Sunset Point asserts the \u201c [defendants were negligent in the manner in which they applied stuc-o-flex to the exterior walls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b618 In its motion for summary judgment, Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., argued that Sunset Point\u2019s claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence contained no allegations of wrongdoing on the part of, or representations by, Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., and accordingly asserted it was entitled to summary judgment on each of those three counts. In response, Sunset Point maintained that Wolstein was Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, agent, and asserted the corporation could therefore be held vicariously liable for Wolstein\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b619 In addressing Sunset Point\u2019s claim for breach of contract, the District Court first noted that \u201c[t]he complaint fails to contain any allegations of agency and this issue was raised by [Sunset Point] for the first time more than two years after the institution of suit\u201d and, therefore, concluded the question of agency was not properly before that court. The court continued with its analysis, however, and concluded that the evidence did not, in any event, \u201csupport a claim of either actual or ostensible agency\u201d between Wolstein and Stuc-OFlex, Inc., and on that basis granted Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment as to Sunset Point\u2019s claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty. The District Court similarly ordered summary judgment in Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, favor with respect to Sunset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Point\u2019s allegations of negligence, specifically concluding that \u201cthere is no evidence establishing or even raising a question of fact whether Wolstein was an agent for Stuc-O-Flex International, Inc.\u201d and that the corporation thus \u201chad no responsibility for the manner in which Wolstein applied the product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b620 On appeal, Sunset Point argues the District Court erred in determining that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the presence of an ostensible agency between Wolstein and Stuc-OFlex, Inc. Sunset Point urges there exists at least enough evidence of record to create a question of fact regarding the presence of such an agency relationship. For example, Sunset Point points to those portions of Sunset Point partner Dan Averill\u2019s deposition testimony in which he explains that he thought applicators were certified by the manufacturer and that he believed Wolstein was an agent of Stuc-OFlex, Inc. Sunset Point also relies on Averill\u2019s testimony regarding a sales pitch he received from a Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., representative as evidence of ostensible agency. Sunset Point next points to the fact that Wolstein signed the construction subcontract as \u201cStuc-O-Flex Systems by Greg Wolstein\u201d and testified that he notified Perma-Chink of his intent to use the name \u201cStuc-O-Flex Systems\u201d and PermaChink did not object. Finally, Sunset Point notes that Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, president, Rich Dunstan, testified that Stuc-O-Flex must be purchased through the company which has a training program for applicators. In light of the foregoing evidence of record, Sunset Point argues, there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., by want of ordinary care, allowed third parties to believe that an applicator like Wolstein was acting as an agent for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b621 With respect to agency, \u00a7 28-10-103, MCA, explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">An agency is either actual or ostensible. An agency is actual when the agent is really employed by the principal. An agency is ostensible when the principal intentionally or by want of ordinary care causes a third person to believe another to be his agent who is not really employed by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b622  Pursuant to this statutory definition of ostensible agency, it must be the principal, not the agent, who \u201cintentionally or by want of ordinary care causes a third person to believe another to be his agent.\u201d <em>See also Miller v. Cascade Northern Co. </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 66, 69, 592 P.2d 156, 158 (recognizing liability under theory of ostensible agency may exist only where the alleged principal, \u201cby reason of some act on his part,\u201d leads another to believe that an agency relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>existed.) (Quoting <em>Elkins v. Husky Oil </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 159, 168, 455 P.2d 329, 333). Furthermore, we have recognized that \u201c[t]he belief that another is an agent must be reasonable.\u201d <em>Larson v. Barry Smith Logging, Inc. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 444, 447, 884 P.2d 786, 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b623  In the present case, we must determine whether the District Court erred in concluding there existed no question of fact as to whether Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., led Sunset Point to believe that Wolstein was acting as its agent. In so doing, we turn first to Sunset Point\u2019s assertion that because Averill believed Wolstein was Stuc-OFlex, Inc.\u2019s, agent, and because he thought all applicators were certified by the manufacturer, Wolstein was Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, ostensible agent. Averill\u2019s deposition testimony reveals that he never met, nor dealt directly, with Wolstein, and suggests no act on the part of Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., which could have led him to reasonably believe that Wolstein was acting as Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, agent. That Averill received a sales pitch from a Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., representative does not suggest the corporation was attempting to hold Wolstein out as its agent. Moreover, we conclude testimony by Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, president, Rich Dunstan, explaining that the Stuc-O-Flex product is purchased through the company which has a training program for applicators, fails to create a factual issue on the question of ostensible agency. The record clearly indicates that Wolstein never requested or received any such training, and additionally indicates that the StucO-Flex product is available to consumers, not only through the company, but also through sales representatives and dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b624  Sunset Point also argues there exists a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the presence of an ostensible agency between Wolstein and Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., because Wolstein signed the construction subcontract as \u201cStuc-O-flex Systems by Greg Wolstein\u201d and testified that Perma-Chink did not object to his use of the name \u201cStuc-O-Flex Systems.\u201d We have previously held, however, that mere use of an alleged principal\u2019s name, without some other \u201cholding out,\u201d does not, by itself, create an ostensible agency. <em>Elkins v. Husky Oil Co. </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 159, 168, 455 P.2d 329, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b625 Based on the foregoing, we conclude, as did the District Court, that the evidence of record fails to raise a question of fact regarding the presence of an ostensible agency relationship between Wolstein and Stuc-O-Flex, Inc. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, favor with respect to Sunset Point\u2019s claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>B. <em>Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b626 We note that the District Court granted Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment with respect to Sunset Point\u2019s claim for negligence on the additional basis that Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., \u201cdid not exist as a corporation when the contract was entered\u201d and that Wolstein purchased the Stuc-O-Flex product he used on the Sunset Point condominiums from Perma-Chink, which was not named as a defendant to this action. The court additionally noted that Stuc-OFlex, Inc., did not sell or endorse the \u201c \u2018sandwich\u2019 of mesh, protective sealant and stuc-o-flex\u201d used in application and that Wolstein neither requested nor received instructional material regarding application of the product in relation to this project.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b627  On appeal, Sunset Point argues the District Court ignored its allegations of direct negligence on the part of Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., in selecting Wolstein as an applicator, failing to provide adequate training, supervision, and instruction. We note that Count IV of Sunset Point\u2019s complaint alleges negligence only on the part of the defendants \u201cin the manner in which they applied stuc-o-flex,\u201d and contains no allegations of direct negligence on the part of Stuc-O-Flex, Inc. Moreover, Sunset Point has failed to point to any evidence of record which would suggest the presence of a duty on the part of Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., to train or supervise Wolstein. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, favor with respect to Sunset Point\u2019s claim for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b628 In light of our conclusion that Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., would, in any event, be entitled to summary judgment on the merits with respect to Sunset Point\u2019s claim for negligence, we need not address whether the District Court erred in granting Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, motion for summary judgment on the partial basis that it did not exist as a corporation at the time the contract at issue was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">C. <em>Strict Liability in Tort</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b629  In the fifth and final count of its complaint, Sunset Point alleges that \u201c[t]he Stuc-o-flex application at Sunset Point Phase IV was unreasonably unsuitable for its intended purpose and thus, defective.\u201d Sunset Point additionally asserts that its \u201cuse of the Stuc-o-flex product was in a manner reasonably foreseeable by the Defendants\u201d and that it incurred damages \u201c[a]s a proximate result of the defective application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\u00b630 The District Court ordered summary judgment in Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, favor on Sunset Point\u2019s claim for strict liability on two grounds. First, the court noted that Sunset Point asserts only that the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>cation of Stuc-O-Flex was defective, not that the product itself was defective. In any event, the court next concluded, Sunset Point\u2019s \u201cown expert, Raymond Cortner, testified that he found no defect in the Stuc-o-flex <em>product </em>and there is no testimony in the record to indicate that the product was defective in any manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\u00b631 On appeal, Sunset Point argues there in fact exists sufficient evidence of record to create a question of fact as to whether the Stuc-O-Flex product was defective. For example, Sunset Point argues that deposition testimony by Raymond Cortner, an expert hired by Sunset Point to investigate the problem at the condominiums, establishes \u201cthat the Stuc-O-Flex system has a very poor track record in this geographic area, as the product may fail in as little as a week or last only a year or two.\u201d Review of those portions of Cortner\u2019s deposition submitted on appeal, however, reveals that Cortner in fact opined there existed no defect in the Stuc-O-Flex product itself. Instead, Cortner explained, \u201c[t]he Stuc-O-Flex adhered to the paper and the paper let go from the core of the gypsum and the gypsum core remained there and the paper fell off as it would when it got wet.\u201d When asked whether he had found \u201cany problem or difficulty with the Stuc-o-flex product itself,\u201d Cortner stated that \u201cno, [he] couldn\u2019t find anything specific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b632 Sunset Point additionally argues that, \u201c[although the product may not be defective while sitting in its container, when applied to a building in its intended manner, it fails.\u201d More specifically, Sunset Point asserts that the Stuc-O-Flex product is sold as a complete \u201csystem\u201d which includes application of the material. As the District Court noted, however, Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., did \u201cnot sell all of the component parts of the alleged \u2018system.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, Cortner testified at his deposition that \u201cstuc-o-flex is a material that is applied to another substraight, but they do not have a system, they have a material stuc-o-flex, and it is applied to anything. They don\u2019t guarantee a system.\u201d As the District Court noted, the record indicates that Wolstein did not purchase the underlying mesh and protective coating over which he applied the Stuc-O-Flex product from Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ApH\">\u00b633 Thus, assuming, as did the District Court, that Sunset Point has properly alleged a claim for strict liability in tort, we hold the District Court correctly concluded the evidence of record simply does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not support Sunset Point\u2019s assertion that the Stuc-O-Flex product is itself defective and that there exists no question of fact precluding summary judgment on this issue. We accordingly hold the District Court did not err in ordering summary judgment in Stuc-O-Flex, Inc.\u2019s, favor with respect to Sunset Point\u2019s claim for strict liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">D. <em>Motion to Amend the Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b634 . Sunset Point additionally appeals from that portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying Sunset Point\u2019s motion to amend the complaint to add Perma Chink Systems, Inc., as a defendant in this case. The court denied Sunset Point\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, concluding that to allow the amendment at such a late date would be prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b635 In light of our conclusion that Sunset Point has, in any event, failed to demonstrate the presence of a genuine issue of material fact in support of any of the claims contained in its complaint, whether Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., or Perma-Chink Systems, Inc., is the appropriate defendant in this case is immaterial. Accordingly, we need not address the propriety of the District Court\u2019s decision denying Sunset Point\u2019s motion to amend the complaint.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-7\">JUSTICES HUNT, GRAY, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-5\">. We are, of course, aware that Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., did not incorporate until October 1991, and so refer to Stuc-O-Flex, Inc., rather than to Perma-Chink Systems, Inc., for purposes of simplicity only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
