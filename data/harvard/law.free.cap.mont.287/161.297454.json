We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">\u00b62 Glickman raises the following three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">\u00b63 1. Were the judgments and decrees of foreclosure in the prior lawsuits entered without or in excess of jurisdiction, thereby rendering them subject to collateral attack?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Glickman\u2019s complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., sanctions?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b66 Joe and Mary Glickman acquired two parcels of real property located in Flathead County, Montana, from Dawn and Duane Reisch by executing promissory notes to the Reisches, Mountain Bank, and WCU. The Glickmans defaulted on their obligations and two foreclosure actions, entitled <em>Dawn H. Reisch v. Joe Glickman, Jr. et al, </em>Flathead County Cause No. DV-95-113(B) and <em>Whitefish Credit Union Assoc. v. Joe Glickman, Jr., et al, </em>Flathead County Cause No. DV-95-238(A), were commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b67 In February 1996, judgments and decrees of foreclosure, subject to the right of redemption, were entered in favor of Dawn Reisch, Mountain Bank, and WCU. Glickman did not appeal either judgment. He occupied the properties when the judgments and decrees were entered and during the one-year statutory period of redemption. On March 18, 1996, and April 4, 1996, sheriff\u2019s sales were held on the properties. Sheriff\u2019s deeds were issued to Mountain Bank and WCU on March 18, 1997, and April 4,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b68 On March 17, 1997, Glickman filed an \u201coriginal petition\u201d seeking to quiet title to the property, damages, and a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the judgments, decrees of foreclosure, and the sheriff\u2019s sales. Respondents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for sanctions under Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b69 The District Court granted Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss and awarded sanctions in the form of attorney fees and costs totaling $2,025 for WCU and $1,989 for Mountain Bank and Dawn Reisch. From this order, Glickman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b610 1. Were the judgments and decrees of foreclosure in the prior lawsuits entered without or in excess of jurisdiction, thereby rendering them subject to collateral attack?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u00b611  Glickman argues the district courts acted outside or in excess of their jurisdiction by decreeing that the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale \u201cbe let into possession.\u201d Respondents maintain that Glickman\u2019s present action alleges issues raised in previous proceedings and is therefore barred. Respondents also argue that this action is not appropriate to set aside a judgment under Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R</p>\n<p id=\"b187-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u00b612  A judgment entered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is subject to attack at any time. <em>Big Spring v. Blackfeet Tribe of Blackfeet, Etc. </em>(1978), 175 Mont. 258, 264-65, 573 P.2d 655, 659. Therefore, we consider whether the District Court acted outside or in excess of its jurisdiction when it decreed that Respondents, as purchasers at the sheriff\u2019s sales, \u201cbe let into possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b613  A collateral attack on a judgment is possible only if the judgment is void on its face and it appears affirmatively from the judgment roll that the court did not have jurisdiction or committed an act in excess of jurisdiction. <em>Higgins v. Montana Hotel Corp. </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 149, 154, 592 P.2d 930, 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b614 Glickman does not provide any authority that a court of general jurisdiction may not enter a judgment in a foreclosure action. The cases he cites deal with dissimilar factual situations, such as lack of personal jurisdiction in <em>Joseph Russell Rlty. Co. v. Kenneally </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 496, 605 P.2d 1107, erroneous determination of heirship in <em>Moxley v. Vaughn </em>(1966), 148 Mont. 30, 416 P.2d 536, or determination and absence of determination of heirship, a jurisdictional prerequisite to a valid decree in <em>In re Bell\u2019s Estate </em>(1958), 134 Mont. 345, 331 P.2d 517. We conclude the District Court did not act outside or in excess of its jurisdiction when it decreed that the purchasers at the sheriff\u2019s sales \u201cbe let into possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b615  Glickman also contends that Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., is not applicable to his case because the rule is grounded upon a valid final order or judgment. The residual clause of Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P, allows a party to file an independent action for relief from a final judgment or order under very limited circumstances: lack of personal notification, fraud upon the court, or an independent action for extrinsic fraud. <em>Loney v. Milodragovich, Dale &amp; Dye, P.C. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 506, 511-12, 905 P.2d 158, 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b616 Glickman did not allege any of these causes of action in his \u201coriginal petition.\u201d We conclude there is no basis for an independent action under the residual clause of Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., for Glickman to set aside the previous judgments and decrees of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"Aha\">\u00b617 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Glickman\u2019s complaint? .</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u00b6 18  The court\u2019s determination that Glickman\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted is a conclusion of law. <em>Loney, </em>273 Mont. at 509, 905 P.2d at 161. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Loney, </em>273 Mont. at 510, 905 P.2d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u00b619  In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.R, motion to dismiss, a court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. A complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief under any set of facts which could be proved in support of the claim. <em>Boreen v. Christensen </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 405, 408, 884 P.2d 761, 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b620  The doctrine of res judicata prevents a party from re-litigating a matter that the party has already had an opportunity to litigate. It is based on the public policy that there must be some end to litigation. A claim is res judicata when four criteria are met: the parties or their privies are the same; the subject matter of the claim is the same; the issues are the same and relate to the same subject matter; and the capacities of the persons are the same in reference to the subject matter and the issues. <em>Loney, </em>273 Mont. at 510, 905 P.2d at 161 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b621  We conclude that all four elements were satisfied as between this action and the two underlying district court actions entitled Flathead County Cause No. DV-95-113(B) and Cause No. DV-95-238(A). Therefore, the doctrine of res judicata bars Glickman from litigating his present claim. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Glickman\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b622 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, sanctions?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">\u00b623  We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusion that the facts constitute a violation of Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Swanson </em>(1990), 240 Mont. 435, 446, 784 P.2d 919, 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">\u00b624  The District Court concluded that given the timing of the filing of this cause and the lack of any allegations that would subject the prior judgments to collateral attack, Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, sanctions in the form of attorney fees and costs were appropriate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">\u00b625 Glickman did not appeal either foreclosure judgment. In Cause No. DV-95-113(B) and Cause No. DV-95-238(A), Glickman stipulated that he was entitled to possession during the statutory period of redemption. He remained in possession during the redemption period, and no one tried to remove him until that period expired. Any reasonable inquiry prior to the filing of the \u201coriginal petition\u201d would have shown Glickman and his attorney that their claims were not grounded in fact, not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>cation, or reversal of existing law, and that unnecessary delay and needlessincreaseinlitigationandthecostthereofwouldresultfrom theclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">\u00b626 We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
