Following a jury trial, Sweet was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of both offenses and sentenced to two consecutive ten-year sentences. Sweet appeals the jury\u2019s verdict and the District Court\u2019s order which denied his motion to dismiss. We affirm the jury\u2019s verdict and the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it denied Sweet\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the State\u2019s alleged negligent suppression of evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b64 2. Was there sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\u00b65 Officer Jerry Stradinger, a detective with the Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff\u2019s Department, recruited a confidential informant to purchase drugs in the Butte-Silver Bow community as part of Detective Stradinger\u2019s drug sale investigations. The confidential informant was Dennis O\u2019Donnell, a former and subsequent drug abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\u00b66 On November 2, 1995, Stradinger met with O\u2019Donnell to effectuate a drug purchase. Stradinger searched O\u2019Donnell and his vehicle, then fitted him with a transmitting device known as a \u201cbody wire.\u201d The body wire allowed Stradinger to monitor any drug transaction or conversation which occurred in O\u2019Donnell\u2019s presence. Stradinger gave O\u2019Donnell $140 with which to purchase the drugs. O\u2019Donnell proceeded to the location where the drug purchase was to be made. Stradinger followed O\u2019Donnell in his own vehicle, monitored O\u2019Donnell\u2019s activities through the body wire, and tape-recorded conversations transmitted from the body wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">\u00b67 The intended drug purchase at the first residence to which O\u2019Donnell was sent did not occur; however, while at the first residence O\u2019Donnell arranged to buy drugs from an individual he identified as Lawrence Earl Sweet. Sweet\u2019s residence was located in Walkerville, Montana, a municipality north of Butte. O\u2019Donnell left the first location and indicated to Stradinger by way of the body wire that he was going to Sweet\u2019s house where a drug sale would take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">\u00b68 Stradinger followed O\u2019Donnell to Sweet\u2019s residence and began surveillance nearby. He watched O\u2019Donnell enter Sweet\u2019s home and heard him clearly identify Sweet on the body wire. According to Stradinger, O\u2019Donnell purchased marijuana from Sweet and left the house. Stradinger followed O\u2019Donnell to a prearranged meeting place where O\u2019Donnell gave him four bags, each containing one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u00b69 On November 11, 1995, Stradinger again fitted O\u2019Donnell with a body wire and set up a surveillance at a distance from Sweet\u2019s home. On that occasion, O\u2019Donnell made a second purchase of marijuana from Sweet. At trial, Stradinger testified that he could not recall whether he searched O\u2019Donnell prior to the second transaction. He also testified that prior to arriving at Sweet\u2019s residence in Walkerville, on that occasion, O\u2019Donnell went into a convenience store \u201cfor change.\u201d When they arrived at Sweet\u2019s house, Stradinger recorded the conversation picked up by O\u2019Donnell\u2019s body wire. He heard O\u2019Donnell knock at the door to the residence, enter, and identify Sweet.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b610 During the second transaction, Sweet told O\u2019Donnell that he did not have anything to sell and that he would have to make a phone call. Sweet sent O\u2019Donnell back outside to wait. According to Stradinger, fifteen minutes later Sweet came out of his house and summoned O\u2019Donnell to Sweet\u2019s garage, where a drug transaction occurred. O\u2019Donnell left Sweet\u2019s residence and Stradinger followed him to the prearranged meeting place where O\u2019Donnell gave Stradinger two one-eighth ounce bags of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b611 Sweet was charged on April 22, 1996, by information filed in the District Court for Silver Bow County, with two counts of felony criminal sale of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA (1995). Sweet pled not guilty to both offenses. On September 25,1996, following the State\u2019s refusal to disclose O\u2019Donnell\u2019s identity without an order from the District Court, Sweet field a motion for the disclosure of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s identity and location. On September 27,1996, the District Cotut entered an order which advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">[T]he State is hereby ordered to disclose the identity of the informant, the location of the informant if known, and any documents, statements or information within its control that relate to the credibility of the informant. Failure to abide by this order will result in dismissal of this case</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b612 On September 30, 1996, the State formally disclosed the identity of Dennis O\u2019Donnell and gave his last known home address. On October 2, 1996, the State informed Sweet that O\u2019Donnell had more recently been located at the Montana Chemical Dependency Center (MCDC) where he was receiving treatment for chemical dependency. The State agreed to produce O\u2019Donnell for an interview on October 3,1996. On the date scheduled for the interview, the State advised Sweet that O\u2019Donnell had been absent from MCDC for approximately seven days, and that his whereabouts were unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u00b613 Sweet moved to dismiss the information filed against him based upon his belief that the State negligently suppressed evidence related to the confidential informant. On October 8,1996, the District Court denied Sweet\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b614 A trial was held on October 8 and 9, 1996. Sweet moved for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case. The District Court denied Sweet\u2019s motion. A jury found Sweet guilty of two counts of criminal sale of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA (1995). On December 13,1996, the District Court sentenced Sweet to two concurrent ten-year sentences at the Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err when it denied Sweet\u2019s- motion to dismiss based on the State\u2019s alleged negligent suppression of evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b616 On appeal, Sweet argues that because the State\u2019s proof depended upon the testimony of its confidential informant, minimal observations of Stradinger, and two poor-quality tape recordings of the alleged drug sale, the availability of the confidential informant was critical. Sweet contends that the jury must be able to observe the confidential informant\u2019s demeanor and evaluate his testimony. Sweet notes that the District Court found that O\u2019Donnell \u201cmay be able to give testimony that is relevant to the defense of entrapment,\u201d and that O\u2019Donnell was advised as early as November 30, 1995, that he may be a witness in this case. According to Sweet, the claim against him should have been dismissed with prejudice because the State\u2019s failure to keep track of O\u2019Donnell constitutes a negligent suppression of important evidence and a violation of the District Court\u2019s order to produce the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u00b617 The State, on the other hand, contends that Sweet did not establish that O\u2019Donnell\u2019s testimony would have raised a reasonable doubt about Sweet\u2019s guilt. It farther argues that there is no evidence on the tapes, or anywhere else, that would suggest that Sweet lacked criminal intent, as required for the defense of entrapment, or was lured into committing a crime which he had no intention of committing. The State contends that the District Court correctly concluded that it did not negligently suppress evidence because it was not in direct control of the confidential informant and because both parties had the power to subpoena him. It further maintains that the District Court\u2019s previous determination that the confidential informant \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>be able to give testimony that is relevant to the defense of entrapment\u201d is not determinative for purposes of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"AOy\">\u00b618  The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law. <em>See State v. Hansen </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 321, 323, 903 P.2d 194, 195. Our standard of review is plenary; we review the decision to determine whether the conclusion of law is correct. <em>See Hansen, </em>273 Mont. at 323, 903 P.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b619  In <em>State v. McLeod </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 482, 487, 740 P.2d 672, 675, we held that in order to compel disclosure of a confidential informant the defendant must adduce \u201csome evidence of entrapment before the government is called upon to disclose to the defendant the identify of an informant\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Sharp </em>(6th Cir. 1985), 778 F.2d 1182, 1187). In its order which required the State to disclose O\u2019Donnell\u2019s identity, the District Court found that O\u2019Donnell \u201cmay be able to give testimony that is relevant to the defense of entrapment,\u201d as is required by our holding in <em>McLeod. </em>However, as argued by the State, we conclude that this finding is not determinative of whether the District Court erred when it denied Sweet\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b620 Although the District Court found that O\u2019Donnell\u2019s testimony may be relevant to the defense of entrapment, the standard for materiality required for a reversal of a conviction is greater than for the disclosure of the identify of a confidential informant. In <em>State v. West </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 83, 826 P.2d 940, we held that in order to reverse a conviction the defendant must show that the lost or destroyed evidence had exculpatory value which would have changed the outcome of the trial. Specifically, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">[W]hen the State, due to negligence, loss, replacement, or destruction, is unable to produce certain physical evidence in the prosecution of the case, reversal of a conviction is not necessary where the actual objects were not.vital to the defense, were not exculpatory in nature, and the result would not have been affected by their introduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\"><em>West, </em>252 Mont. at 87, 826 P.2d at 943. We quoted the United States Supreme Court for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">[w]hatever the duty the Constitution imposes on the States to preserve evidence, that duty must be limited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect\u2019s defense. To meet this standard of constitutional materiality, evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><em>West, </em>252 Mont. at 87, 826 P.2d at 943 (quoting <em>California v. Trombetta </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 479, 488-89, 104 S. Ct. 2528, 2534, 81 L. Ed. 2d 413, 422).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b621 We agree with the State that Sweet did not establish that O\u2019Donnell\u2019s testimony would change the outcome of the trial or raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b622  In <em>State v. Cannon </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 157, 167, 687 P.2d 705, 710, we set forth the following elements of entrapment: (1) criminal intent or design originating in the mind of the police officer or informer; (2) absence of criminal intent or design originating in the mind of the accused; and (3) luring or inducing the accused into committing a crime he had no intention of committing. There is a distinction between inducing a person to commit an unlawful act, and setting a trap to catch him or her in the execution of a criminal design of his or her own conception. <em>See Cannon, </em>212 Mont. at 167, 687 P.2d at 710. Merely affording the defendant the opportunity or facility for committing an offense is not entrapment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b623 Both transactions between Sweet and O\u2019Donnell were recorded on tape. O\u2019Donnell approached Sweet and inquired whether Sweet would sell him marijuana. Sweet then provided O\u2019Donnell with marijuana in exchange for money. Sweet was merely presented with the opportunity to commit the crime of criminal sale of dangerous drugs. There is no evidence on the tapes derived from the body wire to suggest that Sweet lacked criminal intent and was lured into committing a crime which he had no intention of committing.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b624  Moreover, at the times Sweet sought an interview with him, O\u2019Donnell was neither an employee of the Butte-Silver Bow Law Enforcement Agency nor the County Attorney\u2019s office and thus was not under the direct authority of the State. Unlike cases where physical evidence is lost or destroyed, the State cannot be held responsible for the unavailability of someone over whom it has no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">\u00b625  Law enforcement agencies do have a responsibility to make reasonable efforts to secure the testimony of a confidential informant when his or her testimony becomes necessary. However, there was evidence from which the District Court could find that that was done in this case. Stradinger informed O\u2019Donnell, in a confidential informant questionnaire, that O\u2019Donnell may have to testify in court proceedings regarding the investigations in which he participated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>O\u2019Donnell read and signed the questionnaire. The State subpoenaed O\u2019Donnell to testify approximately one week prior to the date set for trial and five days after the District Court ordered the disclosure of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s identity and location. The State was simply unable to locate O\u2019Donnell once he walked away from the treatment center.</p>\n<p id=\"Au1k\">\u00b626  Furthermore, we conclude that Sweet has not established prejudice from O\u2019Donnell\u2019s absence. The entire transaction between O\u2019Donnell and Sweet was recorded on tape for the jury to hear. Stradinger, who was present to testify at trial, monitored both transactions, from start to finish, in person and through O\u2019Donnell\u2019s body wire from a location near Sweet\u2019s residence. Based on these facts, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it denied Sweet\u2019s motion to dismiss based on suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b627 Was there sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"Agr\">\u00b628  On appeal, Sweet contends that the evidence presented to the jury was inadequate to support the jury\u2019s verdict. He argues that because Stradinger and another law enforcement officer controlled the recording of the body wire, they were able to turn it on and off at their discretion and thereby seriously damage the integrity of the tapes. Sweet notes that Stradinger could not remember whether he had searched O\u2019Donnell\u2019s vehicle prior to the November 11, 1995, transaction, that he allowed O\u2019Donnell to stop at a convenience store to get change for the \u201cbuy money\u201d just before the drug transaction, and that he neither observed O\u2019Donnell while he was in the store nor searched his person or vehicle after he exited the store. Sweet adds that Stradinger himself testified that all of his original notations with respect to his contacts with O\u2019Donnell are now destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b629 Finally, Sweet maintains that the entire case turns on the credibility of O\u2019Donnell, the one witness whom the State failed to produce. He concludes that once all of these facts are added up, the evidence is insufficient to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Sweet committed the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b630 The State maintains that the evidence establishes that Sweet sold marijuana to O\u2019Donnell on two separate occasions and fully supports the conviction for the offense of criminal sale of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">\u00b631 Recently, in <em>State v. Plenty Hawk </em>(1997), [285 Mont. 183], 948 P.2d 209, 210, we held that the standard of review for sufficiency of evidence to sustain a criminal conviction is whether, after viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The elements of the crime of criminal sale of dangerous drugs are set forth in \u00a7 45-9-101(1), MCA (1995): \u201cA person commits the offense of criminal sale of dangerous drugs if the person sells, barters, exchanges, gives away, or offers to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any dangerous drug, as defined in 50-32-101.\u201d Marijuana is defined in \u00a7 50-32-101, MCA, as a dangerous drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b632 According to the record, the evidence in this case demonstrated that on the two occasions when Sweet sold marijuana to O\u2019Donnell, O\u2019Donnell was fitted with a body wire, he was searched for any contraband that might be on him prior to going to Sweet\u2019s residence, and he was given enough money to purchase a specified amount of drugs. During the transaction, a detective set up surveillance nearby and listened to and recorded the conversations that occurred inside Sweet\u2019s house. The detective watched O\u2019Donnell go into Sweet\u2019s house with the money, he listened to O\u2019Donnell clearly identify Sweet on the body wire and make the drug purchase, and he watched O\u2019Donnell leave the house with the marijuana. The jury heard the testimony of the detective, as well as the tape recordings of the drug transactions. After viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that any reasonable trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sweet sold marijuana to O\u2019Donnell on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b633 Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict and that the trial court did not err when it denied Sweet\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART, NELSON and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
