Sherlock, Thomas C. Honzel, and Dorothy McCarter (Judges), have, by counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>filed their motion requesting that this Court issue an order dismissing the appeal filed by the Board of Lewis and Clark County Commissioners (Board). The Judges contend that their October 1, 1997 order is not appealable under Rule 1, M.R.App.R The Board has responded, arguing that the order is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b62 In 1997 the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 3-5-602, MCA, to increase the amount of salary for court reporters. The statute went into effect on October 1, 1997, and provided, in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-J\">Each reporter is entitled to receive a base annual salary of not less than $28,000 or more than $35,000 and no other compensation except as provided in 3-5-604, ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b63 The Judges argue that the language \u201cand no other compensation\u201d has been contained in the Montana statute for over 100 years and that despite this language court reporters in this state, working for district Judges, have been receiving fringe benefits in addition to their salary under the statute for decades. The Judges further state that the feoard threatened to discontinue the court reporters\u2019 fringe benefits after October 1, 1997, and that the Judges, accordingly, ordered the Board to continue paying the fringe benefits. The Judges\u2019 order, issued October 1,1997, required the Board to provide the court reporters of the Lewis and Clark County District Court the maximum salary increase authorized by the 1997 Legislature and \u201call county employment benefits they received prior to October 1, 1997, including but not limited to, health insurance, PERS participation, and all other benefits said court reporters received prior to October 1, 1997.\u201d On November 25,1997, the Board appealed this order directly to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u00b64 The Judges maintain that if the Board wishes to take issue with their October 1, 1997 order, the Board is required to file an appropriate civil action \u2014 whether that be a petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to \u00a7 27-26-101, <em>et seq., </em>MCA; a petition for writ of prohibition pursuant to \u00a7 27-27-101, <em>et seq., </em>MCA; or some other action.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u00b65 The Judges contend that Rule 1, M.R.App.P., is very restrictive and specifically requires a civil action or a criminal action to be filed before any party, aggrieved by an order, may appeal. The Judges argue that since the Board has failed to commence any civil action, nor has any civil action been commenced against the Board, there can be no appeal and that the Board\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Judges also point out that since no civil action has been commenced there are no named parties, no case number, nor any court record which can be transmitted on appeal. They contend that their order is simply an \u201cadministrative order\u201d from which an appeal is improper under Rule 1, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b66 In response, the Board argues that the Judges did not issue their order as an idle act \u2014 they expected it to be obeyed unless withdrawn (which it has not been). In fact the Judges expressly provided that failure to abide by the order \u201cwill constitute a contempt of court and subject the county and its commissioners to possible fines and other penalties.\u201d According to the Board, no further steps are needed to effectuate the Judges\u2019 order. The Board faces a clear choice \u2014 abide by the order or face contempt of court charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b67 Under these circumstances, the Board argues that the Judges\u2019 order represents a final order for purposes of Rule 1, M.R.App.R, and it cites to our decision in <em>Butte Silver Bow Local Gov\u2019t v. Olsen </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 77, 743 P.2d 564, wherein we accepted the direct appeal of a similar <em>ex parte </em>funding order of a Montana district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b68 Moreover, the Board argues that the alternative remedy suggested by the Judges would fail to provide the Board with the requisite relief which it seeks. The Board contends that the order is a final appealable order and that the question of whether there might be an alternative approach is purely academic. Furthermore, citing <em>Awareness Group v. School District No. 4 </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 469, 475, 795 P.2d 447, 451, and <em>Billings Associated Plumbing v. State Board of Plumbers </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 249, 254, 602 P.2d 597, 600, the Board contends that a writ of prohibition would provide no relief because the Judges have already acted in issuing their order and because a district court could not order the Judges to refrain from an act that has already occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b69 Similarly, the Board contends that filing a petition for writ of mandamus would be futile since the purpose of the writ is to compel activity and to require the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which he is entitled and from which he is unlawfully precluded. Sections 27-26-101 and 102, MCA. The Board contends that if it opted to disobey the Judges\u2019 order and to await a mandamus action by the affected court reporters, the Board would place itself in contempt of court, which it is not willing to do. Furthermore, the Board cites our decision in <em>Awareness Group </em>for the proposition that filing a petition for a writ of mandamus after the court has already issued its order would be a meaningless act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>See, <em>Awareness Group, </em>795 P.2d at 451. Finally, the Board points out that the Judges\u2019 order is not one from an administrative agency but, rather, is a judicial order from the First Judicial District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b610  We have considered the arguments raised by the Judges and by the Board and conclude that there is merit in each side\u2019s legal position. On the one hand, we tend to agree with the Judges that the order is likely not appealable under Rule 1, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b611 In this regard, however, we note that in <em>Olsen, </em>the case cited by Board, we did entertain a direct appeal of the district court\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>judicial order granting a salary increase to eight members of the court\u2019s staff. As pointed out by the Board, it in fact, does not appear that there was any underlying proceeding or action from which the appeal in that case was taken. <em>Olsen, </em>743 P.2d at 564-65. Notwithstanding, there was no issue or argument raised in <em>Olsen </em>as to whether the district court\u2019s order was directly appealable under Rule 1, M.R.App.P, or whether an underlying civil action or proceeding was a necessary predicate to the appeal. Accordingly, <em>Olsen </em>is not dispositive of the precise issue raised by the Judges in their motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b612  We also tend to agree with the Board that, for the reasons it sets forth in its memorandum of law, neither a petition for writ of prohibition nor a petition for writ of mandamus would be appropriate or provide any meaningful relief given the posture of the case at bar. It would be futile to seek to either prohibit or to compel an act already accomplished. <em>Awareness Group, </em>795 P.2d at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u00b613 Nonetheless, we are concerned that this matter is on direct appeal without any underlying record whatsoever, except for the Judges\u2019 order, and with the potential that, even though the matter at issue appears to be primarily one of law, there may be factual matters which will be of importance to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\u00b614  With all of this in mind, we believe that the better approach in a case such as this is that the party aggrieved by the Judges\u2019 order file an original proceeding in this Court under Rule 17, M.R.App.R This was the sort of procedure that was utilized in <em>Gallatin County v. Eighteenth Judicial District Court </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 33, 930 P.2d 680. In that case the Board of Gallatin County Commissioners instituted an original proceeding in this Court by way of a petition for writ of supervisory control seeking r elief from an order of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court directing the Gallatin County Commissioners to provide and to pay for various jury room facilities at the Gallatin County Law and Justice Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">\u00b615 We accepted supervisory control because of the state-wide importance of the legal issues presented and because it was clear that urgency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>and emergency factors existed, not the least of which was the interest of the Gallatin County taxpayers in avoiding extended litigation beginning at the trial court level. <em>Gallatin County, </em>930 P.2d at 683. \u00b616 Moreover, in that case, since it appeared that a factual record needed to be developed, we were able to remand the entire matter for an evidentiary hearing to a neutral district court judge for the purpose of developing a factual record and more clearly defining the legal issues. Following that hearing and entry of the neutral judge\u2019s findings and conclusions, and with the record developed in the neutral district court, we were able to render our decision on the important legal issues raised. <em>Gallatin County, </em>930 P.2d at 683-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b617 We believe that a similar procedure should be followed in the case at bar. Should the Board choose to do so, it may file a petition for writ of supervisory control with this Court pursuant to Rule 17, M.R.App.P., and raise therein whatever legal questions it determines are at issue as a result of the Judges\u2019 order of October 1,1997. In this regard, and in order to expedite our review of this matter should the Board seek supervisory control, we suggest that the Judges and Board jointly file a statement of agreed facts and attach thereto the Judges\u2019 order and any other documents that are necessary to our review of the legal issue or issues presented. To the extent that the parties cannot agree on certain facts, those disputes can be pointed out and, if we deem it necessary, we can then remand for an evidentiary hearing in a neutral district court as we did in <em>Gallatin County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-k\">\u00b618 On this basis, we conclude that the Judges\u2019 motion to dismiss the Board\u2019s instant appeal should be granted without prejudice to the underlying merits of the case. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b619 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judges\u2019 motion to dismiss should be and the same is, hereby, GRANTED, and the appeal of the Board in this cause is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE MERITS.</p>\n<p id=\"AAK\">\u00b620 IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court give notice of this order by mail to counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b621 DATED this 13th day of January, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">/S/J.
