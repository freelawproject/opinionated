The Smiths asked the court to enjoin the defendants from taking further action with regard to the examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 income tax returns for 1977, 1978, and 1979. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, finding that the Smiths\u2019 suit for injunctive relief is barred by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a), a statutory provision that prohibits injunctions to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes. The plaintiffs appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">\n<em>The Context Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">The Smiths filed joint individual income tax returns for 1977, 1978, and 1979. On August 6, 1979, the IRS mailed a letter to the Smiths. The letter requested certain personal records from the plaintiffs, and it stated that the information was needed \u201cto verify certain items recorded on your return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-17\">In late 1979, the Smiths were informed by telephone that agent Rich had been assigned to investigate their 1978 tax return. By letter of May 1, 1980, Rich gave the Smiths formal written notice that she would be examining their 1978 return. Rich further stated in her letter: \u201cYour 1979 return is being picked up by me for examination due to the results of the 1977 and 1978 examination. The 1979 return will be handled in the same manner as the 1977 and 1978 returns; all deductions are being disallowed because no substantiation has been provided.\u201d Rich also requested the Smiths to mail her a copy of their 1979 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-18\">The Smiths apparently declined to' provide any of the information requested by IRS. They did, however, ask the IRS why their returns had been selected for examination, but the IRS did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-19\">The Smiths then filed the instant suit for injunctive relief. They alleged that, because they signed their returns \u201cunder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>oath,\u201d i.e., under penalty of perjury, the IRS could not \u201ctraverse\u201d their oath without first showing cause or expressing reasons why the returns were thought to contain incorrect information. The plaintiffs also averred that agent Rich had harassed them by threatening to disallow deductions in the absence of substantiation. The Smiths did <em>not </em>allege, however, that the IRS had sent them a notice of deficiency, assessed them for any deficiency, or attempted to collect any deficiency; and in their brief to this court they state that no such deficiency notice was sent to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The district court subsequently granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 suit. The court noted that the plaintiffs had cited no statutory authority or case law in support of their position, and that they had made only \u201cvague allegations of constitutional violations.\u201d The court construed the Smiths\u2019 action as \u201can attempt to prevent assessment of taxes by initially foreclosing any investigation by the IRS,\u201d an attempt that \u201cflies in the face of the policy requiring a minimum of pre-enforcement judicial interference.\u201d Accordingly, the district court accepted the defendants\u2019 contention that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) barred the plaintiffs from seeking injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">On this appeal, the Smiths contend that the district court erred: 1) by dismissing their complaint without an evidentiary hearing, and 2) by giving inadequate consideration to the Smiths\u2019 reliance upon \u201cthe procedural device of traverse\u201d and the \u201ctaxing procedures under the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">\n<em>The \u201cAnti-Injunction Act\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">The district court dismissed this suit as barred by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a), sometimes popularly referred to as the \u201cAnti-Injunction Act\u201d or the \u201cAnti-Tax Injunction Act.\u201d With certain specified exceptions, this provision bars any suit in any court \u201cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of the statute is \u201cthe protection of the Government\u2019s need to assess and collect taxes as expeditiously as possible with a minimum of pre-enforcement judicial interference \u2018and to require that the legal right to the disputed sums be determined in a suit for refund.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 736, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 2046, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974). A \u201ccollateral objective\u201d of the statute is the \u201c \u2018protection of the collector from litigation pending a suit for refund.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>416 U.S. at 737, 94 S.Ct. at 2046. See also <em>Alexander v. \u201cAmericans United\u201d Inc., </em>416 U.S. 752, 94 S.Ct. 2053, 40 L.Ed.2d 518 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">The \u00a7 7421(a) ban against judicial interference is applicable not only to the assessment or collection itself, but is equally applicable to activities which are intended to or may culminate in the assessment or collection of taxes. <em>Kemlon Products &amp; Development Co. v. United States, </em>638 F.2d 1315, 1320 (5th Cir.) <em>modified, </em>646 F.2d 223 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 320, 70 L.Ed.2d 162 (1981); <em>United States v. Dema, </em>544 F.2d 1373, 1376 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1093, 97 S.Ct. 1106, 51 L.Ed.2d 539 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-14\">In addition to the specified statutory exceptions to the prohibition against tax collection injunctions, the Supreme Court has recognized that there might be a judicially created exception where, under the most liberal view of the facts and law, the government cannot win; in such an instance, the government is viewed as attempting an exaction that is \u201cmerely in \u2018the guise of a tax.\u2019 \u201d <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., </em>370 U.S. 1, 6-7, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>S.Ct. 1125, 1128-29, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962). <em>See also Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, </em>424 U.S. 614, 627, 96 S.Ct. 1062, 1070, 47 L.Ed.2d 278 (1976). Even there, additionally, equity jurisdiction must otherwise exist, in the sense that the taxpayer will suffer irreparable injury for which no legal remedy is adequate, id. (but not including the injury that might result merely from the collection of the taxes themselves, <em>Enochs, </em>370 U.S. at 6, 82 S.Ct. at 1128-29). In the present case, the taxpayers do not claim injunctive relief under the <em>Enochs </em>exception; and, indeed, the allegations and the statutory refund procedure negate that either prong of the <em>Enochs </em>test is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">The district court\u2019s holding that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) bars this suit for injunctive relief is plainly correct, under both the express wording of the statute and the judicial interpretations thereof. If so, obviously without merit is the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that an evidentiary hearing was requisite, and nor is there any need to discuss the merits (or rather lack thereof) of the basis for relief set forth by the substantive allegations of the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">\n<em>The Statutory Exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act Relied Upon</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">The plaintiffs contend, however, that their injunction suit is permissible because it falls within the explicit exceptions (see footnote 1) to the statute\u2019s prohibition against tax-assessment injunctions. They rely upon the excepted actions permitted under \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a) and (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 6213(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">The Smiths first rely on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a) and (c), which establish that, once the IRS issues a notice of deficiency for a particular year and the taxpayer petitions the Tax Court for redetermination, the IRS may not (with certain exceptions) determine greater deficiencies for the same period. \u00a7 7421(a) indicates that any \u25a0 attempt by the IRS to determine a greater deficiency under such circumstances may be enjoined. In the present case, however, the Smiths have not alleged that the IRS had made a determination of <em>any </em>deficiency, much less a second determination of greater deficiency. Nor have the Smiths contended that they have petitioned the Tax Court for redetermination. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 6212 is applicable to their case is insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Similarly, the Smiths\u2019 reliance on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a) is totally misplaced. That provision provides that, with certain exceptions, once the IRS mails a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer, an income tax deficiency cannot be assessed and no levy or court proceeding for the collection of any deficiency shall be made, begun, or prosecuted, until after the taxpayer\u2019s period for petitioning the Tax Court has expired, or, if the taxpayer petitions the Tax Court, the decision of that court becomes final. Any attempt by the IRS to assess, levy, or bring suit in violation of this provision is enjoinable. In the present case, however, the plaintiffs have not alleged that the IRS has made any assessment or levy, or brought any suit, or even that the IRS has mailed them notice of any deficiency. Thus, \u00a7 6213(a) is of no help to the Smiths.</p>\n<p id=\"A9TR\">\n<em>The Injunctive Remedy Sought</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">The Smiths claim that unless the IRS is required to show cause before requesting corroborative information about their tax returns, they will be unable to determine whether the IRS wants the information for a legitimate investigatory purpose or for some prohibited purpose. <em>Cf., United States v. First National Bank in Dallas, </em>635 F.2d 391, 395-96 (5th Cir. 1980). They contend that they cannot protect this claimed interest other than by this injunctive suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">The Smiths overlook 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7402(b) and 7604, which recognize that the IRS cannot <em>compel </em>taxpayers to produce documents without court intervention. If the IRS applies to a court to seek enforcement of a summons for the requested information, the Smiths can then raise any claims of harassment or improper purpose. Although the IRS would not need to show probable cause to obtain enforcement of a summons, the IRS would then have to show \u201cthat the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, that the information sought is not already within the Commissioner\u2019s possession, and that the administrative steps required by the [Internal Revenue] Code have been followed.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 255, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). <em>See also United States v. Bisceglia, </em>420 U.S. 141, 145-47, 95 S.Ct. 915, 918-19, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiP\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court that dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-9\">(a) Tax. \u2014 Except as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c), 6213(a), and 7426(a) and (b)(1), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-15\">The statutory exceptions relate to notices of additional deficiency after a first notice was sent (6212(a) and (c) \u2014 see footnote 3 and text that follows), to an assessment or levy made upon a notice of deficiency before the delay for petitioning the Tax Court has expired (6213(a) \u2014see footnote 4 and text that follows), and to a wrongful levy upon property claimed by a third person (i.e., not the taxpayer).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">. For instance, with regard to a contention re-urged before us in seeming disregard of the investigative procedures authorized by the Internal Revenue Code, the district court stated: \u201cThe gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that the income tax returns filed by them were made under oath and that the government must show proper cause to traverse plaintiffs\u2019 oath. Plaintiffs cite no statute nor case law for the proposition that the government must show proper cause to traverse plaintiffs\u2019 returns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a) and (c) provide, pertinently to present claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-7\">(a) In general. \u2014 If the Secretary determines that there is a deficiency in respect of any tax imposed by subtitles A or B or chapter 41, 42, 43, 44, or 45, he is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by certified mail or registered mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-8\"># 5(S * ifc * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-9\">(c) Further deficiency letters restricted.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-10\">(1) General rule. \u2014 If the Secretary has mailed to the taxpayer a notice of deficiency as provided in subsection (a), and the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in section 6213(a), the Secretary shall have no right to determine any additional deficiency of income tax for the same taxable year, * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1303-15\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a) provides:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APb\">(a) Time for filing petition and restriction on assessment. \u2014 Within 90 days, or 150 days if the notice is addressed to a person outside the United States, after the notice of deficiency authorized in section 6212 is mailed (not counting Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the last day), the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. Except as otherwise provided in section 6851 or section 6861 no assessment of a deficiency in respect of any tax imposed by subtitle A or B, chapter 41, 42, 43, 44, or 45 and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such 90-day or 150-day period, as the case may be, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court has become final. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">. Of course, with or without obtaining the requested records, the IRS may proceed to determine a deficiency owed by the Smiths to the government. However, the plaintiffs\u2019 rights would be fully protected in any event, because they could petition the Tax Court for a redetermination, or they could pay the tax and then proceed with a suit for refund. <em>See Dema, supra, </em>544 F.2d at 1377.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
