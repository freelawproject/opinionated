Booker</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>120 Fed.Appx. 785 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">On appeal, Appellant challenges his 87-month sentence, imposed pursuant to his guilty plea, for knowingly transporting child pornography through the Internet by computer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(l). In his initial brief, Dockery argued that the- district court erred by enhancing his sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), because he did not engage in a pattern of activity involving the attempted sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor, within the meaning of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). More specifically, Appellant asserted that because he did not show up for Internet-arranged meetings with the minors, he took no \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward the alleged criminal conduct. Appellant did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence, nor did he assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-18\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the ease as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 990 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cDefendant abandoned the <em>[Apprendi] </em>indictment issue by not raising the issue in his initial brief.\u201d). In the initial brief in this case, Appellant likewise asserted no such <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, Appellant\u2019s sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">OPINION REINSTATED IN PART; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
