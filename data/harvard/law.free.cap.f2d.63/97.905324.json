It may be said, however, that we are of the opinion that-the aliens, having been permitted to enter or land temporarily for four months, by intentionally remaining or refusing to depart after that time, were in the United States in violation of the laws of the United States. Section 2 (a) (4) of the Quota Act of May 19, 1921. United States v. Day (C. C. A.) 43 F.(2d) 917; Hurst v. Nagle (C. C. A.) 30 F.(2d) 346; Domenici v. Johnson (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 433; Wong Hop v. United States (C. C. A.) 35 F.(2d) 596; Rule 3, subdivision H, of Rules and Regulations Act February 5, 1917, and May 26, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">Section 19 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917 (39 Stat. 889, 8 USCA \u00a7 155) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-17\">\u201cAt any time within five years after entry, any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law; any alien who shall have entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>or who shall be found in the United States in violation of this subehapter, or in violation of any other law of the United States; \u00bb * * at any time within three years after entry, any alien who shall have entered the United States by <em>water </em>at any time or place <em>other than </em>as designated by immigration officials, or by <em>land </em>at any place <em>other than </em>one designated as a port of entry for aliens by the Commissioner General of Immigration, or at any time not designated by immigration officials, or who enters without inspection, shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody and deported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4g\">It will be observed that the clause of section 19 under which the appellant is sought to be deported is not the first one containing the five-year limitation, nor the last-quoted clause containing the three-year limitation, but is the second clause of the section which contains no limitation and provides that \u201cany alien who shall have <em>entered </em>or who shall be <em>found </em>in the United States in violation of this subchapter, or in violation of <em>any other lav) </em>of the United States\u201d shall be deported; and that, unless the five-year limitation of the first clause applies to the second one, then there is no time limit upon the power of removal of the class of aliens specified in the second clause.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">, In Costanzo v. Tillinghast, 56 F.(2d) 566, Cafaro v. Tillinghast (D. C.) 31 F.(2d) 384, affirmed 31 F.(2d) 1009, and Tillinghast v. Cresswell, 54 F.(2d) 459, this court held that the five-year limitation contained in the first clause of section 19 did not apply to the later clauses of the section which fixed no time limit, and the Supreme Court, in reviewing our decision in Costanzo v. Tillinghast, 287 U. S. 341, 53 S. Ct. 152, 77 L. Ed.-, decided December 5, 1932, upheld the ruling of this court in that particular.</p>\n<p id=\"A7gp\">But if either of the clauses containing the five or three-year limitation is applicable to this case, even then, on the facts here appearing, the deportation proceedings were \u25a0seasonably instituted. The aliens entered the country April 16, 1924. The warrant of arrest issued May 14, 1925, or within a year and a month after the entry of the aliens into the country. The deportation proceedings were \u201cinstituted\u201d within the meaning of sections 19 and 20 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917 (8 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 155, 156), when the warrant of arrest was issued. Costanzo v. Tillinghast, 287 U. S. 341, 53 S. Ct. 152, 77 L. Ed.-, supra, decided December 5, 1932; Id. (C. C. A.) 56 F.(2d) 566, 567; Tillinghast v. Cresswell (C. C. A.) 54 F.(2d) 459. It cannot be that, after a warrant of arrest has issued, the alien may keep the statute tolling by concealing himself and thus avoiding arrest. Congress could not have entertained such an intention. To so construe the law would be to put a premium on the capacity of the alien to avoid arrest and defeat the purpose of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"AFbJ\">The order or decree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
