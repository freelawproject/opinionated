The Commissioner of eternal Revenue, being influeneed by the deeisio.ns in Warner v. Walsh (C. C. A.) 15 F.(2d) 367, United States v. Bolster (C. C. A.) 26 F.(2d) 760, 59 A. L. R. 491, and Allen v. Brandeis (C. C. A.) 29 F.(2d) 363, \u2022 disallowed the deductions and</p>\n<p id=\"Atb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>assessed deficiency taxes against the trustees. On appeal the United States Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner on authority of its decision in Julia Butterworth et al., Trustees, 23 B. T. A. 838, 839. The ease is in this court on the trustees\u2019 petition to review tho action of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The question decided by the Board and submit! ed here for review \u2014 the right of a trustee under the statutes, when computing taxable income, to deduct income distributed, after election, to a widow as beneficiary \u2014is the same question decided in different ways by the Board and by this court in Butterworth v. Commissioner, 63 F.(2d) 944, arising, however, from a different state of facts. In the Butterworth Case as in the three cited eases in the Circuit Courts of Appeals, the widow received income from the trust. In none of these cases was she entitled to principal. In none was her interest an annuity in a purely technical sense. The latter three cases held, however, that her interest in the trust was, on her election, \u201cin fact and in legal effect tho <em>purchase </em>of an annuity,\u201d limited, however, to income; whereas in the instant ease the bequest is of a fixed annuity which, though payable primarily out of income, is seemingly payable at all events, whether from income or principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">On this difference between the cases referred to and the present case, the Board cited and the government relies on Whitehouse v. Commissioner, 7 B. T. A. 600, affirmed in (C. C. A.) 38 F.(2d) 162, and in turn affirmed in 283 U. S. 148, 51 S. Ct. 374, 75 L. Ed. 916, 73 A. L. R. 1534, as making this ease even stronger than Butterworth v. Commissioner. In Whitehouse v. Commissioner the court held that where an annuity is bequeathed as a definite sum payable at all events, payments \u201creceived\u201d by the donee (not there a widow) are not part of the donee\u2019s gross income but are exempted therefrom as property acquired by gift or bequest. Thus it appears that in Whitehouse v. Commissioner and in the eases in the Circuit Courts of Appeals on which the Board founded its decision in the Butterworth Case, the courts were concerned, and concerned only, with the tax liability of the recipients of trust funds. None of these cases dealt with the tax liability of trust estates with respect to income paid to a widow or annuitant. They decide simply that the widow in the one case, and the annuitant in the other, is, for different reasons, exempted from taxes, and unless it follows that, because of such exemption; the income is taxable to the trust estate, they afford no authority for the Board\u2019s conclusion. Tho question with wliich we are coueerned is not the tax liability of a widow or annuitant, but the liability of the trust estate to pay taxes from which she is exempt. The fact that the annuity was given to- a widow lends nothing to tho case. It makes no difference whether it is to a widow or to a daughter, as the sole question is whether an annuitant, he she widow or some one else, is a beneficiary within tho terms of the statutes under review and in the sense in which the word is ordinarily used and understood. If she is a beneficiary, the trustees were allowed by tho statutes to deduct distributions of income made to her. This brings us back to the reasons for our decision in Butterworth v. Commissioner which, we hold, rules the instant case and calls for a reversal of the judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">THOMPSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
