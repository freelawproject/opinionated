The pertinent statute, Revenue Act 1921, \u00a7 214 (a) (1), 42; Stat. 239; Revenue Act 1924, \u00a7 214 (a) (1), 26 USCA \u00a7 955 (a) (1), provides for the deduction of \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid * * * in carrying on any trade or business,\u201d and the question involved is \u201cwhether fees paid by petitioner to her attorneys in a suit to recover additional income from certain trusts of which she was beneficiary are deductible from her gross income.\u201d Statement of the facts is to decide the ease. The petitioner was trying to surcharge her trustees in the administration of the trust. In so doing she was not engaged in any trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-26\">The Tax Board rightly held she was not entitled to the deduction, and its order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
