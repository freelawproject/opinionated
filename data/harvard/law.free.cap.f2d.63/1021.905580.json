Nor did the Hedger Company assign error on that point as it had a favorable decision below. Since neither Leach nor Canada-Atlantic filed any assignments at all, the Sutton\u2019s right to limitation was. not raised, and accordingly our mandate will be amended by striking out that part which denies limitation to the Sutton.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
