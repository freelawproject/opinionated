The facts are fully set out in the opinion of the court below. 33 F.(2d) 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-23\">The certificate of arrival' attached to the petition reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-24\">\u201cU. S. Department of Labor</p>\n<p id=\"Ad2V\">\u201cBureau of Naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-25\">\u201cCertificate of Arrival Division Ellis Island, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-26\">\u201cApril 2, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-27\">\u201cThis is to certify that the following-named alien arrived in the United States on the date and in the manner described below, at Ellis Island,,New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-28\">\u201cName of alien: Fanariotis, Stelios.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-29\">\u201cDate of arrival: September 1, 1923. Data taken from crew list, member of crew, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>no record of admission for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u201cManner of arrival: Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u201cBy Direction of the Secretary of Labor:</p>\n<p id=\"Atd\">\u201cRaymond F.

C.) 209 F. 143, In re Schmidt (D. C.) 207 F. 678, and In re Cassovel (D. C.) 33 F.(2d) 1002], nevertheless the certificate of arrival set out above discloses that the denial by the District Court of the right of the petitioner to be admitted to citizenship was based upon the insufficiency of the petition in a matter of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The Act of May 19, 1921, \u201cAn Act To limit the immigration of aliens into the United States,\u201d 42 Stat. 5, c. 8, \u00a7 2 (a), provides: \u201cThat the number of aliens of any nationality who may be admitted under the immigration laws to the United States in any fiscal year shall be limited to 3 per centum of the number of foreign-horn persons of such nationality resident in the United States as determined by the United States census of 1910.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Inasmuch as the petition does not set out any facts to show that at the date of the alien\u2019s arrival, September 1, 1923, he came within the limitation of the act of 1921, the District Judge rightly held that it was not shown that the alien had been admitted for such permanent residence as would entitle him to naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The decree dismissing the petition is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
