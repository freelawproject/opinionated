The defendant-appellee, by answer and eross-claim, denied the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s right to the trade-mark, alleged that its trade-mark rights had been infringed, and asked for an injunction perpetually restraining the appellant from using the trademark \u201cDel Monte\u201d on coffee. In a supplement to its answer and eross-eomplaint, the appellee asked for damages, which it asserted to be $1,000,000. Additional pleadings were filed by both parties, and a lengthy trial was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The lower court entered a decree enjoining the appellant, perpetually, from using the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d on coffee \u201cnot by or for the defendant [appellee] made.\u201d In an amended decree, the court below awarded costs, amounting to $533.03, in favor of the appellee and against the appellant. In a memorandum opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District Court declared that because of the appellant\u2019s good faith and because of the fact that the appellee had not proved actual damage, there would be no award of damages in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Tillman &amp; Bendel, Inc., the appellant herein, was established in 1857 under the name of F. Tillman &amp; Co., a partnership, by F. Tillman, father of Frederick Tillman, a witness in this case, and grandfather of F. A. Tillman, president of the appellant and its predecessor company since 1915. The concern was incorporated on December 31, 1891, and was re-incorporated, under the style of Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel, Ine., in 1920. Under an agreement dated April 1,1920, Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel transferred to Tillman &amp; Bendel, Inc., all of the old corporation\u2019s \u201ctrademarks, trade names, patents, and inventions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Up to 1924 the appellant and its predecessors had been engaged in the \u201cdiversified wholesale grocery business.\u201d In 1924 the corporation, under the direction of F. A. Tillman, the grandson, liquidated the different departments of its business, except the manufacturing department, \u201cwhich was always the profitable end of the business.\u201d The company thereafter manufactured tea, coffee, spices, and extracts, until about 1926', when it \u201cdecided to eliminate the manufacture of spices and extracts and.give up teas, and concentrate all [its] efforts on coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">In the late eighties, Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel began selling coffee under the name \u201cDel Monte.\u201d The testimony varies as to the precise year, but it was probably some time between 1886 and 1888. The court found the year to be 1887, or prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">The origin of the name is relied upon by the court below and by the appellee as indicating that, as used by the appellant, \u201cDel Monte\u201d was a grade mark and not a trademark. For that reason a brief history of such origin will bo helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">In about the year 1886, George Schonewald, buyer for Hotel Del Monte, near Monterey, Cal., and later buyer for Castle Crag, purchased a blend of coffee from Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel which pleased him so mueh that he insisted it bo stenciled \u201cDel Monte.\u201d According to ono of the appellant\u2019s witnesses, the quality of the merchandise likewise so pleased Mr. Schonewald \u201cthat h.e told his patrons, his friends, and little by little a demand manifested itself for Del Monte goods, * * *\u25a0 and [the appellant] commenced to list Del Monte commodities under the Del Monte brand * * * and many people, private.' individuals, friends of ours, heard about it,, and used to prevail upon us to sell them the Del Monte blend.\u201d The court found substantially in accordance with this testimony, but also found that the appellant used the name merely as a grade mark and not a trade-mark, until 1925, when- the appellant attempted a, trade-mark use.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">The court below also found that \u201cprior to the year 1927, plaintiff [appellant] did sell coffee under the name Del Monte in the states of California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington,, Montana, and Arizona, but not elsewhere.\u201d The appellant, indeed, concedes that \u201cduring the succeeding years and until 1926, the Del Monte <em>coffee </em>business of Tillman &amp; Bendel continued to be very largely a western business.\u201d The appellant also concedes that \u201cmeanwhile, between 1904 and 1918, the defendant [appellee] and its predecessor company were establishing markets in all parts of the country for their Del Monte <em>fruits and vegetables.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">In 1926, following the liquidation of all of the appellant\u2019s business save the manufacturing, as set forth above, the appellant \u201cmade plans for an extension\u201d of its coffee-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>business. In furtherance of these plans, its president, F. A. Tillman, made several trips east, during which he came into contact with brokers and called on a great niany large accounts throughout the United States. Other representatives of the appellant made similar trips. These trips covered a period extending from June, 1927, to December, 1929'. Other promotional work was undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">As a result of this sales campaign, the appellant established an extensive market for its Del Monte coffee in the middle west and in the east. One of the appellant\u2019s exhibits in the court below is a comparative table of sales of Tillman &amp; Bendel\u2019s Del Monte coffee, as follows: 1925-, 9',302 pounds; 1926, 8,329' pounds; 1927, 301,196 pounds; 1928, 227,506 pounds. The present suit was filed on January 14,1929'. Another exhibit, showing the sales of the appellant\u2019s Del Monte coffee by localities, discloses considerable distribution in sections east of the Mississippi river.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">But there is no affirmative evidence that any confusion disadvantageous to the appellant has resulted from the sale of the two Del Monte brands, either in the east or the west, and the lower court so found. Five pieces of testimony do, indeed, indicate that there might have been confusion in favor of the appellee and disadvantageous to the appellant, but speculation and inference cannot take the place of affirmative proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We refer to the testimony of T. S. Spaulding, a grocer of Woodland, Yolo county, Cal., who stated that \u201cin the early days,\u201d in the year 1888, the appellant\u2019s coffee bearing the Del Monte brand was better known than the appellee\u2019s Del Monte fruits and vegetables ; the testimony of L. B. Taft, a grocery broker of Salt Lake City, to the effect that in 1929' and the early part of 1930, the \u201cCalifornia Packing Corporation, covering practically the same territory as we did, had stepped in [with its Del Monte coffee] with a considerably larger sales organization than we have, and had gathered in the business that we had established on our Del Monte coffee [of the appellant]\u201d; the testimony of Frank II. Cooney, merchandise broker of Butte, Mont., who said that \u201cthe effect of this [Del Monte] advertising of the California Packing Corporation upon our sales of Del Monte coffee of Tillman &amp; Bendel has been that it has almost ruined it\u201d; the statement of F. A. Tillman as to the \u201cdisastrous\u201d effect of the appellee\u2019s Del Monte, coffee advertising upon the Tillman Del Monte coffee business; and the assertion of Kenneth <em>G. </em>Blodgett,-a Boston merchandise broker, that an impression given by a representative of the appellee to the effect that Tillman &amp; Bendel had \u201csold out\u201d, to the appellee, had lost Mr. Blodgett a customer for the appellant\u2019s Del Monte coffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">It will be noted that nowhere in the foregoing testimony is there a statement that a single can of the appellee\u2019s coffee was sold to a customer who believed that he was buying the appellant\u2019s product. Furthermore, all the evidence as to confusion whereby the appellant <em>might </em>have been damaged was in the form of testimony given in open court, and the District Judg'e was better qualified to pass upon the weight to be given to it \u2014 especially when several of the appellant\u2019s own witnesses testified that there was no confusion, one way or the other, in the minds of retailers or their employees, or in the minds of the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">There is, on the other hand, considerable evidence of confusion between the appellant\u2019s and the appellee\u2019s Del Monte coffees disadvantageous to the appellee; that is to say, confusion whereby purchasers of the appellant\u2019s Del Monte coffee believed they were buying Del Monte coffee put out by the appellee, as a result of which confusion it is safe to assume that the appellee lost numerous sales of its own coffee. We will take up the evidence of this confusion in its proper place, as part of the discussion of the appellee\u2019s history, to which we now turn our attention. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The appellee\u2019s first predecessor, the' Oakland Preserving Company, was incorporated on April 14, 1891. Frederick Tillman, the father of F. A. Tillman, the president of the appellant since 1915, was the incorporator and the president of the Oakland Company. In 1899 that company combined with certain other corporations to form the California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association. In 1916 the California Packing Corporation, the appellee herein, took over the business of the California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association, including the latter\u2019s brands, good will, and trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The Oakland Preserving Company began using the name Del Monte on its canned fruits and vegetables some time prior to June, 1891.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Frederick Tillman, who at that time owned the controlling interest in the Oakland Company and also was a partner in the firm of Tillman &amp; Bendel, suggested that the Oakland Company use the name Del Monte on its products. The story of the origin of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>name, so far as the appellee\u2019s predecessor is concerned, is told by Charles William Pike of San Francisco, who built the Oakland plant for Mr. Tillman: \u201cBefore we started operating [in June, 1891] Frederick Tillman and I decided to select the brands to be used, and at that time there were three pound extras of the higher grade and two- and one-half pound extra standard, standard and second. I suggested at that period that we use the Oakland name for extras, that we should have two brands, and Fred Tillman suggested the word \u2018Del Monte\u2019 and I, happily, approved of it, and that was the birth of the Del <em>Monte </em>brand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In its answer to the appellee\u2019s cross-complaint-, the appellant admits: \u201cThat shortly after the creation and organization of Oakland Preserving Company the said Frederick Tillman personally suggested and caused the said Oakland Preserving Company, .of which he was president, to adopt the name Del Monte as its trade mark for canned fruits and canned vegetables; but plaintiff is without knowledge as to whether large or any quantities of the goods, canned fruits and canned vegetables, of said company, bearing the trade mark Del Monte, were sold, and/or distributed throughout tho United States.\u201d The lower court found that the appellee\u2019s .averments as to the suggestion of the name by Tillman wore true, but also found, \u201cas a matter of law, that the facts set forth in said averments are not sufficient to estop the plaintiff from asserting its claim as set forth in its bill of complaint herein or otherwise.\u201d Since the appellee has filed no cross-appeal, and since no plain error of law is involved in the court\u2019s finding, it will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Oakland Preserving Company executed a bill of sale transferring all its business and good will and trade-marks- to the California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association, and tho latter company, as we have seen, did likewise in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The development of the appellee\u2019s business; the magnitude of its publicity campaign, whereby the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d has literally become a household word, as being the brand of goods produced by the appellee; the \u201chigh reputation established by the appellee\u201d; \u201cits high standard of quality\u201d; its \u201ccare in the preparation of its products\u201d \u2014 -all these and kindred matters have already been settled by this court, in the case of Del Monte Special Food Company v. California Packing Corporation, 34 F.(2d) 774, <em>775. </em>Those facts need not be rehearsed here. For the sake of historical completeness, however, we will quote from that decision an excerpt in which the growth of the appellee is briefly traced:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\u201cBeginning 35 years ago, the appellee and its predecessors have organized and established a vast business in the production and sale of various food products, all labeled \u2018Del Monte Brand.\u2019 The words \u2018Del Monte\u2019 in 0\u2019ld English type conspicuously displayed upon a shield coupled with the word \u2018Brand\u2019 constitute the most prominent characteristic of the goods produced by the appellee. The name of appellee is printed upon its labels, but in a type so inconspicuous that it would hardly be noted when the goods were displayed upon the shelves of the grocery store, and might even escape closer inspection. In its advertising matter, as well as in its method of labeling its products, the emphasis is placed entirely upon the \u2018Del Monte Brand,\u2019 and little or no emphasis upon the name of the producer. The business has grown until the annual sales of the appellee aggregate over thirty millions of dollars, and it is estimated that the number of cans and packages labeled \u2018Del Monte Brand\u2019 disposed of in a year exceed 100,000,000. The advertising expenditures of the appellee in making known its Del Monte Brand products has exceeded $2,000,000 in 1927, and the total expenditure for advertising these products has exceeded $11,800,000. The appellee\u2019s business has been constantly expanding, not only in volume but in the diversity of products produced and labeled with its brand, until at the present time it markets over 150 food products under the name \u2018Del Monte Brand,\u2019 all being sold in grocery\" stores. The public has become familiar not only with the label of the appellee but with their course of business by which they have gradually extended their operations to other food products.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\u201cFrom time to time the appellee has registered the \u2018Del Monte Brand\u2019 with the shield as a trade-mark for use in connection with various food products prepared and marketed by it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">In the instant case the lower -court made findings in substantial agreement with most of the statements contained in the foregoing excerpt, and there was ample evidence to sustain such findings. By stipulation it is a settled fact in this ease that \u201cby 1918 the California Packing Corporation had established markets for its entire lino of Del Monte products throughout the territory of the entire United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">It was stipulated, however, that \u201cthere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>was no substantial commercial sale of coffee\u201d by the appellee \u201cprior to 1928.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In view of these facts, it now becomes necessary for us to revert to the question of confusion, already touched upon herein. Did the appellant\u2019s entry with its Del Monte coffee into the eastern food market, where, by stipulation, the appellee\u2019s Del Monte brand was firmly entrenched, cause confusion in the minds of the buying public? In other words, did an appreciable number of persons buy Tillman &amp; Bendel\u2019s Del Monte coffee under the belief that it was in reality a product of the appellee?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The court below found that there had been such confusion, and the record contains abundant evidence sustaining that finding. In one of the appellee\u2019s exhibits there is a stipulation that the depositions of a large number of persons may be deemed to have been taken, tending to show confusion in the minds of approximately 150 persons, both housewives and storekeepers, as to whether or not the appellee was manufacturing or producing Tillman &amp; Bendel Del Monte coffee. In this stipulation as to deposition testimony, many of the witnesses named expressed the actual belief that when they purchased Tillman\u2019s Del Monte coffee they \u201cthought that it was a product of the same concern that paeked Del Monte fruits and Del Monte vegetables.\u201d It is true that a number of these persons later, by oral testimony or by deposition, qualified or repudiated their stipulated statements. There still remains, however, a considerable residuum of unassailed stipulated testimony as to this confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">There is abundant other evidence, however, as to the widespread mistaken belief that the appellant\u2019s coffee was being marketed by the appellee. For example, R. M. Slee, manager of a Piggly Wiggly store in San Francisco, testified: \u201cWe were carrying Del Monte brand coffee put up by Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel. I knew it was put up by Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Company, but I had always seen the Del Monte label associated with the California Packing Corporation name, so I just merely assumed that Tillman &amp; Bendel were just associated with the California Packing Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Similarly, Ray Silver, manager of the MacMarr Stores, Limited, in San Francisco, said that he informed an inquirer that Tillman\u2019s Del Monte coffee was \u201cput out by the California Packing Corporation\u201d; and, upon being told that the can bore the name of Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel, he replied that \u201cit was more . than likely packed by Tillman &amp; Bendel for the Del Monte people,\u201d meaning the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Again, Harry L. Haines, a witness for the appellant, testified as to the confusion prevailing among many of his customers at first: \u201cI advised people upon many occasions that the Del Monte coffee was not put out by the California Packing Corporation. People were constantly inquiring if it was at the beginning; they seemed very much surprised that there were two companies. Some of the people were under the impression that it was put out by the California Packing Corporation; some of them looked at the can, being of a different color, and so forth, and while the name was the same the label was entirely different. On a number of occasions people were surprised at finding it wasn\u2019t packed by the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">B\u00f3yd Sturgess, another witness for the appellant, stated that he \u201cbelieved that there was a good deal of the [appellant\u2019s] coffee that was sold that went out with the understanding it was put out by the California Packing Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Still another of the appellant\u2019s witnesses, Earl Simpson, who had been in the grocery business at Salem, Or., for about twenty-three years, expressed what seems to us a practical, common-sense view, which becomes particularly apposite in connection with the. appellant\u2019s contention that it should not be held responsible for the \u201ccarelessness\u201d of purchasers: \u201cIt is not usual for customers to look over a can to see who it is manufactured by or to see whether it is some name that they don\u2019t know anything about, or to see what the name of the manufacturer is on the can or label.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">If, as we believe, it is not usual for customers to scrutinize labels with microscopic care, those who do not do so can scarcely be called \u201ccareless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Another federal court, besides the court below, has already passed upon the issue of confusion, unfavorably to the appellant. We allude to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, which, in a suit between the identical parties, found as follows: \u201c * * * We conclude that coffee in one-pound tin cans, sold in grocery stores to the same customers who buy the 150 grocery food products manufactured by appellant [the appellee herein], would * * * lead to confusion and mistake in the purchaser believing that the coffee of appellee [the appellant herein], was the goods of appellant. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">That litigation was entitled California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Packing Corporation v. Tillman &amp; Bendel, Inc. (Cust. <em>&amp; </em>Pat. App.) and is reported in 40 F.(2d) 108, 113. It was an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents dismissing a notice of opposition filed by the California Packing Corporation to the registration by Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel, Inc., of \u201cDel Monte\u201d as a trade-mark for coffee. Tillman &amp; Bend el\u2019s application was filed February 21, 3925.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">It is true that in the registration ease the court carefully limited the scope of its decision: \u201cWe are only concerned in this action with appellee\u2019s right of <em>registration </em>of the trade-mark and not with its <em>use </em>of the same. As to whether appellee, in law, has the right to use the trade-mark \u2018Del Monte\u2019 on coffee in containers of any description, or whether it has the right to use it in markets confined to the West coast or throughout the world, are questions not before us and are not decided. We do decide that such a statement of facts is not shown here as would warrant this court in saying that appellee was entitled to the <em>exclusive </em>nse of the words on \u25a0coffee, the right to such exclusive use being implied from the right to registration.\u201d Page 113 of 40 F.(2d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We are quite aware that, as the appellant so earnestly argues, a decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is not res adjudicata. Dwight &amp; Lloyd Sintering Co., Inc., v. Greenawalt, etc. (C. C. A. 2) 27 F.(2d) 823, 827. Nevertheless, a well-considered opinion by that federal tribunal, upon an issue so peculiarly within its province, is entitled to persuasive effect upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">As to the question of contusion, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, in the registration suit between the two litigants herein, further said, at page 134 of 40 F.(2d): \u201cIn the case at bar confusion is proved, hut aside from the proved confusion, it is obvious to us that confusion would result. In Nestle &amp; Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co. v. Walter Baker &amp; Co., Ltd., 37 App. D. C. 348, the court said: \u2018In a trade-mark case involving the question whether there is such a similarity between two marks as will cause confusion in trade, an ocular inspection of the marks constitutes the most satisfactory evidence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">In addition to all the foregoing elements connected with the issue of confusion, it is to he observed that there is to he found in the record some evidence that the appellant planned \u201cto ride on the band wagon of\u201d the appellee\u2019s advertising. While Frederick A. Tillman denied this, here again we believe that the District Court was in better position than we to weigh oral evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">To summarize, we are satisfied that the lower court did not err in its finding that there was confusion in the minds of the public and the trade as to the trade-mark \u201cDel Monte,\u201d and that the appellant, entering the eastern field in 1927, did profit, whether intentionally or unintentionally, by the publicity that the appellee thereto Coro had given and thereafter gave to the trade-mark \u201cDel Monte.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">We now advance to the heart of the present controversy, namely, whether prior to 1925 the appellant used the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d as a trade-mark or as a grade mark. As we have seen, the lower court found that the appellant\u2019s use of the name was merely as a \u201cgrade-mark\u201d and, in its opinion, it indicated that, had it found that the appellant\u2019s use was that of a trade-mark it would have found that the appellant\u2019s adoption of the trade-name \u201cDel Monte\u201d was prior to its use by the appellee, and that the appellant would have been entitled to the exclusive nse of the name upon coffee in eertain western states.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">In onr inquiry as to whether or not the appellant\u2019s use of the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d was that of a trade-mark, we shall be guided by the standard laid down by Mr. Justice Strong in Delaware &amp; H. Canal Company v. Clark, 13 Wall, (80 U. S.) 311, 322, 20 L. Ed. 581: \u201cThe office of a trade-mark is to point out distinctively the origin, or ownership of the article to which it is affixed; or, in other words, to give notice who was the producer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">At the threshold of our investigation, we are confronted with the loose terminology employed by witnesses both for the appellant and the appellee, in referring to Tillman\u2019s \u201cDel Monte\u201d as being or indicating a \u201cgrade,\u201d a \u201cblend,\u201d or a \u201cbrand,\u201d or as constituting a \u201ctrade-mark,\u201d a \u201ctitle,\u201d a \u201clabel,\u201d a \u201cname,\u201d or a \u201ctrade-name.\u201d There are at least twenty-nine references to the name by witnesses, including F. A. Tillman himself, as indicating \u201chigh grade\u201d or simply \u201cgrade.\u201d Most of the witnesses using the term \u201cgrade\u201d in connection with Tillman\u2019s Del Monte name were called by the appellant itself. On the other hand, there are to be found in the record at least eighty-seven direct or indirect references to Tillman &amp; Bendel\u2019s \u201cDel Monte\u201d as being a \u201cbrand.\u201d The name \u201cDel Monte,\u201d as used by Tillman &amp; Bendel, is referred to as a \u201cblend\u201d designation seven times. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>witness referred to the Tillman\u2019s \u201cDel Monte\u201d as a \u201ctrade-name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">There is similar divergence among the various exhibits, as to the designation given to Tillman &amp; Bendel\u2019s mark, \u201cDel Monte.\u201d One of the appellant\u2019s bulletins, dated November 3, 1921, refers to the Del Monte ensemble as a \u201cTitle, Label and Trade-mark.\u201d That bulletin alone refutes the appellee\u2019s statement, made-in its brief, that there was no \u201cevidence of any kind, written or oral, which showed, or tended to show, that the plaintiff or its predecessors had ever referred to the name as being a trade-mark prior to the application mentioned [in 1925].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In a letter to the appellee, F. A. Tillman, on December 13, 1921, referred to his \u201cDel Monte\u201d as a \u201clabel\u201d and a \u201cbrand.\u201d A poster and a carton put out by the appellant show the word \u201cbrand\u201d as being used in connection with \u201cDel Monte.\u201d The poster was prepared \u201clong before the institution of this suit,\u201d according to F. A. Tillman. Both poster and carton carried the legend, \u201cTillman &amp; Bendel [\u2019s] since 1887.\u201d Another of the appellant\u2019s exhibits, however \u2014 a counter display card \u2014 omits the word \u201cbrand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Despite the various discrepancies in the testimony and variances in the exhibits, we are of the opinion that the course of dealing of the appellant during the past four decades indicates that the \u201cfunction\u201d of the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d was, partly, at least, to designate \u201corigin\u201d or \u201cownership.\u201d That the name also fulfilled the office of a grade designation did not, as we shall presently see, militate against its trade-mark use.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">As we have seen, long before the present litigation or the Patent Office controversy was commenced, the appellant referred to its \u201cDel Monte\u201d as a trade-mark. Furthermore, there is evidence that the buying public so regarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">0. H. Greenfield, who handled the appellant\u2019s \u201cDel Monte\u201d brand between 1889' and 1892, testified: \u201cWe pushed the Del Monte brand of coffee with the customers under that name and naturally they asked for it.\u201d (R. 223,)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">There is considerable testimony that Del Monte was the appellant\u2019s \u201chighest grade\u201d of coffee, for at least a great part of the company\u2019s history. For example, W. 0. Weissich, a former employee of the appellant, testified that \u201cthe brand \u2018Del Monte\u2019 always represented the highest grade of coffee.\u201d Similarly, John A. Lombard, another former employee stated that \u201cthe highest price brand under which we sold bulk coffee was \u2018Del Monte.\u2019\u201d There was much additional testimony to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">But the decisions are clear that, this fact alone does not militate against the creation of a trade-mark, as contradistinguished from a grade mark. In Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S. 514, 520, 521, 9 S. Ct. 143, 144, 32 L. Ed. 526, the court said: \u201cThey used the words \u2018La Favorita\u2019 to designate flour selected by them, in the exercise of their best judgment, as equal to a certain standard. The brand did not indicate by whom the flour was manufactured, but it did indicate the origin of its selection and classification. It was equivalent to the signature of Holt &amp; Co. to a certificate that the flour was the genuine article which had been determined by them to possess a certain degree of excellence. It did not, of course, in itself indicate quality, for it was merely a fancy name, and in a foreign language, but it evidenced that the skill, knowledge, and judgment of Holt &amp; Co. had been exercised in ascertaining that the particular flour so marked was possessed of a merit rendered definite by their examination, and of a uniformity rendered certain by their selection.' * * * And the fact that flour so marked acquired an extensive sale, because the public had discovered that it might be relied on as of a uniformly meritorious quality, demonstrates that the brand deserves protection, rather than that it should be debarred therefrom, on the ground, as argued, of being indicative of quality\u2019 only. [Cases cited.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">See, also, Lawrence Manufacturing Company v. Tennessee Manufacturing Company, 138 U. S. 537, 548, 11 S. Ct. 396, 400, 34 L. Ed. 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Interpreting its decision in Menendez v. Holt, supra, the Supreme Court, in the Lawrence Case, supra, observed: \u201cWe held in Menendez v. Holt, * * * that the words \u2018La Favorita\u2019 were so used as to indicate the origin of a special selection and classification of certain flour, requiring skill, judgment, and expert knowledge, and which gave value and reputation to the flour. The name was purely arbitrary, \u2014 a fancy name, and in a foreign language, \u2014 and did not in itself, indicate quality. The legality of the trademark as such (and it had been duly registered under the act of congress) was conceded by the answer, though it was contended in the argument that it was not valid, because indicative only of quality; but we were of opinion that the primary object of its adoption was to symbolize the exercise of the judgment, skill, and particular knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the firm which adopted and used it, and that the phrase covered the wish to buy and the power to sell from that origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">So, in the instant ease, the words \u201cDel Monte,\u201d as we have seen from our foregoing analysis of the evidence, had for their primary object \u201cto symbolize the exercise of the judgment, shill and particular knowledge\u201d of the appellant, and for their secondary object that of designating the \u201chighest grade\u201d of coffee that had resulted from such exercise of judgment, skill, and particular knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Having determined that the appellant\u2019s use of the phrase Del Monte was that of a trade-mark, we now advance to the geographical question of whether or not the appellant is entitled to he protected in its use of the mark so far as certain western states are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">As we have already seen, the court below, in its opinion, stated that, had it been satisfied that the phrase Del Monte, as used on the appellant\u2019s coffee, had been \u201cin fact adopted arid used as a <em>trade-marlc/\u2019 </em>it would have held that the appellant was entitled to the exclusive use of the name upon coffee in the western territory named by the court, namely, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Arizona. We are not relying, however, upon this qualified Statement of the court in reaching our conclusion on this phase of the case, but we are depending upon our own independent study of the evidence, and the law applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We have already shown that the appellant entered the western field with the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d on its coffee at least as early as 3S87, while the court below found that the earliest use of the name on <em>any </em>product of the appellee was in 1891. This state of faets enables the appellant to come within the well-established doetrino of prior appropriation in the law of trade-marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The doctrine was thus stated by the Supreme Court in United Drug Company v. Theodore Rectanus Company, 248 U. S. 90, 100, 39 S. Ct. 48, 51, 63 L. Ed. 141: \u201cUndoubtedly, the general rule is that, as between conflicting claimants to the right to use the same mark, priority of appropriation determines the question. See [Delaware &amp; H.] Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 323, 20 L. Ed. 581; McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, 251, 24 L. Ed. 828; [Amoskeag] Manufacturing Co. v. Trainer, 101 U. S. 53, 53, 25 L. Ed. 993; Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, 150 U. S. 460, 463, 14 S. Ct. 151, 37 L. Ed. 1144.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">See, also, Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 415, 36 S. Ct. 357, 60 L. Ed. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Applying this rule to the ease at bar, we find the appellee entering the field with its Del Monte coffee in the latter part of 19'28, more than four decades after the appellant had begun marketing its coffee in the west under the same trade-mark. As to the west, the appellant was clearly the prior appropriator.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">During at least part of those forty years of the appellant\u2019s prior appropriation, the appellee had written notice of the situation. In its brief, the appellee says: \u201cNo notice of any such [trade mark] claim or use was had by defendant [appellee] prior to December, 3 921, when plaintiff [appellant] wrote to defendant that the former had been selling coffee under the name Del Monte for many years and claimed the right so to do exclusively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">The brief cites the testimony of R. I. Bentley, chairman of the board of the. appellee, who stated: \u201cThe first I heard about Tillman &amp; Bendel Del Monte coffee, or heard that they made any claim about the trade mark Del Monte as applied to coffee, was several years ago, I think about the time they asked for a registration; I think I heard about it at the time they wrote to C. II. Bentley in 1921. I did not hear they had ever marketed coffee until about 1924, when they indicated to us that they were going to do it, or something of that kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">The letter referred to in the foregoing testimony was written by E. A. Tillman to Charles Bentley, at that time vice president and general manager of the appellee. The letter, which was dated December 13, 3923, contained the following closing paragraph; \u201cWe also understand that you either are now, or are contemplating, offering coffee for sale under the Del Monte label. We beg to advise you that for many years we have sold, and are now selling Del Monte brand coffee, and that your sale of coffee under the Del Monte brand will he in direct conflict with our rights. You are further advised that we sell other grocery products such as extracts, spices, ammonia, and bluing under the Del Monte Brand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">While it is hardly likely that even prior to 1921, no member of the appellee\u2019s executive staff had ever heard of the appellant\u2019s sale of Del Monte coffee, at all events the appellee did receive, at least during that year, formal and official notice of such sale and of the appellant\u2019s claim in connection therewith. It will he seen by reference to the letter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>which is one of the appellant\u2019s exhibits, that it was addressed to the California Packing Corporation, \u201cAttention, Mr. Charles Bentley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Of such continued use by a newcomer in the field, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Menendez v. Holt, supra, has said: \u201cThe intentional use of another\u2019s trade-mark is a fraud; and when the excuse is that the owner permitted such use, that excuse is disposed of by affirmative action to put a stop to it. Persistence, then, in the use is not innocent, and the wrong is a continuing one, demanding restraint by judicial interposition when properly invoked.\u201d Page 523 of 128 U. S., 9 S. Ct. 143, 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In its answer, the appellee, on information and belief, .alleged that in 1921 the appellant abandoned the manufacture and sale of the latter\u2019s Del Monte coffee. In the appellee\u2019s brief, it is stated that \u201cit appears that within a few weeks after the letter [of December 13, 1921] .was sent, plaintiff gave every indication of quitting the use of the name Del Monte on its coffee.\u201d In his opinion, in connection with his discussion as to the alleged grade mark used by the appellant, the District Judge stated that, had a. trademark use been found by him, he would have held \u201cthat the evidence did not show abandonment by the plaintiff.\u201d There is ample evidence to sustain the view expressed by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Failure to register its trade-mark does not affect the appellant\u2019s rights thereunder. As we have seen, the decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals does not constitute the controversy res ad judicata; nor are the appellant\u2019s rights measurable solely according to the terms of the Trade Mark Act (15 USCA \u00a7 81 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In the Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 92, 25 L. Ed. 550, decided more than half a century ago, the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe right to adopt and use a symbol or a device to distinguish the goods or property made or sold by the person whose mark it is, to the exclusion of use by all other persons, has been long recognized by the common law and the chancery courts of England and of this eoun.try, and by the statutes of some of the States. It is a property right for the violation of which damages may be recovered in an action at law, and the continued violation of it will be enjoined by a court of equity, with compensation for past infringement. This exclusive right was not created by the act of Congress, and does not now depend upon it for its enforcement. The whole system of trade-mark property and the civil remedies for its protection existed long anterior to that act, and have remained in full force since its passage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Again, in Estate of P. D. Beckwith\u2019s Estate, Inc., v. Commissioner of Patents, 252 U. S. 538, 546, 40 S. Ct. 414, 417, 64 L. Ed. 705, we find the following language used: \u201cOf course, refusal to register a mark does not prevent a former user from continuing its use; but it deprives him of the benefits of the statute, and this should not be done if it can be avoided by fair, even liberal, construction of the act, designed as it is to promote the domestic and foreign trade of our country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">In Waldes et al. v. International Mfrs. Agency, Inc. (D. C.) 237 F. 502, 506, the court said: \u201cPeople sometimes talk as though registration put some rigid limitation on user, but I know of none such. Registration confers no right, and limits none; it is a mere procedural advantage, depending upon common-law \u2018ownership,\u2019 which can exist quite as well without it. In a ease like this, where the jurisdiction of the court does not depend upon it, it gives scarcely any advantage of any sort, except under section 16. It is not, like the issuance of a patent, the condition and the limitation of the owner\u2019s rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">See, also, Ansehl v. Williams (C. C. A. 8) 267 F. 9, 14, and McIlhenny Co. v. Gaidry (C. C. A. 5) 253 F. 613, 616, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">To summarize, we hold that the appellant was the prior appropriator of the trade-mark \u201cDel Monte\u201d in the west; that the appellee had formal, written notice of such appropriation in 1921; that, seven years after such notice had been given to it, the appellee entered the western market with its Del Monte coffee; that the appellant at no time abandoned the trade-mark; that the appellant lost none of its rights to the trade-mark as a result of its failure to register the mark, or as a result of the adverse decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals; and that, therefore, it is entitled to an injunction restraining the appellee from using the words Del Monte in certain western states.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">In view of the fact, however, that there is no evidence of lost sales due to confusion in the west, we conclude that the appellant is not entitled to an accounting for profits or damages. We do so on the authority of' Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk Corporation v. Horluck\u2019s, Inc., 59 F.(2d) 13, 17, decided by this court on May 23, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">We turn now to the east.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The very decisions that hold tho prior appropriator\u2019s trade-mark rights to be paramount, as quoted above, contain a limitation that precludes tho appellant\u2019s assertion of those rights in the east. For example, in the Reclaims Case, supra, we find the qualification thus stated, at page 100 of 248 U. S., 39 S. Ct. 48, 51: \u201cThe reason for the rule does not extend to a ease where the same trade-mark happens to be employed simultaneously by two manufacturers in different markets separate and remote from each other, so that the mark means one thing in one market, an entirely different thing in another. It would be a perversion of the rule of priority to give it such an application in our broadly extended country that an innocent party who had in good faith employed a trade-mark in one state, and by the uso of it had built up a trade there, being the first appropriator in that jurisdiction, might after-wards be prevented from using it, with consequent injury to his trade and good will, at the instance of one who theretofore had employed the same mark hut only in other and remote jurisdictions, upon the ground that its first employment happened to antedate that of the first-mentioned trader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Tho application of this geographical rulo is even more fully expounded in the Hanover Case, supra, at page 415' of 240 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 357, 361: \u201cIn the ordinary case of parties competing under the same mark in the same market, it is correct to say that prior appropriation settles the question. Rut where two parties independently are employing the same mark upon goods of the same class, hut in separate markets wholly remote the one from the other, tho question of prior appropriation is legally insignificant; unless, at least, it appear that the second adopter has selected the mark with some design inimical to the interests of the first user, sueh as to take the benefit of the reputation of his goods, to forestall tho extension of Ms trade, or the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">As we have said, it has been stipulated in this case that \u201cby 1918, the California Packing Corporation had established markets for its entire line of Del Monte products throughout the territory of tho entire United States.\u201d In addition, tho court below found that \u201cby the year 1918, and for many years prior thereto, tho defendant and cross-complainant had established a secondary meaning for the name Del Monte as averred in said paragraph VIII of said cross-claim throughout the territory of tho entire United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Finally, in the Del Monte Special Food Case, supra, at pages 774, 775-, of 34 F.(2d), this court held that: \u201cThe public has become familiar not only with tho [Del Monte] label of the appellee, but with their course of business by which they have gradually extended their operations to other food products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">From the foregoing, it would seem well established that, when tho appellant entered the eastern field with its Del Monte coffee in 1927, it found a fertile economic soil for its product \u2014 a soil that had for years been carefully tilled by the vast advertising of the appellee. In a word, the appellant found firmly entrenched the secondary moaning of \u201cDel Monte\u201d as being the name of tho food products of the appellee. As a result of this established secondary meaning, the appellant, whether intentionally or unintentionally, through the public\u2019s confusion made many sales. As we have seen, the evidence to this effect is overwhelmingly beyond cavil.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">We find the law applicable to such a state of facts well stated by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in tho leading case of Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch-Case Company, 179 U. S. 665, 674, 21 S. Ct. 270, 274, 45 L. Ed. 365:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly true that where such a secondary signification has been acqui red, its use in that sense will be protected by restraining the use of the word by others in such a way as to amount to a fraud on the public, and on those to whose employment of it the special meaning has become attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">\u201cIn other words, tho manufacturer of particular goods is entitled to the reputation they have acquired, and the public is entitled to the means of distinguishing between those and other goods; and protection is accorded against unfair dealing, whether there be a technical trademark or not. The essence of tho wrong consists in the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor for those of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">\u201cIf a plaintiff has the absolute right to the use of a particular word or words as a trademark, then, if an infringement is shown, the wrongful or fraudulent intent is presumed, and although allowed to be rebutted in exemption of damages, the further violation of the right of property will nevertheless be restrained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">See, also, as to the dispensation with proof of fraudulent intent \u201cwhere the proof of infringement is clear,\u201d at least so far as allowing injunctive relief is concerned, McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, 253, 254, 24 L. Ed. 828, and Lawrence Manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Company v. Tennessee Manufacturing Company, supra, at page <em>549 </em>of 138 U. S., 11 S. Ct. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">But, argues the appellant: \u201cWhen the defendant began putting out Del Monte coffee at the end of 1928, the plaintiff, fearing that the presence on the market of defendant\u2019s coffee would create confusion, voluntarily added the Words \u2022 \u2018Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel\u2019 on the front of its cans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The appellant also contends that: \u201cThe law is well settled that the owner of a trademark is not accountable for the mistaken belief of a careless or inattentive purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The answer to all of this is to be found both in the facts of this ease and'in the decisions of this and other courts, We have already quoted the testimony of the veteran grocer, Simpson, to the effect that, \u201cIt is not usual for customers to look over a can'to see who[m] it is manufactured by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Common experience confirms this view. Even an ordinarily careful and prudent, housewife is not in the habit of subjecting every can of goods that she buys to meticulous scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Nor does the law impose any such obligation upon her. In the Horlick Case, supra, this court said, at page 16 of 59 F.(2d):</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u201cThe lower court found as a faet that \u2018the public fails to distinguish between the words Horliek\u2019s and Horluek\u2019s and the use of the name Horluek\u2019s by the defendant in connection with its shops has caused confusion in the minds of the public, and purchasers have patronized defendant\u2019s shops believing that such shops were owned and operated by plaintiff,\u2019 and also: \u2018That such confusion as has arisen concerning the proprietorship of defendant\u2019s shops has mainly arisen from the similarity between the names of Horliek\u2019s and Horluek\u2019s used in association with the words \u201cMalted Milk.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\u201cThere being real confusion in the mind of the public as to the identity of the defendant\u2019s business, a duty devolved upon the defendant to take affirmative steps to avoid such confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Putting the name \u201cTillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel, Inc.,\u201d in sober, smaller type, beneath the showy legend \u201cDel Monte\u201d in ornate and conspicuous italic, as was done in this ease, does not discharge the \u201cduty\u201d referred to- in the foregoing decision. Particularly is this true in view of the appellant\u2019s statement, made in another connection, in its brief: \u201cAn examination of this group of labels will, we believe, suffice to convince the court that merchandise labeled in this way would be spoken of and identified, and considered in the minds of purchasers, as being \u2018Del Monte Coffee/ The purchaser might or might not remember that the coffee was produced by Tillman &amp; Bendel, but he would certainly identify the goods by the trade-mark name. These labels show, beyond the possibility of question, that there is no warrant for supposing that any one dealing in the merchandise would consider it to J)e \u2018Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel- Coffee of the Del Monte grade,\u2019 but would on the contrary identify it as \u2018Del Monte coffee\u2019 only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">The appellant seems to have overlooked the faet that the very argument which tends to establish its trade-mark rights in the west \u2014namely, the identifying nature of the phrase Del Monte \u2014 will militate against the appellant\u2019s invasion of the east, where Tillman &amp; Bendel, Inc., in 1927 was a newcomer, in view of the secondary meaning of the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d theretofore built up by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">If the public can be excused for confusing \u201cHorluek\u2019s\u201d with \u201cHorliek\u2019s\u201d a fortiori it will be excused for confusing two brands each bearing the identical name \u201cDel Monte.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">In the Del Monte Special Food Case, supra, this court laid considerable stress upon the fact that there \u201cwas actual confusion in the minds of purchasers who purchased the appellant\u2019s product, in that they believed that the oleomargarine advertised as a \u2018Del Monte product\u2019 was put out by the same people who were producing other \u2018Del Monte products/ \u201d In the Patent Appeal involving the present litigants, the court, as we have seen, held that there was actual confusion from the use of the \u201cDel Monte\u201d trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">In A. Y. McDonald &amp; Morrison Mfg. Co. v. H. Mueller Mfg. Co. (C. C. A. 8), 183 F. 972, 974, the court said: \u201cThe test is not whether, when gqods are placed side by side, &amp; difference can be recognized in the labels or marks; but the test is, when such goods are not placed side by side, would an ordinarily prudent purchaser be liable to purchase the one, believing that he was purchasing the other?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">Similarly, the standard of the \u201cordinary purchaser\u201d was stressed by the same court in Queen Mfg. Co. v. Isaac Ginsberg &amp; Bros. Inc., 25 F.(2d) 284, 287:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">\u201cIn order to constitute an infringement, it is not necessary that the trade-mark b\u00e9 literally copied. [Cases cited.] Neither is it necessary that every word be appropriated. There may be infringement where the substantial and distinctive part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>trade-mark is copied or imitated. [Many cases cited.] Dissimilarity in size, form, and color of the label and place where it is applied are not conclusive against infringement. [Case cited.] The resemblances may so far dominate the differences as to be likely to deceive ordinary purchasers. [Case cited.] Where a trade-mark contains a dominating or distinguishing word such as the xvord \u2018Queen\u2019 in the instant case, and where the purchasing public has come to know and designate the article by such dominating word, the use of such word by another in marking similar goods may constitute infringement, although the latter mark, aside from such dominating word, may be dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u201cIn determining whether an alleged infringing trade-mark is sufficiently similar to be deceptive, and therefore, an infringement, ordinary purchasers, buying under the usual conditions prevailing in the trade, and giving such attention as such purchasers usually give in buying that class of goods, are the standard. Whether an imitation which is not an exact copy constitutes an infringement depends upon whether the resemblance is such as to be likely to deceive purchasers of the standard above defined and cause them to believe in purchasing the goods of the defendant that they are the goods of the plaintiff. In other words, if the resemblance is such as would deceive ordinary purchasers of the goods using ordinary caution, the trademark is infringed. [Cases cited.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Both the foregoing decisions are quoted with approval by the same court in Reid, Murdoch <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. H. P. Coffee Co., 48 F.(2d) 817, 819, certiorari denied, 284 U. S. 621, 52 S. Ct. 9, 76 L. Ed. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The remaining question to be considered in this phase of the ease is whether or not the Del Monte coffee, with which the appellant invaded the eastern field in 1927, possessed \u201cthe same descriptive properties\u201d as the appellee\u2019s canned fruits and vegetables, for which a secondary meaning in the east is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">As the appellant points out: \u201cIt is a fundamental principle of the law of trade-marks that one person may have a valid right to use a trade mark upon one class of goods and another have an equally valid right to use the same mark on another class of goods.\u201d Section 5 of the Trade Mark Act of 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 85) contains the following proviso: \u201cProvided, That trade-marks which are identical with a registered or known trade-mark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties, or which so nearly resemble a registered or known trademark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as to be likely to cause eonfusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers shall not be registered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">As observed by the Supreme Court in American Steel Foundries v. Robertson et al., 269 U. S. 372, 380, 46 S. Ct. 160, 162, 70 L. Ed. 317: \u201cThe mere fact that one person has adopted and used a trade-mark on his goods does not prevent the adoption and use of the same trade-mark by others on articles of a different description. There is no property in a trade-mark apart from the business or trade in connection with which it is employed. [Cases cited.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">In at least two decisions, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has held that coffee belongs -to the same class and has the same \u201cdescriptive properties\u201d as the kinds of foods put out by the appellee prior to 1928, when the appellee also entered the coffee field. We refer to the Patent Office suit between the present litigants, and to Cheek-Neal Coffee Co. v. Hal Dick Mfg. Co. (Cust. <em>&amp; </em>Pat. App.) 40 F.(2d) 106. The United States Patent Office places coffee into Class 46, \u201cFoods and Ingredients of Foods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">The appellant, however, in its brief argues that \u201ccoffee is not a food at all.\u201d It is somewhat surprising to find that counsel cite volume <em>5, </em>p. 974, of Encyclopaedia Britannica as authority for this view, when reference to that work discloses that at the very page cited, the following statement appears: \u201cCoffee belongs to the medicinal or auxiliary class of food substances, being solely valuable for its stimulant effect upon the nervous or vascular system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">Again, the very first words of the same Britanniea article on the berry are as follows: \u201cCoffee. This important and valuable article of food is the produce chiefly of <em>C'offea ar\u00e1bica,\u201d </em>etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">In its effort to disqualify coffee as a food, the appellant goes so far as to assert that, \u201cCoffee is no more a food than chewing tobacco.\u201d The short answer to this, of course, is that coffee is intended to be swallowed, and tobacco juice is not!</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">Wo have no hesitation in concluding that coffee is a food, has the same descriptive qualities as canned fruits and vegetables, and is consequently capable of being the subject of a secondary meaning in connection with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>trade-mark used by tbe producer of such canned goods, to&gt; an extent sufficient to warrant injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Tbe court below held th^t there was no \u25a0\u201cevidence of actual damage to defendant arising out of plaintiff\u2019s sales of coffee bearing the name \u2018Del Monte\u2019 warranting an award \u2022of damages,\u201d and the amended decree sets forth that \u201cdefendant and cross-complainant take nothing in the way of damages .against plaintiff and cross-defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Since the appellee has filed no cross-appeal, the amended' decree of the lower court will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Each party will bear its own costs, here and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u25a0 To summarize, we hold that the amended \u25a0decree of the District Court should be affirmed in part, and reversed in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">1. In so far as it perpetually enjoins the appellant from directly or indirectly using the name \u201cDel Monte\u2019\u2019 on coffee, not made 'by or for the appellee, whether prepared for \u25a0sale, offered for sale, or sold by the appellant in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Nevada, and Arizona, it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">2. In so far as the amended decree enjoins the appellant from using the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d as stated above, elsewhere in the United States than in the six states hereinbefore named, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">3. In so far as it awards to the appellee costs from the appellant, the amended decree is reversed, each party being herein decreed to pay its own costs, in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">4. In so far as the amended decree holds that the appellant shall take nothing against the appellee, it is reversed, to the following extent, namely: That the appellee, the California Packing Corporation, is hereby forever and perpetually enjoined and restrained from directly or indirectly using the name \u201cDel Monte\u201d on coffee not by or for the appellant made, whether prepared, offered for sale, or sold by the appellee; such injunction and restraint to be in force and effect only in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Nevada, and Arizona, a.nd not elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">5. In so far as the amended decree awards damages to neither party, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Before a final judgment is entered by this court, we desire to hear from counsel as to the precise terms of the injunction, especially with reference to the form of label to be used by the appellant for its Del Monte coffee, which, under this decision, it will be permitted to market in the above-named western states.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">Supplemental Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">Since examining counsel\u2019s briefs relative to the form of label to be used by the respective parties hereto, we have arrived at the conclusion that the terms of the injunction heretofore set forth by this court in the above-entitled cause should remain unchanged, and that decree should be entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">Either party shall have the right to apply to the District Court for any further relief to which it may be entitled, under any changed conditions that may occur in the future.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-19\"> Not for publication.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
