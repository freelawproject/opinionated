C., against appellee, Thorne Clark, in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of North Carolina, to recover upon a written instrument guaranteeing the payment of certain indebtedness of Aileen Mills, Ine., to the First National Bank of Charlotte. The court, over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, submitted to the jury, and the jury answered against the plaintiff, an issue as to the release and discharge of the defendant from the guaranty agreement. From the judgment entered on the verdict this appeal was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-23\">Prior to February 9, 1928, Aileen Mills, Ine., was indebted to the First National Bank of Charlotte, N. C., on certain notes given for money loaned said company by said bank. These notes were indorsed by various individuals, and on said February 9, 1928, the following writing, signed by the defendant Clark and four others, was executed:</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-24\">\u201cWhereas, The First National Bank of Charlotte, N.

Tbe receiver of tbe bank testified at tbe trial in February, 1932, that tbe Aileen Mills, Inc., so far as he knew, was continuing to operate under a receiver. The defendant Clark testified that he knew nothing of the execution of the new contract of guaranty and had nothing to do with the agreement as to the operating receiver. This was not denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-21\">Filing the claim of the hank with the receiver of Aileen Mills, Inc., the cashier of the hank executed and sent to the receiver the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-22\">\u201cTo D.

Johnson being duly sworn deposes and says that he is Cashier of First National Bank, Charlotte, N. C. That the above statement of amount due by Aileen Mills, Inc., to said bank is correct and that no part of said amount has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">\u201cR. C. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">\u201cSubscribed and sworn to before me this the 18th day of April, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">\u201cShaw E. Pender, Notary Public. [Seal.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">\u201cMy Commission expires Feb. 19, 1932.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">One Henry M. McAden was president of the First National Bank of Charlotte, N. C., but only gave part time to the bank, conducting at the same time an insurance business. One R. C. Johnson was cashier of the bank and gave it Ms full time. Johnson, tho cashier, made the memorandums on tho bottom of the two contracts of guaranty, and McAden testified that Johnson had charge of the handling of the two agreements and \u201chandled largely tho transaction involved,\u201d but that the cashier would not have the authority to cancel one of the agreements, without consulting the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">No loan was made to the Aileen Mills by the bank after February 8, 1928, and tho notes sued upon were renewals and all a part of the indebtedness existing before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">Thorne Clark, the defendant below, was not an indorser on any of the notes at the time of the execution of the agreement of February 9, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">It is well settled that any material change in the situation as to a debt guaranteed, made by the creditor, without tho knowledge or consent of the guarantor, will release the guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">So also, when the guiurantee abandons tho guaranty and extends the time of the payment of a debt without the guarantor\u2019s knowledge, the guarantor is released. 28 C. J. 994, and authorities fchei'e cited under note 81; 28 C. J. 992, 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-18\">Here a material change was made in the situation with regard to the debt guaranteed and this change was made without the knowledge of the guarantor, Thorne Clark. The second agreement of guaranty in its express terms shows that it was intended to take the place of the first agreement in order that tho extension of time necessarily involved in the consent of tho First National Bank of Charlotte, to an operating receivership, would not relieve the guarantors who signed tho last agreement. The period of time covered by the first agreement, two years, had expired when the second agreement was entered into. Evidently the operating receivership could not be brought about except by the agreement of the hank which was only given after the second agreement of guaranty was signed. It will bo readily seen, by comparison, that the second agreement was much broader in its scope than the first one and permitted the bank to do whatever it might see fit with respect to the debts. The new agreement had no limitation as to time and guaranteed existing indebtedness; whereas, the first agreement was for a term of two years only and by its terms guaranteed the payment of money to be loaned. In addition to this, memorandums made by the cashier Johnson at the bottom of both agreements show that tho second agreement was intended by the bank to be substituted for the first one and to take its place. The account filed with the receiver of the Aileen Mills, and verified under oa.th by Johnson, tho cashier, contains the statement that tho first agreement was canceled and the debt guaranteed by the three parties who signed the second agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-20\">Johnson, the cashier, was the official of the bank actively in charge of its business to which the president, McAden, gave only part time, yet McAden, according to the record, himself knew that the second agreement of guaranty was executed in order that the bank might agree to the operating receivership. This operating receivership was agreed to by the bank and went into operation. All this was done without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, Thorne Clark, and operated to relieve him from the contract of guaranty which he signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-21\">A somewhat similar situation is discussed in a well-considered opinion in Marshall-Wells Company v. H. O. Tenney et al., 118 Or. 373, 244 P. 84, 45 A. L. R. 1382, and there it is held that where such a material change was made in the situation regarding the debt as affected the rights of the guarantor, without his knowledge, such a change would operate to relieve him of his obligation of guaranty. This is the case here. An entirely new sitnation was created by the operating receivership of the Aileen Mills, and while the notes sued on were not renewed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>any definite period, the consent of the bank to the receivership operated to delay the collection of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"AEK\">T, . , , , , , , , \u00bb It is also strongly contended on behalf of ,, <em>iij.ij.-l j.l c. t. </em>i the appellee that because the first agreement of guaranty expressly referred to loans \u201cto be made,\u201d appellee could not be held for already existing indebtedness, and that under the rule that a guarantor\u2019s liability cannot be enlarged by construction nor varied by prior happenings the appellee was not liable. National Bank of Commerce v. Rockefeller (C. C. A ) 174 F. 22 In view of our conelusion above stated it is not necessary to deeide this point.</p>\n<p id=\"AJx\">, \u201e , \u201e There are a number of assignments of error as to admissions of evidence, but an examination of the record leads to the eonelusion that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad5y\">The issues submitted by the court to the jury were proper, and there was ample evidence to sustain the verdict of the jury to the effect that the bank had released the defendant from the agreement of February 9, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"AqpH\">There was no error in the trial below, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
