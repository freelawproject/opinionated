The foundation for the suit laid in the original declaration was the general allegation that plaintiff was entitled to additional deductions for depreciation in the years 1921 and 1922. The amount in controversy was $7,386.35. Plaintiff claimed that it was entitled to depreciation upon the value of a contract it had with the Nashwaak Pulp &amp; Paper Company, Limited, for the purchase of bleached sulphite.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-29\">It is agreed that, if 'the filing of a claim for refund by plaintiff was timely it was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>titled to a judgment in the court helow; otherwise not, because the filing of such claim within the statutory period, i. e., four years after the payment of the tax, is a prerequisite to recovery. Title 26, \u00a7\u00a7 156, 357, U. S. C. (26 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 156, 157); Treas. Reg. 69, art. 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The sole question is whether plaintiff filed such claim within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">By written stipulation the case was heard without a jury. The District Judge filed a written opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made special findings of fact and conclusions of law, and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The court found that on March 14, 1927, plaintiff filed a claim for a refund of part of its 1922 taxes; that this claim was based \u201con the ground that adjustment of depreciation for prior years now being considered by the Unit, may, when carried forward result in additional deductions for 3921 and 1922, and loss on Home Life Publishing Company may he determined to be allowable in 1921 or 1922 rather than in an earlier year as claimed.\u201d It further found that this claim was rejected on May 19, 1927, because it was not sufficiently specific. These findings were not excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Thereafter, on June 10, 1927, plaintiff, by letter, protested the rejection of its claim of March 14, 1927, and explained <em>that it was claiming deduction for depreciation upon machinery and equipment at 10 per cent, per annum and for $44,553.87 which it had charged off as a worthless account against the Home Life Publishing Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The court did not find as a fact, but it was agreed, that, following the letter of June 10, 1927, plaintiff on October 31, 1927, filed a revised claim for the year 1922, which contains the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">\u201cDeponent verily believes that this application should be allowed for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">\u201cThe details supporting this claim are contained in a protest submitted herewith dated October 26, 1927. The points involved are:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Additional depreciation \u2014 1921..............$ 44,038.32</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Additional depreciation \u2014 1922.............. 21,733.14</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Loss on Home Life Publishing Company\u2014 1921 ....................................... 44,553.87</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">Loss on F. B. Mills Company \u2014 1921....... 314.42</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">Loss on F. B. Mills Company \u2014 1922....... 220.09</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">Total ...................................$110,859.84\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">The accompanying protest states that \u201cthe following specific facts are submitted which we believe will enable you to make a proper adjustment. The points in question are throe, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-20\">\u201c(a) <em>A claim for additional depreciation. </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b401-21\">\u201cThe <em>claim for additional depreciation </em>arises from following the procedure, rates and depreciable cost determined by the Bureau <em>with respect to buildings and machinery </em>for the years 1917 to 1920, inclusive. The effect of applying the basis adopted by the Bureau is indicated in the <em>attached schedule, </em>in which it is shown that additional depreciation is allowable in the amounts of $44,038.32 and $21,733.14 for the years 1921 and 1922, respectively. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">\u201cA revised claim to cover the refund which will result from <em>the specific corrections cited herein </em>is attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">And the accompanying computation shows that the additional depreciation for 1922 <em>was based solely upon buildings, machinery, and equipment,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">This revised claim was timely. It was filed prior to December 13, 1927, the expiration date of the statutory period of four years, hut it carried no suggestion that overpayment was claimed on account of depreciation of the Nashwaak contract, and no formal effort was ever made to amend or enlarge this revised claim to include depreciation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-25\">However, on April 30, 1929, after the expiration of the four-year period, plaintiff filed a refund claim for the amount in controversy for the year 3.922, based upon an allowance by the Commissioner of depreciation of the Nashwaak contract. This claim appears in the record as an independent demand. It does not seek to relate itself to the one filed on October 31, 1927. With the exception of mention made in certain briefs, the earliest of which was filed April 7, 1929, more than sixteen months after the bar of the statute had fallen, this claim made on April 30, 1929, was the first intimation that plaintiff was seeking the return of an overpayment upon its 1922 taxes on account of depreciation upon the Nashwaak contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-26\"> We are not in accord with plaintiff\u2019s view that the claim of April 30, 1929, was so far amendatory or explanatory of the timely claim of October 31, 1927, as to relate to its date and thereby be brought within the statutory period. The claim of October 31,1927, was meticulously specific. It was purposely made so to correct the imperfections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>former claim of March 14, 1927. It fully complied with Treasury Regulation 69, art. 1304. It set out in detail under oath upon the prescribed form the facts relied upon to sup-. port it. It was definitely for depreciation upon buildings and machinery and for losses upon the accounts therein mentioned. The melusion of these specific matters was equivalent to the exclusion of all others. The Commissioner had no authority to extend the statute of limitations by allowing claims for overpayment which were net-presented to him until they were barred by limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"AkR\">In United States v. Felt <em>&amp; </em>Tarrant Mfg. Co., 283 U. S. 269, 272, 51 S. Ct. 376, 377, 75 L. Ed. 1025, the court said: \u201cThe claim for refund which section 1318 makes prerequisite to suit, obviously relates to the claim which may be asserted by the suit. Hence, quite apart from the provisions of the Regulation, the statute is not satisfied by the illing of a paper which gives no notice of the amount or nature of the claim for which the suit is brought, and refers to no facts upon which it may be founded.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"AAY\">In Tucker v. Alexander, 275 U. S. 228, 231, 48 S. Ct. 45, 46, 72 L. Ed. 253, the court said: \u201clateral compliance with statutory requirements that a claim or appeal be filed with the Commissioner before suit is brought for a tax refund may be insisted upon by the defendant, whether the collector or the United States. Kings County Savings Institution v. Blair, 116 U. S. 200, 6 S. Ct. 353, 29 L. Ed. 657; Maryland Casualty Co. v. U. S., 251 U. S. 342, 353, 354, 40 S. Ct. 155, 6<em>4 </em>L. Ed. 297; Nichols v. U. S., 7 Wall. 122, 130, 19 L. Ed. <em>12</em>5.\"</p>\n<p id=\"AlB\">. \u201e ..... In Red Wing Malting Co. v. Willcutts, 15P.(.2d) 626, 634, 49 A. L.R.459 (C. C.A. 8), the court said: \u201cThe precise ground upon which the refund is demanded must be stated in the application to the Commissioner, and we think, if that is not done, a party cannot base a recovery in the court upon an entirely different and distinct ground from that presented to the Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-N\">See, also, Bemis Bros. Bag Co. v. U. S., 60 F.(2d) 944, 948 (C. C. A. 8).</p>\n<p id=\"AKy\">We are not dealing with a situation wherein a refund claim was imperfectly presented before the statute of limitations had run, for the claim in-controversy, was not presented at all within that p.eriod. '</p>\n<p id=\"Axd\">-The-necessity for the-requirement of-the. statute is obvious. The reasons for it have often-been stated by the courts. A Repetition would seem to be useless for the words of .the statute \u201cmark the conditions of the claimant\u2019s right.\u201d U. S. v. Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AQW\">Plaintiff insists District Court erred faii\u00a3ng- to find as a fact that plaintiff filed tbe revise\u00bf claim of 0etober 31 1927.
