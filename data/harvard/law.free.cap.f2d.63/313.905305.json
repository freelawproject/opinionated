McGlone v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 22 B. T. A. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">In September, 1918, R. E. Wade and H. E. Brouillard, of Oklahoma, and J. M. Burns and J. C. Campbell, of Charles City, Iowa, purchased an oil lease upon ten acres of land in the B-urkbumett Oil Field in Texas. They had no means to develop the property, and, in order to secure from friends $30,000, the amount necessary for development, they entered into the following trust agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">\u201cWhereas, J. C. Campbell and J. M. Bums of Charles City, Iowa, and H. E. Brouillard and R. E.

W. %) of the Northwest Quarter (N. W. %) of Block No. Seventy-five (75), of Red River Valley Lands Subdivision recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds, in Wichita County, State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">\u201cThis transfer of interest is made in compliance with the provisions of the said trust agreement and the said grantee is hereby vested with all rights and privileges provided for and conferred therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">\u201cWitness our hands this - day of -, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">\u201c[Signed] J. C. Campbell</p>\n<p id=\"AnkC\">\u201c R. E. Wade</p>\n<p id=\"A6E8\">\u201c C. L. Holden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-19\">The group of interest holders were referred to as the \u201clowa-Burk Syndicate.\u201d During the period of the syndicate\u2019s existence, various holders of certificates or interests transferred them to others. The books of the syndicate showed some of the transfers, but not all. After the $30,000 was raised by the trustees, drilling commenced, and about June, 1919, oil was discovered. J. C. Campbell, J. M. Bums, and R. E. Wade continued to act as trustees and managers of the property, which was operated until November, 1919. They had charge of the affairs of the syndicate, sold oil, kept books, and borrowed money. Shortly after November, 1919, the lease was sold for $300,000, which amount, less about $40,000 kept as a reserve, was distributed to those who were interested in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-21\">Prior to the sale of the lease, the trustees had gone to Washington to ascertain whether, if the sale were made, the proceeds would be taxed as corporate income. They were informed by the solicitor of the Bureau of Internal Revenue that they were not doing business as a corporation or association, but as a partnership or joint venture, and would be justified in consummating the sale upon that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-22\">On March 10, 1925, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the Iowa-Burk Syndicate was taxable as an association, under title 1, \u00a7 1, of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, and that there was due for the year 1919, a tax amounting to $142,672.28, including a penalty of $47,557.-43, which penalty was later waived. J. C. Campbell, one of the trustees, went to Washington upon being notified of this assessment, and turned over all of the undistributed assets of the syndicate, which amounted to $30,-000 in cash and a claim of about $10,000 against R. E. Wade, one of the trustees, as an offer in compromise. The offer was not accepted in settlement of tax liability, but the $30,000 was retained by the government, with the consent of the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">On November 12, 1926, the Commissioner notified each of the persons to whom had been distributed the proceeds of the sale of the lease that he proposed to assess each transferee in an amount equal to the liquidating dividends which he had received. The assessment of Mr. Bums was $29,625'.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-24\">Prom the determination of the Commissioner, the transferees appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which reached the conclusion that they were not liable for the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-25\">The Board found that the syndicate owned or controlled only an undivided one-half of the lease, and that therefore one-half of the purchase price did not constitute any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>income of the syndicate, but belonged to the original owners of the lease, as tenants in common of an undivided one-half interest. The Board also reached the conclusion that, since no formal meeting of the interest holders for the election of trustees, as provided for in the trust agreement, was held after the $30,000 was raised, the trust then terminated and the interest holders became vested with the title to the undivided one-half of the lease which was conveyed to the trustees, that those who subsequently managed the property, as trustees or managers, did s6 by common consent and virtually as the representatives of each individual owner, and that there was no association to be taxed, but merely a group of cotenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The government contends that the findings of the Board are contrary to the undisputed facts, that the facts require a holding that the syndicate was an association and was taxable as such, and that the liquidating dividends of Mr. Bums represented income derived by the association from the sale of the lease and taxable to the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Since this petition to review relates only to the liability of Mr. Burns, it becomes necessary to determine whether what he received out of the proceeds of the sale of the lease was income of the syndicate. If he was not a member of the syndicate, but merely the owner of an undivided one-quarter of the retained undivided one-half of the lease, then what he received never at any time belonged to the syndicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The trust agreement purports to convey only an undivided one-half of the lease to trustees for the benefit of purchasers of undivided interests, and refers to the retention by the original owners of the other undivided one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The government\u2019s theory, however, is that, since the trust agreement provided for a meeting of all those interested in the lease, after the $30,000 was raised, -for the purpose of electing trustees, and since the books of the syndicate showed Mr. Burns to be an interest holder, and since the trustees acted both for those who furnished the $30,000 and for the original owners of the lease, it must be held that Bums was a member-of the syndicate, that the syndicate took over the entire lease, and that the entire purchase price when the lease was sold belonged to the syndicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Mr. Bums\u2019 testimony is to the effect that he never furnished any part of the $30,000 raised for the purpose of drilling, and that no certificate was ever issued to him. It is asserted that he is shown upon the books of the syndicate as an interest holder solely for the purpose of convenience in accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">There appears to be very little to justify a finding that the original owners of this lease parted with more than an undivided one-half interest, or that those who invested the $30,000 under the terms of the trust, agreement ever acquired any rights to the undivided one-half of the lease retained, or any interest in the proceeds of the sale of that portion of the lease. The trustees to whom was conveyed the undivided one-half of the-lease to be sold in order to develop the property, apparently operated the entire lease for the benefit of all who were interested in it, accounting to the original owners for their undivided one-half, and to the syndicate for its undivided one-half. Therefore one-half of the $300,000, for which the lease was sold resulted from the sale of the undivided one-half belonging to the syndicate, and the balance from the sale of the undivided interest retained by the original owners. The most that the government can elaim is that the original owners permitted the syndicate to manage and control the entire leasehold, and, by so doing virtually made themselves members of the syndicate. There is, however, a distinction between being a member of an association which owns an oil lease and being the owner of an undivided one-half of an oil lease managed by an association which owns the other undivided one-half. In one case, whatever income is derived from the lease becomes the income of the association, whereas in the other ease only one half of the income belongs to the association, and the other half it collects as agent or trustee for its cotenant. Certainly one who is a eotenant of a corporation or an association does not render himself liable to pay taxes as a corporation because he permits his eotenant to manage his property and account to him for his share of the profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">The question of the relation which the original owners of the lease bore to the syndicate is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">In New York State v. Roberts, 171 U. S. 658, 664, 19 S. Ct. 58, 60, 70, 43 L. Ed. 323, the court said: \u201cNor.can we consider the further contention that portions of the business which were made the basis of the assessment were improperly treated as business of the corporation, whereas they should have been regarded as pertaining to the personal transactions of Mr. Clay, the company\u2019s agent. The true relation of Mr. Clay to the corporation\u2019s business was one of fact, in respect to which a hearing was afforded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the corporation, and this court is in no position to enter into such an inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The finding of the Board of Tax Appeals to the effect that only an undivided one-half of the lease belonged to the syndicate and hence only one-half of the proceeds of the sale wore taxable to it, having substantial evidence to support it, is binding upon this court.
