S. 268, have agreed to the present perfected rights to the use of mainstream water in each State and their priority dates as set forth herein. Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the joint motion of the United States, the State of Arizona, the California Defendants, and the State of Nevada to enter a supplemental decree is granted and that said present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>perfected rights in each State and their priority dates are determined to be as set forth below, subject to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">(1) The following listed present perfected rights relate to the quantity of water which may be used by each claimant and the list is not intended to limit or redefine the type of use otherwise set forth in said Decree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">(2) This determination shall in no way affect future adjustments resulting from determinations relating to settlement of Indian reservation boundaries referred to in Art.

II (D)(l)-(5) of said Decree, provided that the quantities fixed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of Art. II (D) of said Decree shall continue to be subject to appropriate adjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in the event that the boundaries of the respective reservations are finally determined. Additional present perfected rights so adjudicated by such adjustment shall be in annual quantities not to exceed the quantities of mainstream water necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>supply the consumptive use required for irrigation of the practicably irrigable acres which are included within any area determined to be within a reservation by such final determination of a boundary and for the satisfaction of related uses. The quantities of diversions are to be computed by determining net practicably irrigable acres within each additional area using the methods set forth by the Special Master in this case in his Report to this Court dated December 5, 1960, and by applying the unit diversion quantities thereto, as listed below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">Unit Diversion Quantity Acre-Feet Indian Reservation Per Irrigable Acre</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">Cocopah 6.37</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">Colorado River 6.67</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">Chemehuevi 5.97</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">Ft.

If all or part of the adjudicated water rights of any of the five Indian Reservations is used other than for irrigation or other agricultural application, the total consumptive use, as that term is defined in Art. I (A) of said Decree, for said Reservation shall not exceed the consumptive use that would have resulted if the diversions listed in subparagraph (i) of paragraphs (1) through (5) of Art. II (D) of said Decree and the equivalent portions of any supplement thereto had been used for irrigation of the number of acres specified for that Reservation in said paragraphs and supplement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>for the satisfaction of related uses. Effect shall be given to this paragraph notwithstanding the priority dates of the present perfected rights as listed below.
