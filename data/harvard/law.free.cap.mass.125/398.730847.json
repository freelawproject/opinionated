The defendant, a deputy sheriff, justified by reason of the taking of the hay, as the property of Thomas Dodd, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, on a writ of execution issued by a district court in favor of one Church. At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Brigham, </em>C. J., the jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions, the material parts of which appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>J.

The intention of the party is quite apparent. He has used the word \u201c although \u201d instead of \u201cif,\u201d and has omitted the verb \u201cwas\u201d before\" the preposition \u201c for.\u201d These changes being made, the request would read, \u201c that if the jury should find that the conveyance of the real estate by the husband was for a valuable consideration, through the intervention of a third person, to his wife, the plaintiff, it would not render the hay, cut on said real estate by the plaintiff, and put into her barn, liable to attachment and sale on execution by a subsequent creditor of her husband.\u201d And this we do not doubt was the request intended, and understood to be made at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">It was, however, properly refused; for it omits an element which the Chief Justice of the Superior Court deemed proper, and which we have no doubt was a legal and necessary qualifi.ation of the prayer. That qualification the Chief Justice rightly gave in this language: \u201cIf the jury should find from the evidence that said Thomas Dodd made said conveyance to his wife, the plaintiff, with a design to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, and his wife participated in that design, then she couM not hold hay, cut from said thirty acres, against subsequent creditors of her husband, and the same was liable to be taken to satisfy the execution of said Church, in the hands of the defendant.\u201d The ruling requested, thus modified, was given, and was in all respects accurate, and in conformity with the many and uniform decisions of this court. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
