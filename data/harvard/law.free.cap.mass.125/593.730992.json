The writ and declaration described the action as brought by William L. G. Pierce as administrator of the estate of William Green, Jr., for the benefit of Martin A. Munroe, to whom, as the declaration alleged, Green, \u201c being then in his last illness, and aware that he might not recover, gave and delivered his pass boob, evidencing the deposits in said bank, as an absolute gift, meaning and intending to assign and transfer his pass book to said Munroe, and to give him the absolute ownership and right of possession of said deposits and interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">The bank, in its answer, admitted the deposits; averred its readiness to pay the same and interest to whoever was legally entitled thereto, and its ignorance whether Pierce had been duly appointed administrator of Green\u2019s estate; denied generally all the other allegations of the declaration, and especially those as to the title of Munroe; and alleged \u201c that the legal representatives of said Green\u2019s estate claim said deposits and interest as a part of the effects of said estat\u00e9, and that no part thereof belongs to said Munroe, and the defendant has been notified not to pay said deposits or interest, or any part thereof, to said Mun-roe.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">Upon the petition of the bank, the Superior Court ordered Pierce, as administrator of Green\u2019s estate, to be made a party defendant under the provisions of the St. of 1876, <em>c. </em>203, \u00a7 19, relating to savings banks, which is copied in the margin; <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>he thereupon filed an answer \u201c as claimant for benefit of Green\u2019s estate,\" denying that Green gave the bank book and deposits to Munroe as a <em>donatio caus\u00e1 </em>mortis, as set forth in the declaration, and alleging that, if the bank book was so given, the gift rendered Green\u2019s estate insolvent, and was void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\">At the trial before Colburn, J., and a jury, the pass book was in evidence, on the outside of which was the direction, \u201c If you lose this book, give immediate information to the treasurer;\u201d and inside, among the printed by-laws of the bank, the following : \u201c It shall be the duty of the treasurer to enter all deposits, and payments made to depositors, in the books of the bank, and a duplicate of such entry in the book of the depositor, which shall be his voucher and the evidence of the amount deposited.\u201d \u201c Ho person shall receive any part of his principal or interest, without producing the original book.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">It appeared that the pass book had not been assigned by Green ; and that his estate, including the said deposit of 1615, consisted of $1237.50, and the funeral and other expenses did not exceed $174, and the debts did not exceed $26, unless the alleged donee, Munroe, should be considered as a creditor. Mun-roe testified that he had a legal claim against Green\u2019s estate, of $876, for board furnished and some expenses paid for Green; that he had never made any claim for it, but had consulted his counsel about it. Pierce was appointed administrator of Green\u2019s estate January 26,1877, and the trial of this cause in the Superior Court was commenced January 18, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The defendant and the claimant requested the presiding judge to order a verdict for them, for these reasons : \u201c 1. That the delivery of the bank book to the plaintiff by the deceased in his last sickness, even if made when he did not expect to recover, and if intended by the deceased as a <em>donatio oausd </em>mortis, did not pass to the plaintiff any right to the deposit in the bank. 2. That it appearing from the testimony in the case that the only property left by the deceased, including the bank deposit, $615, amounted to $1237.50, and that the deceased, at the time of the alleged gift, owed the plaintiff $876, in addition to debts to other parties, and that the deceased was insolvent at the time of the alleged gift and of his death, the gift of the bank deposit, if good in other respects as <em>donatio oausd mortis, </em>is void, because made in fraud of creditors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-3\">The judge declined so to rule; and instructed the jury that the ownership of the deposit would pass by the gift of the book, if they found that the gift was made as alleged, and that Mun-roe\u2019s claim for board and expenses did not render the gift to him void, if made in due form. At the request of the defendant and the claimant, the judge further instructed the jury that they might take into consideration, as bearing on the probability of the gift having been made, the question whether the estate was or was not insolvent, and of Green\u2019s knowledge of its condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and to the above instructions and refusals to rule the defendant and the claimant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b613-5\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQtT\">The right of action of a depositor against a savings bank is not negotiable at law, and an action against the bank to recover the amount of the deposit can only be brought in the name of the depositor, or, in case of his death, in the name of his administrator. Any one to whom the right has been transferred by a valid gift or assignment is entitled indeed to use the name of the depositor or of his administrator for the purpose of bringing an action against the bank. But the plaintiff and the only plaintiff of record is the person in whose name the action is and must be brought. <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Lowell Savings Bank, </em>111 Mass. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>It is only \u201c any other party than the plaintiff in such action,\u201d that the St. of 1876, <em>c. </em>203, \u00a7 19, authorizes to be summoned in as a party defendant. It is inconsistent alike with the terms of this statute, and with the rules of the common law, to make the plaintiff himself a defendant also. <em>Winthrop </em>v. Minot, 9 Cush. <em>405. </em>If the action had been actually brought by, as well as in the name of, the administrator, and Munroe, as a claimant of the fund, had been made a party defendant under the statute, this difficulty might have been avoided, and issue might have been joined and tried upon the question whether the title in the fund was in the administrator or in the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The proceedings contemplated by the St. of 1876 are analogous to those upon a trustee process, where a third person is admitted as a claimant, under an assignment or otherwise, of the fund in the hands of the supposed trustee, although the claimant\u2019s interest is merely equitable and he could not have maintained an action at law in his own name against the trustee. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>142, \u00a7 15. <em>Dennis </em>v. Twitchell, 10 Met. 180. <em>Kingman </em>v. Perkins, 105 Mass. 111. But it was never heard of that the plaintiff of record m a trustee process should be admitted as a claimant to defeat the right of recovery in an action brought in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In the present case, the proceedings were unauthorized by law, and were wholly irregular. The plaintiff of record was improperly made a defendant, and there has been a mistrial. The issue tried was not between the administrator, the only legal plaintiff of record, and the bank, the only legal defendant of record ; but between the plaintiff, as a defendant, and a third person, not a legal party to the record at all, as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside, and notice to the plaintiff as claimant quashed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
