Declaration of Eights, art. 12. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>2 Pick. 139, 143. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>2 Wis. 494. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Chalkley, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 258. Archb. Crim. Pl. (18th ed.) 63. The objection, having been duly taken by motion to quash before the jury were empanelled, is rightly before us on the bill of exceptions. St. 1864, <em>c. </em>250, \u00a7 2. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>10 Allen, 193. The exceptions must therefore be sustained and the <em>Indictment quashed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
