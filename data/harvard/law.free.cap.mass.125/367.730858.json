After the decision reported 122 Mass. 336, a second trial was had in the Superior Court, resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff, which the defendants moved to set aside, because the jury carried out with them, into the jury room, and kept there during their deliberations, the bill of exceptions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>drafted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and allowed by the court after the first trial and verdict for the defendants, which was read by the jury or in their hearing during such deliberations. The motion was overruled by Allen, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, stating the facts that appeared upon the hearing of the motion as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\">One of the jury was permitted to testify, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, that the bill of exceptions, (by which it appeared that a verdict was returned at the former trial for the defendants, and that the plaintiff alleged exceptions to certain rulings of the judge,) was handed to the jury by the officer in charge of them, with the other papers in the case; that some of the jurors read the same; and that, at the request of some of the jury, he read it aloud two or three times. It appeared that the jury were out from four o\u2019clock in the afternoon until ten o\u2019clock the next forenoon, and the witness, on cross-examination, testified that the jury did not agree until about three minutes before they came in with their verdict. There was no other evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">The defendants asked the judge to rule that, if he was satisfied that the bill of exceptions was in the jury room, and was read by the jury or any of them during their deliberations, then a new trial should be granted; but the judge declined so to rule, and, finding that there was no misconduct, overruled the motion. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-6\"><em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9D\">The bill of exceptions tendered by the plaintiff and allowed by the judge at the first trial was not competent evidence to be laid before the jury at the second trial: As the statements therein were material to the issue and may have prejudiced the defendants, it was not neee'ssary to show misconduct on the part of the plaintiff in bringing the paper before the jury. The refusal of the judge, at the hearing of the motion to set %side the last verdict, to rule, as requested by the defendants, that, if he was satisfied that the paper was in the jury room and was read by the jury or any of them during their deliberations, a new trial should be granted, was an erroneous ruling in mattei of law, and a subject of exception.
