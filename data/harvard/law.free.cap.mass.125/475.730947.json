It was admitted by the plaintiff that the assignment was founded on a valid consideration; that it was duly recorded; and that there was due the assignee from the defendant a larger sum than was in the hands of the trustee. The claimant contended that he was entitled to all sums earned by the defendant while in the employ of the city, during the year covered by the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">The judge found as a fact, that the contract, under which the defendant was employed when the assignment was made, terminated on June 30, 1877, and that a new contract was entered into between the defendant and the trustee on September 1, 1877; ruled that the assignment did not cover funds earned since September 1, 1877, as against the trustee process; and ordered the trustee to be charged.
