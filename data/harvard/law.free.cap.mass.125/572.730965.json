The writ was entered, and an answer filed, at December term 1876 of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-4\">On October 11,1877, the defendant filed interrogatories to be answered on oath by the plaintiff. On January 2, 1878, the court ordered answers to the interrogatories to be filed on or before March 1; and, on February 25, extended the time for filing such answers to March 11. On March 8, the attorney of the plaintiff moved for further time to answer the interrogatories; and filed his own affidavit, stating in detail his efforts to obtain answers from the plaintiff, his belief that the plaintiff was unwilling to answer and had assigned his interest in the action to another person, and that the attorney had a lien on the judgment rendered in the suit in which the attachment was made. The court overruled the motion. On March 9, the attorney filed answers to the interrogatories signed and sworn to by himself \u201cin behalf of the plaintiff, Zenas S. Harding, and in his own behalf as claimant of lien on judgment on which this suit is founded.\u201d On March 22, the court ordered a nonsuit; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-5\"><em>C. </em>Lamson, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-6\"><em>E.
