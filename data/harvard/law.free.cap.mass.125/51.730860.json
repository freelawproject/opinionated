Smith and J. L. Townsend, both of said Boston, copartners, for all sums of money slue, and for all sums of money and demand which, at any time between the date hereof and the said twenty-sixth day of June next, may and shall become due to me, for services rendered and to be rendered; to have and to hold the same to the said Joseph Davis, his executors, administrators and assigns forever. And I, said John Lightbody, do hereby constitute and appoint the said Joseph Davis, and his assigns, to be my attorney irrevocable in the premises, to do and perform all acts, matters and things touching the premises, in the like manner to all intents and purposes, as I could if personally present.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">There was also evidence that the plaintiff, at the time of making the assignment, and for a long time before and after, was at work for the defendants, at their yard, by employment from day to day, and by the day; that the plaintiff, at the time of making the assignment, was indebted to Davis for groceries to the amount of $165 ; that, subsequently to the assignment, the plain tiff received from Davis $43 worth of groceries; and Davis testified, against the objection of the defendants, that the consideration of the assignment was the amount due for groceries, and foz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>such groceries as he might thereafter let him have; that the defendants paid to Davis, on the assignment, the sum of $125 for labor of the plaintiff up to April 18, 1874, being all that was due up to that date; that on April 20,1874, the plaintiff went to Bedfield Erskine, and desired him to employ him; that Erskine and the plaintiff made an agreement between themselves, and, on the same morning, went to the defendant Smith, and notified him that the plaintiff would not work for the defendants any longer, but had hired himself to Erskine; that to this Smith assented, and subsequently, at the same interview, made an arrangement with Erskine that the plaintiff should work in the defendants\u2019 yard, and they would pay Erskine for the labor so furnished at the rate of $2 per day, which was the same amount they had been paying the plaintiff, and the same amount that Erskine agreed to pay him, Erskine paying him partly in groceries and partly in <em>cash; </em>and that all parties had notice of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-3\">Upon this evidence, the judge found that the agreement between Erskine and the plaintiff was made with a view to fraudulently deprive Davis of the benefit of his assignment; that the defendants had knowledge of that intent when they made the arrangement with Erskine; that the plaintiff was, at the time of making the assignment, indebted to Davis in the sum of $165\"; that Davis subsequently let him have about $43 worth more of groceries; and that Davis drew on the assignment about $125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\">The defendants asked the judge to rule, that, as the plaintiff was hired by the defendants from day to day, the agreement between Erskine and the plaintiff, and the subsequent agreement between Erskine and Smith, was a termination of any colorable contract, if any existed, which was the subject of the assign ment, and that the plaintiff could not recover, notwithstanding that this might have been done with the intent to terminate the hiring and deprive Davis of the benefit of his assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The judge declined so to rule ; and ordered judgment for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim, to wit, $110 and interest, being the full amount earned by him, as claimed in his declaration, between April 18 and June 26, and being the whole amount of his indebtedness to Davis. The defendants alleged exceptions,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>J.

But there was no stipulation to that effect. On the contrary, his employment was by the day, and from day to day only. They had a right to discharge him at any moment and he had a right to seek employment elsewhere whenever he saw fit. Except as to wages actually due him at the time of the assignment, it was an attempt to transfer a mere possibility of future earnings, and not an existing chose in action. <em>Mulhall </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>1 Gray, 105. <em>Twiss </em>v. <em>Cheever, </em>2 Allen, 40. <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>7 Met. 335. <em>Low </em>v. <em>Pew, </em>108 Mass. 347, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The arrangement with Erskine, whatever may have been its motive, and however contrary to the assignee\u2019s expectations, was not a violation of Lightbody\u2019s contract. It was not fraudulent within the legal sense of the word, inasmuch as it was an act which he had a right to do, and which deprived the assignee of none of his legal rights. The defendants were therefore entitled to the ruling which they asked for upon this point; and none of the plaintiff\u2019s earnings after the 18th day of April passed by the assignment to Davis. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
