It was contended by the defendant and admitted by the government that the defendant was the agent or bar-keeper of the licensee of the premises in which the sale was made;. but the defendant did not contend that he was authorized to make such sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c 1. Under the form of the complaint in this case, the governmer.b must show that the defendant held a license as licensee of the premises in which the liquor alleged to be sold by him was sold, and that he was guilty of a violation of the license so held by him. 2. Under the present form of the complaint, the defendant cannot be convicted on the evidence in the case. 3. Under the facts in this case, the complaint should have been drawn under the Lord\u2019s-day act.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">The judge declined to give these instructions; the jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>M. </em>Fischacher, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-4\"><em>C.

The defendant was not a licensee. Nor did he claim that he was acting as agent or servant of a licensee. The equivocal phrase used in the bill of exceptions, that he \u201c did not contend that he was authorized to make such sale,\u201d is to be construed that he did not contend that he was authorized by the licensee to make the sale. We say this is the proper construction, because the object is apparent, that the act done by the defendant should not be considered the authorized act of the licensee, and thus be the foundation for proceedings by which the license should be revoked. It is simply this: the person charged might, if the sale had been made at another time, have offered his employer\u2019s license in evidence as a justification. The fact that the sale is alleged to have been made upon the Lord\u2019s day does not vitiate the complaint, as a complaint for an unlawful sale of liquor, even although the charge is not sufficient in form as a complaint for doing unnecessary work on the Lord\u2019s day, or as a complaint for violating the provisions of a license. The act charged is an illegal act, set forth in sufficiently formal terms. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fredericks, 119 Mass. 199. The act is proved sufficiently. No justification or excuse is offered in defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
