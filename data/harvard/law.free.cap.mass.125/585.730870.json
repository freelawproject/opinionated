Both the plaintiff and McNeil testified that the latter had no authority from the plaintiff to take the horse from the defendants\u2019 stable, and McNeil also testified that he had not taken the horse away from the stable on any other occasion. The defendants called several witnesses, men in their employ in 1874, who testified that the same boy, who took the plaintiff\u2019s horse away on the day of the accident, had driven the horse to the stable several times previously, and on two or three occasions taken the horse from the stable; and that they knew that the boy was in the employ of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">The defendants proposed to ask several stable-keepers, who were in attendance upon the trial, the following question: \u201c What is the practice of stable-keepers in relation to the delivery of horses, under circumstances like those of this case ? \u201d and also offered to prove, by testimony of stable-keepers, that the same care was exercised in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s horse which was usually exercised under like circumstances by other stable-keepers in Boston, as bearing upon the question of ordinary care. But the judge excluded this evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-7\"><em>C.
