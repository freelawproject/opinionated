Answer: 1. A general denial; 2. Payment. The defendants also filed a declaration in set-off for money paid to the plaintiffs in 1874, according to an account annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., the defendants proved that in July, 1874, they purchased of the plaintiffs intoxicating liquors in the State of New York, and paid for such liquors in September, 1874, the sum of <em>$260.90; </em>and that, at the time of the purchase, the plaintiffs knew that the defendants were grocers and liquor dealers in this Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\">The judge ruled that the above facts, and the fact that the liquor was sold by the defendants in violation of law, would not authorize the jury to apply the payment of the $260.90 as a payment for liquors afterwards sold to and received by the defendants from the plaintiffs, not in violation of law, on the ground that the first sale of liquor was in violation of law, and the $260.90 paid therefor might in some form of action, and in some form of pleading, be recovered back from the plaintiffs by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for the full amount claimed; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AS0\">J. <em>W.
