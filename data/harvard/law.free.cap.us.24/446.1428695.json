In 1819, John Camochan, one of the firm of C. &amp; M., visited Engl\u00e1nd, in the expectation of selling immense tracts of land he had purchased in Florida, and, during his residence in that country, his partner, Peter Mitchel, relying, probably, on the sale of lands, continued to draw, heavily on the defendant, W. C., without making correspondent remittances, Carno-. chan being unable to sell his lands, and thus to place funds in the hands of Christie, these bills produced great embarrassments, and frequent communications between the parties, in the course of which Camochan pressed Christie most earnestly to proceed with his acceptances, and promised to secure him by the pledge of his Florida lands, and property in Georgia. At length, deeds of these lands, arid other property, were executed, and the accounts settled between the parties. Ah account was stated, and signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>by them, showing a balance of 43,293 pounds, six shillings and four pence sterling, due to Christie, for which sum Carnochan gave the promissory note <em>^ </em>^ jyj^ --</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Soon after the execution of these deeds, Carnochan returned to Georgia, and considerable payments were made. But, the debt still remaining considerable, the agent of Christie caused the deeds to be recorded, and apprehensions were entertained that he would proceed to sell the property. In June, 1820, Carnochan &amp; Mitchel filed their bill in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Georgia, alleging that the account was unfairly settled, to the very great injury of the plaintiffs; that it contains many erroneous charges, and omits to give credits to which the plaintiffs are entitled, and that Carnochan was induced to sign it, and to give the note for the amount, in consequence of his situation, which placed him in the power of the defendant. That the deeds also were executed under duress, and consequent imposition. The bill prays that the account may be resettled, that the deeds may be cancelled, and the defendant enjoined from proceeding under them. The injunction was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The defendant, Christie, filed his answer, denying all the material allegations of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Numerous exhibits were filed, and several depositions, taken. In'December, 1821, the parties agreed to refer the case to arbiters, and the following submission was entered' on the record :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\"

Whereas. William Christie has this day exhibited to the undersigned arbitrators his entire account current with the late firm of Camochan &amp; Mitchel, with interest calculated thereon up to the' sixteenth instant, we have .duly examined the same, and believe it to be a just and faithful account, showing an amount of thirty thousand four hundred and eighty-three pounds, one shilling and two pence, or one hundred and thirty-five thousand, four hundred and eighty dollars, and twenty-five cents, due him from Camochan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>&amp; Mitchel, and which sum we do hereby award unto the said William Christie as the basis upon which a final settlement of accounts shall take pjace between him and the said Camochan &amp; Mitchel. It is to be distinctly understood by both parties in this controversy, that this amount of (thirty thousand four hundred and eighty-three pounds, one shilling, two pence sterling, or) one hundred and thirty-five ' thousand four \u2022 hundred and .-eighty dollars, and .twenty-five cents, as now awarded to William Christie, is. subject to all such deductions as are mentioned in the preceding itenis of this instrument of award; namely, the unconditional items to be immediately deducted ; the conditional items to be deducted as the provisions of those conditions shall be removed by Camochan &amp; Mitchel, as will more fully appear is intended by the arbitrators, by reference to the eleventh item of this instrument of award: provided, nevertheless, that such amounts, as are awarded to the credit of Camochan and Mitchel in the preceding items of this instrument of award, as are hereby credited in the account current, as aforesaid, of William Christie, shall be considered always as settled by being placed in said account to the credit of Camochan &amp; Mitchel, and, of course, cannot be deducted again, as might be inferred, without this explanation, under the name of a provision to this item the sixteenth, .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\"><em>\u201c </em>17th.

The arbitrators have not decided the whole matter that was submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">2d. They have decided and awarded what was not submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">3d. The award is uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>1. In support of the exception founded on the failure of the arbitrators to decide on the whole matter submitted to them, it is alleged by the plaintiffs, that the duress under which the deeds of trust, executed in England, were obtained, constituted a very essential part of the <em>control </em>versy, on which the award is entirely silent.</p>\n<p id=\"ARC\">Exception on the omission of the arbitrators to decide the whole matter referred.</p>\n<p id=\"AHC\">It is undoubtedly true, that this is a \u201c matter in controversy as exhibited in the pleadings,\u201d and would be submitted to the arbitrators by the general words of the first sentence, describing the extent of the submission, if it were not withdrawn from them in a subsequent part of the same instrument. But we think it is withdrawn. After directing that the arbitrators shall ascertain the balance due on the account, the agreement of submission adds: \u201c that as soon as that balance is paid, the deeds and other encumbrances held by the said William Christie, with the settled account and note of Camochan &amp; Mitchel, are to be delivered up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">This is, we think, a waiver of any objection to the manner in which those deeds were obtained, and an admission that they should remain in the hands, of Christie as a security for the debt, until it should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">2. The second omission with which this award is charged, is the failure to decide on the claim of the plaintiffs to a credit for Christie\u2019s proportion of the expenses incurred in the settlement of the Florida lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">This, too, was undoubtedly a matter of controversy. But we think it has been decided. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>arbitrators have allowed to the plaintiffs several credits claimed by them &gt; . but have not expressed their rejection of any item which may have been made and disallowed. Instead, of introducing into the award the several items which may have been claimed and disallowed, they award a specific sum to the defendant, with a declaration that the several items enumerated in the preceding part of the award as credits. to which the plaintiffs are entitled, are to be deducted therefrom. This is, we think, a rejection of all credits not enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"AtAQ\">3. The failure to decide on the allegation made in the.bill, and denied in the answer, that 50,000 acres, part of the. interest in the Florida land sold to the.defendant, was a mere donation, made under expectations which were entirely disappointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">This also is, we think, decided in the award. The 2d article directs a credit of \u00a310,000 sterling to be given to C. &amp; M., being in payment to them for thirty shares, or 150,000 acres of land, lying in the territory of West Florida. This, we think, asserted the title of the said Christie to the whole quantity jof land, and negatives'the right of the plaintiffs to reclaim any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">objection to the award, that the arbitrator had exceeded their power.</p>\n<p id=\"AM5s\">The,second objection to the award is, that the arbitrators have exceeded their power, in requithe plaintiffs to give a clear unencumbered title to the Florida lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The plaintiffs are not required to give a title. This is not a substantive and independent part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>o&gt;f the award, directing them to do a particular act, for the neglect of. which they would be liable to damages, or for the enforcing of which an attachment might issue. This part of the award is not compulsory. If the plaintiffs choose to waive the credit for the purchase money, they are left at liberty to do so, and to withhold the title, in which case the award affords the defendant no coercive means to compel a conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">But had this article, of the-award been peremptory, it is by no means clear that the arbitrators would have exceeded their power in making it; That power extends to all matters in controversy, as exhibited in the pleadings, unless it be restrained by other parts of the. submission. The title which the defendant might rightfully demand was one of these matters. The plain-* tiffs contend in their bill', that the defendant was perfectly, acquainted with the state of the title, and was bound to take it, such as it was; and there are strong circumstances to support their pretensions, at least as far as respects the 80,000 acres purchased from the-Inerarities. The defendant insists, that they were bound to make him a clear title, and relies to prove, this on a memorandum at the foot of a stated account, in these words :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201c Memorandum. From the balance due to me on this account as. per contra, there is to be deducted, as agreed on between Messrs. Camochan &amp; Mitchel and myself, in lieu of 150,000 acres, or 30 shares of their purchase of Apalachicola lands, held in trust for them bv Mr. Colin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Mitcliel, on his and their executing to me a pro\u00bb per tide for the same, the sum of 10,000 pounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF6l\">The memorandum proceeds in like manner to sfcate&gt; that on a title for the 80,000 acres, there shall be deducted the sum of 6,583 pounds eight shillings and six pence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">The question, what was a proper title, was for a Court to decide under all the circumstances of the contract, and was transferred to the arbitrators by the submission, unless it be withdrawn from them by a subsequent clause of that instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">' The plaintiffs contend, that it is withdrawn by the provision, that, if the arbitrators should decide that Christie was entitled to an undivided interest in the proceeds of the Florida lands, then the whole property shall be placed in the hands of trustees, \u201c with authority to sell the same, or such part thereof as may be necessary, and appropriate the proceeds to William Christie on his own account, and to the credit of the balance which shall b.e found due to him, until the same is extinguished in the proportion of the respective interests of W. C. and C. &amp; M.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The 12th article of the award decides, that the interest of W. C. in the Florida lands, is an undivided interest. The plaintiffs insist, that the parties have themselves provided for the state of things produced by this decision. They have directed that all the lands shall be placed in the hands of trustees, to be sold by them so far as may be necessary for the payment of the debt due. to Christie. They have agreed on what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>shall be. done if the lands were held in common, and that on which 'they have agreed is incohsistent with what the arbitrators have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">There is, undoubtedly, some confusion in this part of the submission, which renders the construction difficult. It directs, that the interest of Christie, as well as that of C. &amp; M., shall be sold, and fhe proceeds applied to the individual credit of Christie, and to the-credit of C. &amp; M. on their debt to Christie, in proportion to their respective interests in the land. This may be readily, done, should the lands be sufficient to discharge the debt. Should they be insufficient, and should the insufficiency arise from want of title in C. &amp; M,, Christie gives the credit absolutely, although he had contended that the right of the plaintiffs to the.credit depended on the validity of the title they sold. This consideration may enter into the construction of the submission, if the words be doubtful, but cannot control the arrangement of the parties if that be intelligible. We rather incline to the opinion, that as the whole property, including the interest of Christie, was to be placed in the hands of trustees to be sold on joint account, that the conveyance- of a title to Christie could not be content-plated as a preliminary measure. But it is unnecessary to. give any positive opinion on this point, because, we think, the award must be set aside because it is uncertain, and not final in a very material point.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The arbitrators have determined that .C. &lt;fc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>M. are entitled to a credit of 63,290 dollars and 99 cents, on account of the sales of lands to Christie, provided they \u201c shall grant, or cause granted, to the said W. C., a clear, unencumbered and satisfactory title\u201d to the said lands, No time is limited,by which this title shall be made. The question, then, whether this credit is to be allowed, or disallowed, is left indefinitely open. Consequently, the award is net final. It does not settle the accounts between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"A8SZ\">The award set aside, as being uncertain and inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">If it be said that the Court may pr\u00e9scribe some time by which the title shall be made, the answer is, that if the arbitrators could refer that question to the Court, they have not done so. They have left it entirely open. But the award ought itself to settle finally and conclusively the whole matter referred to them. It is contrary to the principle of a general reference, that the Court should take the award as far as it goes, and supply all omissions by its decree. The award ought to be in itself a complete adjustment of the controversies submitted to the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4B\">This award, therefore, ought to be set aside, and the decree affirming it reversed, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court. The ..case will, then, stand before that Court as it did previous to the submission. The Court may dissolve the injunction so far as it should be perfectly satisfied that the plaintiffs are indebted to the defendant; and Christie may. either avail him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>self of the deeds he has received, or file a cross bill praying the aid of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Decree. This cause came on, &amp;c. On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that there is error in the decree of the Circuit Court in affirming the award made by the arbitrators in jthis cause, which said award opght to have been set aside, because the same is not certain and final. It is, therefore, decreed aud ordered, that the said decree be reversed . and annulled, and that the cause be remanded to the Circuit Court, with directions to set aside the said award, and to take such further proceedings in the said cause as may be equitable and just.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
