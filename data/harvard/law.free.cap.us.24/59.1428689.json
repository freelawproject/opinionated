M\u2018Cullough, under the following circumstances,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-15\">In the year 1819, the president of the Branch Bank, established at Baltimore, his p\u00e1rtner in trade, M\u2018Cullougli, the cashier of the branch, and Williams, one of the directors of the parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>bank, had contracted a debt to the bank to the amount of 3,497,700 dollars. The directors at Philadelphia, in consequence of some information which- they had received respecting it, passed a resolution, on the 19th of February, 1819, calculated to draw forth a complete statement of the case, with all its circumstances. This resolution. brought the papers it required, and, also, brought the president and cashier to Philadelphia, who attended for the purpose of making verbal explanations. These were received, and the.case was. referred, on the 16&lt;th of March, to a committee, whose report was made oh the 30th of the said month. It appeared by this report, that' the securities offered for the debt consisted of 20,848 shares of the stock of the bank, of 26,550 shares previously pledged for very large sums in London, Liverpool, New-York, and Bostoq, the amount of which was not stated, and the personal liability of the debtors themselves. The'report stated, As the result of many conferences, and a good deal of deliberation,\u201d an offer on the part of the debtors to give additional security for 900,000 dollars, payable in five years by annual instalments. A part of the proposed arrangement was, that the shares previously pledged in London, and elsewhere, should be liberated from the claim of the bank, and that the separate liability .of each for 300,000 dollars, should be received, instead of the joint liability of all for 900,000 dollars, This offer, with some modifications, was accepted by the bank.. A part of the security offered by M\u00a3Cullough, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sixteen merchants of Baltimore, who were to become bound for 12,500 dollars each. The committee recommended the acceptance of these terms, and also recommended, that the sufficiency of the security offered by Williams, and M'Cullough, including the sixteen sureties proposed by M'Cullough, should be referred to the members of the board residing' in Baltimore. This course was adopted by the bank, and the committee \u00a9f members residing in Baltimore reported on the whole subject. Of the sixteen names proposed for their consideration, three were withdrawn, and three were objected to. Among those who were accepted was Etting, the plaintiff in error. The negotiations, investigations, and arrangements, for the completion of the business, were some time in progress. Propositions were made for changes of the securities, and, on the 10th of May, the president, of the bank addressed a letter to the committee in Baltimore, urging them to bring it to an immediate- close. On the 14th of May, the committee at Baltimore reported the documents which had been executed in pursuance of previous arrangements made with the debtors, a report of which was made by the committee at Philadelphia, on the 17th of the same month, and, on the 18th, M\u2018Cullough was removed from the .office of cashier, which he had held from the first establishment of the bank. It was admitted, that he was a young man worth nothing, who had a fa - mily, and whose salary as cashier was 4,000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>When the n ite endorsed by Etting, the plaintiff in error, ft 11 due, he refused to pay it; on which it was. protested for non-payment, and this sult was brought by the bank. At the trial m the Court below, the whole matter was given in evidence, and the Court was moved to instruct the jury on the law which would arise on the facts of the case, and the inferences which the jury might draw from those .facts. The counsel for the plaintiffs moved the Court to instruct the jury, that if they should be of opinion, from the evidence, that the defendant, Etting, without any commurfication with the plaintiffs, but on the application d\u00a3 M\u2018Cu\u00ed]o\u00fcgh only, agreed to become his endorser, under the arrangement made between him and the plaintiffs, although they, should be satisfied, from the evidence offered by the defendant, that the said M\u2018Cullough deceived the said Etting; that it was known to the bank before, or pending the negotiation, that the debt from M'Cullough, or the greater part thereof, had ,grown out of his unauthorized and fraudulent appropriation of their funds to his own use, which knowledge the bank did not promulgate, though they contemplated his removal as soon as the securities should be given, in conformity with the arrangement which had been made ; that the defendant endorsed the note in ignorance of any fraud on the bank, or of any abuse of his offiee of cashier, or of any. probability of his removal from the said office; that, had the defendant 'known these circumstances, he would not have endorsed the said note : and that the bank fore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>bore to promulgate either the information they possessed, or their intention to remove the said M\u2018Cullough, under the inr ression, that the disclosure would increase the difficulty of the said M\u2018Cullough in procuring secu-ity, if not render it impossible for him to procure it; yet,, if they shall also be of opinion, that the defendant, without making any inquiries of the plaintiffs on the subject of such information and intention, or holding any communication with them on the subject of his intended endorsement, did, of his own accord, on the application of the said M'Cullough, and for the purpose of giving-effect to the said arrangement, endorse the said note on which this action is brought, that there was nothing in the evidence so given by the defendant, to affect the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery in this action. That, in order to vitiate the said note and endorsement in law, and to bar .the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery thereon, on the ground of a fraudulent misrepresentation, or fraudulent concealment of circumstances known to them, and unknown to the defendant, it was incumbent on the defendant to show that he applied to the plaintiffs for information, or heid some communication with them for the purpose of receiving such information, and that on such application or communication, the plaintiffs either misrepresented or concealed such circumstances; and that, in the absence of such proof, there was nothing in the facts so given in evidence' by the defendant, to affect the right of recovery in the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>. The Court gave the instruction as asked, to which an exception was taken,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOo\">The counsel for the defendant then moved the Court for instructions\u2019, that if the jury should draw from the evidence-certain inferences \\yhich were stated, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. These inferences were, that the bank was fully informed in Mareh, 1819, of the fraudulent conduct of M\u2018Cullo\u00fagh, the extent of his misapplication of their funds, and of his insolvency; that on receiving this information, they became satisfied of his unfitness to continue in office, and determined to remove him. That, however, they continued him in office until the 18th of May, carefully concealing the circumstances, and their determination, for the purpose of obtaining security of.the debt due to them from the said M\u2018Cullough, one of which so contemplated securities was the note, in question. That the defer: dant was, to the knowledge of the plaintiffs, ignorant of M\u2018Cullough\u2019s breach of duty, and of the determination to remove him, and endorsed the note by reason of that ignorance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">The Court refused to give this instruction, unless the jury should be further of opinion, \u2019.that the defendant was led into this state of Ignorance in consequence \u00f3f inquiries made by him of the plaintiffs, or of some previous communication between them and. him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">On the farther application of the. counsel for the defendant,, praying the Court to instruct the jury, that on the statement and evidence contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ed in the bills of exceptions, if the jury believed the same, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover; the Court refused to give the instruction asked, and directed the jury, that on the evidence aforesaid the plaintiffs were entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-4\">Judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs in the Court below, and the cause, was brought by writ of error to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-5\">The cause was argued by Mr. <em>Webster </em>and Mr. Taney, for the plaintiff in error, and by. the <em>Attorney General </em>and Mr. <em>Emmett, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUd\">The discussion took a wide range upon the doctrine of misrepresentation and concealment in contracts ; but as that point was not determined by the Court, it has not been thought necessary to report any thing more than \u00e1 concise summary of the arguments of counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-6\">The following points were made for the plaintiff in error, upon the instructions given and refused by the Court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-7\">1. That the concealment of the facts' and circumstances above mentioned, or the concealment of any one of them, whereby the plaintiff in error was induced to enter into the contract in question, was a fraud upon him, and vitiated the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-8\">2. That if the mere omission to. communicate the said facts and circumstances would not be a fraud, yet, the act of the defendants in \u00e9rror, of continuing M'Cullough in office, in order to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>him credit, and thereby to procure the security in question by which means the plaintiff in error was deceived, and induced to endorse the said note, was a fraud upon him, and vitiated the contract.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b73-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>March Sth </em>and jo/ft</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>3. That the continuance of M'Cullough in the office of cashier, from the 16th of March, 1819, (when his misconduct in office came to the knowledge of the president and directors of the bank, until the 18th of May following, when he was dismissed, was a violation of the duty of the president and directors to the government of the' United States, and to the public, and, therefore, vitiated any contract obtained by means of such continuance in office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">Upon the first point, it was argued, that the concealment of material circumstances, known to one party, and unknown to the other, vitiates the contract.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> In the opinion given by the Court below, the principle was admitted, but with this qualification, that it must be <em>on inquiry or communication, for the purpose of information. </em>In this view of the subject, the only question would be, whetherthe rul\u00e9is subject tothis limitation, i. e. of inquiry or communication for the purpose of information. But an exception to the rule was supposed to exist, and it might be said, that a party is not bound to communicate circumstances ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>trinsic to the contract, and that the circumstances concealed were <em>extrinsic. </em>If this proposition were true, although there had been inquiry and communication, yet the facts themselves being of such a character that they need not to have been disclosed, that alone created the exception to the rule. But, it ivas insisted, the exception ought to be confined to those facts which are equally open to both parties. The ground upon which Etting undertook for M\u2018Cullough s performance, was his confidence in his supposed integrity, and in his resources and credit derived from his connexion with the bank. No case could be found, which states, that <em>inquiry </em>is necessary to create the obligation to disclose material facts, which are not equally within the knowledge of both parties. The fraud consists in dealing with the party in ignorance, and leaving him so. It is not necessary that the other party should have created the false impression, or intended to have created it. It is sufficient that he' knows it, and. takes advantage of it.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> Undue concealment consists in the suppression of a material fact, not in the knowledge of both parties, and not of a nature to be equally known to both parties, in a case where confidence s reposed that the fact does not exist. In <em>Laidlaw </em>v. <em>Or</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>gan, </em>the intelligence was of a nature to be cclually known to both parties, and it was not a ^act resPect\u00edn\u00a7' which confidence is generally reposed that it will be disclosed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">On the second point, it was argued, that here was an act done in order to give a false credit, and it did give false credit. It was a positive deceit by acts, though not by words. It was asked, whether a party might lawfully deceive in one way, and not in the other ? The law is more consistent with common justice, and says you must do nothing to deceive.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> It was a case of industrious concealment.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> By continuing the cashier in office, the defendants in error gave him a fictitious credit which they knew did not belong to him. It was analogous to the ordinary case of the fraudulent misrepresentation of the credit of another.<footnotemark>c</footnotemark> It had been said there was no inquiry. Why was there none ? Because, the very continuance of the officer in office, was evidence that they thought him honest. It might, perhaps, be contended, that nothing was positively said or done by the bank calculated to mislead the surety. But silence, or an omission to act, may, in many cases, as effectually deceive the party, as the most explicit declaration, or the most positive acts. Continuing the cashier in office was equivalent to a <em>suggestio falsi.</em><footnotemark><em>d</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>On the third point, the peculiar character of the bank was insisted on, as an instrument of the government, not. created for its own profit merely, but as a means to aid the financial operations of the government<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Both the public and the government were deceived and injured by the misplaced confidence of the bank in their cashier. It was their duty to have removed him the ihstaiit his default was discovered. It is contrary to the policy of the law to enforce a contract obtained by a breach of duty to the public. . The bank may be considered as a public officer, and is bound by the same obligations, and owes the same duties, as any other public officer. But, would it be pretended, that a public officer co\u00fcld keep an unworthy agent or. deputy in office, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the mere purpose of securing a debt due to himself?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ab3\">Mr. <em>Fonbtanqne, </em>as to what circumstances a contracting party is bound to disclose : \u201c If a man, by the suppression of a truth <em>which he was hound to </em>communicate, or by the wilful suggestion of a falsehood, be the cause of prejudice to another, <em>who had a right to a full and correct representation of thejact, </em>it is certainly agreeable to the dictates of a good conscience, that his claim should be postponed to that of the person whose confidence was'induced by his representation.\u201d<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Under certain modifications, and with certain exceptions, the party is bound to communicate all circumstances <em>intrinsic </em>in the contract itself; all those circumstances which enter into the contract as ingredients, and form constituent parts of it. But, with regard to-circumstances <em>extrinsic </em>to the contract, though forming inducements to enter into it, however powerfully he may believe and know they are operating with the opposite party, he is at liberty to keep silence. Intrinsic circumstances are such, for example, as regard the quality and price of the article, which must, of necessity, enter into the inducements. Extrinsic circumstances are those considerations which form no component part of the contract itself, but which may form inducements with the party to enter into it. The distinction is founded a the- part of the defendants in error, it was stated, that the rule is accurately laid down by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in reason, and is necessary to the business of life.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> With regard to the whole class of <em>extrinsic </em>circumstances, though, if the party undertake to disclose them, he must take care to state the truth, yet, he .may maintain the most obstinate silence respecting them, and the contract will still be valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\">As to the objection,'that the rule roust be received with the qualification, that the facts are equally accessible to both parties, it was said, that if by this was meant, that they must be equally accessible to both <em>by the use of ordinary diligence, </em>it could not be considered as well. founded.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> And, if it meant' nothing more than that it was physically accessible, where the party pushes his inquiries in all possible directions, and takes sufficient time to make the discovery, then it was inapplicable to any practical purpose in the business- of life. The qualification -had been borrowed from the law with regard to <em>intrinsic </em>circumstances, to which it was properly applied, and transferred to <em>extrinsic </em>circumstances, to which it was wholly inapplicable. Assuming, that, with regard to <em>extrinsic </em>circumstances, a party may conceal them without impairing the contract, there was not a feature in any one of the instructions in this case which was not justified by the operation of that principle.' The keeping the cashier in office was doing nothing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>It <em>was a </em>mere forbearance to act. All the cases referred to, of industrious concealment, admitted of of two answers:. (1.) That the concealment was of circumstances <em>intrinsic </em>to the contract. <em>(2.) </em>That, in all the cases, no acts were done to alter the antecedent state of things for the purpose of concealment. As to the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>The Bank of Scotland,</em><footnotemark><em>a</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which had been relied upon as analogous to the present, it would be found that there was a positive misrepresentation on the part of the bank, they alleging that further security was wanted on account of an increase of business, when, in fact, there w\u00e1s a decrease. Another case from the same book might have been cited, where an attempt was made to set aside a security bond, alleged to have been obtained by unfounded representations of circumstances generally, without any direct reference to the bond, and the Court having, according to the forms of the Scottish law, appointed the sureties to say whether they would refer to the respondent\u2019s oath, \u201c that he did <em>elicit </em>that bond ?\u201d and the sureties having admitted, that \u201c they never meant to say that there was any degree of personal influence with either of them <em>to \u00bflicit the' bond of </em>relief,\u201d the Court of Session pronounced in favour of the bond, which was affirmed by the House of Lords on appeal.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> So, here, it might be asked, whether the plaintiffs below had done any thing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>eUcit </em>the note. All that was alleged was, that they had not communicated their intention of removing the cashier, when they were not asked respecting their intentions, and when it was equally lawful for them to retain or to remove him. The effort on the other side is to induce the Court to establish a new rule of law, which, however analogous to other principles merely applicable to the contract of insurance, was admitted, even by the ingenious and learned author of the treatise which had been referred to, not to form a part of the jurisprudence of this country.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aq0\">\n<em>March 16th</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\"><em> </em>2 <em>Wheat.

The deficit had been increasing from year to year, and was at length carried beyond what the company were likely to.recover. They demanded additional security, which he procured. The case had come before him only upon motion, but he had thought a good deal upon it, and the light in which it appeared to him was this: If he k new himself to be cheated by an agent, and, concealing that fact, applied for security, in such a manner, and under such circumstances, as .held him out to others as one whom he considered as a trustworthy person, and any one acting under the impression that the agent was so considered by his employer, had become bound for him ; it appeared to him, that he could not conscientiously hold that security. He was, then, of opinion, that the Fishmonger\u2019s Company could not hold their security. He did not know what had become of pie case afterwards, but, he believed, that his opinion was submitted to, and that no further proceedings were had. He had since reconsidered the matter, and still retained his formei opinion, and would act upon it judicially, if occasion offered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\n<em> Verplanch on Contracts.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b81-6\">Mr. Chief Justice Marshall</author>\n<p id=\"AnEx\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">If this case depended on the deservedly high character of the individuals who were engaged on the part of the bank in the transactions in which the suit originated; if elevation above the. possibility of suspicion that they could have meditated any thing believed by themselves to be legally or morally wrong, could decide it, this cause would not have required the great efforts which have been bestowed upon it. The names which appear on this record can never be connected with actual fraud; nor would any difficulty be found in protecting them from the imputation, were it possible that it could be made. But judicial inquiries are into the rights of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ties ; and, although high and honourable charactor ^1\u00a3ls\u2019 an&lt;^ ought to have, great influence in weighing testimony in which that character is in \u00b0 \u00b0 . . * , , . \u201e any manner involved; yet, when the inferences from that testimony are drawn by others, and a Court is required to pronounce the law arising upon them, character is excluded from the view' of the Judge, and legal principles alone can be acknowledged as his guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">At the trial several points of law wore raised by both parties, on which opinions were given, to which exceptions were taken, and the correctness of those opinions constitutes the single inquiry in this Court. [Here the learned Chief Justice stated the case, as it is stated above.]</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">As preliminary to the inquiry, whether the law arising on the facts,, and on the inferences \u00e1ssumed in the bills of exceptions contained in the record, was correctly stated by the Court, a point has been made at the bar, which must be disposed of. It has been contended, that a Court is not bound to answer abstract or hypothetical questions of law, not growing out of the testimony in the cause, which may be propounded at the bar; and, to apply this principle, it has been also contended, that the testimony contained in the record, and referred to in the bills of exceptions, contains nothing from which the jury could possibly draw those inferences of fact upon which the Court was asked to declare the law. That the points made in the bill of exceptions constitute a distinct and totally different case from that made by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>That a Judge cannot be required, to declare the low on hypothetical questions which do not belong to the cause on trial, has been frequently asserted in this Court, and.is, we believe, incon trovertible.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> The Court may, at any time, refuse to .give an opinion on such a point; and if the party propounding the question is dissatisfied' with it, he may exec-pt to the refusal, which ex-. Ception will avail him, if he shows that the question was warranted by the testimony, and that the opinion he asked ought to have been given. But, rf the Judge proceeds to state the law, and states it erroneously, <em>his </em>opinion ought to be revised ; and if it can have had any influence on the jury, their verdict ought to be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">It cannot, however, we think, be correctly affirmed with respect to the case now under consideration, that the poihts stated in the bills of exception have no relation to the testimony to which those bills refer. That testimony consists of- various communications and reports, made to the bank, of their own transactions, and of the admissions of parties. It has been said, that this testimony is all in writing, and is to be construed by the Court; and from this proposition is deduced the corollary, that the jury was not at liberty to draw inferences from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Were the fact as alleged, and were it true, that the testimony is all in writing, the consequence drawn from it cannot be admitted. Conceding it to be the province of the Court to construe any particular paper which was offered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>evidence, the report of the 30th of March for example, and to declare the meaning of every sentence, and of the whole instrument, yet this contains a great variety of extrinsic circumstances, suggests measures of deep interest, was followed by numerous successive acts which took place in the country, and which do not derive all their influence on the cause from the construction of the particular papers in which they are communicated, but, in a considerable degree, from their connexion with each other, from the motives in which they originate, and from the effects they were calculated to produce, and did produce, on others. These subjects are peculiarly proper for the consideration of a jury. If the testimony be examined, it will, we think, appear, that the \u2022 counsel for the plaintiffs has not asked the Court to give its opinion on any inferences of fact which it was not at least possible for the jury to draw from the evidence. The knowledge of the bank is not questioned. The ignorance of Etting might be inferred from the absence of all testimony proving his knowledge that any fraud had been practised by M'Cullough. The original resolution of the bank to. remove M\u2018Cullough might be inferred from their knowledge of his unfitness for the office, and from the fact that they did remove him the instant the securities were obtained which they expected from him. The same facts might justify the -inference respecting the motives which induced the bank to retain him in office until those securities were procured</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We are far from saying that these inferences were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>all of them such as the jury ought to have drawn. It is not difficult to perceive, that the bank might have acted on motives equally unexceptionable morals and in law. The jury might very fvell have believed that the bank thought the 26,550 shares of stock were not worth more than the sums for which they were pledged, or, at any rate, were not a safe security, and might, therefore, think it advisable to relinquish that pledge, if other security could be substituted in its place. Others might estimate that stock more highly than they did, and might estimate it rightly. Friends, therefore, acting on their own judgment of the value of this stock, might b.e found willing to endorse the paper of Mr. M'Cullough on receiving it as a pledge. The motive, too, for retaining Mr. M\u2018Cullough in office might be to induce him to do the bank all the justice in his power, not to induce others to endorse his notes. The whole subject was before the jury, and they might hfaye drawn from the testimony either these inferences, or those which are stated in the bills of exceptions. The counsel for the plaintiffs, believing the law to be in their favour even upon that view of the testimony which is taken in the exceptions, and fearing that the jury, should they take that view, might find for the defendant, chose to refer the law to the Court. Whether'his fears respecting the jury were well or ill founded, this cause must now be decided on the correctness of the opinion given bv the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">In the very elaborate arguments which have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>been made at the bar, several cases have befen cited which have been attentively considered! No attempt will be made to analyze them, or to on their application to the case before us, because the Judges are divided respecting it. Consequently, the principles of law which have been argued cannot be settled ; but the judgment is affirmed, the Court being divided in opinion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"><em> </em>Hamilton v.
