Walker against Baltic Shipping Company, owner of the M/V ATKARSK, to recover damages for physical injuries Walker sustained when he slipped and fell down a ladder of the M/V ATKARSK. At the time of his injury, Walker was working on the M/V ATKARSK as a longshoreman winch operator, employed by J. P. Florio &amp; Company, Inc., an independent stevedoring contractor hired by Baltic to load and unload cargo from the vessel. After a nonjury trial, the district judge found Walker\u2019s total damages to be $57,504.73, but that Walker was 60% contributorily negligent. The court accordingly reduced Walker\u2019s judgment to $23,-001.89. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In the afternoon of September 3, 1974, Simmie Walker was assigned to take over the winch controls from the morning operator at the No. 3 hold of the M/V ATKARSK. To get to the controls, Walker had to pass from the main deck to the higher, boat-deck level, where the controls were located. Walker accomplished this by ascending the ship\u2019s ladder on the starboard side of the vessel. The starboard ladder was a \u201cstair-type\u201d ladder resembling the steps still used on occasion by passengers to board commercial airplanes. The ladder was partially obstructed by a lashing wire strung across it from a point above and on the port side of it to a point below and to starboard of it. Walker stooped under the wire, proceeded up the ladder, and began his work at the winch controls. Approximately an hour and a half later, Walker stopped work to get a drink of water. The water container was on the main deck, so he walked back to the starboard ladder and started to descend it facing forward, or toward the stern of the vessel. As Walker approached the wire, he put his hand on it and stooped to pass under it. As he did so, he slipped on the ladder tread and fell down, injuring himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Walker reported the accident to his foreman but used the same ladder twice more, to return to work and when leaving for the dayT Lashing wires are ordinarily used to fasten cargo, but according to the testimony of Baltic\u2019s expert witness, this wire was performing no such function (Supp.R. at 169; <em>see </em>District Court Finding of Fact No. 1). Defendant Baltic Shipping Company was responsible for the presence of the lashing cable (Supp.R. at 122, 129; <em>see </em>Finding of Fact No. 1). Walker did not notify his foreman of the obstructed ladder before starting work, nor did the foreman ask the ship\u2019s crew to remove the wire obstruction. There were alternate passageways and ladders from the main deck to the winch controls which Walker could have used to reach the controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">In 1972, Congress amended the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-50, to increase workers\u2019 compensation benefits and to remove no-fault liability of vessels to workers based on the doctrines of \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d or \u201cnon-delegable duty.\u201d Under section 905(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> vessels became liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>only for their own negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the legislative history to the 1972 amendments, Congress suggested that a uniform federal standard for determining vessels\u2019 negligence founded on land-based negligence concepts be developed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the legislative history also discloses that certain land-based concepts, such as assumption of the risk and contributory negligence, \u201care not to be carried over into the federal law governing LHWCA suits.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">The leading case for this circuit in applying the foregoing principles is <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport &amp; Trading, Ltd., </em>546 F.2d 1233 (5th Cir. 1976). In <em>Gay, </em>we held that the Restatement (Second) of Torts, particularly sections 342, 343 and 343A(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> constitute the uniform federal standard to be applied in LHWCA cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the second opinion of this court to apply the Restatement sections to LHWCA suits, <em>Brown v. Mitsubishi Shin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>taku Ginko, </em>550 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1977), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">Those sections impose a duty on a possessor of property to inform invitees (including employees asked to work on the property) of any dangerous condition present on the property that he knows or should reasonably know about; relieve the possessor of this duty if invitees should reasonably be expected to discover or realize the danger on their own; but reimpose a duty on the possessor to alleviate the danger if he should reasonably anticipate that invitees might be harmed despite their awareness of the danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">550 F.2d at 333-34. After a careful review and balancing of the competing concerns embodied in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit decisions, and the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA, we hold that under the particular facts of this case, the district court\u2019s apportionment of damages was the proper disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Baltic first contends that the wire across the ladder did not, in the words of section 343 of the Restatement, \u201cinvolve [ ] an unreasonable risk of harm\u201d; therefore, a prima facie case for plaintiff has not been established. However, in cases with analogous facts, courts have found that similar conditions present an unreasonable risk of harm. <em>See, e. g., Canizzo v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>579 F.2d 682 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 929, 99 S.Ct. 316, 50 L.Ed.2d 322 (1978) (grease and cables on deck); <em>Spaulding v. Parry Navigation Co., </em>187 F.2d 257 (2d Cir. 1951) (ladder improperly lashed to ship); <em>Leeds v. Sun-Ray Drug Co., </em>173 F.2d 666 (3d Cir. 1949) (grease on stairs of store); <em>Surface v. Safeway Stores, </em>169 F.2d 937 (8th Cir. 1948) (water on floor).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dean Prosser defines unreasonably dangerous conditions in a way which would include the circumstances here of a wire across a ladder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The wire increased the probability that an accident would occur on the ladder. The seriousness or gravity of the potential accident was substantial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, the utility of the wire being placed as it was, was minimal; as we stated above, as far as we can discern from the record, the wire served no purpose. The placement of the wire thus created an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">Both parties agree that the danger was open and obvious and that Walker knew of its existence. Therefore, the crux of the dispute involves an interpretation of section 343A(l)\u2019s imposition of liability on the owner if, in the words of the subsection, it \u201cshould anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">Baltic argues that it could not anticipate the harm to Walker because it can only anticipate reasonable acts of longshoremen on its vessel, and Walker acted unreasonably in encountering an open and obvious danger. However, as the comments to sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tion 343A point out, there are numerous reasons to expect harm to the visitor despite the obviousness of the danger. Illustrations explain that the visitor might have his attention distracted, he might have forgotten about the danger, or he might believe the benefit of encountering the danger outweighs the risk. Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 343A, Comment f and Illustrations 2-5 (1965). We hold that Baltic <em>could </em>have foreseen the harm to Walker; we now consider whether, under the law of this circuit, Baltic <em>should </em>have anticipated the harm and whether Baltic will therefore be held liable for Walker\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Since our decision in <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport &amp; Trading, Ltd., </em>this circuit has stated that recovery by longshoremen for personal injuries upon encountering open and obvious dangers should normally be limited to cases where the danger <em>\u201cmust </em>be faced notwithstanding knowledge.\u201d 546 F.2d 1233, 1242 (5th Cir. 1976) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., Brown v. Mitsubishi Shintaku Ginko, </em>550 F.2d 331, 334 (5th Cir. 1977) (recovery if danger \u201cmust be faced\u201d); <em>Hess v. Upper Mississippi Towing Corp., </em>559 F.2d 1030, 1036, <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 924, 98 S.Ct. 1489, 55 L.Ed.2d 518 (1978) and <em>Stockstill v. Gypsum Transportation, </em>607 F.2d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir. 1979) (recovery if invitees \u201ccould not appreciate or could not avoid\u201d danger). The parties agree that alternate routes to the winch controls were available to Walker. However, under the facts of this case, the availability of an alternate route does not end our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">Beginning with <em>Brown, supra, </em>the same cases that considered the \u201cavoidability\u201d of the danger also introduced \u201ccontrol\u201d of the work area as an element to aid the court in deciding these cases. When the accident occurs in an area controlled by the stevedore \u2014 the longshoreman\u2019s employer \u2014 or in an area controlled by the longshoreman himself, recovery will be denied. <em>See Brown, supra </em>at 334 (longshoreman controlled the condition, recovery denied); <em>Hess, supra </em>at 1036 (condition created by stevedore\u2019s employees, recovery denied); <em>Stockstill, supra </em>at 1117 (danger under control of stevedore\u2019s employees, recovery denied). In the instant case, the ladder was not in an area controlled by the stevedore or the longshoreman.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, one of the elements weighing heavily against recovery is absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">In passing the 1972 amendments, Congress indicated that by removing vessel\u2019s absolute liability for unseaworthiness the amendments would promote safety aboard ship,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> since placing primary liability on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>stevedores for longshoremen\u2019s injuries would encourage the persons best able to prevent accidents to make work areas safer. <em>See Lubrano v. Royal Netherlands Steamship Co., </em>572 F.2d 364, 370-71 (2d Cir. 1978). The Restatement (Second) of Torts, itself, does not state that the danger must be unavoidable in order for the plaintiff to recover.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the Fifth Circuit has determined that in weighing the many elements arguing for or against recovery, at least when the condition is controlled by the stevedore or the longshoreman himself, the obvious danger must be unavoidable before longshoremen\u2019s suits against the vessel will be successful. Such a balancing is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201cliability shall fall upon the party best situated to adopt preventative measures and thereby to reduce the likelihood of injury.\u201d <em>Italia Societa Per Azioni De Navigazione v. Oregon Stevedore Co., </em>376 U.S. 315, 324, 84 S.Ct. 748, 754,11 L.Ed.2d 732 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Where the dangerous condition is located in an area of the ship not under the control of the stevedore or longshoreman, a balancing of competing interests must be made. In passing the 1972 amendments, Congress specifically stated that \u201cnothing in this bill is intended to derogate from the vessel\u2019s responsibility to take appropriate corrective action where it knows or should have known about a dangerous condition.\u201d 1972 House Report at 4704. Moreover, \u201cthe admiralty concept of comparative negligence, rather than the common law rule as to contributory negligence, shall apply in cases where the injured employee\u2019s own negligence may have contributed to causing the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4705. Thus, when determining which party is \u201cbest situated\u201d to prevent the accident becomes more problematical, the basic admiralty concept of apportioning damages carries more weight. Here, it is difficult for us to say that Walker and his stevedore were better situated to prevent the accident by stopping work until the wire was removed or by using an alternative route than was the shipowner by never stringing the wire across the ladder in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In the Second Circuit\u2019s case of <em>Canizzo v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>579 F.2d 682 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 929, 99 S.Ct. 316, 58 L.Ed.2d 322 (1978), a longshoreman was moving to his new work area and walked through a passageway where he slipped on some grease obscured by wires on the deck. The district court applied section 343A, yet still held the shipowner liable. The trial court held, however, \u201cthat Canizzo had been contributorily negligent in failing to walk with sufficient caution, or alternatively, in failing to avoid the wires by taking a different route,\u201d and reduced his recovery 40%. <em>Id. </em>at 684. In upholding recovery the Second Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">Too strict a view of a shipowner\u2019s liability in these situations would do much to diminish the salutary effects of the 1972 amendments by, in effect, making shipowners liable, once again, on what is akin to an unseaworthiness standard, but without recourse to contribution on the part of a negligent stevedore. Too lax a view would specifically contradict the congressional intention to make shipowners liable for their own negligence under the amended statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>579 F.2d at 685. Striking the balance in favor of apportioned damages under similar circumstances here, where the dangerous condition is not under the control of the stevedore or longshoreman, is in our view the proper solution to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Baltic\u2019s final argument is that any negligence besides Walker\u2019s was attributable to J. P. Florio, the stevedore, and not to Baltic. However, we agree with the district judge\u2019s Conclusion of Law No. 2: \u201cThe defendant was negligent in creating the hazardous condition and failing to remedy the situation by removing the cable.\u201d (R. at 439) Once Baltic\u2019s negligence is established, whether the stevedore was also negligent is irrelevant to the issue of Walker\u2019s recovery against Baltic. The district judge correctly stated in his Conclusion of Law No. 3 that \u201cthe negligence of the stevedore company will not insulate a negligent shipowner from liability. <em>Samuels v. Empress Lineas Maritimas Argentinas, </em>573 F.2d 884 [, 888] (5th Cir. 1978).\u201d The Supreme Court has recently held that despite the \u201cawkward wording\u201d of the first two sentences of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> they do not change the \u201cpre-existing rule that a longshoreman who is injured by the concurrent negligence of the stevedore and the ship may recover for the entire amount of his injuries from the ship.\u201d <em>Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, </em>443 U.S. 256, 266, 99 S.Ct. 2753, 2760, 61 L.Ed.2d 521 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We have considered all of Baltic\u2019s contentions with respect to the district court\u2019s findings of fact but hold that these findings are not clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm the award made by the trial court in favor of plaintiff Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">.

Baltic\u2019s expert witness testified that a stevedoring firm assumes control \u201cfor the hatches they are working,\u201d not for the entire ship. Supp.R. at 174. The record shows that J. P. Florio was \u201cworking\u201d hatches 2 and 3 on the date involved, <em>id. </em>at 175, but that the obstructed ladder was near hatch 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">Longshoreman Walker did not assume control of the ladder or the wire merely by the act of coming in contact with them. Baltic\u2019s expert stated that despite Walker\u2019s lack of control, \u201cif he saw an unsafe condition, he could have it corrected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. Apparently the trial judge took this into account in determining Walker\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b371-16\">.

Comment (f), Illustration 5 to section 343A, is most closely analogous to the instant case. Although the illustration gives an example of an unavoidable danger, several of the thirteen cases on which the illustration is based, see Restatement (Second) of Torts, Appendix, Reporter\u2019s Notes \u00a7 343A, are not unavoidable danger situations. See <em>Surface v. Safeway Stores, </em>169 F.2d 937, 940 (8th Cir. 1948) (\u201cIt is true that voluntary exposure to an obvious danger which reasonably can be avoided will ordinarily constitute contributory negligence\u201d to bar recovery.

The difference between the instant case and <em>Frasca </em>is apparent. In <em>Frasca, </em>the longshoremen were assigned to unload the No. 4 hatch and Mr. Frasca slipped on the No. 4 hatch\u2019s slippery ladder. Recovery was denied. Here, Walker\u2019s gang was assigned to unload hatch No. 3 and Walker slipped on a ladder near the No. 4 hatch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b373-23\">. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
