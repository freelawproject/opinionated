After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-20\">A. 1999 Initial Forfeiture Order</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-21\">In 1994, Duboc was charged with drug trafficking and money laundering between 1982 and 1994. Duboc pled guilty to (1) conspiring to import marijuana into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960(b)(1)(G), and 963, and (2) conspiring to launder monetary instruments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(A) and (g). The district court sentenced Duboc to one term of life imprisonment and one term of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-22\">At Duboc\u2019s 1998 sentencing, the district court also found that Duboc had no legitimate source of income and that Duboc\u2019s assets were acquired either directly or indirectly from his drug trafficking. In 1999, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853, the district court ordered Duboc to forfeit (1) $100 million in proceeds of the crimes for which Duboc was convicted, less the value of any property forfeited to date, and (2) a list of specified assets, including automobiles, bank accounts, and real estate, which were also proceeds of Duboc\u2019s crimes. The district court retained jurisdiction so that the government could move for amendments to the forfeiture order to include newly discovered property and to substitute assets. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-23\">In 2000, Thailand \u201crestrained\u201d two condominiums in Thailand (the \u201cThailand condos\u201d) that Duboc owned in response to a request by the United States under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (\u201cMLAT\u201d) between Thailand and the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-24\">B. 2011 Amended Forfeiture Order</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-25\">In 2011, the government moved to amend the 1999 forfeiture order to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>the Thailand condos. The government claimed that Duboc, who is still incarcerated, acquired these properties when he was engaged in drug trafficking and that Duboc had no legitimate explanation for the source of the funds used to purchase the Thailand condos. Accordingly, the government contended that the Thailand condos were subject to forfeiture (1) in satisfaction of the $100 million judgment; (2) as proceeds of Duboc\u2019s crimes of conviction, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(1); and (3) as substitute assets, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p). The government further argued that Duboc was collaterally estopped from relitigating his conviction and the 1999 forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Duboc responded to the government\u2019s motion. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion. In its order, the district court applied 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(d), which establishes a rebut-table presumption that property of a person convicted of certain crimes is subject to forfeiture if the property was acquired during the period covered by the crime and there is no likely source for the property other than the crime. The district court determined that this presumption of forfeiture applied because (1) the Thailand condos were acquired during the period covered by Duboc\u2019s indictment; (2) the district court had previously found that Duboc had no significant legitimate income to justify his wealth; (3) Duboc had identified no persuasive legitimate source for the acquisition of the Thailand condos; and (4) the district court had found that Duboc profited in the amount of $100 million from his criminal activity. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(d). Alternatively, the district court found that the Thailand condos could be forfeited as substitute assets in partial satisfaction of the $100 million judgment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Duboc appeals <em>pro se. </em>Duboc argues that the district court erred by amending the forfeiture order because (1) the Thailand condos were not purchased with proceeds from drug shipments into the United States, and collateral estoppel does not bar him from litigating issues decided in his earlier criminal proceeding; (2) the amendment to the forfeiture order was barred by the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches; (3) Duboc\u2019s due process rights were violated by the 11-year delay between Thailand\u2019s 2000 restraint of the Thailand condos and the government\u2019s 2011 motion to amend the forfeiture order; and (4) the MLAT between Thailand and the United States renders void the district court\u2019s amended order with respect to the Thailand condos.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AXO\">A. Forfeiture Order Amendment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(1), anyone convicted of violating, <em>inter alia, </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960(b)(1)(G), and 963 shall forfeit \u201cany property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation.\u201d Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2 requires the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>court to determine what property is subject to forfeiture, and, if the government identifies specific property, whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(1)(A). The district court may amend a forfeiture order at any time. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(e)(1) (stating that the district court may \u201cat any time enter an order of forfeiture or amend an existing order of forfeiture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">In addition, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(d) establishes a rebuttable presumption that any property of the defendant is subject to forfeiture if the government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the defendant acquired the property during the time of, or within a reasonable time after, the criminal activity, and (2) there was no likely source for the property other than the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Here, the district court did not err by amending the forfeiture order. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(d), Duboc\u2019s Thailand condos were presumptively subject to forfeiture because the district court found that (1) Duboc acquired the Thailand condos during the time covered by his convictions for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960(b)(1)(G), and 963, which are offenses covered by \u00a7 853(a); and (2) Duboc had no legitimate source of income during the time in question and had gained over $100 million from his criminal activity, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 853(d)(2). Accordingly, Duboc bore the burden of rebutting the presumption that the Thailand condos were subject to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">To the extent Duboc now argues that he had a legitimate source of income to account for his acquisition of the Thailand condos, this issue is (1) the same issue the district court decided at Duboc\u2019s 1998 sentencing; (2) actually litigated at Duboc\u2019s 1998 sentencing; and (3) critical and necessary to the district court\u2019s decision at Duboc\u2019s 1998 sentencing that Duboc\u2019s property was subject to forfeiture. Accordingly, the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes Duboc from relitigating the district court\u2019s finding at Duboc\u2019s sentencing that Duboc had no legitimate income to justify his wealth. <em>See United States v. Jean-Baptiste, </em>395 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that collateral estoppel bars a criminal defendant from relitigating issues necessarily decided in his criminal trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">In any event, even if Duboc were entitled to relitigate this issue, Duboc fails to show that \u201cthere was no likely source for\u201d the Thailand condos other than proceeds of the crimes for which he was convicted. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(d)(2). Duboc argues that he was convicted only with respect to drugs he imported into the United States and that only 2.4 percent of the $100 million he earned was attributable to drugs he imported into the United States. But even assuming Duboc\u2019s figure is accurate, this figure alone does not show that the Thailand condos were not purchased with the proceeds of the crimes for which Duboc was convicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, by Duboc\u2019s own math, he realized $2.4 million from these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">The Thailand condos are thus subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(1) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-13\">B. Statute of Limitations and Laches<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-14\">Duboc next claims that the government\u2019s motion to amend the forfeiture order was barred by the statute of limitations and the equitable doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>As to the statute of limitations, Duboc relies on 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, which states that any suit or action to recover any \u201cforfeiture of property accruing under the customs laws\u201d must be brought within five years of the time when the offense was discovered. However, \u00a7 1621 applies to <em>in rem </em>civil forfeiture proceedings, not <em>in personam </em>criminal forfeiture judgments, and is therefore inapplicable here. <em>See United States v. Carrell, </em>252 F.3d 1193, 1198-99 (11th Cir.2001) (identifying \u00a7 1621 as a civil forfeiture statute applicable in civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings); <em>United States v. Bissell, </em>866 F.2d 1343, 1348 n. 3 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cA criminal forfeiture [under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853] operates <em>in personam </em>against the defendant, serving as a penalty upon conviction. A civil forfeiture operates <em>in rem </em>against the property itself under the theory that the property is guilty of wrongdoing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Even if \u00a7 1621 were applicable, the statute of limitations would be tolled because the Thailand condos are not located in the United States. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621(2) (\u201c[T]he time of the absence from the United States of the person subject to the penalty or forfeiture, or of any concealment or absence of the property, shall not be reckoned within the 5-year period of limitation.\u201d); <em>United States v. All Funds in Account Nos. 747.034/278, 747.009/278, 747.009/278 &amp; 747.714/278 in Banco Espa\u00f1ol de Cr\u00e9dito, Spain, </em>295 F.3d 23, 27 (D.C.Cir.2002) (concluding that action under \u00a7 1621 was commenced during the \u201cabsence of the property\u201d because property was located outside of United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Duboc\u2019s laches argument also fails because the United States is generally not subject to the defense of laches when it enforces its rights. <em>See United States v. Summerlin, </em>310 U.S. 414, 416, 60 S.Ct. 1019,1020, 84 L.Ed. 1283 (1940) (\u201cIt is well settled that the United States is not ... subject to the defense of laches in enforcing its rights.\u201d); <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>321 F.3d 1338, 1349 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that \u201crare exceptions to this [Summerlin] rule\u201d apply only in civil cases and \u201cha[ve] never been applied in a criminal context\u201d). Here, the conduct of the government was the government\u2019s enforcing its rights to seize property Duboc obtained with the profits of an international drug trafficking operation. <em>See Bissell, </em>866 F.2d at 1349 (recognizing the \u201cprinciple that the fruits and instrumentalities of a crime do not belong to the criminal, but rather to the government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">In any event, as noted above, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(e)(1) permits the district court to amend a criminal forfeiture order \u201cat any time\u201d on motion by the government. As of 2009, the $100 million judgment had not been fully satisfied. And no provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853 or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure otherwise limits the time during which the government may move to amend an existing criminal forfeiture order to seize property subject to forfeiture under \u00a7 853. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>227 F.3d 955, 970 (7th Cir.2000) (explaining that a criminal forfeiture order is an <em>in personam </em>judgment enforceable \u201cfor the balance of [the defendant\u2019s] prison term and beyond\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">C. Due Process and Notice<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">Duboc argues next that the 11-year delay between the United States\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>2000 request that Thailand restrain the Thailand condos and its 2011 motion to amend the 1999 forfeiture order violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Duboc cites Supreme Court and other federal court of appeals cases holding that due process requires the government to commence property forfeiture proceedings without undue delay. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($8,850) in United States Currency, </em>461 U.S. 555, 562-70, 103 5.Ct. 2005, 2011-15, 76 L.Ed.2d 143 (1983); <em>Ivers v. United States, </em>581 F.2d 1362, 1368 (9th Cir.1978). The problem for Duboc is that the cases he cites are civil, not criminal, forfeiture cases. For this reason, they do not establish the due process rights of criminal defendants in cases such as Duboc\u2019s, where the government seeks the post-conviction forfeiture of proceeds of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">We need not decide what particular due process rights such convicted criminal defendants enjoy because the procedures used in this particular case, which were consistent with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853, were constitutionally adequate. These procedures included (1) notice and a hearing after Duboc pled guilty and before the district court entered the 1999 criminal forfeiture order; and (2) notice and an opportunity to respond to the government\u2019s 2011 motion to amend the 1999 forfeiture order to include the Thailand condos. To the extent Duboc argues that he was entitled to a hearing sooner than 11 years after the government first arranged for the \u201crestraint\u201d of the Thailand condos, Duboc makes no showing that he was prejudiced at all by this delay. <em>See Bissell, </em>866 F.2d at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">D. MLAT Challenge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">Duboc\u2019s final argument is that the United States and Thailand did not comply with the MLAT in 2000 when Thailand restrained the condos in response to a request by United States authorities. Duboc thus claims that the district court\u2019s amended order is void as applied to the Thailand condos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">This argument lacks merit. The MLAT provides for \u201cmutual assistance\u201d between Thailand and the United States with respect to criminal law enforcement. Treaty on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, U.S.-Thai., art. 1(1), Mar. 19, 1986, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-18. This treaty defines \u201cassistance\u201d as including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cassisting in forfeiture proceedings.\u201d MLAT, art. l(2)(h). The MLAT specifically states that \u201c[a] private party may not rely upon any provision of this Treaty to impede the execution of a request, or to exclude or suppress evidence obtained under the Treaty.\u201d MLAT, art. 1(5). In addition, there is a presumption that international agreements do not create private rights or private causes of action in domestic courts, even when the agreement directly benefits private persons. <em>United States v. Valencia-Trujillo, </em>573 F.3d 1171, 1180-81 (11th Cir.2009). This presumption and the plain terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>the MLAT show that Duboc, as a private party, may not use the MLAT as a defense to the forfeiture of the Thailand condos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order amending the 1999 forfeiture order to include Duboc\u2019s Thailand condos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">. Although Duboc's notice of appeal is untimely, the government waived this issue by failing to raise it in its initial brief. <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that an untimely notice of appeal filed by a criminal defendant does not deprive the court of appeals of jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding forfeiture, and it reviews the district court's findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1153 (11th Cir.2003). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the application of collateral estoppel. <em>United States v.

See Peter Letterese &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. World Inst, of Scientology Enter., </em>533 F.3d 1287, 1319 n. 38 (11th Cir.2008).

Duboc also claims that he did not receive notice of the government\u2019s motion to amend the forfeiture order to include the Thailand condos. This argument is without merit. Duboc initially received an incomplete copy of the government\u2019s motion and did not respond. The district court then granted the government\u2019s motion. Duboc then received a complete copy of the government\u2019s motion and the district court granted Duboc an extension of time to respond. Duboc responded, and the district court, \"upon consideration of the defendant's objections,\" found that \"nothing in the objections justify revisiting the prior decision amending the order of forfeiture.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1241-14\">.
