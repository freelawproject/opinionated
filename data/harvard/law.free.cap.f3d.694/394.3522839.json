Garrus was found guilty in state court of voluntary manslaughter in 2001. At sentencing, the judge increased his sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 9714, Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law. In order to do so, the judge made a judicial finding that Garrus had previously been convicted of burglarizing an occupied building, when, in fact, he had only pled guilty to, and been convicted of, second degree burglary (which, under Pennsylvania law, necessarily requires that the burglarized building was unoccupied). In the habeas petition now before us, Garrus argues that this judicial factfinding violated the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>requiring that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The District Court denied the petition on the basis that the highest state court determination upholding Garrus\u2019s sentence was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Key to our determination is a single question: whether, pursuant to AEDPA, the state court unreasonably applied <em>Apprendi </em>by allowing Garrus to be sentenced beyond the statutory maximum based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>judicial finding that Garrus burglarized an occupied building, despite his plea to the contrary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the state court determination upholding Garrus\u2019s sentence was objectively unreasonable, and that Garrus is entitled to habeas relief. Accordingly, we will reverse the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On February 10, 2000, Garrus was at the home of his girlfriend, Toi Bryant, with whom he has a daughter, when Bryant\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Charles Goode, showed up at the residence. Shortly after Goode arrived, an argument ensued between him and Bryant involving their child. As the argument escalated, Garrus took his daughter upstairs. He later returned downstairs to the kitchen where Goode and Bryant were arguing. After Garrus and Goode exchanged some heated words, a fight broke out between the two men. Garrus picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed Goode several times in the chest area. Goode broke away from Garrus and ran upstairs to the bathroom. Garrus left the home. When police arrived, both Goode and Bryant identified Garrus as the attacker. Goode later died from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Following a jury trial in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, Garrus was convicted on March 9, 2001, of voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime. A conviction for voluntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 20 years of imprisonment. 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1103, 2503(c). However, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the \u201cCommonwealth\u201d) notified the trial court that it would seek a sentencing enhancement under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, which requires a judge to sentence a defendant to a minimum term of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment (and a maximum of up to life imprisonment) if the defendant was previously convicted of two or more separate \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 9714. \u201cCrimes of violence\u201d may include <em>first </em>degree burglary (defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>burglary of an occupied structure), but do not include <em>second </em>degree burglary (defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>burglary of an unoccupied structure).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>On April 30, 2001, the trial court held the first of two sentencing hearings. The Commonwealth offered evidence that Garrus had three prior convictions for \u201ccrimes of violence:\u201d (1) a January 1995 conviction for first-degree robbery; (2) a February 1995 conviction for first-degree robbery; and (3) a February 1997 plea and conviction for second-degree burglary. The Commonwealth argued that although Garrus had only pled guilty to second degree burglary in 1997, the trial court should consider a police report and witness statements regarding that burglary to find instead that the building Garrus had burglarized in 1997 was occupied. On the basis of the police report and witness statements, the trial court found at the second sentencing hearing on May 8, 2001, that Garrus\u2019s prior 1997 conviction for second-degree burglary constituted a crime of violence under \u00a7 9714. <em>Commonwealth v. Garrus, </em>June Term 2000 No. 0092, slip op. at 17 (Phila.Cnty.Ct.Com.Pl. Jan. 16, 2002). Additionally, it found that the two 1995 robberies constituted two separate crimes of violence, and that his conviction for voluntary manslaughter was his fourth crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>The trial court sentenced Garrus to a term of 25 to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Garrus appealed his conviction and sentence to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argued that, by definition, his 1997 second-degree burglary conviction did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania adopted the trial court\u2019s opinion in its entirety. <em>Commonwealth v. Garrus, </em>No. 2592 EDA 2001, 815 A.2d 1125 (Pa.Super.Ct. Oct. 18, 2002). The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania granted Garrus\u2019s petition seeking <em>allocatur </em>on the sole issue of Garrus\u2019s sentence, <em>Commonwealth v. Garrus, </em>572 Pa. 438, 817 A.2d 455 (2003), but later dismissed the appeal in September 2003 as having been improvidently granted. <em>Commonwealth v. Garrus, </em>574 Pa. 655, 832 A.2d 1063 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In April 2004, Garrus filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 9541 <em>et seq., </em>challenging his sentence. He argued that the trial court, at sentencing, violated his constitutional rights, as articulated in <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348, by relying on the police report and victim statement to determine that his 1997 burglary conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law. Garrus also asserted that state law required his two 1995 robbery convictions to be considered as one \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the \u201cthree strikes\u201d law. As a result, Garrus claimed that he had, at most, one prior conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d rendering him ineligible for the 25-year mandatory minimum sentence he had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Garrus\u2019s PCRA petition was dismissed in February 2005. A month later, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), in which the Court held that a sentencing court is not permitted to consider police reports in determining whether a prior conviction constituted a \u201cviolent crime\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924, a federal recidivism statute. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">On appeal from the denial of his PCRA petition, Garrus argued that the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ing court\u2019s consideration of the police report and victim statement, with respect to his 1997 burglary conviction, violated his rights under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Shepard, </em>and he again argued that his two 1995 robbery convictions constituted one \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the denial of his PCRA petition. <em>Commonwealth v. Garrus, </em>No. 961 EDA 2005, 902 A.2d 976 (Pa.Super.Ct. Apr. 18, 2006). In its opinion, the Superi- or Court acknowledged that <em>Apprendi </em>requires that \u201cany fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9 (quoting <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348). However, it determined that the prior conviction exception permitted the sentencing judge to find that Garrus had burglarized an occupied building despite his plea to the contrary, and to sentence him beyond the statutory maximum accordingly. The Superior Court also determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard </em>did not affect the validity of the prior conviction exception established in <em>Apprendi. </em>Finally, on the basis that the 1997 burglary constituted a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d the Superior Court declined to reach the issue of whether the two 1995 robberies constituted separate crimes. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied Garrus\u2019s petition seeking further appellate review. <em>Commonwealth v. Garrus, </em>588 Pa. 776, 906 A.2d 539 (Pa. Aug. 29, 2006) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On January 16, 2007, Garrus filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Garrus raised the same challenges to both his 1997 burglary conviction and the two 1995 robbery convictions. The Magistrate Judge denied Garrus\u2019s petition, <em>Garrus v. Mazurkiewicz, </em>No. 07-187 (E.D.Pa. May 28, 2008), and concluded that it was precluded from granting federal habeas relief because the sentencing court\u2019s consideration of the police report and victim statement in determining whether Garrus had two prior convictions for crimes of violence under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The Magistrate Judge also concluded that Garrus\u2019s argument that his two 1995 robbery convictions should be considered as one for purposes of the recidivism statute was therefore moot, as Garrus still had at least two prior convictions for crimes of violence \u2014 the 1997 burglary conviction and at least one of the 1995 robbery convictions. In any event, the Magistrate Judge reasoned, Garrus\u2019s challenge to the 1995 robbery convictions involved an interpretation of state law and could not be considered by federal courts in a habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Nevertheless, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the District Court issue a certificate of appealability to this Court, limited to the issue involving the 1997 burglary conviction. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation, with the exception that it rejected the Magistrate Judge\u2019s determination that sufficient grounds existed to issue a certificate of appealability. <em>Garrus v. Johnson, </em>No. 07-187, 2009 WL 2595599 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 18, 2009). Garrus appealed, and on March 12, 2010, we granted a certificate of appealability to consider the issue of whether the state sentencing court violated Garrus\u2019s constitutional rights by labeling the 1997 second-degree burglary conviction a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of applying Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The District Court had jurisdiction to consider Garrus\u2019s habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as the claim raised in the petition has been properly-exhausted in the state courts. <em>See Alston v. Redman, </em>34 F.3d 1237, 1242 (3d Cir. 1994)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We exercise <em>de novo </em>review over a District Court\u2019s denial of habeas relief, <em>Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007), and apply the highly deferential AEDPA standard, which, in this case, precludes us from granting habeas relief unless the challenged state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Core to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights is the principle that \u201ccriminal convictions [must] rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 510, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995); <em>see also In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that this same right applies to a sentencing factor that would increase a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum because, like an element of a separate crime, such a sentencing factor results in a higher sentence than that which could be prescribed for the original crime. 530 U.S. at 476, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Thus, there is no \u201cprincipled basis\u201d for treating such a sentencing factor differently than an element of a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The exception is that a judge can increase the sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d because a prior conviction has already been established through procedural safeguards. <em>Id. </em>at 488-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 249, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) (\u201c[A] prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">These precepts are \u201crooted in longstanding common-law practicef.]\u201d <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 281, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007). <em>Apprendi </em>recounted their historical context, noting that early on in our history, judges had \u201cvery little explicit discretion in sentencing.\u201d 530 U.S. at 479, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Any \u201ccircumstances mandating a particular punishment\u201d had to be charged to the jury in the indictment; there was \u201c[no] distinction between an \u2018element\u2019 of a felony offense and a \u2018sentencing factor[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 480, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In the 19th century, this idea began to shift, \u201cfrom statutes providing fixed-term sentences to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>those providing judges discretion within a permissible range[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Crucially, this shift \u201chas been regularly accompanied by the qualification that [such judicial] discretion was bound by the range of sentencing options prescribed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">By the late 20th century, the Supreme Court began to address state laws that increased a defendant\u2019s punishment based on factors found at sentencing, rather than based on factors found at trial. In <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986), the Supreme Court, \u201cfor the first time, coined the term \u2018sentencing factor\u2019 to refer to a fact that was not found by a jury but that could affect the sentence imposed by the judge.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 485, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (construing <em>McMillan). </em>Consistent with longstanding constitutional principles, <em>McMillan </em>held that a \u201csentencing factor\u201d must at times be found by a jury because \u201c(1) constitutional limits exist to States\u2019 authority to define away facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense, and (2) ... a state scheme that keeps from the jury facts that \u2018expos[e] [defendants] to greater or additional punishment,\u2019 may raise serious constitutional concern[s].\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 486, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting <em>McMillan, </em>477 U.S. at 85-88, 106 S.Ct. 2411) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">A decade later, the Supreme Court decided <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 242-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), a case in which the defendant was convicted for his presence in the United States after being deported, a violation which normally carried a maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment. 523 U.S. at 227, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Prior to his initial deportation, Almendarez-Torres was convicted of three aggravated felonies, and according to the sentencing statute, where the original deportation had occurred subsequent to an aggravated felony, the court could impose a maximum sentence of up to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 229, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Almendarez-Torres argued that he could not be subject to more than two years\u2019 imprisonment, because his indictment had not mentioned his earlier aggravated felony convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Importantly, there was no contention that the defendant had <em>not </em>been convicted of the three aggravated felonies, but only that the fact of his prior convictions should have been included in the indictment and charged to the jury. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Almendarez-Torres had earlier been convicted of the facts necessary for the sentencing enhancement, \u201cpursuant to proceedings with substantial procedural safeguards of their own[.]\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In other words, by judicially finding that Almendarez-Torres\u2019s three prior convictions existed, the sentencing judge did not \u201cchange a pre-existing definition of a well-established crime, nor ... \u2018evade\u2019 the Constitution, either by \u2018presuming\u2019 guilt or \u2018restructuring\u2019 the elements of an offense.\u201d <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 246, 118 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The Supreme Court found that the fact of Almendarez-Torres\u2019s prior convictions did not have to be charged to the jury because the constitutional limitations articulated in <em>McMillan </em>did not apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 228, 242-43, 118 S.Ct. 1219. As the Supreme Court later explained in <em>Apprendi: </em>\u201c[b]oth the cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tainty that procedural safeguards attached to any \u2018fact\u2019 of prior conviction, and the reality that Almendarez-Torres did not challenge the accuracy of that \u2018fact\u2019 in his case, mitigated the due process and Sixth Amendment concerns otherwise implicated in allowing a judge to determine a \u2018fact\u2019 increasing punishment beyond the maximum of the statutory range.\u201d 530 U.S. at 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">A year after <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court explained that <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>recidivism exception was permitted because \u201ca prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 249, 119 S.Ct. 1215. In <em>Jones, </em>the trial court gave the defendant a sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on a judicial finding that the carjacking offense he was convicted of involved \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230-31, 119 S.Ct. 1215. The Supreme Court found that the carjacking statute required a jury, rather than a judge, to determine whether the crime involved \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d citing \u201cgrave\u201d constitutional questions that would arise if the statute were to be interpreted otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 239, 119 S.Ct. 1215. Although <em>Jones </em>did not actually reach the constitutional issue, its explanation of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and its constitutional discussion were significant, especially given that <em>Apprendi </em>explicitly \u201cconfirm[ed] the opinion ... expressed in <em>Jones </em>[,]\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, that \u201cunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Against this historical backdrop, the Supreme Court decided <em>Apprendi, </em>where a defendant pled guilty to unlawful possession of a weapon, a second-degree offense punishable by up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.

With that exception, we endorse the statement of the rule set forth in the concurring opinions in that case: \u2018[I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 252-53, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (Stevens, J., concurring); citing <em>id. </em>at 253, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (Scalia, J., concurring)). Applying this newly articulated rule, the <em>Apprendi </em>court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the sentencing judge to increase Apprendi\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on a judicial finding that the crime to which Apprendi pled guilty constituted a hate crime. In doing so, it compared <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>reiterating that: \u201cthere is a vast difference between accepting the validity of a prior judgment of conviction entered in a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trial and the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and allowing the judge to find the required fact under a lesser standard of proof.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 496, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Based on these constitutional principles, Garras requests habeas relief under AEDPA.

Quarterman, </em>551 U.S. 930, 953, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007) (emphasis added). Garrus must show that \u201cthe state court\u2019s ruling ... was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">This case turns on the meaning of the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d standard. Garrus argues that the state court unreasonably applied <em>Apprendi </em>and its prior conviction exception by permitting the trial court to determine at sentencing that Garrus\u2019s prior 1997 conviction for burglarizing an unoccupied building (second-degree burglary) actually involved burglarizing an occupied building. In response, the Commonwealth argues that Garrus cannot meet his burden of proving that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Apprendi </em>was objectively unreasonable because neither <em>Apprendi </em>nor any case since has explicitly defined the scope of \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d exception. However, our determination is not dependent on a fully delineated interpretation or application of \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d exception, only a reasonable one. <em>Panetti, </em>551 U.S. at 953, 127 S.Ct. 2842 (\u201cThat the standard is stated in general terms does not mean the application was reasonable.\u201d). The AEDPA standard is not so \u201cmyopic\u201d nor \u201cconstrained\u201d that it requires the full scope of all cleaidy established laws to be precisely defined. <em>Jamison v. Klem, </em>544 F.3d 266, 273 (3d Cir.2008); <em>see also id. </em>(noting that if a Supreme Court decision must precisely resolve a given issue under AEDPA, only the \u201ccontrary to\u201d standard would exist, and the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d standard would be rendered meaningless). Rather, AEDPA requires that if a clearly established rule or principle is stated, however general, state courts must adhere to <em>a </em>reasonable application of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Panetti 551 U.S. </em>at 953, 127 S.Ct. 2842.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Apprendi </em>clearly requires that any fact \u201cother than the fact of a prior conviction\u201d must be submitted to a jury if it will increase the penalty beyond the statutory maximum. 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Under AEDPA there is undoubtedly a broad spectrum of reasonable applications of this rule, but a fact that actually defies and contradicts a prior conviction falls squarely outside the spectrum of reasonable interpretations. <em>Cf. Wilson v. </em>Knowles, 638 F.3d 1213, 1215 (9th Cir. 2011) (\u201cCourts may reasonably disagree about some of the precise boundaries of the exception____But that does not mean that <em>Apprendi </em>is amorphous.... The judge\u2019s fact-finding seven years after the 1993 conviction extended beyond any reasonable interpretation of the prior conviction exception.\u201d). We can find no reasonable basis for applying Apprendi to allow judicial finding of a fact that is inconsistent with and contradicts the facts established through constitutional procedures. The very reason for the exception is to recognize facts that have already \u201cbeen established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 249, 119 S.Ct. 1215. The phrase \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d might be reasonably construed to allow judicial factfinding of a fact underlying a prior conviction or a fact consistent with a prior conviction. However, absent case law authorizing some type of paradoxical interpretation, \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d cannot reasonably be interpreted to allow judicial factfinding of a fact contradicting a prior conviction or a fact inconsistent with a prior conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>No existing precedent so much as hints that a paradoxical interpretation of <em>Apprendi </em>might be reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, under <em>Apprendi, </em>it was objectively unreasonable for the state court to allow Garrus to be sentenced beyond the statutory maximum based on a mere allegation that actually defied and contradicted his prior conviction. The Commonwealth proffers several cases, which it argues could have supported the state court\u2019s decision to apply the prior conviction exception in Garrus\u2019s case, but its attempts fall flat.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Despite the Commonwealth\u2019s attempts to paint it as such, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not a panacea allowing recidivism-related judicial factfinding, or supporting the state court\u2019s determination that <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>pri- or conviction exception permitted the sentencing judge to find that Garrus had burglarized an occupied building despite his plea to the contrary. <em>Apprendi </em>cited <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as the \u201climited\u201d and \u201cnarrow\u201d exception to the <em>Apprendi </em>rule, 530 U.S. at 488 n. 14, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, and explained that the constitutionality of that exception rested on (1) \u201cthe certainty that procedural safeguards attached to any \u2018fact\u2019 of prior conviction,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe reality that Almendarez-Torres did not challenge the accuracy of that \u2018fact\u2019 in his case[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In fact, <em>Apprendi </em>emphasized these factors at least twice, and it is important to note that neither factor is present in this case. Regarding the first factor, the only \u201cfact\u201d judicially found by the sentencing court in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was the actual fact that the defendant was convicted, and that \u201cfact\u201d had previously been established through a conviction process applying procedural safeguards. In contrast, Garrus was only accused of \u2014 not convicted of \u2014 the violent crime of burglarizing an occupied building (which would have been first-degree burglary). More importantly, Garrus only pled guilty and was convicted of burglarizing an unoccupied building (second-degree burglary). Thus, unlike the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>defendant, whose sentence was enhanced based on actual prior convictions, Garrus\u2019s sentence was enhanced beyond the statutory maximum without a basis in any jury determination or plea admission. Because the \u201cfact\u201d of which Garrus was accused was never found by a jury nor was it an element of the crime for which he pled guilty, no procedural safeguards attached to the finding of this \u201cfact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">As to the second factor, Garrus makes clear in his reply brief that, unlike Almendarez-Torres, he did not concede or admit the fact at issue. In fact, at the sentencing hearing, he questioned the judicial finding that his 1997 conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d (Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr. 28, May 8, 2001, <em>see </em>App. at 177a.) A defendant waives his <em>Apprendi </em>rights only if he \u201ceither stipulates to the relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding.\u201d <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 310, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (citing <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 158, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968)). Thus, neither of the two factors that allowed <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to stand as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>narrow exception to <em>Apprendi </em>apply in this case. As <em>Apprendi </em>explained, \u201cthere is a vast difference between accepting the validity of a prior judgment of conviction entered in a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trial and the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d as occurred in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and \u201callowing the judge to find the required fact under a lesser standard of proof[,]\u201d as occurred in both <em>Apprendi </em>and here in Garrus\u2019s case. <em>See </em>530 U.S. at 496, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Therefore, it was objectively unreasonable for the state court to find that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>authorized the application of <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>prior conviction exception in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Had Garrus been convicted of first-degree burglary in 1997 (based on a jury finding or plea establishing that he burglarized a building that was occupied and adapted for overnight accommodation), we do not doubt that under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the court sentencing him for his later manslaughter conviction could have taken note of the earlier first-degree burglary conviction and held that it qualified as a crime of violence under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law. However, Garrus was convicted of second-degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Given the highly deferential AEDPA standard, it is even possible that if Pennsylvania merely had a generic burglary statute that did not differentiate between burglarizing an occupied or unoccupied building, a reasonable application of the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d exception might have permitted the judge to look at facts underlying the prior burglary conviction to determine whether Garrus was convicted of burglarizing an occupied building.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151, 153, 157 (2d Cir.2001) (finding that <em>Apprendi </em>allows a sentencing judge to find \u201cnot only the mere fact of previous convictions but [certain] other related issues as well\u201d);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>cf. Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (holding that under a federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, the sentencing judge may only find facts that were <em>necessary </em>to the prior conviction). However, the sentencing judge in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>looked at the previous conviction for burglarizing an unoccupied building, and nonetheless found facts supporting exactly the opposite proposition: that the building had been occupied. Because Garrus was convicted of burglarizing an unoccupied building, the finding that the building was occupied was simply not a \u201cfact of a prior conviction.\u201d The finding that the building was occupied could be viewed as a fact of a prior accusation of first-degree burglary, or as a fact contradicting a prior conviction for second-degree burglary. Either way, it cannot be reasonably interpreted as a \u201cfact of a prior conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We likewise disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s convoluted argument that <em>Shepard </em>somehow supports the state court\u2019s determination because it was decided on a statutory basis rather than a constitutional one. As a threshold matter, we note that Garrus contends that <em>Shepard </em>supports him rather than the Commonwealth. However, because <em>Shepard\u2019s </em>holding was limited to a federal statute that is inapplicable here and its constitutional discussion was mere <em>diet a, </em>Garrus cannot rely on it for relief. <em>See Carey, </em>549 U.S. at 74, 127 S.Ct. 649 (\u201c\u2018[C]learly established Federal law\u2019 in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u2018refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of th[e] [Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we will address the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that <em>Shepard </em>somehow made the state court\u2019s application of <em>Apprendi </em>reasonable. <em>Cf. Price v. Vincent, </em>538 U.S. 634, 643 and n. 2, 123 S.Ct. 1848, 155 L.Ed.2d 877 (2003) (even cases that are not binding might be relevant to the consideration of whether a state court decision is objectively unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\"><em>Shepard </em>involved a sentencing enhancement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924, which applies where a defendant has been previously convicted of violent felonies, including burglaries of buildings. 544 U.S. at 15-16, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Shepard had previously been convicted of burglary four times, but he was convicted of burglarizing structures under Massachusetts law, and thus it was unclear from his convictions whether he had burglarized buildings or some other types of structures such as vehicles. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17, 125 S.Ct. 1254; <em>see also id. </em>at 31, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court held, based on principles of statutory interpretation, that the sentencing court was not permitted to look at police reports in order to determine whether the structures the defendant had burglarized were buildings. <em>Id. </em>at 16-22, 125 S.Ct. 1254. It ruled that the sentencing court was \u201climited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or [the terms of the] transcript of [the plea] colloquy ... or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">The Commonwealth suggests that the state court could have gleaned support from <em>Shepard </em>by finding that because <em>Shepard\u2019s </em>holding was not constitutionally based, the use of police reports for judicial factfinding was constitutionally permissible. However such <em>non sequitur </em>reasoning is objectively unreasonable. The <em>Shepard </em>Court did nothing more than employ the classic doctrine of constitutional avoidance by deciding the case on a statutory basis. It is entirely unreasonable to read constitutional avoidance as indicative that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>a practice is constitutionally permissible. In fact, if anything can be read into the <em>Shepard </em>Court\u2019s discussion of the Constitution in <em>dicta, </em>it is that the majority of the Court expressed grave constitutional concerns: four justices cited concerns that looking at police reports underlying a prior conviction posed \u201cserious risks of unconstitutionality\u201d under <em>Apprendi, </em>and Justice Thomas would have gone further and found the entire \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d exception to be unconstitutional. <em>See id. </em>at 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (plurality); <em>id. </em>at 26-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Even assuming for purposes of this analysis that the Supreme Court expressed constitutional uncertainty about <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>application in <em>Shepard, </em>it does not follow that <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>application here is unclear. In fact, nothing in <em>Shepard </em>supports the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d might be reasonably construed to mean a fact contradicting a prior conviction because <em>Shepard </em>simply did not involve a fact contradicting a prior conviction. Crucially, Shepard had four times been convicted of burglarizing structures, and the police reports did not contradict this fact. Rather, the police reports supported the conviction for burglary of structures, and merely explained specifically that the types of structures involved were buildings. As the plurality noted, the factual allegations in the <em>Shepard </em>police reports might have been permitted by <em>Apprendi </em>as \u201ca fact <em>about </em>a prior conviction[.]\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (plurality) (emphasis added). The <em>Shepard </em>dissent\u2019s argument also highlights this distinction by stating that sentencing judges should be able to refer to \u201cinternally consistent parts of the record from the earlier conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). In contrast, the police report alleging that Garrus burglarized an occupied building cannot reasonably be interpreted as a fact consistent with or a fact about Garrus\u2019s conviction for burglarizing an unoccupied building.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Rather than supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, <em>Shepard </em>demonstrates that even judicial factfinding that is consistent with a prior conviction might be unconstitutional. By no means does it support the proposition that <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>\u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d exception might be reasonably interpreted to allow judicial factfinding that contradicts a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Finally, the Commonwealth strains to argue that some Circuit court cases show that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Apprendi </em>was reasonable. <em>See Kessee v. Mendoza-Powers, </em>574 F.3d 675 (9th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>474 F.3d 888, 892 (6th Cir.2007), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by United States v.

In fact, no fairminded jurist could disagree that the state court\u2019s paradoxical interpretation of the prior conviction exception renders an absurd result under <em>Apprendi </em>allowing a judge that applies the \u201cthree strikes\u201d statute to make the very factual finding that an earlier judge would have been prohibited from making. As we noted above, Apprendi pled guilty to unlawful possession of a weapon, a second-degree offense punishable by a maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, but the judge increased the sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on the finding of an additional factor, effectively imposing punishment on the defendant for a first-degree offense. <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 491, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Thus, under <em>Apprendi </em>it is clear that a judge applying the initial sentence for second-degree burglary (under Pennsylvania law) cannot enhance the sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on the finding that the defendant burglarized an occupied building, effectively imposing punishment on the defendant for a first-degree offense. The Commonwealth today would have us believe that <em>Apprendi </em>may be reasonably applied to allow a later judge sentencing a defendant to look back at the defendant\u2019s initial conviction and make the factual finding that the initial sentencing judge was prohibited from making. <em>Apprendi </em>cannot be reasonably construed or applied to allow this absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that it was objectively unreasonable for the state court to apply <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>prior conviction exception to allow judicial factfinding based on an allegation that actually defied and contradicted the elements of the prior conviction. The rule of <em>Apprendi </em>and the prior conviction exception simply cannot be reconciled with the state court decision. In sum, Garras has shown that \u201cthe state court\u2019s ruling ... was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">We recognize the rarity of today\u2019s determination; seldom does a state court\u2019s decision fail to withstand AEDPA\u2019s highly deferential standard.

There is no doubt that the state court\u2019s determination relied on its application of <em>Apprendi </em>to uphold the trial court\u2019s decision to increase the length of Garrus\u2019s sentence, and that Garrus has therefore shown a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect.\u201d We conclude that the District Court erred in failing to grant habeas relief under these circumstances. We will reverse the order of the District Court, and remand with directions that a writ of habeas corpus be conditionally granted, providing that petitioner be re-sentenced or released from custody within 120 days, unless, within that time, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania determines that petitioner qualifies for the sentencing enhancement based on his two 1995 robbery convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">.

Contrary to Judge Hardiman\u2019s argument, there is no circuit split on this issue, and our decision here does not create one. Dissenting Op. of Hardiman, J. at Part II. Neither <em>Portalatin v. Graham, </em>624 F.3d 69 (2d Cir.2010), nor <em>United States v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 965 (8th Cir.2001), addresses the question in this case. For this reason, we express no view on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>whether these cases were decided correctly, nor do we question the fairmindedness of those jurists.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In <em>Portalatin, </em>the petitioners were sentenced under New York\u2019s recidivism statute. 624 F.3d at 72. Pursuant to that law, a defendant is subject to an increased sentencing range as a repeat offender \"based <em>solely </em>on whether [he] [has] two prior convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88 (quoting <em>People v. Rivera, </em>5 N.Y.3d 61, 800 N.Y.S.2d 51, 833 N.E.2d 194, 198 (2005) (original emphasis)). After a sentencing court determines that a defendant is a repeat offender and that an increased sentencing range applies, it considers \"the history and character of the defendant, and the nature and circumstances of his crime,\u201d before selecting a sentence within the increased range. <em>Id. </em>at 90. In <em>Portalatin, </em>the Second Circuit first agreed with the New York Court of Appeals that if the recidivism statute were construed \"to require the court to <em>find </em>additional facts about the defendant before imposing a recidivism sentence, the statute[ ] would violate <em>Apprendi.\u201d Id. </em>at 89 (quoting <em>Rivera, </em>800 N.Y.S.2d 51, 833 N.E.2d at 198) (emphasis added). But the <em>Portalatin </em>court also concluded that a sentencing court could <em>consider </em>subsidiary facts about a defendant's prior convictions before imposing a repeat offender sentence without violating <em>Apprendi. Id. </em>at 92. Nonetheless, the important point here is that the Second Circuit did not discuss whether the sentencing court could find or consider underlying facts that contradict an offender\u2019s prior conviction. The failure to address this subject is unsurprising as the <em>Portalatin </em>petitioners did not dispute their underlying convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 75-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Similarly, in <em>Davis, </em>the appellant, sentenced as a repeat offender under federal law, argued that due process required a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that his pri- or convictions were qualifying felonies under the recidivism statute. 260 F.3d at 967-69. The Eighth Circuit held only that, under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the \"fact of prior conviction includes ... a determination of whether a conviction is one of the enumerated types qualifying for the sentence enhancement under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 969 (citation omitted).

Wilson was convicted by a jury of driving under the influence with a prior felony conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1214. At sentencing, the judge found that Wilson's conviction was his third strike under California's \"three strikes\u201d law, and enhanced his sentence accordingly. In order to find that one of the previous convictions counted as a strike under California\u2019s \"three strikes\u201d law, the sentencing judge had to make several findings of fact that were not necessary for the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1215. The issue for the Ninth Circuit was whether such judicial findings \"fell within the prior conviction exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit started by noting that \"[c]ourts may reasonably disagree about some of the precise boundaries of the exception ... [b]ut that does not mean that <em>Apprendi </em>is amorphous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It went on to find that the judicially found facts \u2014 such as the extent of the victim\u2019s injuries \u2014 were disputed and not found by a jury or in any way necessary to the conviction. <em>Id. </em>\"The judge ... speculated as to how a [previous] jury ... might have evaluated the evidence if the evidence had been offered and if a jury had been impaneled to evaluate it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the judge\u2019s factfinding \"extended beyond any reasonable interpretation of the prior conviction exception.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Just as in <em>Wilson, </em>Garrus\u2019s sentencing judge made judicial findings of fact that were not necessary to his prior conviction, and then speculated as to how a jury might have evaluated the evidence had it been offered, or whether Garrus might have admitted to the evidence at his plea hearing. The Commonwealth tries to distinguish <em>Wilson </em>on the basis that the facts here in Garrus's case are \"less controversial\u201d than the judicially found facts in <em>Wilson, </em>but we find such a distinction unavailing; regardless of how controversial the facts were in <em>Wilson, </em>the determinative issue was that such facts were not necessary to the verdict, and were never determined by a jury nor pled to by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1215-16. If anything, Garrus\u2019s case is stronger than Wilson\u2019s because in Garrus's case the facts actually <em>contradicted </em>his prior conviction, whereas in Wilson\u2019s case, the facts were simply not necessary to the prior conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b437-5\">.

As the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania correctly argued, \u201c[ujnder the federal habeas statute, <em>\u2018the only question that matters </em>[is] whether [the] state court decision is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\u2019\u201d Appellee\u2019s Supp. Br. 1 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003)). Indeed, \u201ca state prisoner must show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Even petitioner Garrus acknowledged \u2014 albeit in somewhat apologetic fashion \u2014 that the question we presented invited argument under the wrong legal standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">The question presented is somewhat ambiguous because the district court did not \u201cconsider\u201d the 1997 burglary conviction for purposes of \u201cdetermining whether the defendant should be sentenced under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2018three strikes\u2019 law.\u201d Instead, applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the district court analyzed whether the Pennsylvania Superior Court unreasonably applied clearly established U.S. Supreme Court precedent when it upheld the state sentencing court\u2019s decision to rely on police reports and witness statements to make findings of fact about the 1997 burglary conviction, only to rely on those findings to impose an enhanced sentence under the Three Strikes Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Appellant\u2019s Br. 1 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Instead of posing a question that circumvented AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, we should have asked whether any Supreme Court decision directly prohibits a state court judge from looking to the facts underlying a defendant\u2019s prior conviction when considering a recidivism enhancement. The answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">Central to the state court\u2019s decision was the issue of who \u2014 judge or jury \u2014 should find facts regarding prior convictions when assessing a defendant\u2019s history of recidivism. Because recidivism \u201c \u2018does not relate to the commission of the offense, <em>but goes to the punishment only, </em>[it] therefore ... may be subsequently decided\u2019 \u201d by the sentencing judge. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (quoting <em>Graham v. West Virginia, </em>224 U.S. 616, 629, 32 S.Ct. 583, 56 L.Ed. 917 (1912)). Garrus did not even attempt to explain why his case does not fall squarely within the recidivism exception announced in <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Instead, he relied entirely on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). But as then-judge Sotomayor wrote for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a case not subject to AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, \u201crecidivism has long been considered a distinct issue,\u201d and \u201c[njothing in <em>Apprendi </em>itself \u2014 as it involved a hate crime statute enhancing sentences based on the motivation underlying the crime-\u2014 calls that distinction into question.\u201d <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151, 156 (2d Cir.2001). Judge Sotomayor then clearly explained why <em>Apprendi </em>is of no help to habeas petitioners such as Garras:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A69\"><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>explains why recidivism requires special treatment, and absent an explicit Supreme Court ruling to the contrary, we decline to institute a policy that runs counter to the principles set forth in that opinion. In short, we read <em>Apprendi </em>as leaving to the judge ... the task of finding not only the mere fact of previous convictions but other related issues as well. Judges frequently must make factual determinations for sentencing, so it is hardly anomalous to require that they also determine the \u201cwho, what, when, and where\u201d of a prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">If this were not a case governed by AEDPA and the question presented was whether what befell Garras violated the rule of <em>Apprendi, </em>the majority\u2019s decision might well be correct. It is no secret that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is one of the most tenuous precedents of the Supreme Court; three of the five sitting justices who participated in <em>Apprendi </em>have openly criticized Almendarez-Torres,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, I am convinced that even critics of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>would be hard-pressed to hold that the state court in this case violated the rule of <em>Apprendi </em>when it found facts pursuant to a state recidivist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The existence of a circuit split demonstrates that it is wrong to conclude that \u201c \u2018fairminded jurists could [not] disagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision\u201d in this case. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (quoting <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004)). The Courts of Appeals for the Second and Eighth Circuits have found no constitutional violation in circumstances similar to those presented in this appeal. <em>See Portalatin v. Graham, </em>624 F.3d 69 (2d Cir.2010) (en banc); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 965 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">In <em>Portalatin, </em>the Second Circuit consolidated the habeas petitions of three prisoners who had been sentenced under New York\u2019s persistent felony offender (PFO) statute. The petitioners argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it required a sentencing judge to assess the nature, rather than the mere fact of, predicate felony convictions before imposing a PFO sentence. They urged the court to construe the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception to <em>Apprendi </em>narrowly so as to prevent a sentencing judge from considering the facts underlying a defendant\u2019s prior conviction when forming an opinion about his criminal history. Finding \u201cno clear holding of the Supreme Court to command such a result,\u201d the Second Circuit ex-</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>plained that, \u201c \u2018[g]iven the lack of holdings from th[e] [Supreme Court]\u2019 construing the recidivism exception as narrowly as petitioners urge, \u2018it cannot be said that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92 (quoting <em>Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 77, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006)). Commenting on the \u201clack of guidance as to the precise scope of the recidivism exception,\u201d the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">It might well be constitutionally significant whether a sentencing judge is required to find, for example, that a defendant\u2019s criminal history is \u201cespecially violent\u201d before imposing a sentence, or whether, as in New York, a sentencing judge simply must find that the nature of his criminal history justifies \u201cextended incarceration and life-time supervision.\u201d ... The Supreme Court may answer that question at some future time. But, if our Court cannot divine a clear answer from the Court\u2019s existing holdings, AEDPA prevents us from faulting a state court for selecting one reasonable conclusion over another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 93; <em>see also United States v. Snype, </em>441 F.3d 119, 148 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that while the continued viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been questioned, the Supreme Court has not reversed that decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The Eighth Circuit reached a similar result in <em>Davis. </em>There, the appellant had been sentenced to a term of life imprisonment as a repeat offender following a federal conviction for attempted armed bank robbery, an offense that carried a statutory maximum of twenty-five years. He argued that the question of whether his past robbery convictions were qualifying felonies for purposes of the recidivist statute should have been decided by the jury, not by the sentencing judge. The court disagreed, finding that the \u201cfact of prior conviction includes not only the fact that a prior conviction exists, but also a determination of whether a conviction is one of the enumerated types qualifying for the sentence enhancement.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>260 F.3d at 969. Conceding that <em>Apprendi </em>casts doubt on the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Eighth Circuit nonetheless concluded that its role was \u201cto apply Supreme Court precedent as it stands, and not as it may develop.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Adverse to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Portalatin </em>and the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Davis </em>stands the opinion of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Wilson v. Knowles, </em>638 F.3d 1213 (9th Cir.2011). After a 1993 car accident, Wilson pleaded no contest to gross vehicular manslaughter while driving under the influence of alcohol and to proximately causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of alcohol. When sentencing Wilson for a separate 2000 conviction for driving under the influence with a prior felony, a California judge relied on the information and preliminary hearing transcripts from Wilson\u2019s 1993 convictions to find numerous additional facts about the earlier offenses, including that Wilson personally inflicted bodily injury, that the bodily injury was great, and that his victim was not an accomplice. These factual findings led the judge to conclude that Wilson\u2019s 1993 convictions qualified as two predicate offenses for purposes of California\u2019s Three Strikes Law, and Wilson received an enhanced sentence of 25-years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">The Ninth Circuit held that the state court\u2019s factfinding was an unreasonable application of <em>Apprendi. See id. </em>at 1215 (\u201cIt would be unreasonable to read <em>Apprendi </em>as allowing a sentencing judge to find the kinds of disputed facts at issue here.... The judge\u2019s fact-finding seven years after the 1993 conviction extended beyond any reasonable interpretation of the prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>viction exception.\u201d). Chief Judge Kozinski dissented, stating: \u201cThe Supreme Court hasn\u2019t straightened all this out.... AED-PA deference can be a bitter pill to swallow. In some habeas cases, we must reject what appear to be valid constitutional claims because petitioner\u2019s rights have not yet been clearly established by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217 (Kozinski, C.J., dissenting) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Although it is possible that <em>Wilson </em>was correctly decided while <em>Portalatin, Davis, </em>and Chief Judge Kozinski\u2019s dissent in <em>Wilson </em>were all in error, it is immaterial for AEDPA purposes which line of analysis is correct. The mere fact of a difference of opinion among courts of appeals leads ineluctably to the conclusion that a state court cannot run afoul of AEDPA regardless of which of these two paths it chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Stated differently, I am loath to conclude that the United States Court of Appeals judges who decided <em>Portalatin </em>and <em>Davis </em>are not \u201cfairminded.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>541 U.S. at 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140. Indeed, the intersection of criminal procedure and constitutional law often presents difficult questions upon which reasonable minds can differ.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And while it is true that no Supreme Court decision explicitly <em>authorized </em>the state judge to delve into Garrus\u2019s prior conviction, the fact that no decision of the Court <em>prohibited </em>her from doing so is dispositive under AEDPA. Unless and until the Supreme Court overrules or modifies <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>state courts cannot properly be held to have violated the Constitution when they find facts at sentencing to determine whether a recidivist statute applies. For that reason, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-4\">. <em>See Parker v.

Today, the majority feigns fidelity to this enduring tenet of AEDPA jurisprudence. In the process, the majority assumes the role of legislator, rewriting AEDPA to add this Court, along with the Supreme Court, as the two judicial bodies capable of delineating clearly established law. Armed with this newly created authority, the majority wades through murky Supreme Court precedent and emerges with what it purports to be an unassailable legal principle: that the prior-conviction exception enshrined in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), forbids a sentencing court from finding facts inconsistent with a prior conviction when applying a state recidivism statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Unlike the majority, I cannot discern any principle in <em>Apprendi </em>or other authoritative Supreme Court precedent that would render this interpretation of the pri- or-conviction exception objectively unreasonable, the deferential standard by which we must judge the state court\u2019s determination. Indeed, the majority identifies not one Supreme Court case expounding on the contours of the amorphous prior-conviction exception. This lack of clarity coupled with the inherent tension between <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) \u2014 a controlling case the majority brushes aside as having limited relevance \u2014 belies the majority\u2019s triumphant conclusion that the state court\u2019s determination was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">I do not disagree that the majority\u2019s interpretation of the prior-conviction exception is <em>a </em>reasonable and even favorable one, preventing an otherwise seemingly inequitable result. Of course, our task is not to simply choose the preferred reading of an ambiguous legal phrase. Absent guidance from the Supreme Court, we are left to determine whether the state court\u2019s interpretation was objectively unreasonable. Given that this area of law is, at best, in a state of flux, AEDPA \u201cdemands that [the] state-court decision[] be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1862, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For this reason, I am compelled to respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">I. AEDPA Imposes a High Threshold</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">While the majority outlines the basic AEDPA framework governing our inquiry, AEDPA\u2019s prominent role in this case requires further elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">As amended by AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 provides, in pertinent part: \u201c[A] circuit judge ... shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). \u201c[W]ith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d the writ shall not issue unless the adjudication of the claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court precedent \u201cif the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\u201d or \u201cif the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of th[e] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [the Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision involves an unreasonable application of federal law \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495. To qualify as an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law, the state court\u2019s application must be objectively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495. That the state court decision was incorrect or erroneous is insufficient if the error was nonetheless objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <em>see also Renico, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1862 (\u201c[A]n <em>unreasonable </em>application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law.\u201d (quoting <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495)). \u201cIndeed, \u2018a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Renico, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1862 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">As a result, the \u201ccontrary\u201d and \u201cunreasonable application\u201d thresholds are \u201chighly deferential ... for evaluating state-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>rulings, which demand[] that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (quoting <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam)). These standards are \u201c \u2018difficult to meet,\u2019 because the purpose of AEDPA is to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a \u2018guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,\u2019 and not as a means of error correction.\u201d <em>Greene v. Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 38, 43, 181 L.Ed.2d 336 (2011) (quoting <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">I agree with the majority that the focus of our inquiry is on the \u201cunreasonable\u201d prong because the state court identified controlling Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 406, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (\u201c[A] run-of-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule from our cases to the facts of a prisoner\u2019s case would not fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(l)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause.\u201d). As such, we can grant Garrus\u2019s petition only if the sentencing court\u2019s application of Pennsylvania\u2019s recidivism statute transcended the bounds of this undeniably deferential framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">II. Majority\u2019s Discussion of Supreme Court Precedent Falls Short</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">It is undeniable that the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>prior-conviction exception cannot stand in the absence of <em>clearly </em>established law. <em>See Howes v. Fields, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 1181, 1187, 182 L.Ed.2d 17 (2012) (rejecting a circuit court\u2019s determination that Supreme Court precedent clearly established a categorical rule regarding custodial interrogations of inmates). Recognizing its obligation, the majority spends pages examining Supreme Court precedent. Yet nowhere in that examination does the majority grapple with precedent that undermines its position. This principled avoidance is the only means by which the majority can reach the conclusion that Supreme Court precedent clearly establishes that it would be objectively unreasonable to interpret the phrase \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d as the state court did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">I do not disagree with the majority that <em>Apprendi </em>is at the forefront of our inquiry. I do disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s perception that <em>Apprendi </em>is the be-all and end-all of our inquiry. The majority\u2019s singular focus is apparent at the beginning of its opinion, stating that the \u201c[k]ey\u201d to resolving this case involves answering \u201cwhether, pursuant to AEDPA, the state court unreasonably applied <em>Apprendi.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Majority Op. at 396.) However, as the majority acknowledges, Garrus was sentenced under 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 9714, Pennsylvania\u2019s recidivism statute. Despite this admission, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u2014 a critical Supreme Court case examining a sentencing court\u2019s power to engage in fact-finding when applying a recidivism statute \u2014 plays second fiddle to <em>Apprendi </em>in the majority\u2019s opinion. And when the majority does address <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>it sidesteps the very logic in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>that casts even the slightest doubt on the notion that the majority\u2019s interpretation of the prior-conviction exception is clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\"><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>involved a federal statute that permitted an enhanced penalty for any person unlawfully in the United States who had previously been deported after being convicted of an aggravated felony. 523 U.S. at 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219. The defendant pled guilty to being in the United States, without permission, after being deported. <em>Id. </em>At sentencing, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>argued that the enhancement should not apply because his three previous convictions for aggravated felonies, which the defendant did not contest, were not charged in the current indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 118 S.Ct. 1219. The district court rejected this argument, found the existence of the prior convictions, and applied the sentence enhancement. <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 118 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The Supreme Court held that the district court properly treated the defendant\u2019s prior convictions as a sentencing factor and not a separate offense. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219. The Court repeatedly stressed that its analysis was predicated on the unique role recidivism plays at sentencing. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cAt the outset, we note that the relevant statutory subject matter is recidivism. That subject matter \u2014 prior commission of a serious crime \u2014 is as typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cWith recidivism as the subject matter in mind....\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 241, 118 S.Ct. 1219 (\u201c[The statute at issue] involves one of the most frequently found factors that affects sentencing \u2014 recidivism.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 243, 118 S.Ct. 1219 (\u201c[T]he sentencing factor at issue here \u2014 recidivism\u2014is a traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court\u2019s increasing an offender\u2019s sentence.\u201d). The Court noted that, historically, recidivism operated outside of the general framework requiring elements of an offense be submitted to a jury because \u201crecidivism \u2018does not relate to the commission of the offense, <em>but goes to the punishment only, </em>and therefore ... may be subsequently decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Graham v. West Virginia, </em>224 U.S. 616, 624, 32 S.Ct. 583, 56 L.Ed. 917 (1912)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Two years after <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court rendered a decision in what we have described as its \u201cseminal case\u201d on <em>sentencing </em>\u2014 Apprendi. <em>Reinhold v. Rozum, </em>604 F.3d 149, 152 (3d Cir.2010). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the defendant received an enhanced sentence of twelve years for weapon offenses punishable by a statutory maximum of ten years, based on a determination by the sentencing court, not the jury, that the crime was racially motivated. 530 U.S. at 470-71, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Rejecting this approach, the Court pronounced that the Sixth Amendment required that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Central to the Court\u2019s determination was the fact that the hate crime enhancement required a finding that the defendant\u2019s purpose was to intimidate on the basis of race \u2014 an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s <em>mens rea, </em>an element of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 492-93, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The Court attempted to dispel any apparent tension between the rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>and the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>\u201cWhereas recidivism \u2018does not relate to the commission of the offense\u2019 itself, New Jersey\u2019s biased purpose inquiry goes precisely to what happened in the \u2018commission of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 230, 118 S.Ct. 1219). But the Court was cognizant that \u201cit is arguable that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided\u201d based on a \u201clogical application\u201d of the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Apprendi. Id. </em>at 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In the end, the Court reasoned that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201crepresents at best an exceptional departure\u201d from <em>Apprendi. Id. </em>at 487, 120 S.Ct. 2348. While the <em>Apprendi </em>Court provided less than unbridled support for <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>it is clear that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>had continuing vitality after <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The majority devotes no attention to the integral role recidivism played in <em>Almen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>darez-Torres, </em>instead trying to minimize <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s, </em>significance entirely. Quoting <em>Apprendi, </em>the majority refers to <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as having \u201climited\u201d and \u201cnarrow\u201d application. (Majority Op. at 401-02 (quoting <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 488 n. 14, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348).) Put in its proper light, however, this characterization in no way subverts the importance of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to Garrus\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not involve the application of a recidivism statute. Instead, <em>Apprendi </em>addressed a hate crime enhancement that inquired as to the defendant\u2019s <em>mens rea, </em>which the Court iterated was \u201cas close as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense \u2018element.\u2019 \u201d 530 U.S. at 493, 120 S.Ct. 2348. By contrast, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>expressly excluded recidivism as an exception to the nascent legal principle enshrined three years later in <em>Apprendi. Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219 (\u201c[T]o hold that the Constitution requires that recidivism be deemed an \u2018element\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s offense would mark an abrupt departure from a longstanding tradition of treating recidivism as going to the punishment only.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). As a result, it is unsurprising that <em>Apprendi </em>ensured that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>did not apply outside the recidivism context. However, recidivism is squarely at issue in this case, belying the majority\u2019s attempt to minimize <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s, </em>relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">As much as the majority would like to forget <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>there is little debate that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent. After <em>Apprendi </em>cast doubt on the continuing vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we addressed whether <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>viability had been short-lived. Because the <em>Apprendi </em>Court expressly declined to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we unsurprisingly applied <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and held that predicate offenses under a recidivism statute need not be charged in an indictment and submitted to the jury. <em>See United States v. Weaver, </em>267 F.3d 231, 250 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cRecently, in <em>Apprendi[ </em>], the Court upheld the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres.... </em>\u201d). We have since reaffirmed the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and have not retreated from this determination. <em>United States v. Arrelucea-Zamudio, </em>581 F.3d 142, 157 n. 15 (3d Cir.2009) (\u201cAlthough several Supreme Court decisions have cast doubt on the statute\u2019s continuing constitutional viability <em>post-Apprendi ... </em>we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>....\u201d); <em>United States v. Ordaz, </em>398 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cThe holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding law... ,\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court continues to recognize the separate treatment afforded prior convictions in <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 2174, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">III. State Court\u2019s Determination Was Objectively Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"Aqo\">Against this proper legal backdrop, there can be no doubt that, for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>sentencing under Pennsylvania\u2019s recidivism statute, the state court\u2019s determination that Garrus\u2019s second-degree burglary conviction could be treated as a first-degree offense was not objectively unreasonable. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>established that a sentencing court applying a recidivism statute that carries with it a sentence above the statutory maximum is permitted to engage in judicial factfinding regarding the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court clarified that such judicial factfinding was impermissible, except that relating to \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In other words, the exact undefined judicial factfinding permitted by <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Apprendi </em>provides no guidance regarding the scope or meaning of the prior-conviction exception. For good reason, <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>true import is not the establishment of the exception to the rule but the rule itself \u2014 that a judge cannot find facts regarding an element of the offense where the defendant faces a sentence above the statutory maximum. <em>Apprendi </em>did not need to expound on the scope of the prior-conviction exception because <em>Apprendi </em>was not, contrary to <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>a recidivism case. The prior-conviction exception remains as amorphous and undefined as the day <em>Apprendi </em>was decided. <em>See Kessee v. Mendoza-Powers, </em>574 F.3d 675, 676 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cWhat is the scope of the \u2018prior conviction\u2019 exception to the general rule that a sentencing judge may not make factual findings that increase the statutory maximum criminal penalty? The Supreme Court has not yet answered that question.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">I do not deny that the majority\u2019s reading of the prior-conviction exception \u2014 prohibiting a sentencing court from applying a recidivism statute and finding a fact inconsistent with a prior conviction \u2014 is a reasonable interpretation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under AEDPA, that the majority\u2019s reading was reasonable does not <em>ipso facto </em>render all other readings patently unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>(noting that, under AEDPA, just because an appellate court\u2019s own interpretation of the prior-conviction exception is reasonable does not mean that the state court\u2019s reading was unreasonable). \u201cBecause AEDPA authorizes federal courts to grant relief only when state courts act unreasonably, it follows that \u2018the more general the rule\u2019 at issue \u2014 and thus the greater the potential for .reasoned disagreement among fair-minded judges \u2014 \u2018the more leeway state courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Renico, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1864 (quoting <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004)). In my view, the pri- or-conviction exception is sufficiently general and undefined, such that we must, under AEDPA, defer to the state court. Given the logic of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and the fact that the Supreme Court has yet to clarify the scope of the prior-conviction exception, I simply cannot, subscribe to the majority\u2019s finding that the state court\u2019s decision here was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">A few additional points bear mentioning. First, the majority opinion suffers from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>internal inconsistency. Relying as it does on <em>Apprendi, </em>a case founded on the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, one would expect the majority to require that a jury determine whether or not Garrus\u2019s prior conviction for burglary qualifies as a crime of violence. Yet the majority does the opposite, requiring that the judge determine that Garrus\u2019s prior conviction was necessarily <em>not </em>a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Second, the majority notes that \u201c[n]o existing precedent so much as hints that [the state court\u2019s] paradoxical interpretation of <em>Apprendi </em>might be reasonable.\u201d (Majority Op. at 403-04.) This point suffers from two flaws. One could easily reverse the logic of this statement and assert that no Supreme Court precedent suggests that the majority\u2019s interpretation is the only reasonable interpretation. Under AEDPA, that is sufficient to uphold the state court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">More importantly, the proposition is simply inaccurate. The majority makes clear that it is troubled by the fact that Garrus pled guilty to second degree burglary only to have a judge find facts years later inconsistent with that prior conviction and without affording Garrus procedural safeguards. In <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151 (2d Cir.2001), then-judge Sotomayor, writing for the court, addressed whether the requirement under the federal recidivism statute, the Armed Career Criminal Act, that the defendant have three predicate convictions \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d is a factual issue that must be submitted to a jury under <em>Apprendi. Id. </em>at 152. In resolving the issue in the negative, Judge Sotomayor stressed that courts make determinations all the time in the context of recidivism for which the <em>Apprendi </em>procedural safeguards do not attach. <em>See id. </em>at 156 (\u201cThe determination of \u2018the fact of a prior conviction\u2019 implicitly entails many subsidiary findings, not the least of which is that the defendant being sentenced is the same defendant who previously was convicted of those prior offenses, a fact that could be quite controversial indeed. Determination of this question would not necessarily come with the \u2018procedural safeguards\u2019 noted in <em>Apprendi.\u201d). </em>Judge Sotomayor went on to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">In short, we read <em>Apprendi </em>as leaving to the judge, consistent with due process, the task of finding not only the mere fact of previous convictions but other related issues as well. Judges frequently must make factual determinations for sentencing, so it is hardly anomalous to require that they also determine the \u2018who, what, when, and where\u2019 of a prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\"><em>Id. Santiago </em>refutes the majority\u2019s unyielding interpretation of the phrase \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction,\u201d which is even more meaningful considering that <em>Santiago </em>was not a case decided under the highly deferential AEDPA framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Finally, there is little doubt that <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>continuing vitality is in jeopardy. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 27-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring) <em>(\u201cAlmendarez-Toms ... </em>has been eroded by this Court\u2019s subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a majority of the Court now recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided.... [I]n an appropriate case, this Court should consider <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u2019 continuing viability.\u201d). However, we must apply <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>until the Supreme Court holds otherwise. <em>See Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 236, 252-53, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998) (\u201cOur decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>doubts about their continuing vitality.\u201d); <em>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989) (\u201cIf a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\">. Every other circuit court to have considered the issue has agreed that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>682 F.3d 201, 204 (2d Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 958 n. 2 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Farrell, </em>672 F.3d 27, 37 n. 12 (1st Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Nigg, </em>667 F.3d 929, 935-36 (7th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Ruiz-Apolonio, </em>657 F.3d 907, 921 (9th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. McMurray, </em>653 F.3d 367, 371 (6th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Beckstrom, </em>647 F.3d 1012, 1020 (10th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>640 F.3d 358, 369 (D.C.Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Olalde-Hernandez, </em>630 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Mason, </em>628 F.3d 123, 134 (4th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Alston, </em>626 F.3d 397, 406 (8th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">. I concede that the state court's decision in this case produced a seemingly inequitable result. We have recognized that a guilty plea binds a defendant \"to the accuracy of the facts set forth in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Parker, </em>874 F.2d 174, 177 n. 1 (3d Cir.1989). The state court\u2019s determination would appear to run counter to this principle because Garrus was not held to the facts he pled to as part of the judicial process related to his 1997 burglary conviction. However, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>simply treats recidivism differently. While there is no doubt that the majority's moral compass is well-aligned, morality cannot trump our duty to faithfully apply Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
