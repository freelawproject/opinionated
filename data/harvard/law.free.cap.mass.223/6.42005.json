Donovan against Joseph A. Donovan and William Kirby. An injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>issued, which was dissolved upon the filing of a bond executed by the defendants with surety in favor of the then plaintiff. Later Annie M. Donovan was joined as a plaintiff. On the report of the master to whom the case was referred, a decree was entered<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ordering the defendant Joseph A. Donovan to pay the plaintiff Samuel B. Donovan the sum of $6,782.59, and to pay the plaintiff Annie M. Donovan the sum of $512.81. No appeal was taken by the defendant Donovan. The decree ordered the bill dismissed as to Kirby, and from this decree Kirby appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u201cA party who is aggrieved by a final decree of a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court or a final decree of the Superior Court may . . . appeal therefrom.\u201d R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 19. St. 1911, c. 284, \u00a7 1. See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>222 Mass. 218. Where a finding is in a party\u2019s favor, he is not a person aggrieved and cannot appeal. <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Conlan, </em>212 Mass. 135, 140. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>140 Mass. 171. <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>112 Mass. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The liability of Kirby, if any, as a joint obligor of the bond to Samuel B. Donovan, see <em>Prior </em>v. <em>Pye, </em>164 Mass. 316, does not make him a party who is aggrieved by the decree. The statute gives the party to the suit the right to appeal from an adverse decree, and he must be aggrieved as a party, and not collaterally, in order to exercise this right. The surety on a bond is not a party to the suit and of course cannot appeal; and because as one of the obligors of the bond Kirby may be affected by the decree, he is not given the right of a party to appeal therefrom. <em>Estate of McDermott, </em>127 Cal. 450. <em>Berthold </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>21 Minn. 51. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>96 Maine, 357. <em>Richardson v.
