But, having been content to take her word, the defendant made no preliminary investigation, and her mere antenuptial unchastity furnished no ground for annulment of the marriage, which was valid, even if the parties have never lived together as husband and wife. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>3 Allen, 605, 608. <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>154 Mass. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">The decree moreover dismissing the defendant\u2019s libel for annulling the marriage brought under R.

In truth she was unchaste and had borne an illegitimate child which died before she became acquainted with the libellant. A marriage ceremony was performed between the parties by a justice of the peace. The libellant knew that this ceremony was valid and was under no apprehension or mistake concerning it. It was intended, however, that a religious ceremony according to the rites of their faith should be performed later. Before the observance of that ceremony the libellant discovered the unchastity of the libellee and brought this libel. He has never had sexual intercourse with the libellee. I rule that the libel cannot be maintained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-17\"> <em>Callahan, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
