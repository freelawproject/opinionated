The medical adviser has seen this employee and reports that in his opinion the injured hand is permanently incapable of use. This is shown by the X-ray and the hand itself. The board rules informally that the employee is entitled to additional compensation for a period of fifty weeks from the date of the injury and that compensation should be continued on the basis of total incapacity for work since March 15, 1915. We suggest that you file an agreement with the board covering the additional compensation due, and advise us, that in accordance with our suggestion, you are paying incapacity compensation.\u201d On May 14,1915, the insurer replied to the board, \u201cWe have your favor of the 12th inst. with reference to this case, and beg to advise that we have already completed the payment to this man of twenty-five weeks\u2019 additional compensation for the loss of the fingers. Taking the position that the hand was not totally incapable of use, up to the present time there has been no claim of total incapacity of this hand, and if we are to understand that that claim is now made, it is a matter that will have to be determined at the hearing which is now set down for June 4th. It is not our desire to inconvenience the board in any way or take advantage of the injured man, but we have found it exceedingly difficult to deal with this man and his family, each and all having adopted an antagonistic attitude throughout our dealings, and practically telling us that there was no intention of endeavoring to better the injured man\u2019s position by seeking employment, which we feel sure he could avail himself of. We believe that the only solution of the problem will be a hearing, and we shall be pleased to abide by the findings of the committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Thereupon a hearing was had before the arbitration committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>upon the single question \"whether the injury was such as to render the hand permanently incapable of use.\u201d The employee and the insurer were represented by counsel and, so far as appears, the hearing was held without objection. The committee found \u201cupon all the evidence that the employee . . . received a personal injury ... by reason of which his right hand was rendered permanently incapable of use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">This finding was affirmed by the Industrial Accident Board upon a review of the evidence, and was warranted by the visible external physical condition of what remained of a hand as also by the internal loss of bone structure as shown by an X-ray photograph, by the testimony of the employee as to how he could use it and by that of the physician who concluded his testimony with the statement that \u201cThe hand has no use as a hand.\u201d <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136. <em>Floccher\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 54. There being reasonable evidence to support this finding, it is conclusive. <em>Herrick\u2019s Case, 217 </em>Mass. 111. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 530. <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The insurer contends that there can be no recovery in this case for specific compensation, because in the claim as filed, the nature of the compensation sought as well as the nature of the injury was not stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">There is nothing in St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 23, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 5, which requires ah injured employee to state at the peril of loss of compensation anything more than \u201cthe time, place, cause and nature of the injury.\u201d It is common knowledge that the results of physical injuries are very often not determinable at the time they are received; in the common course of events, a requirement that such result shall be stated is to demand the performance of an impossible thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The insurer argues that its agreement with the employee for .specific additional compensation for twenty-five weeks for the loss of three fingers when approved by the Industrial Accident Board, was a final determination that the injury which the employee suffered was the loss of the fingers and not for injury to the hand rendering it permanently incapable of use. While the agreement as to additional compensation makes reference to \u201closs of three fingers of right hand,\u201d it does not state that it is intended. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>to cover all claims for other additional compensation under St. 1913, c. 445, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 6 (e).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b375-9\"><em>J.
