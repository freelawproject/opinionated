Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated April 24, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-12\">In the Municipal Court the presiding judge found for the plaintiff, and, at the request of the defendant, reported the case to the Appellate Division. His report stated the following facts among others:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-13\">The automobile in question was owned by the plaintiff, but, with the consent of the plaintiff, was registered in the name of one Sewell. On or about October 4, 1914, Sewell with the plaintiff\u2019s permission took the automobile on a personal errand to Canton. Late in the day he rode into the defendant\u2019s garage in Boston and stated that he was the owner of the automobile and that he desired to store it. After the defendant had stated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>terms for storage, Sewell said that he would leave it \u201ca few days.\u201d He did not give the defendant any information as to the true facts regarding the ownership of the automobile and never communicated with the defendant thereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">The plaintiff asked Sewell about the automobile frequently but did not learn of its whereabouts until in February, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">The plaintiff for the first time communicated with the defendant on February 24, 1915, when, with her approval, a letter was written to the defendant stating that the automobile was hers and was \"registered in the name of John M. Sewell simply because it would have been an inconvenience for\u201d her \u201cto register it in her own name.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cWe wish to notify you to hold the car subject to our disposal. The storage etc., Mr. Sewell contracted and will have to pay. Under no conditions should Mr. Sewell be allowed to take the car from your garage unless you receive written instructions from us.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">The report continued as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">\u201cNothing further was done by either party until the time of replevying.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-9\">\u201cAt the time of replevin the defendant claimed and demanded payment of a storage lien up to May 4, 1915, which would be tho. end of an even seven months from October 4, 1914, of $105. This report contains all the evidence material to the questions reported.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-10\">The judge also found, \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s conduct as to Sewell\u2019s, use and control of the automobile was not known to the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-11\">Other material facts are stated in the opinion. The Appellate Division ordered judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-12\"><em>F. R. Mullin, </em>(P.

The storage etc., Mr. Sewell contracted and will have to pay. Under no conditions should Mr. Sewell be allowed to take the car from your garage unless you receive written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>instructions from us.\u201d Thereafter, by virtue of St. 1913, c. 300, \u00a7 1, the defendant had a lien on the automobile for proper charges for storage and care. On April 24, 1915, without demand for possession, without recognition of the defendant\u2019s right to assert any lien, and before tender of any sum in payment of defendant\u2019s probable charges for the storage and care of the automobile, the plaintiff sued out his writ of replevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The report of the judge of the Municipal Court states, \u201cAt the time of replevin, the defendant claimed and demanded payment of a storage lien up to May 4, 1915, which would be the end of an even seven months from October 4, 1914, of $105.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The defendant requested the judge to rule, \u201cUpon all the evidence the defendant is entitled to a finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">As the defendant had a lien under the statute for the period between February 24, 1915, and April 24, 1915, the plaintiff was not entitled to possession of the automobile as against the defendant\u2019s claim of hen, without proof of prior payment of the proper charges, of tender of payment thereof to the defendant and of his refusal to receive the same, or such other conduct on the part of the defendant as estopped him to contend either that he had a lien or that the plaintiff had made no sufficient tender. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>4 Pick. 258. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>177 Mass. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The right to maintain replevin of a chattel is predicated upon the plaintiff\u2019s general or special title and upon his right to immediate possession as against the defendant in the replevin writ at the time of the issuance of the writ. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Neale, </em>6 Allen, 227. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>143 Mass. 401. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>191 Mass. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Therefore, we need not discuss whether the demand of the defendant, made at \u201cthe time of replevin,\u201d for a sum in excess of his legal claim, amounted to a conversion or whether a tender must have been made. Compare <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>145 Mass. 20; <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>180 Mass. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
