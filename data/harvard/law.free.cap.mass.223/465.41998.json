The plaintiff, having exchanged the certificate for a third class ticket at Liverpool, sailed on the steamship; but his baggage was not put on board or was lost during the voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The contract was made in Liverpool. <em>O\u2019Regan </em>v. <em>Cunard Steamship Co. </em>160 Mass. 356. And, no evidence of the common law of England having been introduced, we assume that it is the same as our own. <em>Callender, McAuslan &amp; Troup Co. </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>187 Mass. 104, 107. By its terms as printed on the ticket the defendant\u2019s liability for the loss of baggage was limited to ten pounds or, as agreed by the parties, the sum of $50, and ordinarily the limitation would be controlling. <em>Garvan </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Husdon River Railroad, </em>210 Mass. 275, 278, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">But from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony a finding would have been warranted that upon presentation of the certificate and before receiving the ticket the plaintiff, through an interpreter, asked the person in charge of the defendant\u2019s ticket office to have his baggage insured, offering to pay therefor rather than to take any chance of loss. \u201cI told him that I had valuable things, valuable articles, and I wanted it insured, and he said it was not necessary.\u201d \u201cIt is not necessary . . . and it will come.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">While the exceptions state that he was unable \u201cto read and write\u201d the English language, this fact of itself would not avoid the contract. The plaintiff knew he could not embark or be cared for during the journey unless he obtained a ticket and that the paper received in exchange for the certificate was a ticket; and it is of no consequence that before embarking he failed to acquaint himself with the contents. <em>Fonseca </em>v. <em>Cunard Steamship Co. </em>153 Mass. 553, 555. <em>O\u2019Regan </em>v. <em>Cunard Steamship Co. </em>160 Mass. 356, 359, 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The plaintiff relies on <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, 217 </em>Mass. 274, as stating a different rule. But, while in that case the shipper\u2019s agent, who transacted the business, was illiterate, the bill of lading never reached the shipper; and.there was no evidence, as there is in the case at bar, that the contract relied on by the carrier had been mutually accepted and acted upon as forming the only contract between the parties. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>American Express Co. 221 </em>Mass. 237. The limitation therefore was binding on the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b493-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>S. L. Bailen &amp; F.
