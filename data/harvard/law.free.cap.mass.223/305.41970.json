The defendants have not sought leave to open the case'for a new trial by reason of matters which have arisen since the decision of the issues raised by the pleadings; and no such alleged facts can; be considered on this appeal. The decree must be construed in the light of the facts as found by the master, and confirmed by this court. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>201 Mass. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">The complaint of the defendants is that the decree compels them to accept a title which is subject to \"the possibility of a part of said premises being subject to lease referred to in Supreme Court opinion.\u201d Their brief is mainly a reargument of one of the main issues already tried and decided adversely to their contention. The opinion, based on findings of the master, which were not excepted to by the defendants, expressly stated: \"The tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>. . . had promised in writing to execute a release and surrender the premises whenever required, within thirty days. This was a sufficient compliance with the contract.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Connors, supra. </em>A rehearing on this issue is not opened by the appeal.
