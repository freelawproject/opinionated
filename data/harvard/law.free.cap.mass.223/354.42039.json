Company. In the course of the cross-examination, by the counsel for the defendant Armstrong, of an employee of the R. &amp; L. Company, it appeared that one Warren, the driver of the automobile of the R. &amp; L. Company, had made a report to his employer immediately after the accident. In cross-examination of the witness by the counsel for the plaintiff, it appeared that the report had been sworn to but that the original could not be found, and that the witness could not remember that the report was signed \u201cWilliam H. Warren, R. &amp; L. Company, 915 Boylston Street, Boston.\u201d On redirect examination the witness was shown a paper procured from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, which he testified was a copy of that report.

As against the defendant Armstrong it is excluded, and the jury are expressly told not to consider it as far as Armstrong is concerned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">The entire paper then was read to the jury, the judge repeatedly interjecting instructions that it was in no sense evidence that the jury could consider against the defendant Armstrong. The defendant Armstrong excepted. The contents of the paper were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\">\u201cSaturday, May 3rd, 1913. About 4.45 P. M. while driving a Garford automobile, Model G. 8 Chasis 214 touring car, registered in Massachusetts under number 0526J, property of the R. &amp; L. Company, on Cross Street, Somerville, in the direction of Boston, Mass., a car driven by David B. Armstrong, registered under number 0834B Massachusetts, came out of Flint Street, giving no audible signal, and struck the car I was driving at right hand rear wheel, breaking three spokes in wheel, bent rear fender beyond, repair, dented touring body, smashed hub cap and caused injuries to the brake and axle. This accident was unavoidable on my part. The occupants of my car were E. A. Gilmore, 200 Devonshire Street, Irene Kennedy, 200 Devonshire Street, and Reginald Gilmore, 14 years old. The occupants of the car driven by David Armstrong were Abner T. Armstrong and J. W. Palmer of Somerville. I was driving at the rate of 15 miles an hour and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>was on the proper side of the road, namely, the right hand side. The registration number 0834B, Massachusetts, is under the name of Armstrong and Curtis, Somerville, Mass. William H. Warren, R. &amp; L. Company, 915 Boylston Street, Boston.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">There was a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $15,505. On motion of the defendant it was ordered that the verdict be set aside unless the plaintiff should remit $6,000 therefrom, the judge filing the following memorandum:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">\"1. I deem the damages awarded the plaintiff excessive for the injuries sustained by her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Through no intention, or censurable fault of counsel, but through probable inadvertence of a witness, the jury that tried this cause learned, or had reason to believe, that the defendant had at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury some sort of insurance relating thereto and affecting his liability therefor. It seems to me natural, if not almost inevitable, that a verdict should in such a case, and that this verdict does, to a substantial extent, reflect the influence upon the jury of this information. With some hesitation I concluded at the time not to stop the trial of this cause and another being tried therewith because such information or suggestion of insurance had come to the knowledge of the jury. Nor do I now feel called upon to set aside the verdict absolutely. But it seems to me to be in furtherance of justice to give the plaintiff an opportunity to remit a part of her verdict, and only in case of her refusal to do so, to set aside the verdict absolutely and direct a new* trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\">The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-10\"><em>C.

Company, which collided with an automobile of the defendant. She brought suit against both the defendant and the R. &amp; L. Company. The cases were tried together and a verdict of $15,505 was recovered against each. On the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, the judge <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ordered the verdict set aside unless the plaintiff remitted $6,000, to which she agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">1. Dr. Davison, a witness for the defendant Armstrong, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>cross-examination by the plaintiff was asked: \u201cHow frequently do you testify in court?\u201d to which he answered: \u201cI have testified in court twenty times.\u201d This question was then put to him by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cUsually for an insurance company or defendant?\u201d This question was not answered, the defendant asking to have the case taken from the jury. The judge refused this request, to which refusal the defendant excepted. If the judge thought this question was asked for the purpose of leading the jury to suppose an insurance company, and not the defendant, was the real defendant, thus turning their minds from the real issue in the case and tending to arouse prejudice against the defendant, the judge had the right in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion to take the case from the jury. There is nothing in the evidence, however, to show that there was any abuse of this discretion in refusing the request of the defendant, and we cannot revise his decision. In fact, the judge in his statement filed with the decision on the motion to set aside the verdict says there was \u201cno intention, or censurable fault of counsel.\u201d The plaintiff clearly was not at fault because- a witness, who was later called by one of the defendants, and while he was under cross-examinatian by the counsel for the other defendant, made an irresponsive answer indicating that Armstrong referred him to the insurance company. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Glines, </em>220 Mass. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">2. A witness for the plaintiff testified that she was in a position to hear the horn of either automobile, if blown. To this the defendant excepted and later the judge ordered the testimony stricken out. Even if this evidence were inadmissible, a question which we are not called upon to decide, (see <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>203 Mass. 453; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>159 Mass. 532,) this exception must be overruled, because the judge ordered the evidence to be stricken from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">3. A witness was permitted to read from a paper purporting to be a copy of a statement made by the driver of the R. &amp; L. Company\u2019s automobile. It was offered by the R. &amp; L. Company as evidence against the plaintiff. The cases against the R. &amp; L. Company and this defendant were tried together, and each defendant had the right to present all the material evidence bearing on the issue, even if prejudicial to the other. The judge more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>once, while the admissibility of the evidence was under discussion, and again when the witness was testifying, instructed the jury clearly and decisively that the statement was not evidence against Armstrong and must be entirely disregarded as to him. We do not see what more the judge could have done to protect the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>125 Mass. 34, 39, 40. <em>Produce Exchange Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bieberbach, </em>176 Mass. 577. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>197 Mass. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The remaining exceptions are not argued on the defendant\u2019s brief, and we consider them waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-14\"> <em>King, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
