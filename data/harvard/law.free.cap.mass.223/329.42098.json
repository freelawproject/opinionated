Greenwood, late of Boston, for interest alleged to be due to the plaintiff by reason of a delay beyond a year in the payment of a legacy. Writ dated August 25, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-11\">By the first paragraph of the will of Charles H. Greenwood all his real estate was given to Thomas C. Bachelder and Charles Ripley in trust in their discretion to manage, maintain and develop it and to collect the revenue from it; to \u201cpay over the net receipts at intervals of not more than six months apart to the executor of this will hereinafter named and his receipt for such payments shall be a full and complete discharge to my trustees;\u201d to sell and dispose of all the real estate, with an exception not material, \u201cas speedily and quickly as they can economically and reasonably do so,\u201d the trustees being given \u201cfull, absolute, and final\u201d discretion in all matters appertaining thereto, and being directed \u201clikewise\u201d to pay over to the executor \u201cany such monies so received, in the manner\u201d provided in the passage above quoted as to \u201cnet receipts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>In the second paragraph Thomas C. Bachelder was named sole executor and was directed \u201cto pay over out of my personal property and the sums received from profits and sales of my real estate as above provided the following bequests and legacies as soon as he can conveniently do so, but under no circumstances and in no event shall my real estate be sold to pay these bequests and legacies except by my two said trustees in manner as above provided.\u201d There then followed a list of bequests including, among others, the eighth, quoted in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">There was an agreed statement of facts, from which it appeared that the inventory of the intestate\u2019s estate showed $187,020 of real estate and $112,426.43 of personal estate; that the gifts provided for in the will amounted to $178,000; that at the date of the writ in this action the executor had received $154,595.81 from the personal property of the estate and from the trustees, and that this had accumulated as a fund to use for the payment of the legacies. A part of this fund the executor was obliged to use to pay legacy taxes, payments upon mortgage notes and expenses of administration. Before this action was begun the plaintiff had been paid all the principal of her legacy. At \u201cthe time of the payment of the principal sum of the legacy and at the date of the writ, the defendant had in his hands sufficient funds remaining unpaid out of the fund\u201d paid him by the trustees \u201cto pay the interest on the plaintiff\u2019s legacy.\u201d If the plaintiff was entitled to recover interest, judgment should be entered for her in the sum of $233.46 with interest from August 25, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">The case was heard upon the agreed statement of facts by <em>Jenney, </em>J., who found for the plaintiff in the sum of $237.93 and ordered judgment forthwith. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-7\">\n<em>T. C. Bachelder, pro se.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-8\"><em>G. F. Wales, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b356-9\">Pierce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS7\">It is the contention of the defendant, that under the scheme of the will the plaintiff as a <em>cestui que trust </em>took an interest to the extent of $12,000 in a fund to be developed and accumulated from the executor\u2019s investment of personal property and from the trustees\u2019 management and sale of the real estate. He also argues, that her right to receive payment did not accrue at the expiration of one year from the day of the testator\u2019s death, but, by necessary implication, was postponed until the executor had acquired a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>fund sufficient to pay in full the gift to her and to all others similarly conditioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In that part of the will which creates and defines the trust, as also the duties of the trustees, no word can be found to indicate that the testator intended that there should be at any time a payment of trust income or principal directly to any beneficiary other than to the executor of the will. That such was not the intention of the testator is made certain by the provision in the trust which directs the trustees \u201cTo transfer by proper deed or deeds such an amount of land to the three trustees of the Greenwood Memorial Building hereinafter named as said three trustees shall decide and determine to be proper and necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The clause of the will under which the plaintiff claims, is as follows: \u201cEighth. To Lydia A. Gilbert twelve thousand dollars (12,000) and to her sister, Josephine Gilbert, eight thousand dollars (8,000) if they shall be living at my decease. If one of them be then living the entire sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be paid that one then living. If neither be then living these legacies lapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">This clause creates an ordinary pecuniary legacy payable at the expiration of one year from the testator\u2019s death, and we find nothing in the other clauses of the will to indicate that such a construction is inconsistent with any express or implied intention of the testator. In all essential respects this case is not to be distinguished from <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>202 Mass. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">It follows that interest by way of accretion is to be added to that portion of the legacy that remained unpaid at the expiration of one year from the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">By agreement of parties, judgment in the above event is to be entered for the plaintiff for $233.46, and interest thereon from August 25, 1915, to the date of the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">And it is</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
