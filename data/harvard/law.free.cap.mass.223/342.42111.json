The accident occurred on Dec. 12th 1914 at 3 P. M. I went to the relief Hospital on that day also to Dr. T. F. Goulding M.D. Hotel Commonwealth. I will see you on my return to Boston when I am able to work. If there is any thing I should do please let me know as I don\u2019t know just what to do. I came to Nova Scotia after getting hurt as I could board cheaper than in the city;\u201d that upon the receipt of the employee\u2019s letter the insurer, on January 29, 1915, made answer as follows: \u201cWe have your letter of January 16th advising us that you are unable to work on account of your injury of December 12th, while in the employ of I. Blair &amp; Co. Under the Massachusetts act, we are entitled to have any injured employe examined at any time at our request. You will, therefore, be obliged to present yourself at this office at an early date for the purpose of an examination, otherwise any claim for compensation will not be recognized, and cannot be sustained in our courts;\u201d that the employee on February 19, 1915, by letter replied, \u201cI have received your letter of the 29th. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>I appreciate you kindness for letting me know. I have been waiting to see if I would get improve some. I wish to know, if I go up to Boston, to be examined, will it be necessary for me to remain up there, as I much prefer living down here in the country. I feel better contented down here than rooming out in Boston all alone, while I am unable to work;\u201d that the employee returned to Boston on June 1, 1915; that no claim for compensation ever was filed with the Industrial Accident Board or otherwise than in the above letter to the insurer dated January 16, 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Upon the foregoing facts the insurer asked the Industrial Accident Board to rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201c1. That there can be no compensation allowed in this case as the claim was not made within six months of the date of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201c2. That the failure to make a claim within the period of six months was not occasioned by mistake or other reasonable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201c3. That the refusal of the employee to submit himself for examination is ground for forefeiting his compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">It also argues upon its brief that, \u201cThe notice to the foreman, McDonald, was insufficient, as he was a fellow employee. He was not an agent exercising superintendence, nor was he such an officer or agent as could receive notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">We shall consider the argument and requests in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The workmen\u2019s compensation act (St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 18) provides, \u201cNo proceedings for compensation for an injury under this act shall be maintained unless a notice of the injury shall have been given to the association or subscriber as soon as practicable after the happening thereof,\u201d provided (\u00a7 18) that \u201cWant of notice shall not be a bar to proceedings under this act, if it be shown that the association, subscriber, or agent had knowledge of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The situation as regards notice to the foreman McDonald would seem to be identical to that presented in <em>Bloom\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">In addition to the notice to the foreman, the fact must be found that the foreman communicated the notice given to him, from the fact that a report of the injury to the employee was filed promptly by the subscriber. Thus the knowledge of the subscriber is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The finding of the board that the employee \u201cdid not refuse the examination\u201d and \u201cdid not obstruct same\u201d was amply warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Indeed, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at another conclusion in view of the correspondence and particularly in consideration of the insurer\u2019s failure to reply to the letter of the employee dated February 19, 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 23, as added to the workmen\u2019s compensation act by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 5, provides that \u201cThe claim for compensation shall be in writing and shall state the time, place, cause and nature of the injury; it shall be signed by the person injured or by a person in his behalf . . . and shall be filed with the Industrial Accident Board. The failure to make a claim within the period prescribed by section fifteen shall not be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings under this act if it is found that it was occasioned by mistake or other reasonable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A claim was not filed with the board within the time limited in \u00a7 15 or ever thereafter. The employee gives no reason and offers no excuse for his failure to present his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The board\u2019s finding of mistake on the part of the employee because of the insurer\u2019s failure to reply to the letter of February 19, 1915, finds no warrant in the testimony of the employee. There is no evidence that he thought the letter would serve as notice to the insurer or as a claim to the Industrial Accident Board. Nor are other facts evidenced from which it could rightly be found that there existed other reasonable cause for not filing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Ignorance of the statute\u2019s requirement is the only inference to be drawn from the facts that the employee gave notice to his foreman, gave formal notice to the insurer and failed to file with the Industrial Accident Board a claim for compensation within the six months required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Ignorance of the statutory requirement is not a mistake within the meaning of the above exception. See <em>Roles </em>v. <em>Pascall &amp; Sons, </em>[1911] 1 K. B. 982; <em>Griffiths </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>[1912] W. C. R. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">The case is to be recommitted to the Industrial Accident Board, where the employee may move for a hearing and for the introduction of further evidence upon the question of \u201creasonable cause,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>other than mistake for not filing the claim. If such motion is made and granted, and upon further hearing new facts are shown upon this point, the case is to be considered anew, upon all the evidence introduced by all parties. Otherwise, the rulings requested numbered 1 and 2 should be given.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b372-7\"><em>J. F. Scannell, </em>for the insurer.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b372-8\"><em>T. L.
