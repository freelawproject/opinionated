That the matter therein alleged does not set out any ground for relief in equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That upon the plaintiff\u2019s own allegations he has a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">It is true the plaintiff has a complete defence at law to the notes expressly declared to be void, and it is also true that he can recover at law any unlawful interest paid to the defendant; but his remedy is not limited to the common law, since the enactment of St. 1911, c. 727, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 13, amended by St. 1912, c. 675, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, has conferred expressly also a right to maintain a suit in equity. Independently of the statute \u201ccourts of .equity will grant relief against usurious contracts no matter what may be their form and will permit no shift or devise of the creditor to shield him in taking more than legal interest on a loan.\u201d <em>Horner </em>v. <em>Nitsch, </em>103 Md. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">The defendant also assigns as a ground of demurrer:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b339-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>M. J. Mulkern, (R. Forknall </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b339-12\"><em>W. M. Noble, (D. A. Marshall </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\"3. That the plaintiff\u2019s bill contains no offer to pay the defendant any amount which may be found due him upon the accounting prayed for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This contention is not specifically argued upon the defendant\u2019s brief and may well be treated as waived; but the answer thereto may be taken to be that the statute granting the remedy in equity imposes no condition, on its use. At the hearing the defendant may well be entitled to a decree for so much of the loans as were not made in contravention of any statute upon principles recognized and applied in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Tremont Securities Co. </em>221 Mass. 218, but the failure to offer to pay such does not render the bill demurrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The defendant further assigns as a special cause of demurrer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\"><em>\u201c4. For </em>special cause of demurrer, the defendant says as to paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of the plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint that the matters therein alleged are not set out with sufficient definiteness and particularity so they can be understood and answered by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We think that the allegations, while somewhat vague and informally stated, do make clear the facts intended to be relied upon and do state proper grounds for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">We are of opinion that a decree should be entered revoking the decree <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill and that in place thereof a decree should be entered overruling the demurrer and ordering the defendant to answer over.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-13\"> Of the Superior Court made by <em>Morton, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
