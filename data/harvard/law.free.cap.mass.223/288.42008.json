What the Legislature might have said is one thing; what it has said is quite another thing; and in the application of the statute the cause of partial or total incapacity may spring from and be attributable to the injury just as much where undeveloped and dangerous physical conditions are set in motion producing such result, as where it-follows directly from dislocations or dismemberments or from internal organic changes capable of being exactly located. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The findings, having been justified, are conclusive, and the requests <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> were all properly denied. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AhB6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>J.
