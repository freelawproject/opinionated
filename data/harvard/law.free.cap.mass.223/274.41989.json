The trial judge ruled that the discharge in bankruptcy barred the action and that no special judgment could be entered under R.

Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, dated September 8, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">At the trial in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston it appeared that the suits of clothes were destroyed on July 26,1913, by a fire which burned the defendant\u2019s premises and which was caused by an explosion of naphtha, that on July 10, 1914, the defendant filed a petition in bankruptcy, and included the plaintiff\u2019s name and claim in the schedule of his creditors. On November 19, 1914, a suggestion of bankruptcy was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">When the action was begun on September 8,1913, property of the defendant was attached, and on September 12, 1913, the attorney for the defendant gave to the attorney for the plaintiff $125 and received from the attorney for the plaintiff the following acknowledgment and agreement in writing :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\">\u201cSeptember 12, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-10\">\u201cReceived of Samuel Sigilman, One Hundred, Twenty-five Dollars ($125.00) in lieu of attachment bond in the case of Nathan Fingold <em>vs. </em>Morris Schacter, writ brought in the Boston Municipal Court, dated September 8th, 1913, returnable September 27th, 1913, in which the Royal Insurance Company was named as trustee. This amount will be held by me to await the determination of the above mentioned suit. If a judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff, this amount or any portion thereof is to be applied in satisfaction of the same, and if judgment is for the defendant, this amount will be returned to Mr. Sigilman; it being understood that Mr. Sigilman is to enter an appearance as attorney for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-11\">Wm. J. Holbrook, Atty. for Fingold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZF\">Thereupon the attachment was discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The judge ruled (1) that the defendant was not liable for the loss of the goods by fire unless negligence on his part was proved; (2) that the happening of the explosion was sufficient evidence to sustain a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s property was destroyed through the negligence of the defendant, and the judge so found; (3) that the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant was barred by the discharge in bankruptcy and that the plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment for his damages, which amounted to $115, nor was he entitled to a special judgment under R. L. c. 177, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 25. After making his findings of fact, the judge refused a request of the plaintiff to rule (4) that on all the evidence the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the second count of his declaration, which was a count in tort alleging negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">The judge found for the defendant; and at the request of the plaintiff reported the case to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division made an order dismissing the report; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-7\"><em>W.

It became immaterial, and the assessment of damages ordinarily would have followed. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>3 Allen, 594. <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>136 Mass. 57, 59. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>164 Mass. 537. <em>Beattie </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>201 Mass. 3, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">It appears, however, that after the action had been brought the defendant was adjudged a bankrupt, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim, although suable in either contract or tort, was provable under \u00a7 63 of the bankruptcy act of 1898 as amended by the U. S. Sts. of 1903, c. 487; 1906, c. 3333; 1910, c. 412. <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>190 U.S. 340, 349. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>195 U. S. 176, 194. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>183 Fed. Rep. 518. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>New York Trust Co. </em>188 Fed. Rep. 611. Having obtained his discharge, the effect of which is assumed in the record and in the briefs of counsel to be the same as if it had been duly pleaded, the defendant, even if the writ was dated more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>than four months before the filing of the petition, is freed from all liability, unless by force of the lien which exists where an attachment has been made, or an injunction has issued, or security has been given, the plaintiff is entitled to a special judgment as provided by R. L. c. 177, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 25. U. S. St. 1898, c. 541, \u00a7 17; \u00a7 67 c. <em>Herschman </em>v. <em>Justices of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>220 Mass. 137. <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Nove, </em>175 Mass. 559. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Mass. 58, 61, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">But, as no attachment of property remained in force, no bond was given to dissolve an attachment and no payment of money into court is shown, the plaintiff is not entitled to a special judgment under either section, and no general judgment can be entered because of the discharge. The agreement that the money deposited by the defendant with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney \"in lieu of attachment bond\u201d should be held to await the termination of the action, and then if the plaintiff recovered applied in satisfaction of the judgment, is not within the provisions of our statute and is unenforceable. The third ruling, that the discharge in bankruptcy barred the action and that no special judgment could be entered, and the refusal of the plaintiff\u2019s fourth request, were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The order dismissing the report should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
