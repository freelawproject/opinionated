It is the contention of the defendant that the statute is <em>ex post facto, </em>conflicting with art. 24 of the Declaration of Rights of Massachusetts, and art. 1, \u00a7 9 of the Constitution of the United States. The statute does not attempt to punish the father for his past conduct; it does not attempt to punish him for begetting or neglecting to support the child before the statute took effect. The statute, from the time it became a law, requires the defendant, as the father of the child, to contribute to its support and maintenance, thus relieving the mother or others upon whom the burden may chance to fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">If it is <em>ex post facto </em>legislation to compel the father to provide for the support of a child, not bom in wedlock, because born before the statute was enacted, it might be argued that it is contrary to the Constitution to punish a husband under St. 1911, c. 456, for refusing to support his wife and children, because he was married and the children were born before the statute took effect; or to insist on a son of sufficient means supporting his parents under St. 1915, c. 163. We are of opinion that St. 1913, c. 563, is not <em>ex post facto </em>legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">2. Since the birth of the child, the mother has married and the child has been supported by her husband. About a \u201cdozen times since they ceased to live together,\u201d she asked the defendant to contribute toward the support of the child, but he refused. She last saw him three years ago, \u201cwhen she met him in front of his office, when she then asked him if he would not do something toward the support of the child, and he said he was married again and he had all he could do to take care of those he had and he did not intend to do anything.\u201d The fact that the husband of the mother has supported the child does not relieve the father of the duty imposed on him by the statute. See <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>128 Mass. 287; <em>Purinton </em>v. <em>Jamrock, </em>195 Mass. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The jury could find on all the evidence, that the defendant neglected or refused to contribute reasonably to the maintenance and support of the child, although no demand was made on bim during the three years preceding the time of the trial. It is provided in the statute that the practice under St. 1911, c. 456, shall apply to proceedings under the statute before us, and St. 1911, c. 456, \u00a7 7, enacts that \u201cproof ... of the neglect or refusal . . . shall be <em>prima fade </em>evidence that such . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>neglect or refusal is wilful and without just cause.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenblatt, </em>219 Mass. 197.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b178-7\"><em>B.
