No. 333.01 Cod. Ord. of Barberton.\u201d At that time Sec. No. 333.01 read<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201cDRIVING OR PHYSICAL CONTROL WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE; EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201c(a) No person who is under the influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse, or the combined influence of alcohol and any drug of abuse, shall operate any vehicle within the Municipality. (ORC 4511.19)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">\u201c(b) No person who is under the influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse, or the combined influence of any drug of abuse, shall be in actual physical control of any vehicle within the Municipality. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">On May 30, 1983, appellant was charged with \u201cDWI in violation of Sec. No. 333.01A Cod. Ord. of Barberton.\u201d At that time Sec. No. 333.01 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">\u201cDRIVING OR PHYSICAL CONTROL WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE; EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">\u201c(a) <em>Operation Under Influence. </em>No person shall operate any vehicle within the Municipality if any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-15\">\u201c(1) The person is under the influence of alcohol or any drug or <em>[sic] </em>abuse, or the combined influence of alcohol and any drug of abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-16\">\u201c(2) The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths of one percent or more by weight of alcohol in his or her blood;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-17\">\u201c(3) The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his or her breath; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201c(4) The person has a concentration of fourteen-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his or her urine. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Appellant contends that the January 23, 1983 ticket did not advise him whether he had been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both, and/or being in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs or both. Appellant claims the ticket was so vague that it failed to charge him with an offense as required by Traf. R. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Appellant contends that the May 30, 1983 ticket did not advise him whether he had been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both. Again, appellant claims that the ticket was so vague that it failed to charge him with an offense as required by Traf. R. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The purpose of the Ohio Traffic Rules is, in large part, to ensure <em>\u201csimplicity </em>and uniformity <em>in procedure </em>* * (Emphasis added.) Traf. R. 1(B). Simplicity in procedure does not mean unfairness in procedure, or indifference to the rights of the prosecution or the defense. It means that traffic court procedure is not controlled by the stricter, more elaborate rules that govern procedures in more serious cases. Cf. <em>Youngstown </em>v. <em>Starks </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App. 3d 269, 271. Therefore, a complaint prepared pursuant to Traf. R. 3 simply needs to advise the defendant of the offense with which he is charged, in a manner that can be readily understood by a person making a reasonable attempt to understand. <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1978), 55 Ohio App. 2d 215, 219 [9 O.O.3d 368].</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Given the facts in this case, we find it inconceivable that appellant did not know he had been charged with driving while intoxicated by alcohol. A copy of an Alcohol Influence Report Form was filed with each ticket. Given appellant\u2019s familiarity with the traffic court system, he should have immediately understood the significance of those reports. If he did not immediately understand, his lawyer should have immediately understood. If neither of them understood, they should have made some reasonable attempt to understand. They made no such attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">If appellant did not understand exactly what he had been charged with, he could have informally asked the prosecutor to amend the complaint so as to charge a more specific offense. As a practical matter, there is a possibility the prosecutor would have complied with appellant\u2019s informal request. If he would have refused to comply, appellant could have requested that the prosecutor furnish him \u201cwith a bill of particulars setting up specifically the nature of the offense charged and * * * the conduct of defendant alleged to constitute the offense.\u201d Crim. R. 7(E). This would have required the prosecutor to correct any prejudicial defects in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Appellant never attempted to have any defects in the complaint corrected. Instead, he pled \u201cno contest\u201d to the charges set forth in the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>complaints. Then, after he was convicted and sentenced, he claimed <em>for the first time </em>that he had not been properly charged with an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We find appellant\u2019s contentions unpersuasive and hold that a Uniform Traffic Ticket properly charges the defendant with an offense when it describes the nature of the offense as \u201cDWI\u201d and makes reference to the ordinance that gives rise to the offense, even if it does not indicate the substance that caused the defendant to be intoxicated. A Uniform Traffic Ticket effectively charges an offense even if the defendant has to make some reasonable inquiry in order to know exactly what offense is charged. Such inquiry should be made before trial by filing a request for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">For the foregong reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-18\"> Despite the fact that this c\u00e1se turns on an application of Barberton Codified Ordinance Sec. No. 333.01 and 333.01(a), neither party provided this court with a copy of these provisions. Therefore, pursuant to Crim. R. 57(B) and Civ. R. 44.1(A)(2), this court attempted to locate these provisions in various law libraries, including this court\u2019s library. When that search failed to produce the provisions in question, this court contacted the assistant prosecutor handling this case (pursuant to Crim. R. 57[B] and Civ. R. 44.1[A][2]) and requested him to: (1) provide to this court copies of the provisions as they were in effect on January 23,1983 and May 30, 1983; and (2) to certify to this court that he served a copy of the requested <em>ex parte </em>communication on opposing counsel. The assistant prosecutor complied with these requests and instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-19\">While this court \u201cmay\u201d take judicial notice of a municipal ordinance within the state of Ohio, pursuant to Civ. R. 44.1(A)(2), it was not required to do so in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
