The court based its decision on <em>State, ex rel. Steyer, </em>v. <em>Szabo </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 109 [21 O.O.2d 366], where we held that quo warranto relief was not available because of the existence of the statutory appeal procedure in R.C. 2506.01 <em>et seq. </em>The threshold question, then, is whether appellant could have obtained any relief by way of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">R.C. 2506.01 provides that \u201c[e]very final order, adjudication, or decision of any * * * commission * * * of any political subdivision of the state may be reviewed by the common pleas court of the county in which the principal office of the political subdivision is located, as provided in sections 2505.01 to 2505.45, inclusive, of the Revised Code, and as such procedure is modified by sections 2506.01 to 2506.04, inclusive, of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">As a prerequisite for appeal, and for the time for perfecting an appeal to begin to run, R.C. 2505.07 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\"><em>\u201cAfter the journal entry </em>of a final order, judgment, or decree has been approved * * * in writing and filed * * * for journalization, or after the entry of other matter for review, the period of time within which the appeal shall be perfected unless otherwise provided by law is, * * * (B) * * * within ten days.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">In <em>Schenley </em>v. <em>Kauth </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 109 [51 O.O. 30], this court considered G.C. 12223-7, the predecessor to R.C. 2505.07. At paragraph one of the syllabus, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">\u201cA court of record speaks only through its journal and not by oral pronouncement or mere written minute or memorandum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">In paragraph two of the syllabus, we declared that pursuant to statute, \u201cthe filing of a journal entry * * * is essential to start the running of the period of time, therein prescribed, within which an appeal may be perfected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">In <em>Grimes </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(C.P. 1969), 17 Ohio Misc. 193 [46 O.O.2d 279], at 195-196, a Cuyahoga County trial court applied the principles of <em>Schenley </em>in terms with which we agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-13\">\u201cIt is clear that since the statute definitely applies to an administrative agency as well as to a court of record, such agency has the duty of reducing its rulings to writing before they may become effective and before the ten-day period for an appeal can start running. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-14\">\u201cThe form of written entry of a decision of an administrative board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>should be the written minutes of its meeting at which the decision was rendered. * * * The ten-day period for appeal starts to run at the time when the board\u2019s decision has been set forth in writing in its minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Accord <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals </em>(C.P. 1966), 9 Ohio Misc. 101 [38 O.O.2d 152], at 102, where another trial court explained that the time for appeal \u201cdoes not commence upon a mere verbal announcement of the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In the same connection, the court of appeals in <em>Lakewood Homes </em>v. <em>Bd. of Adjustment </em>(1971), 25 Ohio App. 2d 125 [54 O.O.2d 306], discussed the administrative procedure statutes and at 131 commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">\u201cThe statute [R.C. 2505.07] is explicit in its reference to \u2018entry of other matter\u2019 for review. That there be a permanent, written record of some nature is implicit and inherent in the use of the word \u2018entry.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">In this case, the record is devoid of the actual minutes of the commission\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s complaint. Because of the commission\u2019s failure to journalize its decision appellant asserts that \u201cthe remedy by way of appeal was not available.\u201d We agree. The court of appeals failed to take into account the requirement that the commission\u2019s decision be journalized before it could become a final appealable order. In that failure lies the error in the judgment below. We consequently hold that pursuant to R.C. 2505.07, the decision of an administrative agency must be journalized before an appeal from such decision may be taken under R.C. 2506.01. Since this was not done here, appellant has no means available by which he may seek redress of his grievances; he therefore can resort to the extraordinary remedy of quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">We now proceed to issues not addressed by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Appellees concede that contrary to law and the commission\u2019s own rules,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> efficiency points were not counted in computing the examination scores. They argue, however, that \u201conce a public official has successfully completed his probationary period, * * * he cannot be removed by quo warranto, but rather can only be removed for cause.\u201d As support, they rely on <em>State, ex rel. Polen, </em>v. <em>Wymer </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 24 [65 O.O.2d 96], the syllabus of which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\">\u201cWhere a candidate is certified as having scored the highest grade in a promotional civil service examination that was not graded in full conformity with civil service law, and where it does not appear that the candidate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>so certified knew of or participated in the irregular grading, he will not be replaced by one bringing an action in quo warranto who failed to take affirmative action to prevent the certification and permanent appointment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><em>Wymer </em>and its related decisions are inapposite.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Workman has not attained the permanent tenure that would insulate him from quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The city manager\u2019s pretended permanent appointment, made three days before the expiration of Workman\u2019s probationary period, was ineffective and void <em>ab initio. </em>R.C. 1.45 provides: \u201cIf a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun * * *.\u201d Moreover, the course of events in the courts below, culminating in an injunction preventing Workman\u2019s permanent installation until the dispute is decided by this court, precludes application of the <em>Wymer </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In <em>State, ex rel. Heer, </em>v. <em>Butterfield </em>(1915), 92 Ohio St. 428, at paragraph one of the syllabus, this court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cIn order that a private relator may be entitled to maintain an action in quo warranto under Section 12307, General Code [now R.C. 2733.06], to recover a public office, he must show not only that he is entitled to the office, but also that it is unlawfully held and exercised by the defendant in the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">With respect to showing in a quo warranto action that he is entitled to recover a public office, a relator need not prove his own title beyond all doubt. He need only establish his claim \u201cin good faith and upon reasonable grounds.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Ethell, </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 217 [59 O.O. 298], paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Halak, </em>v. <em>Cebula </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St. 2d 291, 293 [3 O.O.3d 439].</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Appellant argues that Workman\u2019s earlier participation in an identical examination disqualifies his certification and appointment. From this, appellant reasons that he should be designated chief of police since he ranked second on the eligibility roster. Appellees answer that \u201c \u2018[a] mere possibility of appointment does not constitute entitlement in any way.\u2019 \u201d <em>State, ex rel. Halak, supra, </em>at 293.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find the latter\u2019s argument unpersuasive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>R.C. 124.44 requires the civil service commission to \u201ccertify to the appointing officer the name of the person receiving the highest rating. Upon such certification, the appointing officer shall appoint the person so certified within thirty days from the date of such certification.\u201d Accordingly, if Workman\u2019s score is invalid because he had an unfair advantage, appellant\u2019s appointment would be more than a mere possibility. Under the statute, appellant\u2019s appointment would be a certainty, because he is second on the list of eligibles.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Appellant has, therefore, alleged a claim to the office of chief of police based upon \u201cgood faith and upon reasonable grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In addition, appellant attacks Workman\u2019s certification on another ground. He contends the results of the 1983 promotional examination are void for the reason that efficiency points were not included as part of the final scores.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">R.C. 124.31(B) provides that efficiency credit \u201cshall be added to the examination grade * * This requirement is stated in terms<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we hold to be mandatory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Equally mandatory is the specification in the commission\u2019s own rules that \u201c[e]ach promotional examination shall consist [in part] of * * * [performance ratings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In <em>State, ex rel. Ethell, </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>at 223, we declared that where a civil service promotional examination is conducted contrary to law, \u201cit is not possible to consider merely the written portion thereof and decide from that who is entitled to the promotion for which the examination was given,\u201d and \u201cit follows necessarily that if one part of such an examination is unlawful then the whole examination must fail.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Ironically, because the entire 1983 promotional examination for chief of police is void, appellant can no more claim a valid title to that office than can Workman. Accordingly, although we allow the writ of quo warranto, we are constrained to confine its effect to the ouster of Workman only.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Finally, appellant requests the court to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to conduct another examination according to law. \u201c \u2018In order to grant a writ of mandamus, the court must find that the relator has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, that the respondent is under a clear legal duty to perform the requested act, and that relator has no plain and adequate remedy at law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State, ex rel. Halloran, </em>v. <em>Zapatony </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 73, 74. In the case at bar, appellant has a \u201cclear legal right\u201d to a new examination. By this decision, the office of chief of police is vacant, and appellant is eligible to take the promotional examination necessary to fill such vacancy. He possesses an interest in seeing that the examination is fair, competitive, and held in full compliance with the law. Second, the commission is under a \u201cclear legal duty\u201d to conduct another test. It has a statutory obligation under R.C. Chapter 124 to see that all promotions in the classified service are made pursuant to a competitive examination. Third, appellant has no \u201cadequate remedy at law,\u201d because, as we have discussed, he has been foreclosed from pursuing an appeal under R.C. 2506.01 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In view of the foregoing, the certification of Workman as chief of police was unlawful and he is not entitled to that position. Since the facts which cause us to order the ouster of Workman preclude us from ordering appellant certified and appointed, we limit our judgment in quo warranto to the ouster of Workman. We further allow a writ of mandamus to compel the Portsmouth Municipal Civil Service Commission and the Portsmouth City Manager to proceed to administer a new competitive promotional examination for the office of Chief of Police of Portsmouth, to certify the highest score, and to make appointment of the applicant receiving such score, all according to law as hereinbefore determined. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writs allowed accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes and C.

Chapter 2733 relative to quo warranto actions. <em>State, ex rel. Mikus, </em>v. <em>Hirbe </em>(1965), 5 Ohio App. 2d 307 [34 O.O.2d 490], affirmed (1966), 7 Ohio St. 2d 104.

Performance Ratings * * *.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> Previously, this court decided <em>State, ex rel.

Mikus, </em>v. <em>Hirbe, supra, </em>all of which stand for the general proposition that where an appointee in the classified service has completed his probationary period, he cannot be ousted by quo warranto even though testing or grading procedures were fraudulent and efficiency credits were not counted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\"> Appellees also argue that the civil service statutes do not preclude taking an identical examination twice after a six-month period has expired. This argument flies in the face of the policy underlying the merit system. Section 10, Article XV, of the Ohio Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[appointments and promotions in the civil service of * * * cities, shall be made according to merit and fitness, to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by <em>competitive </em>examinations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 124.31(B), pertaining to promotions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>states that \u201c[a]ll examinations for promotions shall be <em>competitive </em>and in writing * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Where any applicant has taken an examination \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as one taken previously, and his competitors have not taken the previous examination, such applicant certainly would enjoy an unfair advantage and the second examination becomes less than \u201ccompetitive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> \u201cIn statutory construction,-* * * the word \u2018shall\u2019 shall be construed as mandatory * * *.\u201d <em>Dorrian </em>v. <em>Scioto Conserv.

The place one comes out, when faced with the issues raised in a case, depends largely on where one starts. The majority starts by summarily concluding: \u201cThe essential facts of this case are undisputed.\u201d I start by noting that this case is before us on a very sparse record, consisting mostly of motions and briefs, items of correspondence, a transcript of proceedings from an entirely separate (albeit factually related) case and a limited stipulation of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The transcript of proceedings is from the Scioto County Common Pleas Court case, <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>which was apparently pending when appellant initiated this case as an original action in the Court of Appeals for Scioto County. During arguments in the common pleas court, Workman\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">\u201cIf nothing else we have accomplished one fact, and that is that the facts are sure as the dickens in dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Hanley\u2019s attorney agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cThe facts are always in dispute. Of course, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The facts are (almost) always in dispute, and that is why they must be developed in an evidentiary hearing conducted pursuant to the Rules of Evidence. Nothing of the sort has been done in this case. Consequently, we really do not know whether the 1980 and 1983 promotional exams were the same, or similar. We do not know whether the alleged similarities rendered the 1983 test uncompetitive. I reject the majority\u2019s conclusion that the alleged similarities between the two tests made the 1983 test <em>per se </em>uncompetitive. I think a determination of the competitiveness of the 1983 test depends on an analysis of its nature and content.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Furthermore, I note the relevance of Ohio Adm. Code 123:1-9-12 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">\u201cAn applicant who has competed in a civil service examination <em>may not repeat that examination </em>or take an examination for the same classification <em>within six months </em>from the date of original examination, unless an alternative form of examination is given, or unless other standards are specified in the examination announcement, provided that the Director may waive in writing this rule upon written request from an applicant stating substantial reasons for granting such waiver.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">This provision makes it clear that an applicant may retake the identical exam after waiting six months. In the case before us, there is no evidence that the 1980 and 1983 exams were identical. To the contrary, the record contains a November 1, 1983 letter from IPMA to the Executive Secretary of the Portsmouth Civil Service Commission, which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-14\">\u201c* * * It cannot be stated for certain whether or not the 1980 and 1983 IPMA 558 examinations are identical. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">The majority is disturbed because efficiency points were not added to the examination grades as required by R.C. 124.31(B). Again, there is nothing in the record to support appellant\u2019s contention that the addition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>efficiency points would have caused the civil service commission to rank him ahead of Workman. For all we know, Workman might have had as many, or more, efficiency points than the appellant. My point is that the record in this case is, at best, incomplete, and the extraordinary relief of quo warranto should not be granted unless the record positively indicates that such relief is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">I also believe that appellant had an adequate remedy at law to protect his interests, and is, therefore, not entitled to the quo warranto or mandamus relief he now seeks. Appellant could have formally petitioned the civil service commission for relief, and appealed the denial of that relief pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506. For instance, appellant could have formally requested the commission to utilize efficiency points in determining the overall rankings for police chief and appealed the commission\u2019s denial of his request. If the commission would have then refused to journalize its denial of appellant\u2019s request, a point of concern to the majority, he could have quickly obtained a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to conform to its clear legal duty and to journalize its decision. Then he could have appealed. See <em>State, ex rel. Steyer, </em>v. <em>Szabo </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 109 [21 O.O.2d 366].</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Finally, I am concerned about this court extending the scope of quo warranto beyond that which was originally intended. R.C. 2733.08, dealing with petitions against a person for usurpation of office, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201cWhen an action in quo warranto is brought against a person for usurping an office, the petition shall set forth the name of the person claiming to be entitled to the office, with an averment of his right thereto. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">In <em>State, ex rel. Heer, </em>v. <em>Butterfield </em>(1915), 92 Ohio St. 428, this court held a private relator could not obtain quo warranto relief unless he could prove he was entitled to the office he claimed was unlawfully held. In this case, the appellant has failed to prove he is entitled to the office he claims is unlawfully held. Therefore, he is not entitled to quo warranto relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Finally, the majority decision undermines the independence of an equal branch of government, and thrusts itself into the role of the Portsmouth Civil Service Commission. In light of the sparse record in this case, it would be appropriate to defer the administration of the civil service system to the proper city officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the court of appeals decision, which stated that \u201c* * * relator is not entitled either to quo warranto or mandamus relief for the reason relator had an adequate remedy at law by raising his objections before the Civil Service Commission and appealing adverse rulings pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-12\">Locher, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
