We agree. \u201cThe function of mandamus is to compel the performance of a present existing duty as to which there is a default. It is not granted to take effect prospectively, and <em>it contemplates the performance of an act which is incumbent on the respondent when the application for a writ is made. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State, ex rel. Willis, </em>v. <em>Sheboy </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 167, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The writ allowed by the court of appeals ordered that appellant be promoted to the rank of sergeant because he had attained the top position on the eligibility list when that vacancy occurred. The writ did not attempt to provide relief to appellant beyond the original promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">In <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Welfare Dept. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 58 [23 O.O.3d 93], we had the opportunity to discuss the role of probation in the civil service system and stated at 59:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">\u201cSince 1913, Ohio has provided for a probationary period for civil service employees. The requirement of a period of probationary service has been held to be part of a valid statutory scheme implementing Section 10, Article XV of the Ohio Constitution. <em>State, ex rel. Clements, </em>v. <em>Babb </em>(1948), 150 Ohio St. 359, 368-369 [38 O.O. 217]. Specifically, in <em>Babb, </em>this court held that the requirement of the Ohio Constitution that appointments and promotions be ascertained by competitive examination \u2018as far as practicable\u2019 leaves room for the possibility that examination might not be the sole test of merit and fitness. For that reason a probationary period might be imposed to aid in determining fitness. <em>Id. </em>Successful completion of the prescribed probationary period is required before appointment to a civil service position is made final. <em>State, ex rel. Artman, </em>v. <em>McDonough </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 47, 49 [7 O.O. 160].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">An original civil service appointment or promotion is not intended to guarantee continued employment throughout the employee\u2019s probationary period. Thus, we cannot accept appellant\u2019s argument that his probationary demotion violated the original writ compelling promotion. To do so would defeat the recognized purpose of probation in the civil service system and impermissibly broaden the scope of the writ allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">For the same reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the court of appeals to have the oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tunity to establish that appellees acted in bad faith. Such a finding would not render appellant\u2019s probationary demotion actionable as a violation of the writ compelling his promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
