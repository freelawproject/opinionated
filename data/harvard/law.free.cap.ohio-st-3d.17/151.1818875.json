See, <em>e.g., Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield </em>(1982), 186 Conn. 490, 442 A. 2d 911; <em>Nyman </em>v. <em>Eugene </em>(1979), 286 Ore. 47, 593 P. 2d 515; <em>Drainage Dist. No. 1 </em>v. <em>Green Valley </em>(1979), 69 Ill. App. 3d 330, 387 N. E. 2d 422; <em>State, ex rel. Remy, </em>v. <em>Agar </em>(Okla. 1977), 559 P. 2d 1235; <em>United States </em>v. <em>202.76 Acres of Land </em>(D.N.D. 1977), 439 F. Supp. 483. Ohio is in accord with this view. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Krites </em>(1950), 90 Ohio App. 38, 43 [46 O.O. 360] (public alley); <em>Wilberforce University </em>v. <em>College </em>(1948), 86 Ohio App. 121 [40 O.O. 521] (state university); <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Nichol </em>(1942), 70 Ohio App. 467 [25 O.O. 206] (board of education); <em>Gund Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1927), 26 Ohio App. 590 (municipal corporation). Indeed, this court has long recognized that \u201c* * * roads and streets may be established by prescription * * *.\u201d <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Roseville </em>(1907), 76 Ohio St. 108, at 117. Paragraph four of the syllabus in <em>Roseville, swpra, </em>provides: \u201cTitle by prescription to a public street can be shown only by adverse user by the public, under a claim of right, and uninterrupted for twenty-one years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Likewise, the United States Supreme Court has held that the federal government can acquire property by adverse possession and that such an acquisition does not fall within the eminent domain provisions of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Schwalby </em>(1893), 147 U.S. 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We recognize that Ohio\u2019s past decisions upholding the government\u2019s right to acquire title by adverse possession did not expressly address appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge. However, we believe that the operative language of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution is that compensation shall be paid when property is \u201ctaken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In the case of adverse possession, property is not taken. Rather, once the statutory period enunciated in R.C. 2305.04 has expired, the former titleholder has lost his claim of ownership and the adverse possessor is thereafter maintaining its possession, not taking property. Such a conclusion is consistent with results in other jurisdictions which have addressed this challenge as well as the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncement in <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Short </em>(1982), 454 U.S. 516. <em>Texaco </em>concerned the issue of whether an interest in mineral rights had lapsed or had been taken without just compensation by the state government in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court stated, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cIt is the owner\u2019s failure to make any use of the property \u2014 and not the action of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the State \u2014 that causes the lapse of the property right; there is no \u2018taking\u2019 that requires compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530. See, also, <em>Board of Commrs. </em>v. <em>Flickinger </em>(Colo. 1984), 687 P. 2d 975; <em>Ashland </em>v. <em>Hardesty </em>(Ore. App. 1975), 543 P. 2d 41; <em>Dunnick </em>v. <em>Stockgrowers Bank of Marmouth </em>(1974), 191 Neb. 370, 215 N. W. 2d 93; <em>Kentucky Dept. of Parks </em>v. <em>Stephens </em>(Ky. 1966), 407 S.W. 2d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Appellant also contends that neither party had actual knowledge of the encroachment until 1981, which precludes the city\u2019s acquisition by adverse possession. Actual knowledge is not a necessary element of adverse possession. Since the streets involved were in open, visible, and notorious possession by the city, constructive knowledge is charged to the titleholder. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Krites, supra. </em>See, also, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State </em>(1898), 59 Ohio St. 278; <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>Rapp </em>(App. 1950), 59 Ohio Law Abs. 105, 106 [45 O.O. 494]; <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Brenaman </em>(C.P. 1915), 25 Ohio Dec. 533, 538, 17 Ohio N.P. (N.S.) 515, 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Finally, we find unpersuasive appellant\u2019s argument that the word \u201cperson\u201d in R.C. 2305.04 does not include governmental entities. In <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Schwalby, supra, </em>at 517, the United States Supreme Court noted the government is a \u201cperson\u201d as that term is used in a state\u2019s lapse-of-time statute for purposes of asserting the statute as a bar to recovery by a titleholder who had lost his rights to property. We also note that R.C. 2305.04 establishes the twenty-one-year time frame in which a person is entitled to <em>bring </em>an action to recover title or possession from an adverse user. In this case, appellant is the person bringing the action, not the city. The controlling statute on the issue of who may raise the passage of time as a defense is actually R.C. 2305.03 which provides that a \u201cparty\u201d may interpose lapse of time as a bar to recovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee, city of Columbus, is undoubtedly a \u201cparty\u201d to the instant litigation, as that term is used in Ohio, and may properly raise lapse of time as a bar to civil actions. Cf. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State, ex rel. Leroy </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 48, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Accordingly, we hold that a municipal corporation can acquire title to private property by adverse possession. Likewise, we believe the lower courts properly held that appellee was entitled to summary judgment, as the city demonstrated open and exclusive possession and use for over twenty-one years which was hostile, notorious and adverse to the titleholder. Appellee therefore did acquire title by adverse possession as the appellant did not commence an action to recover title or possession of the property within twenty-one years after the cause accrued. R.C. 2305.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., O\u2019Neill, Locher, Holmes, C.
