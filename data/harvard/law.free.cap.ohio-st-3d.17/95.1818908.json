Respondent suggests that, if any penalty be imposed, such penalty should be a public reprimand. For the following reasons, we overrule respondent\u2019s objections and adopt both the findings of fact and recommended sanction of a one-year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">In <em>Columbus Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 33, we issued a one-year suspension to an attorney convicted of aggravated assault which is a violation of R.C. 2903.12 and also a fourth-degree felony. This conviction arose from a baseball-bat attack upon a date of the attorney\u2019s ex-wife. This court ruled that such conduct amounted to a violation of DR 1-102(A)(3) and warranted a one-year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Respondent attempts to distinguish <em>Harris </em>on the ground that the attorney in <em>Harris </em>committed the assault with a potentially deadly implement while respondent \u201conly\u201d struck Francis with his hand, and that respondent was convicted of misdemeanors as opposed to a felony. We do not find these to be material distinctions. There is no question that respondent\u2019s conduct was illegal. That respondent\u2019s conduct also involved moral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>turpitude is evident from respondent\u2019s striking another person in response to a verbal invective and the violation of the sanctity of Francis\u2019 home and property. With this in mind, the differences between <em>Harris </em>and the instant case become minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s objections to the board\u2019s report are overruled, the findings and recommendation of the board are adopted, and respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
