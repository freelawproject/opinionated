This test weighs the harm to the \u2018prompt and orderly disposition of litigation,\u2019 and the consequent waste of judicial resources, resulting from the allowance of an appeal, with the need for immediate review because appeal after final judgment is not practicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">According to the analysis in <em>BancOhio Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Rubicon Cadillac, Inc. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 32, an order excluding counsel cannot be effectively reviewed after a final judgment if the court erroneously deprives a party of his chosen counsel. The burden on that party at the end of the case to show that he was prejudiced would in effect be an \u201cinsurmountable burden.\u201d See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>McAlpin </em>(C.A. 2, 1980), 625 F. 2d 433, 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The reasoning of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mercy Hospital, supra, </em>at 42, governs this matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cIt appears far less likely that appeals from orders granting disqualification * * * [in this matter refusing to permit out-of-state attorneys] motions will be taken for purely tactical reasons, however. The granting of a disqualification motion by a trial court is a fair indication that a legitimate and nonfrivolous issue has been raised. It is incumbent upon courts, when a legitimate question of propriety arises, to dispose of matters promptly in order to facilitate and improve the justice system. Immediate appealability of orders granting disqualification [refusing permission] motions fulfills this purpose.\u201d (Bracketed material added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b122-11\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b122-12\">Cox, J., of the Seventh Appellate District, sitting for Wright, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-13\"> The assignment of error before the appellate court was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it denied plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for admission of an out-of-state counsel on the sole ground that said counsel or members of their firm may be called as witnesses in the trial of this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
