In <em>Temple </em>we expressly adopted Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts 2d. <em>Id. </em>at 322.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Paragraphs one and two of the syllabus in <em>Temple </em>state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">\u201c1. <em>One who sells any product </em>in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">\u201c(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">\u201c(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-16\">\u201c2. The rule stated above applies although the seller has exercised all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In contradiction to our holding in <em>Temple, </em>the court of appeals herein incorrectly held that \u201c[sjummary judgment was properly granted * * * because appellee was not the manufacturer of the product which allegedly caused appellant\u2019s injury.\u201d Accordingly, we find that the appellate court erroneously concluded that strict liability only extends to sellers who also manufactured the defective product which allegedly caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The remaining issue to be decided is whether this appellant may utilize the dual-capacity doctrine to attach strict tort liability to his employer for injuries received at the work place.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Undeniably in certain unique settings Ohio courts have attached tort liability to employers who can be regarded as acting in a dual capacity with respect to an employee. <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App. 2d 279 [3 O.O.3d 333]. In <em>Mercer, </em>the court noted at 283 that \u201c \u2018[t]he decisive dual-capacity test is not concerned with how separate or different the second function of the employer is from the first but with whether the second function generates obligations unrelated to those flowing from the first, that of employer.\u2019 \u201d The court concluded that the alleged hazard was not necessarily one of employment, but was common to the public in general which severed the causal connection between the employment and the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">A consistent result was reached by this court in <em>Guy </em>v. <em>Arthur H. Thomas Co. </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 183 [9 O.O.3d 138], where the syllabus provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">\u201cWhere an employer-hospital occupies a second or dual capacity, as an administering hospital, that confers upon it traditional obligations unrelated to and independent of those imposed upon it as an employer, <em>an employee injured, as a result of a violation of the obligations springing from employer-hospital\u2019s second or dual capacity, </em>is not barred by either Section 35 of Article II of the Ohio Constitution or R.C. 4123.74, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, from recovering in tort from that employer-hospital.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">However, it has more recently been noted that the dual-capacity doctrine is not without limit. <em>E.g., Simpkins </em>v. <em>Delco Moraine Div. </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App. 3d 275.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We recently refused to allow a policeman tort recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>from his city-employer on a theory that the city had failed to maintain public streets in <em>Freese </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 5. This court noted at 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201c* * * [I]n order for the dual-capacity doctrine to apply, there must be an allegation and showing that the employer occupied two independent and unrelated relationships with the employee, that at the time of these roles of the employer there were occasioned two different obligations to this employee, and that the employer had during such time assumed a role other than that of employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee purchased the liquid fertilizer for two purposes: (1) public sale, and (2) use in its greenhouse operations. To fulfill the second purpose it provided the product for use by its workers as a routine and integral part of its operations within its traditional capacity as a supplier of tools and equipment. <em>Simpkins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The appellee was not a manufacturer of a product for public sale but rather was both a consumer and distributor. As such, the two purposes of appellee\u2019s use of the product had differing obligations attached to them. The appellant was injured by the employment use, not the public sale use. As we observed in <em>Freese, supra, </em>at 11: \u201c* * * [Wjhat must be determined is whether the employer stepped out of his role as such, and assumed another hat or cloak. If the facts would show the latter, the employer has accordingly assumed another capacity and also has assumed independent obligations to his employee unrelated to the obligations arising out of the employer-employee relationship.\u201d In this case, we find that appellee had not assumed another capacity to the appellant and that the employment relationship predominated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Since under the facts of this case the dual-capacity doctrine may not be used by the appellant, the action is precluded by the exclusivity provisions of Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, as implemented by R.C. 4123.74. Where the injury suffered in the course of employment is not intentionally inflicted the employee\u2019s sole avenue of recovery is through workers\u2019 compensation. See <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 608 [23 O.O.3d 504], Recently, this court observed: \u201cCommon-law damages are clearly unavailable under R.C. 4123.741 for injuries negligently inflicted by a co-employee in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>VIP Development Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 90, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Allowing a cause of action in addition to the relief afforded by Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is unwarranted where, as here, the injury is</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>caused predominantly by the employment relationship and not by an independent relationship between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In conclusion, we hold that a seller of a defective product, who purchases it in bulk, supplying some of the product to its employees for use in the course of employment and repackaging the remainder for public sale, is not strictly liable under the dual-capacity doctrine to an employee who is unintentionally injured in the course of employment while using the defective product. Such a cause of action is barred by Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act which provides the exclusive remedy for the injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-8\">O\u2019Neill, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b190-9\">O\u2019Neill, J., of the Seventh Appellate District, sitting for Sweeney, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-17\"> As is noted in Prosser <em>&amp; </em>Keeton, Law of Torts (5 Ed. 1984) 706-707, Section 100:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aul\">\u201cThe retailer is in a more favorable position to bear the costs of accidents due to the defectively dangerous products he sells than is the first purchaser for use. If the defect is one that is traceable to the manufacturer, the retailer may be more likely to get acceptance of financial responsibility without litigation than is the consumer purchaser. If the manufacturer is insolvent or is a corporation that has been dissolved, or if the defect is one that is not traceable to the manufacturer, the loss is one that can best be borne by the retailer as a cost of doing business.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\"> In <em>Simpkins, supra, </em>the court held that an employee could not use the dual-capacity doctrine to reach an employer who had manufactured and provided a defective mobile hoist, not for public use or sale but solely for use by company employees. The court found the key to determining whether the doctrine was applicable is if the employer\u2019s status as a manufacturer generates obligations unrelated to those from his employer status. The court held that the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy fell under workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\"> If an employer could be held liable in tort for such work-related injuries, absurd consequences could result. For example, a hardware store would have to purchase brand X hammers for public sale and brand Y hammers for use by its employees to avoid dual-capacity liability as a dealer. In this case, appellee would have had to purchase one brand of fertilizer for use by its greenhouse workers and purchase another brand for public sale to avoid work-related tort exposure to its employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
