The indictment and charge of the court appear to be in conformity with law. Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was based upon alleged misconduct of the jury, and it appears that evidence was heard by the trial court in support of this motion. In order for us to properly decide whether a correct decision was had upon such hearing it has always been held necessary for the evidence adduced to be presented here by statement of - facts or bill of exceptions. There appears in the record what purports to be a statement of facts he/ard by the trial court, but same was filed long after the expiration of the trial term and for that reason cannot be considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">No error appearing in the record, the# judgment of the trial court will be affirmed. . ...</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
