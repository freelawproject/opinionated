An indictment for the possession of intoxicating liquor under the present law can be maintained only where the possession is for the purpose of sale. The insufficiency of the indictment charging the offense of which the appellant is convicted requires that the cause be reversed and the prosecution dismissed. See Francis v. State, 90 Texas Crim.
