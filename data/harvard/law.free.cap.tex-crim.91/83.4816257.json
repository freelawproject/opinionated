confined in the penitentiary in pursuance of said sentences and their paroles havnig been revoked that they are legally bound to complete the serving of such sentences, it is therefore unanimously resolved and ordered by the Board of Prison Commissioners of the State of Texas that each of said convicts be retaken in custody and returned to the penitentiary to complete his respective term in accordance with the order, judgment and sentence of the court on file; it being hereby further unanimously ordered that such warrants, orders, notices or instructions as may be legally necessary be forwarded to the sheriffs of the various counties in which such paroled convicts are now located, directing and authorizing such sheriffs to take and retain said convicts in their custody until such time as they may be delivered to duly authorized agent or agents of the State penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of order duly adopted at a regular meeting of the Board of Prison Commissioners of the State of Texas, held in its offices at Huntsville, Texas, on the 2nd day of July, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Given under my hand and

F. Wolff</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">Secretary, Board of Prison Commissioners, State of Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">A warrant was issued for the arrest of relator and his recommitment to the penitentiary as under his said sentence, and from eus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tody under said warrant he seeks relief in the present proceeding. In an agreed statement of facts accompanying the application appear the rules of the Prison Commission in regard to parole, from which we learn that if a paroled prisoner desires to change his employment or residence, he must first make application in writing to the Prison Commissioners and obtain their consent to such change; also that any paroled prisoner shall be liable to be retaken and returned to the penitentiary for any reason deemed sufficient to the Prison Commission; also that no application for parole will be considered unless the applicant has served the minimum time fixed by law for his punishment for the crime for which he was convicted. Prom said agreed statement it also appears that relator worked for said Bedford but a few days after his release and had made a number of changes of employment, none of which had been reported to the Prison Commission and to none of which they had given their consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">As we understand the certificate of Acting Secretary of State, C. W. Payne, and the statement of Mr. Singletary, Chief Clerk of the Criminal Records Department of the State Penitentiary,\u2014both of which appear in said statement of facts, the record shows no recommendation by the Prison Commission, of the parole of relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The parole statutes of this State appear in Chapter 4, Title 12 of Vernon\u2019s Crim. Proc. We observe that .Article 1057C thereof forbids consideration of a parole for a convict till he has served the minimum time fixed by his sentence; and that Article 1057A states as conditions to the granting of a parole, that the prisoner shall be subject to the provisions of this Act and to the regulations and conditions which may be made by the Prison Commission; Article 1057H authorizes a majority of the Prison Commission, if they have reasonable cause to believe a prisoner has .violated his parole, etc., to issue a warrant for him and have him returned to the penitentiary ; Article 1057B provides that during the life of the parole, the prisoner shall be subject to be taken back at any time as under the original sentence, \u201cbut such retaking shall be at the direction of the Governor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Relator raises the question of the constitutionality of the parole law, which matter we discuss no further than to say that any part thereof wherein the right and power of the Chief Executive to grant' reprives, commutations and pardons under the terms of See. 11, Article 4 of our Constitution, is in anywise abridged or infringed, would be held by us to be unconstitutional; but such parts of said parole law as prescribe rules and regulations for the action of the Prison Commission in dealing with the prisoners and their duties, which do 'not abridge or infringe said rights of the Governor above mentioned, would be upheld by us. No particular part of said law being here assailed, further than as just stated, we do not feel called upon at this time to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Irrespective of the question of constitutionality, we are of opinion that by reason of his reference thereto in the parole granted herein, and his having expressly made such grant conditioned as under the law and rules of the Prison Commission, the Governor thereby granted,\u2014and the relator accepted,\u2014said parole with the parole statutes and the rules of the Prison Commission relating thereto, as much a part of same as if they had been written therein at length. We are of opinion that in the exercise of executive clemency to one convicted of a felony, the Governor may impose such conditions as he sees fit, and this may be done by direct expression or by reference and implication, and_ as has often been said, it is only when the conditions are illegal, immoral or impossible of performance, that any question concerning them can be raised in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">If then Governor Hobby granted and relator accepted, a parole containing a condition that the prisoner might at any time be retaken as under the original sentence, and that such retaking was to be under the direction of the Governor, and it further appear that the Governor has directed that such prisoner be retaken, and a warrant has been issued by virtue of such direction, and the prisoner retaken thereunder,\u2014 we see no reason to believe that such restraint violates any rights of such prisoner, the relator in the instant case. We do not think it necessary that the question of whether relator had violated the terms of his parole, be passed upon by the courts in any case wherein the conditions of the grant make the determination of their violation and the reincareeration of the prisoner, a matter for the Governor, or the Prison Commission and the Govern- or. This question has often been considered and discussed by various courts of last resort in this and other states and the nation, and the conclusion seems universal that by whatever name the grant of relief may be called, its exercise by the authority clothed by the Constitution with such power, if conditional, must be construed by all parties affected according to said conditions. If the terms of the grant, expressly or by necessary implication, make any other authority than the courts the arbiters of the question as to when the conditions of the grant have been violated, then the prisoner\u2019s quarrel lies not with the courts for refusing to assume jurisdiction but with the Governor when he made the terms of the grant, and the prisoner himself when he accepted them.
