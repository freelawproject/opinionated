The punishment fixed by statute for burglary of a private residence is by confinement in the penitentiary for any term of years, not less than five. The record is before us without a statement of facts or any bill of exceptions, and the indictment seems to correctly charge burglary of a private residence as aforesaid. The charge of the court presented the issues of law applicable to said offense. There appearing no error in the indictment, or in the charge of the court, and there being before us nothing else for our consideration, .the judgment of the trial court will be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
