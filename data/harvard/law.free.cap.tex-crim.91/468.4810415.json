While walking on the road, she met the appellant, and after passing, he spoke to her. Prom her testimony, we quote the following: \u201cI turned my face towards him, and he hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off of me since he came, called me. He fixed his eyes at my face and never batted them. I turned my face. He had one hand in readiness to grab me, and had the other hand about his pocket. When he says: \u2018Old Miss,\u2019 I turned, my face, thinking he wanted a job. He says: \u2018How about getting a piece?\u2019 I says: \u2018What did you say?\u2019 He repeated it. I'says: \u2018Negro, I am not afraid of you, I am protected. There is a white man on the shelled road that will protect me. \u2019 He looked down towards the shelled road. Ha says: \u2018Who?\u2019 \u2018Where?\u2019 I says: \u2018He stepped just behind a clump of bushes; come go with me, I will show him to you.\u2019 He says: \u2018I am not going up there where there is any white man.\u2019 I says: \u2018Yes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>you are; if you don\u2019t want to take my word for it, you come go with me. \u2019 He made off through the woods. \u2019 \u2019 The lady, on meeting friends, showed indication of excitement and distress on account of the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The appellant, a negro boy, about twenty-three years of age, was apprehended and whipped. Testifying he admitted seeing the lady, but denied any assault or insulting words or conduct. The occurrence took place about five o \u2019clock in the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">It was charged that the assault was to rape by force. To sustain the State\u2019s case, it must appear from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant made an assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of the prosecutrix by the use of such force as might reasonably be necessary to overcome resistance, taking into consideration the relative strength of the parties and the surrounding circumstances. It is essential that a specific intent to commit rape be established by the testimony and it must <em>go </em>beyond the mere possibility of such intent. Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. Penal Code, Secs. 1700 and 1701, and cases listed. Illustrating the application of this rule, there will be found in Vernon\u2019s Texas Crim. Statutes, Vol. 1, p. 607, note 15, numerous cases in which the evidence has been held insufficient to support the conviction. Cases upon a similar state of facts are found in Dina v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 402; Ross v. State, 78 S. W. Rep., 503. See also Barnes v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 501 Armstead v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 477; Collins v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The fact that the conduct attributed to the appellant was atrocious and merited punishment cannot take the place of proof establishing the elements of an assault with intent to rape. This court is not justified in sanctioning a conviction where the evidence falls short of the requirements contemplated by the statute defining the offense. Dockery v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Deeming the facts revealed insufficient to support the conviction of assault with intent to rape, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
