The party had been conveyed to the scene of the crime in appellant\u2019s automobile and at the time the fatal shot was fired, he was about one hundred feet away, the engine of his car running, and in waiting to aid his co-conspirators in making their escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">There is other testimony to the effect that while the deceased was in his sleeping-room at his place of business, he was killed, and circumstances were developed corroborative of appellant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">We are not prepared to say that the evidence was not of sufficient cogency to support the conclusion reached by the trial judge to the effect that a capital offense had been committed and that appellant acted therein as a principal offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
