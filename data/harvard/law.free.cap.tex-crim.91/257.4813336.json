The indictment in the instant case does not contain such allegation. We have held that for failure to allege that the possession was for the purpose of sale, an indictment attempting to charge this offense is fatally defective. That being true in the instant case, the judgment must be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
