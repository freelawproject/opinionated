A part of the property was found in the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>sion of Mrs. Francis Hawes at San Marcos, Texas. The remainder was recovered from the premises of Earl Allison, situated about six miles from the city of Cameron in Milam County. When recovered, a part of the property was in suit-cases in the attic of Allison\u2019s house and a part of it was buried in the ground some distance therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">It was the theory of the State, supported by testimony, that the offense was committed by the appellant, Mike Nichols, Bryant Walker, and Raymond Allison; that Raymond was a brother of Earl Allison and dwelled at the same place. Circumstances were relied upon to establish the State\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The appellant resided in Rogers, Bell County, Texas, and was arrested in the state of Oklahoma. From appellant\u2019s testimony, it appears that he went in liis automobile to Thorndale on the 14th of December in company with Bryant Walker, Hugh Walker, and Raymond Allison; that Raymond Allison stopped at Cameron, the remainder of the party going to Thorndale.for the purpose of gambling with cards; that following this, appellant, leaving Bryant and Hugh Walker at Thorndale in his automobile, proceeded to Rogers, reaching there about 10:30 at night, going to his mother\u2019s,home; that on the next day, Bryant Walker and Raymond Allison went in appellant\u2019s car to Taylor, he following them on the train at night. That night Raymond Allison, Bryant Walker and Francis Hawes came to Cameron, on the way passing through Thorndale at night. On reaching Cameron, they went to a cafe where appellant left Bryant Walker, Allison and Mrs. Hawes. They said they were going to a hotel. Appellant left his car with them. The next morning, he met them in the car and all went to see Mrs. Fisher, Raymond Allison\u2019s girl, who lived near the home of Earl and Raymond Allison, where the party stopped. While there, they did not remain in company with each other all the time. When appellant went in the house, he found Bryant Walker, Raymond Allison and Mrs. Hawes with some suit-eases and some hand-bags and dry-goods, all being new merchandise. On reaching the home of Mrs. Fisher, Raymond Allison and Francis Hawes got out of the car, and later joined appellant and Walker. The party proceeded to Rogers and then went to the country for a couple of girls,\u2014one; for appellant \u25a0 and one for Raymond Allison,\u2014and brought them back to Rogers. On the following morning, Allison and appellant returned with the two girls and -upon returning, were informed by Bryant Walker that they were in danger of getting in trouble about some whisky; that, anticipating trouble about the whisky, they went to Oklahoma and sent Mrs. Hawes from Temple by rail. They stayed at Drumwright, Oklahoma. Appellant while there, assumed a different name, rented a room and spent the night. The \u2022next morning they drove to town in the ear and were arrested. After making bond, appellant went to San Marcos and proposed to marry Francis Hawes, he having been thrown in such bad light as to make it difficult to extricate himself; and he, understanding that a wife could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>not testify against him, sought to marry her. She refused to marry him.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">Appellant denied that he took part in the burglary, though he was present when the goods were exhibited at Allison\u2019s house; that they were exhibited by Bryant Walker; that he saw Walker give Mrs. Hawes a cloak.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Mrs. Francis Hawes testified that she had married in 1918; that she had separated from her husband; that while working in a Harvey House in Oklahoma she met Bryant Walker and became engaged to marry him; that on the 15th of December, he called her over long distance telephone and she went to Taylor, where she was met by Bryant Walker and Raymond Allison; that they went to Thrall and back to Taylor after the Appellant; that they all rode in an Essex car and went to Thrall and from there to Cameron; that she and Walker and Allison went to a hotel; that she did not know where appellant went, but he said he was going to see Gladys. Mrs. Hawes and Walker registered as husband and wife,\u2014Mr. and Mrs. McVey. Allison occupied a room across the hall. She described the trip on the following morning over to see Allison\u2019s girl, and to the home of Raymond Allison and his brother Earl, and said that there certain merchandise was exhibited and a cloak given to her; that they returned to Rogers; that Allison and appellant went and brought some women; that she went from Rogers to San Marcos; that appellant had sought her at San Marcos and proposed to marry her; that his attorney accompanied him on some of the occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Earl Allison testified that the stolen goods were put in his house on the night of December 14th by some one, whom he supposed to be his brother Raymond.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">To the testimony that Mrs. Hawes and Walker registered at the hotel as man and wife; that appellant said he was going down to see Gladys, and that on the following morning they went down passed the depot and stock yards to a white house over across the railroads after the appellant, there was objection made!. That touching the last referred to was that it was a matter of common knowledge that the white house was one of ill repute. The bill, as qualified, shows there was no evidence that it was of such repute. Touching the other matters .complained of in the bills, substantially the same facts are revealed by appellant\u2019s testimony. That being true, complaint of its repetition from other sources without objection is untenable. Wagner v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep. 306, and cases cited. From appellant\u2019s testimony and from the testimony of Francis Hawes, it is obvious that the jury could not have failed to have understood that she was a paramour of Walker; that they spent the night together at the hotel. We Fail to comprehend the importance of the additional fact that they registered at the hotel as man and wife. They were associates of the appellant, and from his own testimony and from that of Mrs. Hawes, not complained of, the relation of the parties was made clear, as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>also appellant's knowledge of it, According to Ms own testimony, he and Raymond Allison, each wanting a girl, had procured them at Rogers. We fail to understand why appellant\u2019s case would have been tainted with prejudice by the knowledge given the jury of the fact that his companions\u2014Mrs. Hawes and Walker\u2014had held themselves out as husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Mrs. Hawes, in relating the fact that appellant and Allison went to the country and brought in some girls, also revealed the fact that they brought some corn whisky along. This was promptly withdrawn and the court instructed the jury to ignore it. Appellant, in his own testimony, explained his flight to Oklahoma by claiming that he was fearful of trouble in connection with some whisky. There was, in our opinion, no harmful error. Miller v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Complaint is made of the receipt in evidence of the testimony of Francis Hawes to the effect that appellant had proposed to marry her. In connection with the proposal, he made to her declarations from which the jury might have justly drawn the inference that his object was to render her testimony unavailable to the State. This appeared also from his own testimony to the effect that he knew that if she was his wife, she could not give\" evidence against him. We regard the testimony as admissible under the rule permitting proof of effort to suppress testimony. Underhill on Crim. Evidence, Sec. 264; Cyc. of Law &amp; Proc., Vol. 12, p. 386; Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas Penal Code, p. 93. It was also available to the State as a fact showing consciousness of guilt. Underhill on Grim. Evidence, See. 115. The same testimony also came voluntarily from the appellant. Having proved the same fact, he is not in a position to complain of its proof by the State. Wagner v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">After appellant was arrested and while he was in jail in Oklahoma, an officer went for him and brought him to Texas. This officer, as a witness, testified that appellant, while in Oklahoma, went under the name of Collins. Upon his making this statement, counsel for appellant, with the permission of the court, interrogated the officer touching his means of knowledge, and the office/r said that he saw on the register in the jail the name: \u201cMike Nichols, alias R. N. Collins;\u201d that he supposed it was made by the jail clerk. The court refused to exclude the testimony. Granting that it should have been excluded, as secondary or hearsay evidence, we think the failure to do so was not error which justified a reversal of the judgment. Appellant testified that while in Oklahoma, he/ used an assumed name. At the time of his arrest, there were found in his possession two letters which he admitted writing, and which he had prepared for mailing, signed R. N. Collins. In view of this evidence to the effect that he was using the name of Collins, the additional fact that it was written upon the jail record would not vitiate/ the conviction. Against this testimony the argument is made that it tended to discredit the appellant and prejudice the case before the jury because it was a jail record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>and from it the jury might draw the inference that he was an habitual criminal. Considering the fact that he was arrested and in jail, charged with the present offense, and that it was proved by other evidence that he was using the assumed name of Collins, we think the point is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In the record, there is a copy of some proffered special charges. In the accepted hill of exceptions it is declared by the trial judge that there was neither written nor verbal exception to his refusal of the charges. Our statute makes it necessary that the refusal of a special charge be made the subject of exception in order to entitle the ruling to review. We will add that, in our opinion, if properly presented, the refusal of the charges was not error. Acts of 33rd Leg., p. 278;. Barrios v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep. 550, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The court instructed thus: \u201cIf the evidence raises in your mind a reasonable doubt as to the presence of the defendant at the time and place when and where said property was fraudulently taken from Gus Newton, if you find same was taken, you will find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The charge on alibi, which we have quoted, is in language heretofore approved in Gallaher v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 278, and is in substance the same as many others which have been sanctioned. See. Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas Penal Code, Sec. 52. The charge on circumstantial evidence, we think, is in full accord with approved precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In a brief and argument showing research and zeal, appellant\u2019s counsel insists that the enhanced penalty was the result of discrediting facts improperly admitted. The competency of evidence tending to show appellant\u2019s flight and his efforts to suppress testimony was obviously relevant. His movement after the offense was committed is inextricably interwoven with that of his chosen associates. If, in proving the flight, there was developed discrediting incidents, they appeared but res gestae of the flight and corroborative of the accomplice witness. The cases to which appellant refers are those in which matters tending to discredit, the accused, disconnected from or collateral to the relevant facts,.have been held reversible error. See Roquemore v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep. 568, 129 S. W. Rep. 1123. The incidents, the admission of which appellant complains, are, as we have pointed out, of a different type. Moreover, as indicated above, the same facts were revealed by evidence admitted without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We do not find any error in the record that would warrant a disturbance of the verdict. ' \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b311-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">March 15,1922.</p>\n<author id=\"b311-4\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqS\">\u2014In his motion for rehearing counsel for appellant takes the following two quotations from our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cGranting that it should have been excluded as secondary or hearsay evidence, we think the failure to do so was not error which justified a reversal of the judgment. Appellant testified that while in Oklahoma he used an assumed name. At the time of his arrest, there were found in his possession two letters which he admitted writing and which he had prepared for mailing, signed R M. Collins. In view of this evidence to the effect that he was using the; name of Collins, the additional fact that it was written upon the jail record did not vitiate the conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201cThey stayed at Drumwright, Oklahoma. Appellant while there assumed a different name, rented a room and spent the night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Counsel then asserts that \u201ceither the court or appellant\u2019s counsel has not read this record correctly and <em>challenges </em>the court to examine the record and find that the/se quotations are not borne out by the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">It is scarcely necessary for counsel in any case to <em>challenge </em>this court to verify any conclusion it reaches as to the facts or as to the correctness of any proposition of law stated. Notwithstanding the vast press of work now upon the court if we should make a mistake as to the facts or law, no attorney however interested he may be in his client, can have a greater desire that such error be corrected than the members of this court. From page forty-two of the statement of facts we quote: \u201cWe went to Temple and put Francis on the train there and all three of us got in the car and went to. Drumwright, Oklahoma. ... I had been there before; I stayed in Drumwright and the oil fields around there practically three years. I had worked all over the oil fields, I was pretty well known. I went under my own name. I used an assumed name one time. I was not known under the name of R N. Collins. After we got there we went to the Bly rooming house, the place we had stayed at before when we were there and rented a room and paid for it a week. It was rather late when we got there, but we went up town a little while and fooled around a little and went back and went to be)d. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The foregoing is from appellant\u2019s testimony on direct examination. From page fifty of the statement of facts on his cross-examination we quote as follows: \u201cI was arrested in Drumwright on Tuesday morning. ... I dont think anybody knew where I was back home ... I did not state I went under an assumed name once. He (Lyles) asked me if I went under, the name of R N. Collins, and I said one time. That was in a letter I wrote on this trip, that was a letter I wrote to my brother. I did not give my name in to the chief of police of Drumwright as R N. Collins. I do not know how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>he got that name on the register. I wrote my brother and asked him to see how everything was there. I told him there was a couple of detectives in town the day we left and we left in a hurry. \u2022 . . . I knew if they were watching and my brother sent me anything in my own name that they could follow it. Those letters were in my pocket when I was arrested, the chief of police got them. . . .1 wrote to Miss Gregory and my brother, Tom Nichols. . . . That R. N. Collins, I wrote that; they are to Tom Nichols and Hattie Gregory. I think those are the letters I wrote December 20th, 1920. The letter could have been changed; I believe it is my handwriting, I am not for sure. I thought you had those letters; I knew the chief of police took them off of me before I mailed them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The State introduced a letter addressed to Tom Nichols, Rogers, Texas, dated Drumwright, Oklahoma, December 20, 1920, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\n<em>\u201cDear Bro</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">\u201cWill try and write a few lines am getting along pretty well.

They are a spot light in my trunk that goes on the wind shield of a car send it too. Tell mama I will write her in a few days that didn\u2019t think it necessary to write both at the same time.
