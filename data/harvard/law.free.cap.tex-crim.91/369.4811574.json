After the trial judge prepared his charge, attorneys representing appellant prepared three special charges and requested that they be given, and upon the court\u2019s refusal to submit the same reserved proper exceptions thereto, stating their reasons in the bills why such charges should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">There was no error in the court\u2019s refusal to submit the first special charge, which was a peremptory direction to the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. We believe!, however, the second special charge requested should have been given. It was as follows: \u201cNow if you believe the plaintiff has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant resided, at the time alleged, in Calhoun County, Texas, then you will acquit the defendant and so say by your verdict.\u201d This was on the pivotal issue in the case and the one upon which the great conflict of evidence arose. The manner in which this issue was submitted in the court\u2019s charge makes it the more' important that the special charge should have been given. After having told the jury that they must believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully practiced medicine for pay without having a verification license from a State Medical Examining Board of the State of Texas, the charge proceeds as follows: \u201cand further without having same recorded in the district clerk\u2019s office of the County of Calhoun, in which County the said defendant, Dr. Jim Woodson, then and there resided,\u201d they will find the defendant guilty, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We do not deem it necessary to set out at length the conflicting testimony with reference to the residence of appellant, but that issue being so closely drawn we think the special charge should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause! remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
