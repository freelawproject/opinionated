The indictment charged murder by the use of firearms in the usual form. The charge of the court submitted murder, manslaughter and self-defense in accordance with what seems to be settled procedure. A special charge asking that the jury be instructed not to consider certain argument of the State\u2019s attorney, presents no error upon which we can base any conclusion in the absence of a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of the facts necessary in order that such error might appear. The recitals of the special charge itself cannot be taken as evidencing error in the absence of a bill of exceptions setting forth the surroundings, or such statement of facts as would make it appear erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the lower court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
