Rep. 622, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">1 \u2018 That if one take hold of a child under fifteen years of age and handle her in such manner as under the circumstances of the particular case demonstrates a present intent to at once so subject her to his power, she consenting or not, as that he may now accomplish the act of intercourse, he would be guilty of the offense, but if, as we view the facts in the case, he has gone no further than placing his hand upon. her with the probable, and we think you might say the evident, intent to detain her and make further solicitation, notwithstanding her refusal, yet having in his mind a hope that if she could be induced to remain he might persuade her, we say, going no further than this, the appellant would not be guilty of assault to rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In view of these declarations, interpreting the statute upon which the offense is founded, the charge quoted falls short of giving the . jury an adequate guide to determine whether the appellant had made the kind of assault which would render him guilty of an assault with intent to rape. The charge does not limit their inquiry to \u201ca present intent to at once subject her to his power, she consenting or not.\u201d Under the charge, the jury might have found him guilty though believing that his acts related to a future and not a present intent and that they went to the extent of solicitation only. Such is adverted to in the quotation above, wherein the court says: \u201cWe do not understand that it is an assault to rape if one forcibly detain a girl and .compel her to hear solicitations to have intercourse at a time in the future.\u201d (Cromeans v. State, supra.) See also Armstead v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep. 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">We think there was no evidence raising the issue as to the want of chastity of the prosecutrix, but we regard the charge complained of as erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">For that reason we order the judgment of the trial court reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
