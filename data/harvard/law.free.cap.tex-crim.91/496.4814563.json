We have uniformly held that it is necessary that the indictment contain an allegation that such possession is for the purpose of sale. There being no such charge in the instant case, the indictment is fatally defective, and it becomes necessary to order a reversal and that the prosecution be dismissed, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
