Gambling house and gaming house, as used in this law, is meant any place where people resort for the purpose of gaming, betting or wagering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-17\">All gambling at games played with dice are prohibited by another section, namely, Art. 567. See Knowles v. State, 67 Texas Crim. Rep. 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-18\">The State\u2019s theory, sustained by the evidence, is that various persons were playing games with dice and betting money in a certain restaurant and that appellant went into the house and remained as \u25a0an onlooker, but did not participate in the game. As we understand this construction of the statute, the evidence supports the conviction. Renfro v. State, 82 Texas Crim. Rep. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">The court\u2019s reasoning in the last-mentioned ease is that inasmuch as betting at a game played with dice is unlawful wherever played, it is likewise unlawful for one to remain in any place where such betting is going on. The case of Walters v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep. 240, is distinguished upon the ground that the game there in question was not unlawful nor in an unlawful place. To gamble with cards unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>it was in a gambling house or one resorted to for gambling purposes is not prohibited. Penal Code, Title 11, Chap. 4. With games of dice, there is no such limitation. Scott v. State, 69 Texas Crim. Rep. 615. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
