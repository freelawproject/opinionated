Appellant made a motion to quash the indictment based on the fact that by the constitutional amendment adopted May 24, 1919, and made effective by proclamation July 3, 1919, that the section of our Constitution under which local option statutes were voted into existence, was repealed, and that consequently there was no such local option law in existence when this indictment was returned and at the date of the charge therein laid. The exact question was discussed and decided in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>appellant\u2019s contention in Cone v. State, 90 Texas Crim.
