This state law claim presents issues of first impression best resolved by Florida state courts. Because the district court may decide not to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over that state law claim, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dated January 21, 2005 (Docket #23) and the district court\u2019s order dated March 8, 2005 (Docket # 26), certifying that January 2005 order for appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and remand this case for further proceedings in the district court in light of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-24\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-18\">. While the district court\u2019s March 8, 2005 order refers to its January 21, 2005 order as its January 23, 2005 order, it is clear from that docket sheet that the order certified is the January 21, 2005 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
