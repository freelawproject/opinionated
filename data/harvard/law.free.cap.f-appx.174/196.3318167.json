Meraz contends that the enhancement of her sentence for \u201creckless endangerment\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5) was unreasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>she was not charged with reckless endangerment, she did not admit reckless endangerment, and the facts supporting the enhancement were not proved to the jury. She further asserts that the district court\u2019s failure to make factual findings and the lack of any clear record supporting the enhancement renders the sentence unreasonable and requires remand for resen-tencing. Similarly, she contends that remand is required because the district court failed to make required factual findings regarding its denial of her request for a minor role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Meraz\u2019s arguments are without merit. As Meraz was sentenced after the decision in <em>Booker, </em>there was no requirement that any sentencing facts be charged, admitted, or proved to a jury; the district court was free to make factual findings in the same manner as before <em>Booker. See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Further, as the Government correctly points out, the district court expressly adopted the findings of the Presentence Report in its Statement of Reasons. Adoption of the PSR is appropriate. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>283 F.3d 300, 314 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1231 (5th Cir.1994). Meraz makes no argument to the contrary, other than a conclusory assertion that the district court did not make required factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
