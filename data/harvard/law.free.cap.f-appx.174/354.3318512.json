This represented an upward departure under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), from the advisory Guidelines imprisonment range of 4-10 months. On appeal, Ocampo-Discua\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We conclude that the sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Dalton, </em>404 F.3d 1029, 1032 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review). The district court relied on the numerous times that Ocampo-Discua had previously been deported, as well as certain aspects of his criminal history, factors which were appropriate for the district court to consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2) and which justify the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\">.
