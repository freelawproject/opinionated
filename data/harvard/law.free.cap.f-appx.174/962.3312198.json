The Magoffin District Court ordered Doe, who was sixteen years old at the time of the events surrounding this case, to complete community service at the Magoffin County Courthouse. Doe alleges that she was under the supervision of defendant Paul Hudson Salyer, the Magoffin County Judge Executive,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Lloyd Monk Patton, the custodian of the courthouse. In July 2001, Patton sexually assaulted and raped Doe at the courthouse. Patton was later found guilty of rape in criminal proceedings. Although Doe has settled her civil claim against Patton, she has not settled her claims against the Magoffin County Fiscal Court and against Salyer, in both his individual and official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to all claims. Ultimately, the district court accurately summarized this case: \u201cPatton\u2019s alleged acts are <em>reprehensible </em>and <em>unconscionable. </em>Whether Ma-goffin County and Salyer, however, are responsible for the alleged acts is another matter.\u201d JA 183. Doe\u2019s federal claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 fail because Doe has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to her constitutional rights in their hiring and supervising of Patton. Doe\u2019s state-law claims fail because sovereign or official immunity shields the defendants from suit. Finally, the fact that Doe provided an affidavit of an expert witness declaring that he believed that the defendants were negligent and deliberately indifferent does not create any genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b987-19\">Jan Doe was sixteen years old when Magoffin District Court Judge Terry Ja<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>cobs ordered her to perform community service at the Magoffin County Courthouse. Doe alleges that she was assigned to work for Lloyd Monk Patton, the courthouse janitor. In July 2001, Patton sexually assaulted Doe by forcing her to touch his exposed penis. About an hour later, he locked her in the courthouse\u2019s jury room during a recess in court proceedings and raped her. Patton was later convicted of first degree rape, and he is currently serving a sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Paul Hudson Salyer, the Magoffin County Judge Executive, hired Patton as the courthouse\u2019s custodian with the unanimous approval of the Magoffin County Fiscal Court. Salyer and his wife Marcella, who served as Deputy County Judge Executive, were Patton\u2019s supervisors. Salyer testified that the Magoffin County Clerk asked him to hire Patton. The county clerk told Salyer that Patton had \u201cbeen [working at the courthouse for] six months without pay and he\u2019s done an excellent job and he hadn\u2019t drank [sic] any in two years.\u201d JA 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Salyer also testified that he was unaware that Patton had a criminal record prior to Doe\u2019s lawsuit. Neither the Ma-goffin County Fiscal Court nor Salyer verified whether Patton had a criminal background. The defendants submitted an affidavit from paralegal Crystal Tucker. Tucker declared that she had performed a criminal search regarding Patton, and \u201cat the time there were no convictions of any violent crimes regarding Mr. Patton in this criminal search.\u201d JA 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Salyer testified that he had never performed a criminal-background check on any employee. Dr. Charles Hardin, the former Magoffin County Judge Executive, was also deposed. He testified that he had never performed formal criminal-background checks when in office because \u201cmost people in a small community are pretty well known to the people of that community.\u201d JA 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">After Doe filed her lawsuit, Salyer learned of Patton\u2019s criminal record. Patton told Salyer that Patton had served a term of imprisonment for attempted arson. Salyer also learned that in the mid-1990s Patton had assaulted Dr. Hardin on Founder\u2019s Day by hitting Hardin over the head with a liquor bottle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Salyer had run against Hardin three times for the office of Judge Executive. Salyer also testified that he knew that Patton had been banned at some point from the courthouse, but Salyer did not know why. Salyer testified that he would have hired Patton even if he had known of Patton\u2019s assault conviction. Patton continued working at the courthouse after Doe accused Patton of raping her.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Salyer testified that Patton had \u201cat one time\u201d supervised prisoners in the courthouse with Salyer\u2019s approval. JA 297. Salyer earlier testified, however, that \u201c[Patton] was the janitor and we would just send him out there to help. We didn\u2019t give him no authority to supervise anyone. He was supposed to show them what to do and if they done it or if they didn\u2019t do it.\u201d JA 296. Salyer testified that he was unaware that the district court was ordering juveniles to complete community service at the courthouse and that Patton was supervising juveniles. Judge Jacobs, who ordered Doe to complete her community ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>vice at the courthouse, declared that he did not know that Patton supervised juveniles in the courthouse and that, based on his prior knowledge of Patton, he would not have consented to Patton\u2019s supervising juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Doe filed her complaint in federal district court. She brought federal and state claims concerning the hiring and supervising of Patton. She named Patton, in both his individual and official capacities, and the Magoffin County Fiscal Court as defendants. She also asserted state-law claims of assault, battery, and outrageous conduct. Over a year later, Doe amended her complaint to add claims against Salyer in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as County Judge Executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. Doe filed a response and memorandum opposing summary judgment. She included in her motion an affidavit from Joseph Smith. Smith had previously been appointed by United States District Judge Joseph M. Hood as an expert witness in a case concerning allegedly discriminatory hiring practices in another Kentucky county. Smith declared that, after reviewing relevant depositions and affidavits, he found it unconscionable that Salyer did not know that Patton was supervising juveniles. He also stated that he believed that the failure to complete a criminal-background check played a \u201csubstantial role in causing harm to the juvenile.\u201d JA 147. He declared that Salyer\u2019s entrusting of a female juvenile to a custodian with a criminal background was in \u201cwanton disregard of the rights of the juvenile.\u201d JA 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court, referring to <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997), held that Doe\u2019s federal hiring and supervising claims failed as a matter of law because Patton\u2019s criminal background did not make it \u201cplainly obvious\u201d that Patton would commit rape. The district court next held that, under Kentucky law, sovereign immunity barred Doe\u2019s state-law claims against the Magof-fin County Fiscal Court and Salyer in his official capacity. Finally, the court held that Salyer was entitled to official qualified immunity under Kentucky law for the state-law claims against him in his individual capacity because he performed his discretionary functions in good faith. The district court did not mention the affidavit of Joseph Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">Doe then filed a motion to reconsider. Doe primarily asked the district court to consider (for the first time) <em>Yanero v. Davis, </em>65 S.W.3d 510 (Ky.2002), the case in which the Supreme Court of Kentucky discussed all forms of immunity recognized by federal and state law. In <em>Yanero, </em>the state supreme court recognized that, under Kentucky law, there is a narrow exception to the rule that hiring decisions are discretionary. The supreme court noted that public officers, when sued in their individual capacities, have a ministerial duty not to hire employees who are \u201cincompetent to perform the task for which [they were] hired.\u201d <em>Yanero, </em>65 S.W.3d at 528. The district court held that <em>Yanero </em>did not compel the district court to alter any of its original findings. Patton was competent to serve as a janitor, and his occasional supervision of others was not \u201cthe task for which he was hired.\u201d JA 209. The district court also held that Salyer\u2019s supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>sion of Patton was not ministerial because Salyer was not bound by any statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Doe next moved the district court to set aside judgment. Doe pointed to Marcella Salyer\u2019s testimony during Patton\u2019s criminal trial, which took place after entry of judgment in Doe\u2019s civil action. During the criminal trial, Marcella Salyer referred to Doe as a \u201clittle girl,\u201d and described an incident when, in Patton\u2019s presence, she saw Doe dressed and positioned provocatively. JA 239. She said that the encounter left her \u201cconcerned.\u201d JA 239. Doe noted in her motion that Marcella Salyer had not mentioned this encounter in her civil deposition. The district court held that this \u201cnew evidence\u201d did not alter its earlier holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Doe now appeals, and we have consolidated the three appeals that she filed from orders of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See United States v. Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d 797, 805 (6th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We must view the facts contained in the record and draw all inferences from the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). We cannot weigh the evidence or determine the truth of any matter in dispute, <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986), because this court determines only whether the case contains sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for the nonmoving party, <em>id. </em>at 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">With this standard in mind, we affirm. Doe\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims fail because Doe has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to her constitutional rights in hiring and supervising Patton. Doe\u2019s state-law claims for negligent hiring and supervision fail because sovereign or official immunity shields the defendants from these claims. Finally, because the affidavit from Joseph Smith offers only a short recitation of general facts and legal conclusions, it is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact and thereby preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">All of Doe\u2019s federal claims fail because she has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants acted with deliberate indifference when first hiring and then supervising Patton.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">As a preliminary matter, we shall assume that Patton, who is no longer a party to this suit, violated \u00a7 1983 by sexually assaulting and raping Doe and that he would not be entitled to qualified immunity. Section 1983 states, \u201cEvery person who, under color of [state law or custom] subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured....\u201d Assuming that Patton acted under color of state law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his sexual assault violated Doe\u2019s substantive due process right to bodily integrity. This court has previously held that \u201cno rational individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>could believe that sexual abuse by a state actor is constitutionally permissible under the Due Process Clause\u201d and that a citizen has <em>\u201ca </em>clearly established right under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause to personal security and to bodily integrity____\u201d <em>Doe v. Claiborne County, Tenn., </em>103 F.3d 495, 507 (6th Cir.1996). Therefore, we assume that Doe would have a cause of action against Patton under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">\n<em>1. Federal Hiring Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Although Patton may have been liable, the remaining defendants are not liable under \u00a7 1983 for Patton\u2019s transgressions. Doe\u2019s federal claims against the defendants regarding how Patton was hired fail as a matter of law because Patton\u2019s background did not make it \u201cplainly obvious\u201d that Patton would rape Doe. Doe cannot demonstrate that the fiscal court had a policy or custom in place that deprived her of her federal constitutional rights because she has not proffered any evidence to demonstrate that <em>\u201cthis </em>officer [Patton] was highly likely to inflict the <em>particular </em>injury suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 412, 117 S.Ct. 1382. Doe has also failed to demonstrate that Salyer, by hiring Patton, was deliberately indifferent to her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Municipalities cannot be held liable simply because they employ tortfeasors. <em>See Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 403, 117 S.Ct. 1382. In <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-10\">[A] municipality can be found hable under \u00a7 1983 only where the municipality <em>itself </em>causes the constitutional violation at issue. <em>Respondeat superior ... </em>will not attach under \u00a7 1983. It is only when the execution of the government\u2019s pohcy or custom ... inflicts the injury that the municipality may be held hable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989) (internal quotations and citations omitted). A pohcy or custom ensures that \u201ca municipahty is held liable only for those deprivations resulting from the decisions of its duly constituted legislative body or of those officials whose acts may fairly be said to be those of the municipahty.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 403-04, 117 S.Ct. 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">The Supreme Court has placed a heavy burden on plaintiffs seeking to impose municipal liability as a result of hiring decisions; the Court requires that the plaintiff demonstrate (1) sufficient fault in the form of \u201cdeliberate conduct\u201d and (2) a causal link between the alleged pohcy or custom and the injury. <em>See Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown </em>compels us to hold that Doe has failed to meet her heavy burden. In <em>Brown, </em>a sheriff hired a deputy who, in making an arrest, used excessive force by severely damaging the knee caps of an arrested person. The sheriff had not paid attention to the deputy\u2019s criminal record or driving record, both of which the sheriff had obtained, when he hired the deputy. The records revealed driving infractions and misdemeanor convictions for public drunkenness, assault, battery, and resisting arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02, 117 S.Ct. 1382. The parties agreed that the sheriff was the final policy maker for the Sheriffs Department. <em>Id. </em>at 401, 117 S.Ct. 1382. The Court held that the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the municipality failed as a matter of law because the sheriff and county were not deliberately indifferent to the plaintiffs federal constitutional rights. Adequate scrutiny of the deputy\u2019s background did not reveal that it would be \u201chighly likely\u201d that <em>\u201cthis </em>officer [would] inflict the <em>particular </em>injury suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 117 S.Ct. 1382. In other words, the deputy\u2019s convictions for assault, drunken<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>ness, and resisting arrest did not make it \u201cplainly obvious\u201d that the deputy would use excessive force. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 117 S.Ct. 1382. The Court stated that it was not enough that the deputy was an \u201cextremely poor candidate\u201d for his job. <em>See id. </em>at 414, 117 S.Ct. 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Like the municipality in <em>Brown, </em>the fiscal court is not liable because Doe cannot demonstrate that any policy or custom of the fiscal court in its hiring practices caused her constitutional injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Adequate scrutiny of Patton\u2019s criminal record would not reveal that it was highly likely that Patton would sexually assault a juvenile or lock her in a room against her will. First, the defendants submitted evidence, which Doe does not challenge with any record evidence, that Patton\u2019s criminal record does not reveal violent crimes. Second, the crimes with which Patton was allegedly charged do not demonstrate any propensity to commit sex crimes or to imprison someone. At most, the record demonstrates that Patton was convicted of vote fraud, attempted arson, and battery against a male politician while Patton was drunk. As in <em>Brown, </em>Patton may have been an \u201cextremely poor candidate\u201d for his job as custodian or even supervisor, <em>see Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 414, 117 S.Ct. 1382, but his convictions do not make it \u201cplainly obvious\u201d that Patton would commit sexual assault or falsely imprison someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Contrary to Doe\u2019s argument, Patton\u2019s battery of a man, even if characterized as a crime of violence, does not make it plainly obvious that Patton would commit rape. In <em>Brovm, </em>the deputy had convictions for assault and battery; nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that these convictions did not make it plainly obvious that the deputy would use excessive force. In Doe\u2019s case, Patton\u2019s prior battery against a man in the mid-1990s did not make it obvious that he would commit a sexual crime against a female years later. In light of <em>Brovm, </em>the mere fact that a prior crime and the later constitutional violation both include violence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the fiscal court was deliberately indifferent.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Doe\u2019s case is not salvaged by the fact that the fiscal court and the county judge executives never performed criminal-background checks on potential employees. The fact that the sheriff in <em>Brovm </em>normally performed background checks before hiring candidates arguably distinguishes this case from <em>Brovm. </em>It is also conceivable that a custom or policy of failing to perform criminal-background checks might amount to \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the particular constitutional rights of others if, immediately or over time, the consequences of failing to perform the background checks were known or obvious. <em>See Canton, </em>489 U.S. at 390 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1197. Doe has not pointed to any other instance in which the Magoffin County Fiscal Court\u2019s failure to perform background checks caused another to be deprived of his or her constitutional rights. Moreover, both Dr. Hardin and Salyer testified in their depositions that background checks were unnecessary because everyone knows everyone else in the county. The mere fact that one employee committed a crime does not demonstrate that Magoffin County\u2019s custom of not performing background cheeks was sime to lead to constitutional deprivations, especially when scrutiny of Patton\u2019s record would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>revealed that he was highly likely to commit rape or imprison someone. Because Doe has failed to demonstrate that any custom of the Magoffin County Fiscal Court was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the injury alleged, Doe\u2019s federal hiring-practices claims against the Magoffin County Fiscal Court and Salyer in his official capacity fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Finally, .Salyer is not liable in his individual capacity for his hiring practice because he was not deliberately indifferent to Doe\u2019s constitutional right to substantive due process. It is true that in <em>Brown </em>the claim against the sheriff in his individual capacity had been dismissed prior to trial and that issue had not b\u00e9en appealed. <em>See Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 401, 117 S.Ct. 1382. But it is clear that for suits both against municipalities and individual-capacity supervisors, \u201c[rjespondeat superior is not a proper basis for liability under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>McQueen v. Beecher Cmty. Sch., </em>433 F.3d 460, 470 (6th Cir.2006). Moreover, it is clear that negligence or recklessness is not enough to hold supervisors liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Doe, </em>103 F.3d at 513. Because the Supreme Court\u2019s concern in Brown\u2014 that municipalities not become vicariously liable\u2014is equally implicated when supervisors are sued in their individual capacities, <em>Brown\u2019s </em>analysis is relevant to Doe\u2019s claim against Salyer in his individual capacity. As with Doe\u2019s claims against the fiscal court and Salyer in his official capacity, Doe has not established that Salyer was deliberately indifferent to her rights in hiring Patton. Therefore, all of Doe\u2019s federal hiring-practices claims fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">\n<em>2. Federal Claims for Failure to Supervise</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">\n<em>a. Claims against the Fiscal Court and Salyer in his Official Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">From the briefs and complaint, it is unclear whether Doe brings a federal claim for failure to supervise against the fiscal court and Salyer in his official capacity. But even assuming that Doe brings federal claims for failure to supervise against these defendants, her claims fail as a matter of law. Doe neither identifies any policy or custom that she challenges, nor alleges that the fiscal court affirmatively condoned sexual abuse. <em>See Doe, </em>103 F.3d at 508. The only claim she conceivably has is that the fiscal court\u2019s custom of not supervising its employees amounted to deliberate indifference through inaction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Doe, nevertheless, has not satisfied the requirements for an \u201cinaction\u201d theory. To state a municipal liability claim under an \u201cinaction\u201d theory, Doe must establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-11\">(1) the existence of a clear and persistent pattern of sexual abuse by [fiscal court] employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-12\">(2) notice or constructive notice on the part of the [fiscal court];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-13\">(3) the [fiscal court\u2019s] tacit approval of the unconstitutional conduct, such that [its] deliberate indifference in [its] failure to act can be said to amount to an official policy of inaction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-14\">(4) that the [fiscal court\u2019s] custom was the \u201cmoving force\u201d or direct causal link in the constitutional deprivation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-15\"><em>Doe, </em>103 F.3d at 508. Doe cannot establish the first requirement of an inaction theory. Doe has not even alleged the existence of a pattern of sexual abuse, much less pointed to any evidence in the record, to reveal that a pattern existed. The only sexual abuse in evidence is Doe\u2019s rape. Therefore, whatever the nature of her federal claims for failure to supervise against the fiscal court and Salyer in his official capacity, Doe\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Furthermore, Doe\u2019s claims cannot survive under the theory that one event of sexual abuse is sufficient to establish that the fiscal court was deliberately indifferent. In <em>Canton, </em>the Supreme Court left open the possibility \u201cthat evidence of a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by a showing that a [fiscal court] failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an obvious potential for such a violation, could trigger municipal liability.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 409, 117 S.Ct. 1382. The Court in <em>Brown </em>later stated that one incident may be sufficient because \u201c[t]he high degree of predictability may ... support an inference of causation\u2014that the municipality\u2019s indifference led directly to the very consequence that was so predictable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409-10, 117 S.Ct. 1382. There is no basis to conclude on this record, however, that there was a \u201chigh degree of predictability\u201d that Patton or any other employee was likely to rape anyone, especially considering that Patton\u2019s background does not reveal any inclination to assault another sexually. The intentional, violent act that a custodian performed far outside the scope of his duties cannot be something that was \u201cobvious\u201d to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Finally, the testimony of Marcella Sal-yer does not demonstrate that the fiscal court was deliberately indifferent to Doe\u2019s constitutional rights when supervising Patton. As the district court held, Mrs. Sal-yer\u2019s testimony revealed only that the defendants may have known that she was a juvenile and that Mrs. Salyer was concerned about Doe\u2019s provocative dress and body position. Her testimony does not demonstrate in any way that Mrs. Salyer had reason to believe that Patton would forcibly assault or imprison Doe. Whatever negligence Mrs. Salyer committed, her response to <em>Doe\u2019s </em>dress and actions is not relevant to the foreseeability of <em>Patton\u2019s </em>later conduct. Mrs. Salyer\u2019s testimony does not reveal that she was deliberately indifferent. Therefore, under no theory of municipal liability can a federal claim by Doe for failure to supervise survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\n<em>b. Claim against Salyer in his Individual Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Doe\u2019s federal claim against Salyer in his individual capacity fails because there is no evidence that Salyer, in supervising Patton, was deliberately indifferent to Doe\u2019s constitutional rights. Doe \u201cmust show that, in light of the information the defendants possessed, the [employee] who engaged in sexual abuse \u2018showed a strong likelihood that he would attempt to\u2019 sexually abuse [another], such that the \u2018failure to take adequate precautions amounted to deliberate indifference\u2019 to the constitutional rights of [others].\u201d <em>Doe, </em>103 F.3d at 513. Moreover, \u201cthe supervisor [must have] \u2018either encouraged the specific incident of misconduct or in some other way directly participated in it.\u2019 \u201d <em>McQueen, </em>433 F.3d at 470 (quoting <em>Shehee v. Luttrell, </em>199 F.3d 295, 300 (6th Cir.1999)). There is no evidence that Salyer had any information, either from Patton\u2019s criminal record or his job performance, that indicated that Patton was likely to abuse another sexually. Furthermore, there is no evidence whatsoever that Salyer encouraged or was directly involved in Doe\u2019s rape. Doe has thus failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Salyer, in his individual capacity, is liable for his supervision of Patton.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Doe\u2019s state-law claims fail because the defendants are shielded from liability by sovereign or official immunity under Kentucky law.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>\n<em>1. State-Law Claims for Negligent Hiring</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">\n<em>a. Claims against the Fiscal Court and Salyer in his Official Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Doe\u2019s state-law claims of negligent hiring against the fiscal court and Salyer in his official capacity are barred by sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity bars state-law actions against county governments. <em>See Schwindel v. Meade County, </em>113 S.W.3d 159, 163 (Ky.2003). Kentucky courts have treated fiscal courts as county governments and thus have permitted fiscal courts to share sovereign immunity with county governments. <em>See Bd. of Claims of Ky. v. Banks, </em>31 S.W.3d 436, 439 (Ky.Ct.App.2000) (\u201cBecause the Board of Claims Act does not expressly waive sovereign immunity for counties, the Board was correct in finding that it had no jurisdiction of ... claim[s] against the Powell County Fiscal Court.\u201d); <em>see also Expert Masonry, Inc. v. Boone County, Ky., Fiscal Ct., </em>440 F.3d 336, 339 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201c\u2018Fiscal Court\u2019 is the name that Kentucky traditionally assigns to county government bodies.\u201d). Unless the fiscal court waives its immunity, sovereign immunity protects the fiscal court from state-law claims. <em>See Schwindel, </em>113 S.W.3d at 163. Doe has not pointed to any evidence indicating that the Magoffin County Fiscal Court has waived its immunity. Therefore, sovereign immunity bars Doe\u2019s state-law claim of negligent hiring against the fiscal court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Sovereign immunity also protects Salyer from Doe\u2019s claims against him in his official capacity. Under Kentucky law, an officer sued in his official capacity receives the same kind of immunity that protects the state or governmental agency for which he or she works. <em>See Yanero v. Davis, </em>65 S.W.3d 510, 521-22 (Ky.2002). Because Salyer is an employee of the county, he is entitled to the same sovereign immunity that the fiscal court receives.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">\n<em>b. Claim against Salyer in his Individual Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">Salyer, in his individual capacity, is entitled to official qualified immunity from Doe\u2019s state-law claim of negligent hiring. \u201c[I]n their individual capacities, public officers and employees enjoy ... qualified official immunity, which affords protection from damages liability for good faith judgment calls made in a legally uncertain environment. Qualified official immunity applies to the negligent performance by a public officer ... of (1) discretionary acts or functions ...; (2) in good faith; and (3) within the scope of the employee\u2019s authority.\u201d <em>Yanero, </em>65 S.W.3d at 522. Salyer satisfies this three-part inquiry and is thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>entitled to state-law qualified official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">First, Salyer\u2019s decision to hire Patton and not to perform a background check were discretionary functions because Sal-yer was not enforcing or failing to enforce any particular order or rule. <em>See id. </em>at 528. Doe has not identified any order, regulation, or statute that required Salyer to perform a background check or consider certain factors when hiring his staff. Indeed, Salyer and his predecessor Dr. Hardin both testified that background checks were unnecessary in Magoffin County because everyone knows everyone else. Doe has failed to make any showing that Sal-yer\u2019s decisions regarding hiring were not discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Second, Doe does not contend that Sal-yer was not acting within the scope of his authority when making his hiring decisions. Kentucky law empowers county judge executives to hire staff. Ky.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 67.710(7). Thus, Salyer satisfies the second prong of Kentucky\u2019s qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Finally, Salyer hired Patton in good faith as a matter of law. The Supreme Court of Kentucky has \u201cheld that qualified immunity would be defeated if an official <em>\u2018knew or reasonably should have known </em>that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the [plaintiff], <em>or </em>if he took the action <em>with the malicious intention </em>to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights....\u2019\u201d <em>Yanero, </em>65 S.W.3d at 523 (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 815, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). Doe has the burden of demonstrating that Salyer did not act in good faith. <em>See id. </em>As previously discussed in the section of this opinion concerning Doe\u2019s federal hiring-practices claims, there was no constitutional violation in this case by Salyer in his individual capacity because he did not act with deliberate indifference in hiring Patton. Just as there is no evidence of deliberate indifference in this record, there is also no evidence of malicious intent to deprive Doe of her constitutional right to bodily integrity or her right to be free from unreasonable seizures. Salyer is therefore entitled to qualified official immunity under Kentucky law.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Doe\u2019s case is not helped by the state supreme court\u2019s recognition that hiring entails a ministerial aspect that precludes public officers from hiring an employee who is not competent \u201cto perform the task for which he/she was hired.\u201d <em>See Yanero, </em>65 S.W.3d at 528. Despite Patton\u2019s criminal history, he was competent to perform janitorial duties. Doe has not alleged, much less pointed to evidence in the record suggesting, that Patton was not qualified to be the courthouse janitor. Moreover, as the district court held, \u201c[w]hile [Patton] may have occasionally been ordered to oversee people performing community service on an informal basis, this was not \u2018the task for which he was hired.\u2019 \u201d JA 209. Doe even concedes that he was hired as a janitor, not as a supervisor. <em>See </em>Doe\u2019s Reply Br. at 4. (\u201c[T]he [Appellees] ... claim that Mr. Patton was hired as a janitor, not hired to supervise juveniles. The Appellant agrees.... \u201d). Therefore, Salyer did not breach his recognized but limited duty to hire employees who were competent \u201cto perform the task for which [they were] hired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">\n<em>2. State-law Claims for Negligent Supervision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">As with Doe\u2019s state-law claims for negligent hiring, Doe\u2019s claims for negligent supervision against the fiscal court and Sal-yer in his official capacity are barred by sovereign immunity. Her claims for negligent supervision against Salyer in his indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>vidual capacity are barred by qualified official immunity. Doe contends, however, that the defendants have no immunity when sued for negligent supervision because supervision is a ministerial function. Doe argues that qualified immunity does not apply to ministerial functions and that Kentucky has waived sovereign immunity when a state or county employee negligently performs a ministerial function. Doe\u2019s contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Statements in <em>Williams v. Kentucky Department of Education, </em>113 S.W.3d 145 (Ky.2003), and <em>Yanero </em>that teachers perform a ministerial task when supervising students do not apply to this case, and thus Salyer is entitled to state-law qualified official immunity in his individual capacity in response to Doe\u2019s negligent-supervision claims. In her brief, Doe claims that the Supreme Court of Kentucky has \u201creiterated that it is \u2018well-established\u2019 that sovereign immunity is not applicable to <em>individuals </em>being sued for \u2018negligent supervision.\u2019 \u201d Doe\u2019s Br. at 24 (emphasis added). The state supreme court, however, has not made such a broad statement; instead, the court has held that \u201c[i]t is well established in this jurisdiction that a <em>school teacher </em>can be held liable for injuries caused by negligent supervision <em>of his/ her students.\u201d Williams, </em>113 S.W.3d at 148 (referring to <em>Yanero, </em>65 S.W.3d at 529) (emphasis added). The state supreme court held that teachers are not entitled to immunity when supervising students because the teachers\u2019 duty to supervise students arises from state statutes and regulations and is thus ministerial. <em>See id. </em>at 150-51 (describing some of the statutes and regulations to which teachers are bound). In contrast, Salyer is entitled to qualified immunity because Doe has identified no regulation, statute, or administrative framework in this case that requires Salyer\u2019s obedience. Because Doe has not demonstrated that Salyer\u2019s supervision of Patton was ministerial, Salyer is entitled to qualified official immunity regarding Doe\u2019s negligent-supervision claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Because Salyer\u2019s duty to supervise was not ministerial, the fiscal court and Salyer in his official capacity are entitled to sovereign immunity from negligent-supervision claims premised on vicarious liability. In <em>Williams, </em>the state supreme court held that the administrator of a deceased student\u2019s estate could bring claims against the Kentucky Department of Education and the local county school board of education in Kentucky\u2019s Board of Claims under a theory of vicarious liability for teachers\u2019 failure to supervise students. 113 S.W.3d at 155-56. The supreme court noted that the state had waived its immunity from suits brought in the state board of claims concerning \u201c \u2018all negligence claims for the negligent performance of ministerial acts,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 155 (quoting Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 44.073(2)), and that teachers, pursuant to statutes and rules, had a ministerial duty to supervise students, <em>id. </em>at 150-51. Salyer\u2019s duty to supervise, unlike the teachers\u2019, was not ministerial. The legislature\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity for ministerial acts, therefore, does not apply here, and the fiscal court and Salyer in his official capacity are entitled to sovereign immunity. Furthermore, no suit against the fiscal court or Salyer in his official capacity for independent tort liability can he because Doe has not identified any statute or regulation that these defendants were required to enforce when supervising their employees. For these reasons, <em>Williams </em>does not deprive any defendant of immunity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">Moreover, even if the duty to supervise Patton were ministerial, the defendants did not breach this duty because the harm that resulted was not foreseeable. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>state supreme court in <em>Williams </em>held that the ministerial duty to supervise requires that \u201cadministrators ... take all reasonable steps to prevent <em>foreseeable </em>harm to [their] students.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 148 (italics added). Where there is no foreseeability, there is no duty under Kentucky law. <em>See M &amp; T Chems., Inc. v. Westrick, 525 </em>S.W.2d 740, 741 (Ky.1974). In <em>Z.A. ex rel. S.A. v. City of Louisville, </em>No.2004-CA-001189-MR, 2005 WL 1491554, at *4 (Ky. Ct.App. June 24, 2005), the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that, as a matter of law in a negligent-supervision claim, a library staff could not have foreseen that one of its computer-lab assistants would sexually assault a juvenile, even though that same assistant had displayed a picture with sexual overtones on an overhead projector three weeks earlier. In this case, Doe has not pointed to any kind of evidence that would potentially put Salyer on notice that Patton would sexually abuse another. Because Salyer had no notice, constructive or otherwise, that Patton would sexually assault or imprison Doe, Salyer owed no duty to Doe to prevent the unforeseeable harm that occurred. Doe\u2019s state-law claims for negligent supervision also fail because the harm that occurred was unforeseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">The district court\u2019s failure to mention whether it considered Joseph Smith\u2019s affidavit does not require us to reverse the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the defendants. In <em>Williams v. Ford Motor Co., </em>this court held that \u201c[a]lthough expert testimony may be more inferential than that of fact witnesses, in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment an expert opinion must be more than a conclusory assertion about ultimate legal issues.\u201d 187 F.3d 533, 543 (6th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., </em>8 F.3d 88, 92 (1st Cir.1993)). <em>Williams </em>also referred approvingly to <em>Merit Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>569 F.2d 666, 673 (D.C.Cir.1977), which stated that \u201c[t]he evidentiary rules regarding expert testimony at trial were not intended ... to make summary judgment impossible whenever a party had produced an expert to support its position\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted). Smith\u2019s affidavit presents only incorrect, conclusory statements of law and thus does not preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Smith\u2019s first contention\u2014that the defendants\u2019 failure to investigate employees\u2019 criminal backgrounds was in \u201cwanton disregard of the rights of the juvenile\u201d\u2014is simply incorrect in light of this opinion that has considered the same facts. <em>See Thomas Noe, Inc. v. Homestead Ins. Co., </em>173 F.3d 581, 584 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201cGiven our conclusion that Exclusionary Clause 5.D [in an insurance contract] is unambiguous, it is clear that evidence of [an expert\u2019s] contrary conclusion is inadmissible.\u201d). Smith next contends that Patton\u2019s conduct was foreseeable in light of his past violent crimes. But, as this opinion has already held, <em>Brown </em>forecloses this argument as to Doe\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. The deputy in <em>Brown </em>also had convictions for violent crimes, but the Supreme Court held that those convictions were insufficient to demonstrate that the hiring sheriff was deliberately indifferent to the plaintiffs constitutional rights. Moreover, as a matter of law, it was not foreseeable that Patton would sexually assault Doe, <em>see City of Louisville, </em>2005 WL 1491554, so Smith\u2019s contrary conclusion is incorrect under Kentucky law. Simply having experts restate general facts and announce legal conclusions without any analysis does not create a genuine issue of material fact. Therefore, the district court\u2019s failure to consider the affidavit amounts at most to harmless error because the declarations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>the affidavit do not preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the orders of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-14\">. A county judge executive is the \"chief executive officer\" of a county, and all executive power rests with him or her. Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 67.705(1) and 67.710.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b988-7\">. Doe states in her brief that Patton\u2019s criminal record includes twenty arrests. She alleges that fifteen of these arrests were for alcohol intoxication and that two were for disorderly conduct. She also alleges that Patton was found guilty twice of vote fraud. Doe, however, points to (and we have uncovered) no evidence in the record to support her assertions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b989-9\">. The district court did not grant summary judgment as to the claims against Patton in his individual capacity. Doe, however, later settled those claims against Patton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b990-8\">. The district court held that Patton was acting under color of state law. See JA 176-77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">. We assume, without deciding, that the fiscal court and Salyer were the final policy makers for hiring decisions. The county judge executive has the power to appoint and supervise personnel with the approval of the fiscal court. Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 67.710(7). We have also assumed, as the Supreme Court did in <em>Brovm, </em>that one hiring decision can qualify as a policy or custom. <em>See Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 412, 117 S.Ct. 1382.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b995-7\">. The district court held that \"Magoffin County had a minimal ministerial duty to not hire someone \u2018incompetent\u2019 to perform janitorial services....\" JA 209. Kentucky law, however, does not impose this minimum ministerial duty on fiscal courts, counties, or officers sued in their official capacities. Kentucky law imposes this duty only on public officers sued in their individual capacities. In <em>Yane-ro, </em>the Supreme Court of Kentucky said, \"[Tjhere is authority for the proposition that a public officer can be subject to personal liability in tort for hiring an employee known to that officer to be incompetent to perform the task for which he/she was hired.\u201d 65 S.W.3d at 528. The <em>Yanero </em>court discussed this minimal ministerial duty only in the context of its opinion concerning claims against public employees in their individual capacities. Moreover, the case to which the supreme court referred, <em>Whitt v. Reed, </em>concerned only claims against public officials in their individual capacities. 239 S.W.2d 489, 491 (Ky.1951) (\"The petition alleges that the Superintendent, Principal, Maintenance Supervisor and Janitor were negligent in the performance or non-performance of their ministerial duties. The allegations stated a cause of action against them as individuals.\u201d). Therefore, this ministerial duty exception does not apply to Doe's claims against the fiscal court or Salyer in his official capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
