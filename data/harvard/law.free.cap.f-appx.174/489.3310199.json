He asserts the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for relief from the judgment based upon \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of relief under Rule 60(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>Davis v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>205 F.3d 1301, 1304 n. 4 (11th Cir.2000). We consider only the denial of relief as to the motion filed under Rule 60(b), not the underlying judgment. <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">A party may file a motion for relief from a judgment or order based upon \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). To prevail on this ground, the appellant has the burden to demonstrate a justification so compelling the court was \u201crequired\u201d to vacate its order. <em>Rice v. Ford Motor Co., </em>88 F.3d 914, 919 (11th Cir.1996). Generally, such relief \u201cis an extraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Swim-Tech Corp., </em>722 F.2d 677, 680 (11th Cir.1984). We have also held \u201cwhere denial of relief [under Rule 60(b)] precludes examination of the full merits of the cause, even a slight abuse may justify reversal.\u201d <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">In <em>Seven Elves, </em>we found the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a Rule 60(b) motion where doing so was necessary to \u201caccomplish justice\u201d given the \u201ctruncated proceedings\u201d that led to an entry of a judgment against the appellants, who also \u201cdid not appear, either personally or through an attorney\u201d at the proceeding due to \u201cunusual circumstances.\u201d <em>Seven Elves, </em>635 F.2d at 403-04. The following factors were considered in reaching this determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-16\">(1) [t]hat final judgments should not lightly be disturbed; (2) that the Rule 60(b) motion is not to be used as a substitute for appeal; (3) that the rule should be liberally construed in order to achieve substantial justice; (4) whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the motion was made within a reasonable time; (5) whether if the judgment was a default or a dismissal in which there was no consideration of the merits the interest in deciding cases on the merits outweighs, in the particular case, the interest in the finality of judgments, and there is merit in the movant\u2019s claim or defense; (6) whether if the judgment was rendered after a trial on the merits the movant had a fair opportunity to present his claim or defense; (7) whether there are intervening equities that would make it inequitable to grant relief; and (8) any other factors relevant to the justice of the judgment under attack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARd\"><em>Id. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Applying the factors set forth in <em>Seven Elves </em>to the circumstances of this case, we find the district court\u2019s denial of relief was sufficiently \u201cmisaligned with the equities\u201d as to warrant reversal. <em>See id. </em>at 402-03. First, Montero does not seek to use the Rule 60(b) motion in this case as a substitute for appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 402. His motion was brought within a \u201creasonable time\u201d after the denial of the post judgment motion, as it was filed only seven days after the district court ordered summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>Further, the summary judgment order was entered in Montero\u2019s absence, prior to the taking of evidence by him, and without the requisite ten-day notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), such that the extent to which he had an opportunity to present his case is at best unclear. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the proceedings before the district court were \u201ctruncated\u201d such that \u201cRule 60(b) [should] be liberally construed in favor of trial on the full merits of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Finally, we note Hurricane Jeanne struck the area during the time the motion was pending, and in denying Montero\u2019s Rule 60(b)(1) motion, the district court failed to explain why the hurricane was not a basis for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d Rather, it cited as the basis for its ruling, first, its desire to reach a timely disposition of the case, and, second, its apparent determination that Montero\u2019s failure to respond to the motion was the result of his attorney\u2019s oversight. For the foregoing reasons, we find that the district court\u2019s denial of Montero\u2019s Rule 60(b)(1) motion was an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order that was entered on October 1, 2004, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\">. Montero argues for the first time on appeal the district court erred in not setting aside the summary judgment order underlying his Rule 60(b)(1) motion on the basis that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance. We need not address this issue because we find the order denying post-judgment relief should be vacated for the reasons set forth herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-17\">.
