We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Terry v. Sparrow, </em>328 B.R. 450 (M.D.N.C.2005; entered Mar. 31, 2005 <em>&amp; </em>Apr. 22, 2005). Additionally, we deny Terry\u2019s motions for a rehearing of the denial of his motion to disqualify counsel for the Appellee, for sanctions, for appointment of counsel, for review under the Administrative Procedures Act of Ap-pellee\u2019s informal brief, to expedite oral argument, and to consolidate this appeal with three other pending appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
