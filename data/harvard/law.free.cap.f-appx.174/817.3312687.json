Arellano was sentenced to 46 months in prison and three years of supervised release. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>For the first time on appeal, Arellano argues that his guideline imprisonment range was erroneously increased by 16 levels on the ground that his 1993 Texas conviction of sexual assault was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The Government contends that this issue is effectively unreviewable in that Arellano affirmatively waived it below. Arellano replies that there is no \u201cindication\u201d that he, as opposed to his counsel, made a \u201cknowing and intentional \u2018affirmative choice\u2019 \u201d to forego appellate review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Waiver, as opposed to forfeiture, is the \u201c \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (citation omitted). A claim that is waived is \u201centirely unreviewable, unlike forfeited errors, which are renewable for plain error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931 (5th Cir.1995). We have indicated that a defendant\u2019s attorney can waive a claim by his client \u201c \u2018so long as the defendant does not dissent from his attorney\u2019s decision, and so long as it can be said that the <em>attorney\u2019s decision was a legitimate trial tactic or part of a prudent trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Reveles, </em>190 F.3d 678, 683 n. 6 (5th Cir.1999) (addressing waiver of Sixth Amendment confrontation right) (quoting <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>609 F.2d 230, 232-33 (5th Cir.1980)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In applying the 16-level increase, the district court noted that Arellano had been indicted in Texas for the aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of 14 and that he had pleaded guilty to the lesser included offense of sexual assault. Arella-no has not established that the court was not authorized to consider the underlying offense conduct, at least insofar as this consideration was limited to the charging instrument. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 n. 14 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). Although the extent to which such underlying conduct may be considered remains unsettled in this circuit, <em>see United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 338 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004), Arellano has not established that his attorney\u2019s decision not to raise the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) challenge in the district court was not prudent or reasonable. <em>See Reveles, </em>190 F.3d at 683 n. 6; <em>cf. United States v. Jaimes-Jaimes, </em>406 F.3d 845, 847-49 (7th Cir.2005) (concluding that attorney\u2019s waiver of objection to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) increase was not reasonable and could not be attributed to defendant, when increase was plain error). Accordingly, Arellano has not shown that the waiver was invalid. As an alternative matter, he has not established that the 16-level increase was plain error. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Arellano\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Arellano contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Arellano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b841-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
