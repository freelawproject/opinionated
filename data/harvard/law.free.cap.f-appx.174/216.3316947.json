Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>For the following reasons, we find that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendant-Appellant Manuel Villanueva\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b241-19\">In July 2003, Villanueva pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of transporting undocumented aliens for financial gain in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. His base offense level under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(a) was twelve, and the pre-sentence report recommended, pursuant to \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(A), a three-level enhancement based on the number of aliens he smuggled. The district court additionally increased the base offense level to eighteen under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5), based on its finding that Villanueva was high on heroin at the time of his offense and thereby created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the aliens he was transporting (\u201creckless endangerment enhancement\u201d). Finally, Villanueva received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) &amp; (b). The resulting imprisonment range under the sentencing guidelines was 41 to 51 months. The district court sentenced Villanueva to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>At his sentencing Villanueva denied having used heroin on the day of the offense and objected to the three-level reckless endangerment enhancement, contending that there was insufficient evidence to support the enhancement. Villanueva did not make any Blakely<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or Booker-type objections in the district court, however, as his sentencing occurred several months before either of these decisions issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">On appeal, Villanueva again challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the reckless endangerment enhancement. Additionally, during the pendency of the appeal <em>Blakely </em>was decided, and we granted Villanueva\u2019s request for leave to file a supplemental brief asserting \u201cthat the [enhancement] violated <em>Blakely ... </em>because it was based on facts that were not charged in his indictment, were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and were not admitted by him at his plea hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirmed the sentence in an unpublished opinion, noting that the <em>Blakely </em>argument was foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>which held <em>Blakely </em>inapplicable to the federal sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In his petition to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, Villa-nueva again asserted Blakely-type error and requested that the Supreme Court remand his case for further consideration under its then-pending decision in <em>Booker. </em>By a memorandum of the acting Solicitor General, the Government also recommended a remand for further consideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>which the Supreme Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Villanueva raised his <em>Booker </em>claims for the first time on appeal. Therefore, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This means that we will not remand for resentencing unless there is (1) error, (2) that error is plain, and (3) it affects substantial rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines constitutes (1) error, and (2) that error is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He carries his burden if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">Villanueva satisfies the first two prongs of our plain error review because his sentence resulted from application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the Guidelines in their mandatory form. He has not, however, met his burden of showing that this error affected his substantial rights, as required under <em>Mares. </em>Villanueva acknowledges that this circuit has rejected the arguments that <em>Booker </em>error is structural or otherwise reversible per se,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or presumptively prejudicial,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but mentions those arguments only to preserve them for further review. Next, Villanueva urges us to follow the approach taken by the Tenth Circuit in <em>United States v. Dazey,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rather than our own. <em>Mares, </em>however, is the settled law of this circuit, and we may revisit it only en banc or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it. As Villanueva presents no viable ground for remand under <em>Mares, </em>we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Villanueva has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the plain error at his sentencing affected his substantial rights. His sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
