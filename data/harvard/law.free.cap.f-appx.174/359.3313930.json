We need not consider the merits of Sjodin\u2019s claim for relief because we conclude that the tax court lacked jurisdiction over her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">Sjodin filed joint tax returns with her husband for tax years 1987, 1988, 1990, and 1992, each of which \u201creflected tax due which was not paid at the time of filing.\u201d The IRS did not assess deficiencies against the Sjodins for any of these tax years. Sjodin petitioned the IRS for innocent spouse relief from the unpaid tax liability under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015(f) (taking into account all facts and circumstances, Secretary may relieve taxpayer of liability if it is inequitable to hold individual hable for unpaid tax or any deficiency, and relief is not available under subsection (b) or (c)), and in April 2003, the IRS issued a Notice of Determination denying her request. Sjo-din appealed that decision to the tax court, which concluded on the merits that the IRS had not abused its discretion in denying Sjodin relief. Sjodin appealed the tax court decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-25\">This circuit has recently concluded that the issuance of a deficiency by the IRS is a prerequisite for tax court jurisdiction over</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>a petition for review from an IRS determination regarding relief available under \u00a7 6015. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(1); <em>Bartman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>446 F.3d 785, 787-88 (8th Cir.2006) (under \u00a7 6015(e), tax court lacks jurisdiction over petition for review from an IRS determination regarding availability of \u00a7 6015(f) relief, unless deficiency has been asserted against taxpayer); <em>see also Comm\u2019r v. Ewing, </em>439 F.3d 1009, 1012-14 (9th Cir.2006) (same). Thus, we vacate the tax court\u2019s decision and remand with instructions that it dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Bartman, </em>446 F.3d 785, 788 (vacating tax court\u2019s finding that petitioner\u2019s claim regarding one tax year at issue was time-barred because court lacked jurisdiction over issue).\u2019</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
