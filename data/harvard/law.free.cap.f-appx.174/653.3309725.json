We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Where, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Grishaj testified inconsistently with his written application is supported by substantial evidence. The record contains various instances of conflicting and inconsistent testimony, and the IJ was reasonable in rejecting Grishaj\u2019s explanations for such discrepancies as inadequate. The IJ\u2019s finding that Rajmona Grishaj\u2019s (\u201cRajmo-na\u201d) testimony regarding the dates of the explosion as well as her father\u2019s harassment and the destruction of the greenhouse are supported by the record, and are key elements of Grishaj\u2019s claim of persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the inconsistencies go to the heart of his claim of persecution on account of his role in the Democratic Party, they form a proper basis for the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Finally, as this Court affords significant deference to the IJ\u2019s demeanor observations, <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73, the IJ\u2019s determinations that Grishaj did not directly answer the questions posed to him and that Rajmona had difficulty recalling details and often looked to her father for help are proper factors for the negative credibility finding. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 161 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that remand is not required where \u201c(1) substantial evidence supports the error-free findings that the IJ made, (2) those findings adequately support the IJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion that petitioner lacked credibility, and (3) despite eiTors\u2014considered in the context of the IJ\u2019s entire <em>analysis\u2014we </em>can state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to his' decision were the petition remanded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Because the IJ properly determined that Grishaj failed to present sufficient credible, objective evidence establishing his eligibility for asylum, denial of withholding of removal, which carries a higher burden of proof, was also proper. Additionally, as Grishaj failed to present any evidence that he would likely be subject to torture upon return to Albania, denial of CAT relief was also proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in these petitions is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">. The IJ\u2019s finding regarding the materials causing injury after the explosion is not supported by the record, as both Rajmona and Grishaj testified that they were injured by plaster and glass. However, this error is harmless because the other inconsistencies identified by the IJ support the adverse credibility finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
