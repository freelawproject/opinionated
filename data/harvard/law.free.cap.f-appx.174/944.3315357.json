We are satisfied that the parties\u2019 dispute is not governed by the arbitration provision of their expired independent sales representative agreement, and therefore, we will AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">In 1981, the plaintiff, Morris Zucker, began working as a sales representative for Superior Pant Company and continued in that capacity when the company became After Six, in about 1984. In 1997, Zucker and After Six entered into a written independent sales representative agreement, which, by its terms, was effective from August 1, 1997, to August 1, 1998. Under the agreement, Zucker was free to sell clothing products for other manufacturers, provided those products were not sold in competition with After Six\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Zucker alleges that, in 1998, after the written agreement expired, After Six required him to represent its clothing line exclusively and terminate the employment of the sub-agent who had worked for him, with After Six\u2019s approval, since 1985. Zucker did as he was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">In 2001, Zucker and After Six entered into a second written independent sales representative agreement. It was identical to the 1997 agreement, except that the dates were changed to make it effective from March 1, 2001, to March 1, 2002. Zucker alleges that he continued to act as an exclusive agent for After Six during the term of that agreement and after it expired. On April 15, 2004, After Six announced that it was restructuring its sales force and terminated Zucker as a sales representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Zucker then filed this diversity action against After Six, alleging that the company breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing when it terminated him without cause; that After Six exercised such control over his work that he was an employee and not an independent contractor, but he was not paid the benefits to which he was entitled as an employee; and that After Six refused to pay commissions on some of the sales he had generated up to the time of his termination. After Six filed a motion to stay the lawsuit pending arbitration of the parties\u2019 dispute, as required by the arbitration provision contained in the two written independent sales representative agreements. After Six argued that the expiration of those agreements did not preclude arbitration of the dispute because Zucker\u2019s claims rest on facts that allegedly occurred before the agreements expired. The district court was unpersuaded and declined to grant the motion for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of the arbitrability of a dispute. <em>M &amp; C Corp. v. Erwin Behr GmbH &amp; Co., </em>148 F.3d 1033, 1037 (6th Cir.1998). The <em>de novo </em>standard of review also applies to questions of contract interpretation. <em>Inland Bulk Transfer Co. v. Cummins Engine Co., </em>332 F.3d 1007, 1014 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">We find, and the parties seem to agree, that the arbitration provision of their expired written independent sales representative agreements falls under the coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) because those agreements involved interstate commerce. The FAA codifies the \u201cliberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Section 2, the main substantive provision of the FAA, provides that a written arbitration agreement \u201cin any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The text of \u00a7 2 \u201ccreates a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate,\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>460 U.S. at 25, 103 S.Ct. 927 n. 32, but it also provides that courts may apply state law to invalidate an arbitration agreement <em>\u201cif </em>that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally,\u201d <em>Perry v. Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 492 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The FAA \u201cestablishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitra-bility.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>460 U.S. at 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927. \u201c[Arbitration should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the clause does not cover the dispute.\u201d <em>Georgia Power Co. v. Cimarron Coal Corp., </em>526 F.2d 101, 106 (6th Cir.1975) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">The central question on appeal is whether the parties\u2019 dispute falls under the valid arbitration provision contained in the independent sales representative agreement that expired in 2002, two years before Zueker was terminated. This is a question regarding the scope of the arbitration agreement, and such questions are governed by federal law under the FAA. <em>See Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>460 U.S. at 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">It seems clear that the parties\u2019 dispute arose in 2004 when After Six terminated its employment relationship with Zueker. After Six argues that Zueker should be compelled to arbitrate the dispute under the arbitration provision of their expired 2001-2002 independent sales representative agreement, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-9\">10. <em>Arbitration</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">(a) Any controversy or dispute which arises in connection with the validity, construction, application, enforcement or breach of this Agreement which is not settled shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Zueker does not question the validity of the arbitration provision or the 2001-2002 agreement as a whole. Rather, he questions whether \u201cthere is a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement applicable <em>to this matter\u201d </em>because the independent sales representative agreement expired two years before the dispute arose. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">After Six claims the dispute is arbitrable despite the expiration of the independent sales representative agreement because our holding in <em>South Central Power Co. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>186 F.3d 733 (6th Cir.1999), is applicable to all contracts, not just collective bargaining agreements. In <em>South Central, </em>we applied Supreme Court precedent establishing a presumption that disputes arising after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement are arbitrable when they arise under the contact, and held that \u201ca dispute \u2018arises under the contract\u2019 when a <em>majority </em>of the <em>material </em>facts and occurrences arose before the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>piration of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740. After Six argues that all the material facts needed to prove Zucker\u2019s claims occurred before the expiration of the 2001-2002 agreement when After Six allegedly required him to represent its clothing line exclusively in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The district court offered three reasons for its holding that Zucker was not required to arbitrate the dispute. First, it found that our holding in <em>South Central </em>is applicable only to collective bargaining agreements. Second, it determined that this case does not involve actions that occurred prior to the expiration of the 2001-2002 agreement because the only grievance at issue is Zucker\u2019s termination in 2004. Third, the court stated that After Six cannot defend itself by denying any agreement between the parties and then insist that an expired agreement should be applied to its benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Although we disagree with some of the district court\u2019s reasoning, we agree with its decision to deny After Six\u2019s motion to stay the action pending arbitration because we can say with \u201cpositive assurance\u201d that the parties\u2019 dispute does not fall under the arbitration provision of their 2001-2002 independent sales representative agreement. <em>See Georgia Power Co., </em>526 F.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">In <em>South Central, </em>we interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Litton Financial Printing Division v. NLRB, </em>501 U.S. 190, 111 S.Ct. 2215, 115 L.Ed.2d 177 (1991). In <em>Litton, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated its holding in <em>Nolde Bros. v. Local No. 358, Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers Union, 430 </em>U.S. 243, 255, 97 S.Ct. 1067, 51 L.Ed.2d 300 (1977), that there is a presumption in favor of arbitration when a dispute arises under an expired collective bargaining agreement unless that presumption is \u201c \u2018negated expressly or by clear implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Litton, </em>501 U.S. at 204, 111 S.Ct. 2215 (quoting <em>Nolde Bros., </em>430 U.S. at 255, 97 S.Ct. 1067). The Court also held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-10\">A postexpiration grievance can be said to arise under the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration, where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, or where, under normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 111 S.Ct. 2215. In <em>South Central, </em>we held that, under <em>Litton, </em>a dispute \u201carises under the contract\u201d not when \u201cany\u201d facts and circumstances relating to the dispute arose before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, but rather, \u201cwhen a <em>majority </em>of the <em>material </em>facts and occurrences arose before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>South Central, </em>186 F.3d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">Although <em>Litton, Nolde Bros., </em>and <em>South Central </em>all involved collective bargaining agreements, their holdings are based upon principles applicable to arbitration agreements generally, and their application need not be limited to the collective bargaining context. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Nolde Bros., </em>arbitration is a creature of contract, and a party may not be compelled to arbitrate any dispute he has not agreed to arbitrate, but adherence to these principles does not lead to the conclusion that the expiration of a contract automatically extinguishes the duty to arbitrate disputes arising under that contract. <em>Nolde Bros., </em>430 U.S. at 250-51, 97 S.Ct. 1067. If the duty to arbitrate automatically terminated upon expiration of the contract, a party could avoid his contractual duty to arbitrate by simply waiting until the day after the contract expired to bring an action regarding a dispute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>arose while the contract was in effect. <em>See id. </em>at 251, 97 S.Ct. 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Applying the principles of <em>Litton </em>and <em>South Central, </em>we conclude that the parties\u2019 dispute did not arise under their 2001-2002 independent sales representative agreement. It arose on the date Zucker was terminated, April 15, 2004, and it did not involve facts and occurrences that arose while the written agreement was in effect. The dispute between Zucker and After Six also does not involve any rights arguably created by the independent sales representative agreement. Therefore, Zucker may not be compelled to arbitrate the dispute because he did not agree to submit it to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">For the reasons above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying After Six\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
