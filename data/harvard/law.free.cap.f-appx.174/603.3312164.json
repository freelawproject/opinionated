The district court issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of \u201cwhether petitioner has met the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test [for a claim of ineffective counsel], based on the disparity of seventeen months between the sentence he received without the additional one level departure and the sentence he would otherwise have received based on a prompt guilty plea.\u201d Familiarity with the record below and issues on appeal is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to deny habeas corpus relief and the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Washington v. Schriver, </em>240 F.3d 101, 107 (2d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 204 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Petitioner received a two-level reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 3El.l(a). However, the court denied Moore\u2019s request for an additional level departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), finding \u201cno basis for awarding any reduction for timeliness\u201d because the \u201cgovernment\u2019s and the court\u2019s resources were in no way conserved as to the timeliness of the plea.\u201d Petitioner claims that he was denied the full three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility because of the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">To establish a claim of ineffective counsel, Moore must show (1) that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured by prevailing professional norms, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-90, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Boria v. Keane, </em>99 F.3d 492, 496-97 (2d Cir.1996). The district court issued a certificate of appealability on the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Because Moore does not allege conduct that would satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective counsel, which requires a showing that the outcome would be different <em>but for </em>the counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the district court correctly denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">Petitioner seeks, in the alternative, a remand for a hearing on this issue. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to deny a hearing on a habeas petition for abuse of discretion. <em>See Pham v. United States, </em>317 F.3d 178, 182 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Chang v. United States, </em>250 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.2001). If the facts alleged by petitioner, even if credited, would not entitle him to habeas relief, the motion should be denied. <em>See Ciak v. United States, </em>59 F.3d 296, 307 (2d Cir.1995). Here, as explained above, the facts would not establish that the petitioner would have received an additional point reduction but for the alleged ineffective counsel. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
