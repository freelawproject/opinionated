When Melendez refused to allow Dowtin to spend the night, Dowtin became angry and hit her. Dowtin then pulled a gun out of his pocket, told her he would shoot her, and then fired one shot into the air before leaving. At sentencing, Dowtin did not contest that the district court properly calculated a sentencing guideline range of thirty to thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then granted the Government\u2019s motion for an upward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.6 (2005). The district court added two offense levels and found a guideline range of thirty-seven to forty-six months. Dowtin received a sentence of forty-four months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">Dowtin claims that the district court erred when it departed upward from the sentencing guideline range. A district court may depart upward from the guideline range under USSG \u00a7 5K2.6 if a firearm was used or possessed. \u201cThe extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner it which it was used, and the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tent to which its use endangered others. The discharge of a firearm might warrant a substantial increase.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5K2.6. The district court granted the upward departure because Dowtin \u201cfired the possessed firearm in the vicinity of a victim holding a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Dowtin claims that his offense level under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 encompassed his conduct in firing the gun through cross-referencing to a minor assault under USSG \u00a7 2A2.3(a)(1). Minor assault under USSG \u00a7 2A2.3(a)(1), however, does not take into consideration the discharging of a firearm during an assault and speaks only to the threatened use of a firearm. An upward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K2.6 was proper to address the fact that Dowtin\u2019s conduct was more aggravated than a minor assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Dowtin also claims that the amount of upward departure was unreasonable. The extent of a departure must be reasonable under the circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f)(2) (2000); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>142 F.3d 702, 707 (4th Cir.1998). USSG \u00a7 5K2.6 explicitly states that the discharge of a firearm might warrant a substantial increase. The extent of the district court\u2019s departure was reasonable when compared to other provisions in the guidelines for enhancements based on the discharge of a firearm. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the two level increase resulted in a sentencing range of only nine months above the original guideline range, and an actual sentence only seven months greater than Dowtin could have received absent the departure. Thus, because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, calculated and considered the guideline range, gave a reasonable justification for sentencing above the guideline range, and weighed the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), we find that the sentence it imposed upon Dowtin was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-15\"> Dowtin does not appeal his conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
