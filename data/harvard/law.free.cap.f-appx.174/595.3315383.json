The district court denied relief, holding that, while <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), was applicable to his case, petitioner\u2019s claim failed on the merits. We assume familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">We agree with the district court that <em>Apprendi </em>is applicable to petitioner\u2019s case. As the court correctly noted, petitioner\u2019s case was not final until three days after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi. </em>Therefore, the <em>Apprendi </em>rule applies to petitioner\u2019s case. <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 322, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987). Nevertheless, petitioner\u2019s claim fails on the merits. Petitioner was sentenced to 108 months, below the statutory maximum for his offense at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial. <em>Apprendi </em>stands only for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s sentence cannot be increased beyond the statutory maximum by facts not found by a jury. To the extent that petitioner claims that the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines themselves are unconstitutional or that the enhancements used to calculate his sentence under the Guidelines were unconstitutionally imposed, those claims must be made under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and we have held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to cases on collateral review that became final before the <em>Booker </em>decision was handed down. <em>Guzman v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 139, 141 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">In his motion for reconsideration under Fed R. Civ. P. 60(b), petitioner argued for the first time that the restitution of more than $9.5 million that he was required to pay was illegally imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A because it failed to identify specific victims he defrauded. However, this circuit has held that challenges to restitution orders are not cognizable on a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, even when joined with other cognizable claims. <em>Kaminski v. United States, </em>339 F.3d 84, 89 (2d Cir.2003). This court left open the possibility that a \u00a7 2255 motion may be appropriate where the petitioner alleges that the restitution order is so burdensome that it amounts to a restraint on the petitioner\u2019s liberty, <em>see id. </em>at 87. Even if we were to consider petitioner\u2019s argument that his restitution order amounts to a restraint on his liberty, an argument raised for the first time in his letter brief, petitioner failed to raise this argument on direct review. His challenge in the district court and before this court on direct review concerned only the amount of the restitution order. Because petitioner failed to preserve the issue on direct review, it is not a cognizable ground for \u00a7 2255 relief absent a showing of cause and prejudice. <em>See Fountain v. United States, </em>357 F.3d 250, 254 (2d Cir.2004). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Petitioner offers no reason that his belated objections to the restitution order could not have been raised on direct review. He is therefore barred from asserting such a challenge now.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We furthermore decline to treat petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as a motion for a writ of coram nobis. If petitioner wishes to pursue such a remedy, he should file a proper motion with the district court in the first instance. <em>See Kaminski, </em>339 F.3d at 89-91 (opinion of Calabresi, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
