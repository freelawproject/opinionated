The procedural history of this case and the details of Blake\u2019s claims are well-known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s thorough opinions, and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Blake filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. He alleged that appellee Jack Young, Chief of Police for the Borough of Cambridge Springs, had used excessive force on him while Blake was detained at the Crawford County Correctional Facility (CCCF). The District Court granted appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Blake filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The District Court granted summary judgment on the ground that Blake had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Blake argues <em>on </em>appeal that the grievance procedure at the jail lacked the authority to provide relief from the actions of appellees Young and the Borough of Cambridge Springs and, therefore, was not \u201cavailable\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">In <em>Booth v. Chumer, </em>532 U.S. 731, 736, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001), the Supreme Court addressed the question of \u201cwhether or not a remedial scheme is \u2018available\u2019 where ... the administrative process has authority to take some action in response to a complaint, but not the remedial action an inmate demands to the exclusion of all other forms of redress.\u201d The Court concluded that in such situations the inmate must complete the administrative process. Here, Blake only requested monetary damages in his complaint. The grievance process at CCCF does not limit the relief available or exclude awarding monetary damages in response to a grievance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If Blake had submitted a grievance, the officials at CCCF certainly would have had the authority to investigate the matter, to bring Blake\u2019s allegations to the attention of the appropriate officials with authority over Young, or to not allow Young into CCCF in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>future. Because CCCF\u2019s grievance procedure had the \u201cauthority to take some action in response to [Blake\u2019s] complaint,\u201d the procedure was available to him, and exhaustion of his administrative remedies was required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\">. The grievance policy is described in one sentence in the inmate handbook for CCCF: \"If you wish to file an inmate grievance, you must follow the chain of command (housing unit officer, sergeant, lieutenant, deputy warden, warden).\u201d There are no time limits for filing grievances. We note that the appellees raised the exhaustion defense in their answer filed in April 2003. At this point, Blake still had the opportunity to exhaust his administrative remedies and re-file the complaint within the statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-16\">. Blake also argues that the exhaustion requirement does not apply to allegations of excessive force. However, in <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002), the Supreme Court held that it does apply to such cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
