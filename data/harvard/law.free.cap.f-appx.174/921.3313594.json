Lett sued defendant Dr. Zarife Sahenk pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>\u00a7 1983, alleging that Sahenk violated her substantive due process rights by failing to obtain Lett\u2019s informed consent before performing a non-therapeutic sural nerve biopsy for a medical research study. On September 27, 2002, the district court denied Sahenk\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), finding that Lett filed the claim within the relevant statutory limitations period. Sahenk later filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The court granted the motion on February 23, 2005, holding that Lett\u2019s allegations and evidence did not permit a finding that defendant had violated her constitutional rights, or in the alternative, that Sahenk was entitled to qualified immunity for her actions. The parties cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Sahenk alleges that the district court wrongly denied her motion to dismiss Lett\u2019s complaint. We review a district court order denying a motion to dismiss de novo. <em>Trzebuckowski v. City of Cleveland, </em>319 F.3d 853, 855 (6th Cir.2003). The district court determined that Lett brought her \u00a7 1983 claim in federal court outside of the applicable two year limitations period set forth in. Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2305.10. <em>See Browning v. Pendleton, </em>869 F.2d 989, 992 (6th Cir.1989) (en banc) (holding that \u00a7 2305.10 establishes the applicable limitations period in Ohio). However, the court determined that Lett\u2019s claim was covered by the Ohio savings statute, Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2305.19, which allows plaintiffs to refile claims within one year of the termination of a prior claim \u201cotherwise than upon the merits.\u201d <em>See Harris v. City of Canton, </em>725 F.2d 371, 375 (6th Cir.1984) (citing <em>Cero Realty Corp. v. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>171 Ohio St. 82, 167 N.E.2d 774, 777 (1960)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). The district court held that Lett\u2019s prior state action against Sahenk and other defendants was sufficient to save the federal cause of action. Sahenk argues that this determination was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Lett argues that the district court wrongly granted summary judgment for Sahenk on the merits of her claim. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>TriHealth, Inc. v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, Hamilton County, </em>430 F.3d 783, 787 (6th Cir.2005). Lett alleges that her \u00a7 1983 claim is valid because Sahenk\u2019s conduct violated Lett\u2019s substantive due process right to bodily integrity. The district court held that Lett failed to allege or produce evidence of conduct that \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d and that the eases cited by Lett as precedent were distinguishable from the facts of this case. Further, the court held that even if Lett had alleged such conduct, Sahenk would be entitled to qualified immunity for her actions because she did not violate \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">After reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, we determine that a panel opinion further addressing the issues raised would serve no jurisprudential purpose. Therefore, on the grounds identified by the district court, we affirm both the district court\u2019s September 27, 2002, denial of Sahenk\u2019s motion to dismiss Lett\u2019s complaint and its February 23, 2005, grant of summary judgment for Sa-henk.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
