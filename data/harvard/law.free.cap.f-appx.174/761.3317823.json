See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b786-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">On August 16, 2004, David Blackwood pleaded guilty to one count of illegally reentering the United States after having been previously deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Although \u00a7 1326(a) provides a two-year maximum term of imprisonment for this offense, \u00a7 1326(b)(2) increases this maximum to twenty years when the alien was previously removed subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). After finding that Blackwood had been removed subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony\u2014 specifically, a 1992 federal felony narcotics conviction\u2014the district court sentenced Blackwood to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">On appeal of his sentence, Blackwood argues that because the indictment in the instant case did not specifically charge, and he did not admit, the prior conviction on which the court based the sentencing enhancement, a sentence in excess of two years violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Recognizing that this claim is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), he argues that that case is no longer good law because it has been undercut by later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">The Supreme Court has not only failed to overturn <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>it has specifically recognized its continuing force in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This court recently addressed the continuing vitality of <em>Almendarez-Tor-res </em>in <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352 (4th Cir.2005), and held, \u201cIt is thus clear that the Supreme Court continues to hold that the Sixth Amendment (as well as due process) does not demand that the mere fact of a prior conviction used as a basis for a sentencing enhancement be pleaded in an indictment and submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d We decline Blackwood\u2019s invitation to revisit this decision and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
