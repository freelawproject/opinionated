We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsa-meachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Because Rihi fails to challenge the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s findings that his asylum application was untimely and that he did not establish past persecution, Rihi has waived these issues. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Additionally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Rihi failed to meet his burden to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. The 2003 State Department reports indicated that the Indonesian Government recognized Protestantism and Catholicism as official religions, its Constitution provides for \u201call persons the right to worship according to his or her own religion or belief,\u201d the country had five Christian parties, respect for human rights improved in the provinces of Maluku, North Maluku, and Central Sulawesi, incidents of interreligious violence targeted both Muslims and Christians, and there were no reported religious prisoners. Based on these conditions, the IJ properly concluded that Rihi had not established it would be more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution due to his religion if he returned to Indonesia, and Rihi\u2019s personal history and background materials did not suggest otherwise. Furthermore, the IJ appropriately indicated that the fact that Rihi\u2019s family members, who continue to reside in Indonesia as practicing Christians, did not report incidents of persecution, undermined Rihi\u2019s claim. <em>See In Re A-M-, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. 737, 740-41, 2005 WL 1123283 (BIA 2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">. We note that Board Member Pauley, in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision on the BIA\u2019s behalf, appears to have confused this case with some other case. Mr. Pauley writes that Rihi \u201cfailed to establish that he ... has a well-founded fear of persecution on a ground protected under the Immigration and Naturalization;\u201d he gives no explanation for this finding, and in fact the finding conflicts with the IJ\u2019s finding that Rihi, whose testimony she credited, \"probably\u201d has met his burden of establishing eligibility of asylum but had not met the higher (more likely than not) standard under the withholding provision. We nonetheless affirm here in light of the clear-cut facts and law against Rihi, which leave no doubt as to how this case would be decided on remand. However, we caution the BIA that the \"streamlined\u201d procedure for summary affirmance, which we have upheld against a per se constitutional challenge, <em>see Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158-59 (2d Cir.2004) satisfies due process only so long as it reflects individualized consideration of each case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
