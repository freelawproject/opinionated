We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">Stevenson\u2019s petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. We will grant habeas relief only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The Supreme Court has held that in reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Accordingly, we review the decision of the California Court of Appeal upholding Stevenson\u2019s conviction to determine whether it was an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson. See Juan H. v. Allen, </em>408 F.3d 1262, 1275 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1145, 163 L.Ed.2d 1000 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-20\">Stevenson argues that the movement does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 209, as it was \u201cmerely incidental to the commission of\u2019 the underlying robbery because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the short distance the victim was forced to walk did not result in any change of environment, and because it did not \u201cincrease[] the risk of harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in\u201d the robbery. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 209(b)(2); <em>see also People v. Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, 1139, 80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225 (1969). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In determining whether a movement is merely incidental to the underlying robbery under \u00a7 209, California courts examine the \u201c \u2018scope and nature\u2019 \u201d of the movement. <em>People v. Rayford, </em>9 Cal.4th 1, 12, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369 (1994) (quoting <em>Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d at 1131 n. 5, 80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225). In doing so, courts must consider \u201cthe context of the environment in which the movement occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Stevenson moved the victim from a remote, poorly lit area where there was no one else present to an area that was more brightly lit and where there was a police car. Stevenson did not merely \u201cmove his victim around inside the premises in which he [found] him.\u201d <em>Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d at 1140, 80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225. To the contrary, the movement of Nguyen from the area by his car to the intersection was \u201cexcess [and] gratuitous movement\u201d that was \u201cover and above that necessary to obtain the money\u201d in his victim\u2019s wallet. Indeed, the robbery was already complete before Stevenson moved his victim; the underlying robbery thus did not inherently \u201cinclude[ ] the risk of movement of the victim\u201d and cannot be characterized as incidental to the underlying offense. <em>People v. Washington, </em>127 Cal.App.4th 290, 299-300, 25 Cal.Rptr.3d 459 (Cal.Ct.App.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Moreover, the state court properly determined that the movement increased the risk of harm to the victim. Under California'law, courts should consider \u201cthe danger inherent in a victim\u2019s foreseeable attempts to escape\u201d in evaluating an increased risk of danger. <em>Rayford, </em>9 Cal.4th at 13, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d. 1369. There was a foreseeable possibility that the victim would attempt to escape, resulting in his being struck by an oncoming car or shot by his attackers. The victim testified at trial that as he was moved toward the intersection, with the expectation that his attackers were heading toward his apartment, where his parents were, he became increasingly scared because of his concern for what might happen to his family. He testified that when he reached the intersection, his attention was on the police car, and he aimed to attract the attention of the officers. In light of his fear for his family\u2019s safety and his focus on catching the attention of the police car, the state court properly concluded that the movement created a possibility that the victim would attempt to escape, a possibility that carried with it a risk of dangers that had not been present at the point of Stevenson\u2019s initial contact with his victim. \u201cThe fact that these dangers [did] not in fact materialize does not, of course, mean that the risk of harm was not increased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781. The state court\u2019s decision upholding Stevenson\u2019s conviction was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b443-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
