In his appellate brief, Honour asserts numerous claims, none of which merit relief. For example, Honour challenges the judicial rules limiting review to the issues raised in the informal brief and imposing page limits on appellate briefs. We reject these claims. To the extent that Honour objects to the handling of his prior cases by judges and court staff, we note that both courts and their staff are entitled to judicial immunity. <em>See Cleavinger v. Saxner, </em>474 U.S. 193, 200, 106 S.Ct. 496, 88 L.Ed.2d 507 (1985); <em>Mitchell v. McBryde, </em>944 F.2d 229, 230 (5th Cir.1991). Furthermore, Honour\u2019s conclusory claims of conspiracy do not state a claim for relief. <em>Phillips v. Mashbum, </em>746 F.2d 782, 785 (11th Cir. 1984). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, although we grant Honour\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, we affirm. Honour\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for a certificate of appeala-bility are denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
