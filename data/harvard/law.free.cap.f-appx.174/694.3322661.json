In his petition, Sanford alleged that the 123-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea for arson and mail fraud is invalid under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Sanford fried a timely notice of appeal, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-20\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s decision is <em>de novo. United States v. Cleary, </em>46 F.3d 307, 309-10 (3d Cir.1995). Sanford\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition may not be entertained unless a motion under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Sanford argued that his case falls within the exception set forth in <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). However, unlike the situation in <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>the decision in <em>Booker </em>did not decriminalize the conduct for which Sanford was convicted. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120-21 (3d Cir.2002). We agree with the District Court that it lacked jurisdiction over Sanford\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See also Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-21\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
