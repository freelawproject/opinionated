We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsa-meachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">As an initial matter, although the IJ made no reference to Mikaj\u2019s claim for relief under the CAT in his decision, Mikaj has abandoned this claim by omitting it from his appellate brief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">The IJ rested his adverse credibility finding on a single factor: Mikaj\u2019s failure to testify on direct examination about an incident set forth in his asylum application wherein two masked men invaded his home and attacked his family. This inconsistency was a \u201cspecific, cogent reason! ]\u201d that \u201cb[ore] a legitimate nexus\u201d to the adverse credibility finding. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74 (quoting <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307). A reasonable adjudicator would not have been compelled to credit Mikaj\u2019s testimony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73. Accordingly, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Even if the IJ erred in relying on the lack of a corroborating affidavit from petitioner\u2019s brother without giving petitioner an opportunity to explain its absence or why it was not reasonably available, <em>see Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 394-95 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 153 (2d Cir.2003), it is clear from his decision that he did not rely to any significant degree on this finding. We can confidently predict that the IJ would reach the same adverse credibility finding on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 162 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
