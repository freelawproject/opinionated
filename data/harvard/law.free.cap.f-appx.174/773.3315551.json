We affirm the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) relief for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Onwuazombe, </em>Nos. CR-91-305-JFM; CA-05-2856-1-JFM (D. Md. filed Oct. 18 &amp; entered Oct. 19, 2005). To the extent that Onwuazombe sought to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, an appeal may not be taken from the final order in a post-conviction proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of ap-pealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 </em>U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Onwuazombe has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal of the denial of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
