We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-22\">Franklin has failed to allege sufficient facts from which a trier of fact could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>conclude that there was an agreement or meeting of the minds between FranklinLipsker and state actors to violate his constitutional rights. <em>See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Phelps Dodge Corp., </em>865 F.2d 1589, 1540-41 (9th Cir.1989). While there is perhaps sufficient evidence to show that Franklin-Lipsker perjured herself, or that there was a conspiracy between her and her sister, there is simply no \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of a conspiracy involving state actors. <em>Radcliffe v. Rainbow Constr. Co., </em>254 F.3d 772, 782 (9th Cir.2001). Therefore, Franklin\u2019s claim must fail. The district court properly granted summary judgment for Franklin-Lipsker.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Furthermore, we hold that even if there were sufficient evidence of a conspiracy between Franklin-Lipsker and state actors, Franklin-Lipsker cannot be held liable because she is entitled to absolute witness immunity. <em>See Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 326, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). Franklin-Lipsker is not a complaining witness, defined as one \u201cwho makes statements in an affidavit submitted to a magistrate [judge] for the purpose of obtaining an arrest warrant.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Kauai County, </em>279 F.3d 1064, 1068 (9th Cir.2002). Because Franklin-Lipsker is not a complaining witness, she is entitled to absolute witness immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
