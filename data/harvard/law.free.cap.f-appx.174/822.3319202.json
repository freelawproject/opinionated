Cohen challenges the district court\u2019s application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of his case. As part of Cohen\u2019s plea agreement, however, he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence except for an upward departure. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994). We therefore decline to consider Cohen\u2019s arguments that challenge the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We do consider, however, Cohen\u2019s contention that the district court erroneously decided that an upward sentencing departure was warranted under the facts of his case. Cohen also contends that the extent of the departure was unreasonable. Cohen has not shown that the decision to upwardly depart was either unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 310 &amp; n. 46 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 810, 163 L.Ed.2d 637 (2005). The decision was grounded in an acceptable basis. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Further, the extent of the departure was acceptable. <em>See Saldana, </em>427 F.3d at 312-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b847-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
