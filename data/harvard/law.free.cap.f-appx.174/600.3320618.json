Feuerstein, <em>Judge) </em>be, and it hereby is, REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-24\">Defendant-appellant Jose Bernal-Ibanos appeals the sentence he received following his conviction, upon a plea of guilty, of reentry after removal for conviction of an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). He was sentenced to 96 months imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the proceedings below, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-25\">Bernal-Ibanos is entitled to a remand to be resentenced under the <em>post-Booker </em>non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>mandatory Guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Fagans, </em>406 F.8d 138, 141 (2d Cir.2005). We decline to exercise our discretion under <em>Fagans, </em>to adjudicate Bernal-Ibanos\u2019 challenge to the district court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 141. In addition, we decline to address Bernal-Ibanos\u2019 challenge to the additional criminal history point assessed for an offense arising in Ohio that he alleges he did not commit. The district court will consider these questions upon resentencing under the standards of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Accordingly, we remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Fagans, </em>and refer defendant\u2019s challenge to its upward departure and to the Ohio sentence for consideration on remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
