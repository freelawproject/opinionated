Butcher, appeals the pre-Roofcer prison sentence of 37 months imposed upon him as a result of his guilty plea to the charge of making a false statement in the acquisition of a firearm. Before this court, he asserts that the district judge erred in his calculation under the sentencing guidelines by considering Butcher\u2019s previous conviction for involuntary manslaughter to be one for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He also contends that the sentencing court committed plain error by treating the guidelines as mandatory rather than merely advisory. Although we conclude that the district court was justified in treating the defendant\u2019s prior offense as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d circuit precedent requires that Butcher\u2019s sentence be vacated and this matter remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">This case arose from the defendant\u2019s purchase of a Remington 12-gauge shotgun from a K-Mart store in Conneaut, Ohio. When presented with the required form to be submitted to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Butcher indicated that he had not previously been convicted of a felony and was not then subject to any felony indictment. In fact, however, the defendant well knew that he had previously been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in Ohio and that he was at that time also under indictment for aggravated vehicular assault. Law enforcement authorities eventually arrested Butcher for making a false statement in the acquisition of a firearm, and the defendant pleaded guilty to that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing was held prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s release of its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As a result, the district judge treated the United States Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory and increased Butcher\u2019s base offense level from 14 to 20 because of his prior conviction for involuntary manslaughter, a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) and (4) (2003). The court subsequently decreased the total offense level by three based on Butcher\u2019s timely acceptance of responsibility and sentenced the defendant as a level 17, criminal history category IV offender to 37 months in prison, the minimum sentence in the applicable range of 37-46 months. Butcher now appeals that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The defendant correctly contends that the sentence imposed upon him must be vacated and the matter remanded to the district court for resentencing because the district judge treated the guideline sentencing range as mandatory rather than merely advisory in nature. The government concedes that we have consistently held that sentencing under such a misconception\u2014however unintentional on the part of the district court\u2014amounts to plain error, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Hudson, </em>405 F.3d 425, 445 (6th Cir.2005), especially where a defendant has been sentenced to the lowest possible sentence in an applicable range. <em>See United States v. Hollings-worth, </em>414 F.3d 621, 624 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Nevertheless, we must still examine Butcher\u2019s appellate challenge to the application of a specific guideline provision to his sentencing determination. Even after <em>Booker, </em>any resentencing must include, among other considerations, a calculation of the appropriate guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">A conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) for making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm falls under \u00a7 2K2.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL App. A (2003). As a convicted felon, Butcher thus would ordinarily have been subject to sentencing pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6), establishing a base offense level of 14. The district court, however, determined that the defendant\u2019s base offense level should be increased to 20 because \u201cthe defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of ... a crime of violence .... \u201d U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">The application notes to \u00a7 2K2.1 specify that the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u201chas the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES manual \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.5) (2003). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>turn, \u00a7 4B1.2(a) defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Furthermore, application note 1 to the commentary on \u00a7 4B1.2 explicitly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cCrime of violence\u201d includes murder, <em>manslaughter, </em>kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i <em>e., </em>expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved the use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The guidelines, therefore, categorically define manslaughter, whether voluntary or involuntary, as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for guidelines purposes. <em>See also United States v. Sanders, </em>97 F.3d 856, 859-60 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that, for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), involuntary manslaughter in Ohio is a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d the definition of which is identical for all relevant purposes to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)). Thus, in calculating the appropriate guidelines sentencing range, the district court properly increased the defendant\u2019s base offense level from 14 to 20 because Butcher\u2019s prior involuntary manslaughter conviction is considered, for guidelines purposes, a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Butcher nevertheless argues that the indictment in his involuntary manslaughter case indicates that the facts underlying that earlier conviction\u2014the accidental death of a young boy caused by the defendant allowing his own underage son to operate a motor vehicle\u2014does not reflect upon <em>the defendant\u2019s own </em>propensity or lack of propensity for violence. Such an argument is appropriate for the resentencing hearing when the district judge may, and indeed must, take into consideration not only the suggested guidelines sentence, but also each of the other six factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See, e.g. United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 (6th Cir.2006) (even a sentence within the guidelines range is not reasonable \u201cif there is no evidence that the district court followed its statutory mandate to \u2018impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u2019 to comply with the purposes of sentencing in section 3553(a)(2)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">The defendant also contends that the presentence report prepared in his case improperly sought to justify categorization of Butcher\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by reference to language in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) that describes crimes involving the use of physical force against another person. Butcher maintains that he used no \u201cforce\u201d against the manslaughter victim and, even though his actions could be considered to present a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), the government did not object to the presentence report\u2019s failure to invoke that basis for sentence enhancement. Viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1) and (2) in isolation, an argument could be made that the probation officer and the district court did not align the defendant\u2019s prior conviction with the proper guideline justification for sentence enhancement. However, any confusion in this regard can be resolved on remand by specific reference to subsection (a)(2) in the district court\u2019s sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The district court sentenced the defendant under the then-existing statutory provision\u2014since invalidated\u2014that made the guidelines mandatory, not merely advisory. The sentence imposed upon Butcher must, therefore, be VACATED and this case REMANDED for resentencing. After <em>Booker, </em>one component of a district court\u2019s sentencing determination continues to be consideration of the sentencing range calculated in accordance with the applicable provisions of the guidelines. In this case, such consideration requires a recognition by the sentencing court of the fact that the Ohio offense of manslaughter categorically constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d On remand, the district court must give due consideration to the guidelines range but should also determine what sentence is \u201creasonable\u201d in light of the appropriate factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion to take judicial notice of prior state conviction\u201d is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
