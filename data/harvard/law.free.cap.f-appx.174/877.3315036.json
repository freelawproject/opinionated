We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny May\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, and we vacate the sentence, remanding for resentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">Evidence at trial established the following facts. May operated and controlled the finances of Maranatha Financial Group, Inc., as its registered agent, majority shareholder, and president. Investigating May\u2019s tax-filing conduct, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found that from June 1990 through December 1996 May withheld federal income taxes from his employees\u2019 paychecks, but failed to pay over those taxes to the IRS and failed to file employment and corporate income tax returns. Although May filed individual income tax returns for 1995 and 1996, he failed to pay over taxes he reported withholding from his own salary. The taxes May claimed to have withheld from his and his employees\u2019 paychecks remained in Maranatha\u2019s bank account. Maranatha\u2019s payroll tax liability amounted to $1,441,812, and May\u2019s personal income tax liability amounted to $418,325.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">The district court sentenced May to 72 months\u2019 incarceration and three years\u2019 supervised release, and it ordered May to pay $600 in special assessments and $728,090 in restitution to the IRS. On appeal May argues that the district court: (1) erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the tax-evasion charges; (2) plainly erred by failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of \u201cwillfully\u201d; and (3) plainly erred by treating the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">First, the district court did not err in denying May\u2019s motion for judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>acquittal on the tax evasion charges. In general, an employer must withhold an employee\u2019s share of federal income tax from each paycheck. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8102(a), 3402(a). The employer must then pay over those sums to the IRS. If the taxes are <em>actually withheld </em>from the employee\u2019s wages, but not remitted to the IRS, the employee may credit the taxes against his tax liability. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 31 (\u201cThe amount withheld as tax under chapter 24 ... shall be allowed to the recipient of the income as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle.... \u201d); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.31-l(a) (\u201cIf the tax has actually been withheld at the source, credit or refund shall be made to the recipient of the income even though such tax has not been paid over to the Government by the employer.\u201d); <em>Slodov v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 238, 243, 98 S.Ct. 1778, 56 L.Ed.2d 251 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">May contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that federal income taxes were not actually withheld from his wages. He adds that because the evidence proves that the taxes were actually withheld, he should receive credit for those taxes and thus cannot be convicted of tax evasion. As proof that the taxes were actually withheld, May points to his pay stub from Paychex\u2014a payroll processing company that issued paychecks to Maranatha\u2019s employees in 1995 and 1996\u2014 reporting taxes it deducted from Marana-tha employees\u2019 wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Evidence at trial, however, established that neither Paychex nor May, acting on behalf of Maranatha, actually withheld the taxes from May\u2019s wages. May gave Pay-chex funds covering only the employees\u2019 wages; Paychex never received or possessed the gross pay sums. May, moreover, retained those corporate funds (the difference between the gross and net pay due employees) in Maranatha\u2019s corporate bank account, an account May personally controlled and accessed for personal expenditures. Because the evidence supports a finding that May did not actually withhold the taxes from his wages as reflected on his Paychex pay stub, May cannot claim a credit for those taxes. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision denying May\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Second, we reject May\u2019s argument that the district court plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of \u201cwillfully,\u201d an element of tax evasion and failure to pay over. The record establishes that the district court <em>did </em>instruct the jury at length on the meaning of \u201cwillfully\u201d and therefore did not plainly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Third, in light of the government\u2019s concession that the district court plainly erred by treating the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, we vacate the sentence and remand the case for resentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We therefore decline to address May\u2019s other challenges to his sentence and urge him to present those to the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny May\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, vacate May\u2019s sentence, and remand the case for <em>Booker </em>resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
