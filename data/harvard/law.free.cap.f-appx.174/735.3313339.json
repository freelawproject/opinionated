McNair appeals his 37-month sentence, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure and that his sentence was excessive and unreasonable when considered in light of all the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005). We affirm McNair\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">McNair\u2019s 37-month sentence was both within the guideline range of 37 to 46 months, and well within the statutory maximum of ten years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). We decline to review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart from the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 622, 626-28, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30 (4th Cir.1990). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">Accordingly, we affirm McNair\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
