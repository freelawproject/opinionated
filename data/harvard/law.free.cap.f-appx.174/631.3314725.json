We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-22\">\u201cThe scope of our review of the board\u2019s findings that an employer committed unfair labor practices is quite limited.\u201d <em>NLRB v. J. Coty Messenger Serv., Inc., </em>763 F.2d 92, 96 (2d Cir.1985). We will uphold the Board\u2019s findings of fact that are supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>NLRB v. Local 32B-32J Serv. Employees Int'l Union, </em>353 F.3d 197, 199 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cEven if a court could draw different conclusions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>those drawn by the agency, that would not prevent the agency\u2019s decision from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Kinney Drugs, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>74 F.3d 1419, 1427 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Moreover, \u201c[w]hen the NLRB\u2019s findings are based on the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses, they will not be overturned unless they are hopelessly incredible or they flatly contradict either the law of nature or undisputed documentary testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The respondent\u2019s arguments are primarily variations on the theme that the ALJ should have found its witnesses credible. Yet the respondent cannot prevail simply by recasting the evidence in the light most favorable to the respondent. Nor do we find that the ALJ\u2019s occasional overstatement of the standard for assessing the credibility of current employees set forth in <em>Flexsteel Industries, Inc., </em>316 N.L.R.B. 745 (1995), undermines his credibility findings, given the breadth of the factors the ALJ actually considered in assessing credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We have considered all of the respondent\u2019s arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons given by the Board and the ALJ, <em>see The Jewish Home for the Elderly of Fairfield County, </em>343 N.L.R.B. No. 117, 2004 WL 2967815 (2004), the petition for enforcement is hereby GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
