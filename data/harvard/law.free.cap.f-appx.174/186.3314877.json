The IJ had substantial evidence, <em>see Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994), that Maknojia failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-19\">Although Maknojia alleged that on several occasions he and his family had faced persecution on account of being Muslims living in a predominantly Hindu country, he did not show that such persecution would likely occur upon his return. Furthermore, the IJ noted that approximately 120,000,000 Muslims live in India, and Maknojia did not satisfactorily explain why he could not relocate to a predominantly Muslim area in India to be free from religious reprisals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-20\">Likewise, Maknojia has not proven that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Under the CAT, he need not demonstrate a connection between the probability of future torture and his race, religion, nationality, or political or social affiliation. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>899, 908 (5th Cir.2002). But, he must meet the \u201chigher bar\u201d of proving the likelihood of torture as opposed to mere persecution. <em>Id. </em>Because his evidence consists mainly of the same series of previous unfortunate events used to support his persecution claim, the BIA did not err in finding that he failed to meet his burden of proving that he -will probably face torture if returned to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-13\">. Because the BIA affirmed without extended analysis, we may consider the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency action for purposes of this petition for review. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 343 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-14\">. Maknojia does not allege extraordinary or changed circumstances that would excuse his failure to file an application for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States, and we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination of untimeliness. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Therefore, only withholding of removal is at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b211-22\">. <em>INS </em>v. <em>Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-23\">.
