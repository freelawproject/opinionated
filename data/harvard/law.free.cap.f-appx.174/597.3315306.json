We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-23\">This Court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001). An abuse of discretion may be found where the decision under review \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233-34 (2d Cir.2005) <em>(per curiam); Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">A petition for review challenging an order entered <em>in abstentia </em>is \u201cconfined to (i) the validity of the notice provided to the alien, (ii) the reasons for the alien\u2019s not attending the proceeding, and (iii) whether or not the alien is removable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(D). An <em>in absentia </em>removal order may be rescinded if, within 180 days after entry of the order, the alien moves to reopen and can demonstrate, among other things, that his failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Exceptional circumstances include circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as \u201cserious illness of the alien,\u201d but do not include \u201cless compelling circumstances.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In this case, assuming that Song\u2019s supporting documentation is authentic and Song was in fact ill from April 2003 to May 2003, such evidentiary support does not address Song\u2019s absence from the March 13, 2003 hearing. As such, Song\u2019s argument that her illness constituted \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d beyond her control as required by the INA, is without merit. Additionally, as the BIA pointed out, Song made no effort to contact the INS prior to the hearing date of her illness or her inability to attend the proceedings. Song now offers no argument for failing to make such a notification. Lastly, the BIA did not err by refusing to consider any new supporting information since the BIA can no longer engage in factfinding. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (2005); 165 Fed.Reg. 54,-878, 54,905 (Aug. 26, 2002) (eliminating BIA\u2019s powers of <em>de novo </em>review and fact-finding). The BIA, therefore, did not exceed its allowable discretion in dismissing Song\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Song\u2019s pending motion for a stay of deportation is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
