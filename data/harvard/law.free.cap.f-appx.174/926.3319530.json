The district court sentenced each defendant under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 Drug Equivalency Tables, determining the methamphetamine equivalents of the quantities of pseu-doephedrine. Appellants challenge the validity of the relevant Guidelines, arguing that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s promulgation of the pseudoephedrine-to-metham-phetamine equivalency ratio ran afoul of the Commission\u2019s congressional directive. Because Appellants have not shown that the Commission failed to follow Congress\u2019s mandate, we affirm Appellants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b951-19\">Pseudoephedrine is \u201craw material\u201d used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, and different manufacturing processes produce different yields. Before the enactment of the Guidelines at issue in this case, courts relied on expert testimony to estimate pseudoephedrine-to-methamphet-amine yields. Then, in 2000, Congress passed the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, directing the Sentencing Commission to enact a Guidelines amendment structuring the penalty for illegal posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>sion of pseudoephedrine at a level reflective of \u201cthe quantity of [methamphetamine] that could reasonably have been manufactured\u201d from the pseudoephedrine. Pub.L. No. 106-310, \u00a7 3651, 114 Stat. 1101, 1238-39. The Act instructed the Sentencing Commission to determine a conversion ratio for the manufacture of methamphetamine from pseudoephedrine \u201cbased on scientific, law enforcement, and other data the Sentencing Commission considered] appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Acting on this mandate, the Sentencing Commission added tables to sections 2Dl.ll(d) and 2D1.1 (application note 10) of the Guidelines, establishing a two-to-one ratio of pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. In arriving at its ratio, the Commission used \u201cdata from the Drug Enforcement Agency, Office of Diversion Control, as published on the web site of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). These data indicate that the actual yield of methamphetamine from ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is \u2018typically in the range of 50 to 75 percent.\u2019 \u201d Proposed Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, 66 Fed.Reg. 7962, 7965 (Jan. 26, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">After Appellants pleaded guilty to drug charges, the trial court .determined their sentences according to the amount of pseu-doephedrine in their possession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants objected to the court\u2019s use of the Sentencing Guidelines, but the district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Appellants challenge the validity of the portion of the Drug Equivalency Table under which they were sentenced. If in promulgating its ratio for the Drug Equivalency Table the Commission acted inconsistently with Congress\u2019s plain language, Congress\u2019s language trumps the inconsistent ratio. <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 757, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997); <em>see United States v. Butler, </em>207 F.3d 839, 852 (6th Cir.2000). Yet we \u201c \u2018defer to [the Commission\u2019s] interpretation as long as it is \u201csufficiently reasonable\u201d in light of the Congressional directive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Butler, </em>207 F.3d at 850 (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>53 F.3d 769, 772 (6th Cir.1995)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Congress directed the Commission to determine the drug equivalency ratio \u201cbased on scientific, law enforcement, and other data the Sentencing Commission considered] appropriate.\u201d Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act \u00a7 3651. In Appellants\u2019 view, the Commission based its ratio on Drug Enforcement Agency <em>conclusions, </em>and \u201c[b]asing a decision on someone else\u2019s conclusions is all together [sic] different from analyzing the available data and reaching one\u2019s own conclusion.\u201d Appellants quote the Minutes of the Sentencing Commission: \u201cThe Commission based the proposed penalty structure on the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s determination that the average yield is between 50 and 75 percent.\u201d Minutes of the March 20, 2001 United States Sentencing Commission Business Meeting, http://www.ussc.gov/MIN - UTES/3_20_01.htm (last visited Mar. 13, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"A5L\">The Commission\u2019s single characterization of the DEA information\u2014in its meeting minutes, no less\u2014is not determinative. The Commission elsewhere characterized this information as \u201cdata\u201d: \u201c[The ratio] is based on <em>data </em>from the DEA that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the actual yield ... is in the range of 50 to 75 percent.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C (Supp. at 109-10) (2001) (emphasis added). Similarly, the Commission\u2019s Notice of Proposed Amendments describes its ratio as based on data: \u201cThis table ... was developed from <em>data </em>from the Drug Enforcement Agency.... These <em>data </em>indicate that the actual yield of methamphetamine <em>from ... </em>pseudoephed-rine is \u2018typically in the range of 50 to 75 percent.\u2019 \u201d 66 Fed.Reg. at 7965 (emphasis added). Further, even if the Commission relied on a DEA \u201cdetermination,\u201d such a determination would suffice as data because the word \u201cdata\u201d denotes \u201c[ijnformation, esp. information organized for analysis <em>or used as the basis for a decision-making. </em>\u201d Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 287-88 (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Appellants also argue that the \u201cDEA\u2019s ... determination that a typical yield was in the range of 50%-75% ... conflict[ed] with other available DEA sources at the time,\u201d citing DEA testimony before Congress and before courts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Eschman, </em>227 F.3d 886, 889 (7th Cir.2000) (\u201cVirginia Kleekamp, a chemist with the Drug Enforcement Administration ... indicated that an average yield for a clandestine laboratory is from 40% to 60%, but she has noted yields as high as 85%.\u201d). Variations in the DEA\u2019s\u2014or its employees\u2019\u2014yield estimates, however, do not aid Appellants\u2019 case. Congress directed the Commission to determine, \u201cbased on scientific, law enforcement, and other data the Sentencing Commission considered] appropriate,\u201d the quantity of methamphetamine that <em>\u201ccould reasonably have been manufactured\u201d </em>from pseudoephed-rine. Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act \u00a7 3651 (emphasis added). The Commission\u2019s determination is neither arbitrary and capricious nor otherwise unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>438 F.3d 621, 635-37 (6th Cir.2006) (rejecting an identical challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Finally, Appellants contend that the Commission based the ratio only on law enforcement data and thereby failed to follow Congress\u2019s directive to base the ratio on \u201cscientific, law enforcement, and other data the Sentencing Commission considered] appropriate.\u201d Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act \u00a7 3651. In <em>United States v. Martin, </em>a panel of this court employed \u201cthe rule of the last antecedent\u201d to hold that the Congressional directive mandated that the Commission base the ratio on, at a minimum, \u201cscientific and law enforcement\u201d data.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id </em>at 630. Even if we assume, as did the panel in <em>Martin, </em>that the court may \u201cdelve into the Commission\u2019s methodology as a general matter,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 633, Appellants nevertheless fail to demonstrate that the Commission relied on law enforcement data to the exclusion of scientific data. Appellants attempt to show that the Commission utilized only law enforcement data by pointing to the Commission\u2019s statements referencing the DEA report. But, as the <em>Martin </em>panel discussed, \u201cDEA reports could contain ... both scientific data ... as well as law enforcement statistics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634. As in <em>Martin, </em>\u201c[t]he record before us includes no testimony and no further documentation regarding the Commission\u2019s method of selecting the new 50% conversion ratio,\u201d and this record \u201cdo[es] not suffice to demonstrate that the Commission failed to base its ratio on both scientific and law enforcement data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Because Appellants fail to demonstrate that the Commission deviated from the congressional mandate, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s sentencing Appellants pursuant to the Drug Equivalency Tables. We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-8\">. Appellants McAlister and Dixon pleaded guilty to possession of chemicals and equipment used in methamphetamine manufacturing. Although Appellant Graham pleaded guilty only to possession of methamphetamine, the court imposed his sentence based on possession of both methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine, after converting the pseu-doephedrine to methamphetamine under the Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-6\">. The panel held that the restrictive clause \"the Sentencing Commission considers appropriate\u201d modifies only \"other\u201d data and not \"scientific\u201d or \"law enforcement\u201d data. The panel did not address the fact that all three adjectival terms modify the same noun, \"data,\u201d so that one could conclude that the restrictive clause modifies the norm \"data,\u201d which is in turn distributed across the three adjectival terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b954-5\">RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">I concur in the result reached by the majority opinion and, in large part, with its reasoning. Nevertheless, I write separately because I disagree with the comment set forth in footnote 2 regarding <em>United States v. Martin, </em>438 F.3d 621 (6th Cir.2006). As the author of the <em>Martin </em>opinion, I believe that the panel in that case properly applied the rule of the last antecedent to the statute at issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
