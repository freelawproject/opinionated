For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss the appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B); <em>see also Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-23\">The parties are familiar with the facts, so we will only briefly revisit them here. In November 2004, Bierley was sentenced by Judge DiSantis in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County to a term of two to eleven months\u2019 imprisonment. As a condition of Bierley\u2019s parole, Judge DiSan-tis restricted his access to the Erie County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Courthouse. Specifically, Bierley was required to give prior notice to his parole officer if he wished to conduct official business on his own behalf or testify as a witness during his parole period. However, if Bierley wanted access to the Courthouse for any other reason, Judge DiSan-tis\u2019 prior approval was necessary. On February 3, 2005, Bierley entered the Courthouse to \u201cconduct! ] business on a civil matter.\u201d However, because Bierley had neither given prior notice to his parole officer nor received permission from Judge DiSantis to enter the Courthouse, Bierley was ordered to leave the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The following day, Bierley initiated the underlying civil rights action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In his complaint and subsequent amended complaint, Bier-ley alleged violations of his rights to due process, equal protection, and access to the courts resulting from the 2004 state criminal proceedings and his removal from the Courthouse on February 3, 2005. Bierley sought compensatory damages, and declaratory and injunctive relief. The defendants responded to Bierley\u2019s complaint by arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his claims were without merit and that they were entitled to either qualified or absolute immunity. On May 26, 2005, the District Court held a 40-minute telephonic hearing with Bierley and counsel for the defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, by order entered May 31, 2005, the District Court dismissed Bierley\u2019s action. Bierley then filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied by order entered July 1, 2005. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Bierley has been granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pawperis </em>on appeal, this Court must dismiss his appeal if it is \u201cfrivolous.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). A frivolous appeal has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827. After a careful review of the record, including the transcript of the May 26 hearing, we will dismiss this appeal because Bierley\u2019s claims lack an arguable basis in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">We turn first to Bierley\u2019s claims regarding his 2004 state court conviction. Insofar as Bierley is attempting to challenge the fact or duration of his conviction or sentence, a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is the exclusive method for seeking relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Likewise, to the extent that Bierley\u2019s claims \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d they are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Gilles v. Davis, </em>427 F.3d 197, 208-210 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Moreover, to the extent that any of the remaining claims can arguably survive the <em>Heck </em>bar, we find them to be merit-less. Bierley\u2019s claims against Judge DiSantis are, of course, barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity. It is a well-established principle that judges are absolutely immune from suits for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when they act in a judicial capacity. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (citation omitted) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>(\u201cA judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d). Because the acts Bierley complains of\u2014sentencing, denial of pre-trial motions, and the conditions of parole\u2014were all performed by Judge DiSantis in his official capacity, Judge DiSantis is entitled to judicial immunity. <em>See, Gallas v. Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, </em>211 F.3d 760, 768-69 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We next address Bierley\u2019s claims regarding his February 3, 2005, removal from the Courthouse. To bring a successful equal protection claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove the existence of purposeful discrimination, and demonstrate that he was treated differently from individuals similarly situated. <em>See Keenan v. City of Philadelphia, </em>983 F.2d 459, 465 (3d Cir.1992). Bierley simply failed to allege any facts in the District Court which can be construed as establishing a viable equal protection claim. Bierley\u2019s due process allegations regarding the events of February 3, 2005, are likewise without merit. On November 29, 2004, Judge DiSantis drafted a memorandum to defendant Sheriff Merski, explaining that Bierley\u2019s access to the Courthouse was restricted during the period of his parole. Bierley alleges that the defendants violated his due process rights by failing to serve him with a copy of Judge DiSantis\u2019 memorandum as required by Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 114, and by removing him from the Courthouse without giving him prior notice of the conditions of his parole. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Bierley was entitled to a copy of Judge DiSantis\u2019 memorandum under Pennsylvania law, it is well-established that \u201cstate law does not ordinarily define the parameters of due process for Fourteenth Amendment purposes; rather, the minimum, constitutionally mandated requirements of due process in a given context and ease are supplied and defined by federal law, not by state law or regulations.\u201d <em>Shuman ex rel. Shertzer v. Penn Manor Sch. Dist., </em>422 F.3d 141, 150 n. 4 (quotation and citation omitted). Bierley does not assert that he was not present at his November 4, 2004, sentencing hearing where Judge DiSantis explained the conditions of his parole, and he simply fails to allege that he was deprived of any process due him under federal law. Under these circumstances, we can deduce no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Finally, a violation of the First Amendment right of access to the courts is only established where a litigant shows that he was actually injured by the alleged denial of access. The actual injury requirement is a constitutional prerequisite to suit. <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002) (explaining that the constitutional right of access is \u201cancillary to the underlying claim, without which a plaintiff cannot have suffered injury by being shut out of court\u201d). An actual injury is shown only where a non-frivolous, arguable claim is lost. <em>Christopher, </em>536 U.S. at 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179. Bierley has not alleged, must less established, that he suffered the loss of a non-frivolous legal claim when he was ordered to leave the Courthouse. Furthermore, Bierley\u2019s parole restrictions did not preclude him from filing lawsuits, or even entering the Courthouse; instead, he needed merely to contact his parole officer or Judge DiSantis before doing so. Thus, we have little difficulty concluding that Bierley\u2019s access to the courts claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Having found no merit to this appeal, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\">.

Pa. Civ. No. 04\u201400363. Bierley\u2019s petition is presently pending in the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
