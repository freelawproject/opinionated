Hawkins asserted claims under the First, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments, as well as the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. According to Hawkins, the defendants violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>rights by making certain rulings between 1999 and 2004 during numerous state court proceedings where he had appeared on behalf of a variety of clients. The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss Hawkins\u2019 amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In their motion to dismiss, the defendants argued that Hawkins\u2019 claims were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>and <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrines,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Eleventh Amendment, judicial immunity, and the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">By order entered August 31, 2005, the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. First, to the extent that Hawkins\u2019 claims had been \u201cactually litigated in state court,\u201d or were \u201cinextricably intertwined with [the] state court adjudication[s],\u201d the District Court concluded that they were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Desi\u2019s Pizza, Inc. v. City of Wilkes-Barre, </em>321 F.3d 411, 419 (3d Cir.2003) (quotations and citations omitted). Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Hawkins\u2019 claims were not barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the District Court concluded that the Supreme Court of New Jersey and the Office of the Attorney General for the State of New Jersey were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, while the remaining defendants were entitled to judicial immunity. Finally, the District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Hawkins\u2019 state law claim. This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Hawkins\u2019 amended complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Gary v. Air Group, Inc., </em>397 F.3d 183, 186 (3d Cir.2005). Because we are reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to the Hawkins. <em>Doug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., </em>232 F.3d 173, 183 (3d Cir.2000). We may affirm on any grounds supported by the record. <em>Nicini v. Mor-ra, </em>212 F.3d 798, 805 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">After careful review of the record, and the appellate briefs, we will affirm the August 31, 2005, order for essentially the same reasons set forth by the District Court. We write here briefly only to add the following. We agree with the District Court that Hawkins is not merely raising a \u201cgeneral constitutional challenge\u201d to the rules and procedures used by. the New Jersey state courts, but is instead primarily challenging the allegedly unconstitutional practices and acts to which he was subjected. <em>Compare Centifanti v. Nix, </em>865 F.2d 1422, 1429 (3d Cir.1989) <em>(Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply where \u201c[t]he declaratory judgment [a plaintiff] seeks is prospective and directed toward the rules and procedures for considering [future] petitions for reinstatement, rather than toward the decision of the state supreme court on [the plaintiffs] prior petition\u201d), <em>with Stern v. Nix, </em>840 F.2d 208 (3d Cir.1988) (holding that because the suit at issue effectively required review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>state court\u2019s judgment in the plaintiffs particular case, it was not a \u201cgeneral challenge\u201d and, therefore, was barred by Rooker-Feldman). One telltale indication that Hawkins is not simply raising a general challenge to state court rules and procedures is the \u201cextensive exposition of the specific facts\u201d of Hawkins\u2019 state court cases in his amended complaint, \u201cwhich hardly would have been necessary if the district court were being asked only to assess the validity\u201d of the rules and procedures in their general application. <em>Stern, </em>840 F.2d at 212-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Hawkins\u2019 claims were not barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>his amended complaint would have been subject to dismissal in any event under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. First, even aside from the issue of sovereign immunity,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> neither the Supreme Court of New Jersey nor the Office of the Attorney General for the State of New Jersey is a \u201cperson\u201d subject to liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Second, although the District Court did not specifically address Hawkins\u2019 allegations that he is entitled to relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, when finding the defendant justice and judges immune from suit for monetary damages and injunctive relief, the District Court did not err in dismissing these claims because Hawkins is not entitled to the declaratory relief he seeks. <em>See Johnson v. Onion, </em>761 F.2d 224, 225 (5th Cir.1985) (concluding that the Declaratory Judgment Act cannot be used to obtain relief where appellant claimed that past judicial conduct violated his constitutional rights); <em>see also Emory v. Peeler, </em>756 F.2d 1547, 1552 (11th Cir.1985) (noting that a \u201cdeclaration that [a judge\u2019s] past conduct violated [a plaintiffs] constitutional rights ... would be nothing more than a gratuitous comment without any force or effect\u201d) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons we will affirm the District Court\u2019s August 31, 2005 order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\">. On appeal, Hawkins argues that the District Court should have disqualified the Office of the Attorney General for the State of New Jersey as counsel for the defendants. The District Court declined to consider this issue because Hawkins failed to file a motion to disqualify. Because this issue was not properly raised in the District Court, we decline to consider it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\">. We do note, for Hawkins' benefit, that the <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), exception to sovereign immunity permits suits for prospective injunc-tive relief against individual <em>state officials </em>in their official capacities. A careful reading of the District Court\u2019s August 31, 2005, order, however, clearly shows that the District Court determined only that the Supreme Court of New Jersey and the Office of the Attorney General for the State of New Jersey were entitled to sovereign immunity, not the named state officials. As such, <em>Young </em>is not applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
