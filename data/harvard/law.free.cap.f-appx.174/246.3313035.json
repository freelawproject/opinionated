Cressionnie, Mississippi prisoner #22155, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application challenging his convictions for escape, grand larceny, and petit larceny as time-barred. This court has granted Cression-nie a certificate of appealability on the limited issue of whether his state habeas corpus application filed in the state circuit court on November 19, 2001, tolled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>statute of limitations and made his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application timely. <em>See Cressionnie v. Cabana, </em>No. 04-60259 (5th Cir. Oct.26, 2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Cressionnie argues that his state habeas application was properly filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) and tolled the statute of limitations during its pendency. If the application was not properly filed, he contends that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled because he was actively misled into believing that the application was properly filed. The respondent asserts that Cressionnie\u2019s state habeas application challenged his extradition from Florida to Mississippi to face the charges for which he was convicted, that Cression-nie did not have standing to bring that challenge, and that the state circuit court, therefore, did not have jurisdiction to consider it, making the application not properly filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) established \u201can explicit limitation period for state prisoners filing federal habeas petitions.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 711 (5th Cir.1999). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), a prisoner has one year from the latest of various events, including \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review,\u201d to file a federal habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The period during which a \u201cproperly filed application for state post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d regarding the same conviction is pending is not counted toward the one-year period. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Fields v. Johnson, </em>159 F.3d 914, 916 (5th Cir.1998). This court reviews a district court\u2019s determination that a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application was untimely de novo. See <em>Melancon v. Kaylo, </em>259 F.3d 401, 404 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The respondent\u2019s argument misconstrues the relevant precedent. Whether the state circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the claim raised by Cressionnie in his state habeas application is irrelevant to the issue of whether the application was properly filed; the relevant question was whether the state circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the application itself, regardless of whether it lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims contained therein. <em>See Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8-11, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000); <em>Larry v. Dretke, </em>361 F.3d 890, 893 (5th Cir.2004). The state circuit court had jurisdiction to consider Cressionnie\u2019s state habeas application. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-43-7; <em>Bubac v. Boston, </em>600 So.2d 951, 953 (Miss. 1992). Accordingly, Cressionnie\u2019s state habeas application was properly filed and tolled the statute of limitations pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), making his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application timely. <em>See Ar-tuz, </em>531 U.S. at 8-11, 121 S.Ct. 361; <em>Larry, </em>361 F.3d at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
