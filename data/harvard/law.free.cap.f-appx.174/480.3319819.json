Because we find Dye has failed to point to any evidence that Radcliff acted under color of state law, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">This appeal arises out of a dispute between neighboring property owners along the Emeralda Marsh in Florida. Radcliff began to complain to authorities at the Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) about unauthorized hunting on his land after he had terminated Dye\u2019s employment as his ranch manager in November 2000. Rl-34, Steinke Affidavit 116. He repeatedly complained about such unauthorized hunting particularly by Dye and his son, Keith Dye. <em>Id. </em>Some of the complaints were registered by Radcliffs new ranch manager, Larry Gephardt. <em>Id., </em>Fisher Affidavit H 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">After one such complaint, Commission officers went out to Radcliffs property on 1 December 2001 to investigate. After hearing gunshots, they stopped Dye and his son who were traveling through a passage of water called the \u201cNarrows\u201d with two dead deer in their air boat. They denied having been on Radcliffs property at any time. Dye\u2019s son was cited for hunting without a license but both Dyes were permitted to leave. The officers warned them, however, that they would be investigating the issue of trespassing. Keith Dye later admitted responsibility for killing two other deer found on Radcliffs property and was charged with exceeding the legally prescribed hunting limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">Later in the day, Gephardt informed the officers that the \u201cNarrows\u201d was within the boundaries of Radcliffs ranch and that Radcliff wanted to press charges for trespassing. The Commission proceeded, in cooperation with the Lake County Geographic Information System Division and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s Bureau of Surveying and Mapping and the State Cadastral Surveyor, to determine whether the \u201cNarrows\u201d and the location where the deer were found were navigable waters and were therefore considered \u201csovereignty lands,\u201d a determination that would negate the possibility of trespass. After receiving a report from Terry Wilkinson, Chief of the Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, which concluded that the \u201cNarrows\u201d did not constitute navigable waters, the Commission forwarded a copy of that report and its own report on the 1 December 2001 air boat stop to the State Attorney\u2019s office. On 4 March 2002, Ronald Dye was charged with armed trespass. The charge was later dismissed by the state trial court, which concluded that Dye had a right to travel through the \u201cNarrows\u201d up to the point of the high water mark both because he was a riparian property owners of lands adjacent to the Emeralda Marsh and because the Dye family\u2019s hostile, continuous, and adverse use of the \u201cNarrows\u201d had established a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Dye alleges that his prosecution for armed trespass was malicious and resulted from a conspiracy among Radcliff and officers of the Commission to deprive him of his freedom and, eventually, his property. The district court found no evidence in the record of any such conspiracy and accordingly granted summary judgment on the grounds that Dye had failed to establish that Radcliff had acted under color of state law, as would be required for a successful claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Perrino v. S. Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>209 F.3d 1309, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2000). Summary judgment must be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u201cTo establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove (1) a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Holmes v. Crosby, </em>418 F.3d 1256,. 1258 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201c[T]he under-eolor-of-state-law element of \u00a7 1983 excludes from its reach merely private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.\u201d <em>Focus on the Family v. Pinel-las Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir.2003). However, \u201c[pjrivate parties who corruptly conspire\u201d with state officials in a malicious prosecution also act under color of state law for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 183, 187, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980). A \u201cplaintiff attempting to prove such a conspiracy must show that the parties \u2018reached an understanding\u2019 to deny the plaintiff his or her rights.\u201d <em>NAACP. v. Hunt, </em>891 F.2d 1555, 1563 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1605, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)). An allegation that a private defendant misused a valid state statute does not state a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 940-41, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2755-56, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). Therefore, we join other circuits in saying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that a private party does not act under color of state law merely by calling upon official state authority when he does not also join in the exercise thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Our <em>de novo </em>review of the record reveals no error in the district court\u2019s finding that there is no evidence that Radcliff was involved with the investigation regarding the navigable waters issue and that there is no evidence of any agreement or plan between Radcliff and the Commission officers to arrest and prosecute Dye unlawfully. Dye\u2019s brief on appeal points to ample evidence of Radcliffis animosity toward Dye, his insistent complaints to the Commission, his own knowledge about trespass law, his expressed desire to have Dye prosecuted for trespass, and his alleged financial motives for doing so. Dye also points to evidence of his actual innocence. Although this may bear on Dye\u2019s state law claims, none of it demonstrates the conspiracy necessary for a successful \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Dye also makes much of his assertion that Lt. Jeff Hahr of the Commission did know the general rule that boaters were allowed to go as far as the high water mark of navigable waters. He points to no evidence, however, that any of the Commission officers knew whether the \u201cNarrows\u201d were technically navigable, and if so, where the high water mark lay. In fact, he admitted in his deposition that he did not believe any of the officers \u201cknew where the ordinary high watermark was when they stopped him on December 1st of 2001.\u201d R3-36 at 41. Further, Dye himself admitted during his deposition that he did not \u201cfeel that [the Commission Officers] were conspiring with Radcliff,\u201d only that Radcliff was using the Commission to leverage him to sell his land or \u201cdestroy [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78-79. In his brief, Dye fails to point to any specific evidence of a conspiracy. He refers generally to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and argues that the victim is often the last to discover a conspiracy. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27. This, though perhaps true, is not evidence of a conspiracy in this case and, thus, fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Dye appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Radcliff as to Dye\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim. Dye has faded to point to any evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Rad-cliff acted under color of state law. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">. <em>See Ginsberg v.
