The IJ rejected the petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), based on her expression of support, one time, for practitioners of Fa-lun Gong in a high school student group. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-18\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-19\">When the BIA issues a short opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s decision in part, and modifying it in part, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Because the BIA declined to adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings, we may not rest our decision on those findings. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-20\">We conclude that, contrary to the views of the BIA, there was nothing inherently suspect about the petitioner\u2019s failure to volunteer details about whether government officials \u201ccontinue to search for [her] and seek to arrest her,\u201d because, during her testimony, she was never asked about it. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cLike outright inconsistencies, the impact of omissions must be measured against the whole record before they may justify an adverse credibility determination.\u201d). Moreover, we find no substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that asylum was inappropriate because the Chinese government has the \u201csovereign authority to practice or to ban practices which they determine to be detrimental to public security or good order.\u201d Asylum claims are frequently and properly granted based on acts of government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>thought by it to be \u201cdetrimental to public security and good order,\u201d at least when those acts evidence persecution under United States law.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">We nevertheless deny the petition for review. The behavior of which petitioner complains, that she was threatened with arrest and that she fears arrest if returned to China, does not \u201crise above mere harassment.\u201d <em>See Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, 359 </em>F.3d 121, 128 (2d Cir.2004) (adopting Seventh Circuit\u2019s standard that \u201cpersecution in the asylum context ... \u2018must rise above mere harassment\u2019 \u201d and ruling that \u201cphysical harm inflicted on an applicant on account of his religious beliefs\u201d may constitute persecution (quoting <em>Begzatowski v. INS, </em>278 F.3d 665, 669 (7th Cir.2002))). In any event, because there was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that the petitioner \u201ccould avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(B), asylum was properly denied. The IJ\u2019s finding was supported by testimony that the petitioner was able to live in the Guangzhou region for the three months between her expression of support for Falun Gong and her departure without interference by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Because the petitioner is ineligible for asylum, the IJ properly concluded that she could not meet the higher burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Secaidar-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 306. The petitioner did not carry her burden to prove that \u201cit is more likely than not that [s]he ... would be tortured if removed to [China],\u201d <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. 208.16(c)(2), and, therefore, she is not eligible for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
