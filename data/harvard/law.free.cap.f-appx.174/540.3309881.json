Moore argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in admitting during Moore\u2019s trial evidence of his prior uncharged conduct of possessing a firearm. Moore also contends that his 210-month sentence was unreasonable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment, charging Moore with the above-referenced \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense. Prior to trial, the government filed two notices of its intent to rely on several prior bad acts, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Moore responded by filing a motion <em>in limine, </em>seeking to exclude evidence of all of these acts. The government subsequently replied that it had decided to rely only on a August 20, 2004, arrest, for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The district court denied Moore\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>explaining, in relevant part, that the proffered evidence was relevant and admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), to demonstrate Moore\u2019s criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">At trial, Carl Baaske, a detective with the Miami-Dade Police Department, testified that, on March 1, 2005, while watching an apartment complex in Miami, Florida that had been the scene of frequent drug deals he observed three persons near a dumpster, including Travis Jones, whom Detective Baaske had warned one week earlier about selling drugs, and Moore, whom Detective Baaske had not previously met. That same evening, Detective Baaske observed Jones engage in nine drug transactions, each time giving the buyer a bag containing either marijuana, cocaine, or cocaine base, in exchange for money. During these transactions, Moore either stayed within two to three feet of Jones, conversing with him, or looked up and down the nearby avenue\u2014conduct Detective Baaske attributed to acting as a \u201clookout.\u201d After Detective Baaske described to other officers the three persons he had observed at the dumpster and these other officers approached the suspects, the suspects all ran away from the dumpster, with Jones running towards his mother\u2019s residence. The officers then arrested Jones and executed a search warrant for his mother\u2019s residence, during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>which they recovered marijuana, cocaine base, and a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Orlando Reyes, a sergeant with the Miami-Dade Police Department, also testified, stating that, after Detective Baaske informed him about these drug sales, and after he and Officer Willie McFadden approached the suspects, Moore ran through a breezeway in the complex, at the end of which the officers blocked his path. When Moore attempted to run through these officers, they grabbed him, wrestled him to the ground, and handcuffed him, during which time Moore vigorously resisted them. When the officers finally were able to handcuff Moore and pull him up from the ground, Sergeant Reyes saw a firearm fall out of the left pocket of Moore\u2019s pants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The government, over Moore\u2019s renewed Rule 404(b) objection, also introduced testimony from Adrian Barazal, another detective with the Miami-Dade Police Department, that, on August 20, 2004, at about 3:00 p.m., Detectives Barazal and Octavio Tellez were on patrol in the Liberty City area of Miami, Florida, in an unmarked police vehicle, when they observed a driver fail to stop at the stop sign. When the detectives attempted to stop this vehicle by turning on their red and blue lights, they saw the driver look back at them and accelerate his vehicle, thus beginning a car chase. During this chase, Detective Barazal observed (1) the driver\u2019s head \u201cdisappear for a second and then pop back up,\u201d and (2) the driver reach across the passenger of the vehicle and throw an object out of the window. As the thrown object hit the ground, the detectives slowed their vehicle and saw that it was a revolver. The detectives, however, then resumed their chase and eventually stopped the vehicle, which Moore was driving. Upon his arrest, Moore told the detectives: \u201cYou didn\u2019t catch me with it.\u201d Detective Tellez later recovered from the side of the road a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 caliber revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The court then instructed the jury twice that it could consider this evidence of uncharged prior bad acts only for the limited purpose of determining Moore\u2019s intent as to the charged \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense, and only if it decided beyond a reasonable doubt that Moore had committed the charged offense. Moore decided not to testify or put on any evidence. The jury convicted him as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Moore\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated that he had a base offense level of 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), because the offense involved possessing a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon who committed the offense subsequent to sustaining two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense. The PSI also recommended a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), because the firearm was stolen, and a four-level increase, pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), because the firearm and ammunition were used or possessed in connection with a drug offense. However, because Moore was an armed career criminal, he was subject to (1) a 15-year mandatory minimum statutory sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); and (2) an adjusted offense level of 33, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a) &amp; (b)(3)(B). With a criminal history category of V,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moore had a resulting guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Moore\u2019s only objection to the PSI was to the four-level \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On September 7, 2005, at sentencing, Moore renewed his objection to the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. He, however, conceded that this enhancement would not affect his offense level because, due to his status as an armed career criminal, his offense level automatically was increased to level 33. The court, nevertheless, granted Moore\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement and, adopting the PSI\u2019s guideline calculations, determined that Moore\u2019s resulting guideline range was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Moore then argued that his statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment was \u201cmore than adequate\u201d to punish him and to deter him from committing future offenses. Moore also argued that, although he had a long criminal history, this history was, at least in part, the result of the failure of the criminal justice system to rehabilitate him. The government responded that Moore\u2019s prior criminal history involved violent felony offenses, including carjacking, with two of his offenses involving the use of firearms. The government also contended that the evidence showed that Moore was using the firearm in the instant offense to further drug-trafficking activity. After considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court determined that a sentence at the bottom of Moore\u2019s guideline range, that is, 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Issue 1: <em>Evidence of Moore\u2019s prior uncharged conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Moore argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting, as evidence of his intent, that he had possessed a firearm as a convicted felon on August 20, 2004, because, in not putting on a defense at trial, he had not contested the issue of intent. Moore contends that this evidence, instead, was improperly admitted to \u201cbolster the credibility of\u2019 the government\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Rule 404(b) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Our test for admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9J\">First, the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; Second, the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; Third, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must meet the other requirements of Rule 403.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-13\"><em>United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ted). The district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude such evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In applying the first element of this Rule 404(b) test\u2014the only element Moore is challenging on appeal\u2014we have explained that the government has the burden of proving knowing possession of a firearm to convict a defendant of a \u00a7 922(g) offense. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>417 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 768, 163 L.Ed.2d 596 (2005). Thus, we concluded in <em>Taylor </em>that, in the absence of the defendant\u2019s admission of this intent, and in light of the district court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of a prior conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm under Rule 404(b). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Furthermore, to the extent Moore has cited to our prior decision in <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>411 F.3d 1210, 1225 (11th Cir.2005), <em>vacated and superseded on rehearing by United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296 (11th Cir.2005), in which we determined that the admission of Rule 404(b) evidence was improper when the defendant failed to mount an affirmative defense and, thus, squarely challenge the issue of intent, this decision has been vacated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, in our superseding opinion in <em>Matthews, </em>we explained that a defendant\u2019s plea of not guilty, alone, \u201cwithout an accompanying affirmative removal,\u201d leaves the element of intent at issue. <em>See Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Similar to the facts in <em>Taylor, </em>the charge at issue here was a \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense; the government, therefore, had the burden of proving that Moore knowingly possessed a firearm. <em>See Taylor, </em>417 F.3d at 1182. Although Moore is contending that he did not testify or present any evidence, he also has not cited to evidence in the record showing that he entered into a stipulation relating to, or admitted, this intent. Moreover, the challenged Rule 404(b) evidence here occurred in August 2004, within seven months of the charged conduct in March 2005. <em>See also United States v. Butler, </em>102 F.3d 1191, 1195-96 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that a three-year-old prior conviction for possession of cocaine for personal use was relevant and admissible for purposes of demonstrating the defendant\u2019s intent in the charged conspiracy for possession with intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Thus, instead of constituting improper character evidence, this evidence was relevant as evidence of Moore\u2019s knowledge and intent. <em>See Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1311; <em>see also Taylor, </em>417 F.3d at 1182. Additionally, the court properly instructed the jury twice that it could consider this evidence of uncharged prior bad acts only for the limited purpose of determining Moore\u2019s intent as to the charged \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense, and only if the jury decided beyond a reasonable doubt that Moore had committed the charged offense. We, therefore, conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this Rule 404(b) evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">Issue 2: <em>Whether Moore\u2019s 210-month sentence was reasonable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Moore also argues on appeal that his 210-month sentence was unreasonable because, although this sentence was at the bottom of his guideline range, his length of incarceration exceeded his \u201cculpability for this crime.\u201d Moore contends that, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>though he should have been subject to a longer sentence for being a \u201crecidivist offender,\u201d his guideline range in the absence of his criminal history only would have been 21 to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment, and his substantially increased guideline range for being an armed career offender of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, which represented a \u201c10-fold increase,\u201d far exceeded a reasonable guideline range. Citing to <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003), Moore also argues that his sentence was in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Prior to Moore\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>holding that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 232-35, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a second and separate majority opinion, the <em>Booker </em>Court explained that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections\u201418 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range)\u2014thereby effectively rendering the federal guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 125 S.Ct. at 764. Thus, the <em>Booker </em>Court concluded that a defendant\u2019s guideline range is now advisory; it no longer dictates his final sentence, but, instead, is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court is to consider, along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). When we review for reasonableness, our review is deferential. <em>Id. </em>at 788. We do not, as the district court did, determine the exact sentence to be imposed. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the party who is challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in [\u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">When the court considered the factors of \u00a7 3553(a), it was not required to discuss each of them. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). Regardless, in the instant case, the court stated that it had taken into account Moore\u2019s advisory guideline range, as well as the statutory sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), including the need for the sentence in this case to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment and adequate deterrence, and to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3) (the kinds of sentences available).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Moore\u2019s PSI also reflects that he had a lengthy criminal history and had not taken advantage of past opportunities to rehabilitate himself. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d). Thus, Moore has failed to show that the court did not consider \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors, or that his 210-month sentence, which was at the bottom end of his guideline range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, was unreasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (explaining that, although a sentence within a defendant\u2019s guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, ordinarily we \u201cwould expect a sentence within the [g]uideline range to be reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Finally, to the extent Moore is contending for the first time on appeal that the district court committed reversible error in relying on the \u201c10-fold\u201d increase in his guideline range due to his recidivism, he is analogizing to the Supreme Court\u2019s limits on disparities between punitive and compensatory damage awards in civil cases. Our review of this newly raised argument, however, only is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.) (reviewing a newly raised <em>Booker </em>challenge for plain error), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c \u2018If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">\u201c[A]n error cannot meet the \u2018plain\u2019 requirement of the plain error rule if it is not \u2018clear under current law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1319 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). \u201c[Wjhere neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Here, neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s limits on disparities in civil awards should be applied in the criminal-sentencing context.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, even if we were to conclude that error occurred, it was not \u201cplain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of Moore\u2019s prior uncharged conduct of possessing a firearm. Additionally, Moore has failed to show that his 210-month sentence was unreasonable. We, therefore, affirm his conviction and sentence,</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\">. The government also produced (1) a stipulation by Moore that he previously had been convicted of a state felony; and (2) evidence showing that the firearm that fell out of Moore's pocket was an operable Star .380 caliber pistol, had six rounds of ammunition and had traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-12\">. Moore\u2019s PSI reflects that his criminal history category of V was based on a lengthy criminal history, including convictions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>burglary with assault, robbery with a firearm, armed robbery with a firearm, attempted robbery, robbery and burglary with an assault, and a failure on Moore's part to take advantage of opportunities to rehabilitate himself. This category also was the result of Moore being an armed career criminal, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.4(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b567-14\">. Rule 403 provides that, \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. In citing to our prior decision in <em>Matthews, </em>Moore notes that it has been superseded and vacated. He, however, relies on it, among other authorities, for the proposition that, where intent is at issue, and the act charged \"is not equivocal,\u201d proof of other offenses will not be permitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b569-6\">. The Supreme Court discussed in <em>State Farm </em>that, \"[wjhile States possess discretion over the imposition of punitive damages, it is well established that there are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on these awards.\u201d <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>538 U.S. at 416, 123 S.Ct. at 1519. The <em>State Farm </em>Court ultimately concluded that an award of $145 million in punitive damages against a defendant, where full compensatory damages only were $1 million, was excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See id. </em>at 412, 123 S.Ct. at 1517.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-11\">.
