They seek to raise claims challenging their sentences based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because the Appellants waived their appellate rights in their plea agreements, we grant the Government\u2019s motions to dismiss on that basis and deny Appellants\u2019 motions to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">When the Government seeks to enforce a waiver of appellate rights, and there is no claim that the Government breached the plea agreement, this court will enforce the waiver if the record establishes the defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to waive the right to appeal, and the issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168-69 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cAn appeal waiver is not knowingly or voluntarily made if the district court fails to specifically question the defendant concerning the waiver provision of the plea agreement during the Rule 11 colloquy and the record indicates that the defendant did not otherwise understand the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 461, 163 L.Ed.2d 350 (2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">In their plea agreements, Appellants each waived their rights to appeal their convictions and \u201cany sentence within the maximum provided in the statute of conviction (or the manner in which that sentence was determined) on ... any ground whatsoever.\u201d Appellants do not contend the district court failed to question them concerning their appellate waivers at their guilty plea hearings or that they did not otherwise understand the full significance of their waivers. Further, they do not assert that their sentences exceeded the statutory maximum or that the Government breached their plea agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">Linder contends that while he \u201cdid waive his right to appeal in the plea agreement,\u201d the \u201cagreement did not contemplate <em>Blakely. </em>\u201d However, his argument is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>Johnson, </em>410 F.3d at 153, and <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 170. Tarrats contends the Government\u2019s failure to object, after the district court inquired at the end of his sentencing hearing whether \u201che still wish[ed] to follow\u201d his appellate waiver and Tarrats\u2019s counsel stated that <em>Blakely </em>\u201cwould be the sole reason for an appeal,\u201d constituted either a modification of his appellate waiver or a waiver by the Government of its right to enforce the appellate waiver on appeal. We disagree. We find there was no mutually agreed upon modification of the waiver of appellate rights contained in Tarrats\u2019s knowing and voluntary plea agreement. Moreover, the Government has timely and diligently pursued enforcement of the appellate waiver on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motions to dismiss and deny the Appellants\u2019 motions to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
