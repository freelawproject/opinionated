We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Where, as here, the BIA fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d. Cir.2005). An asylum applicant must prove \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the [asylum] application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208(a)(2)\u00ae. Additionally, \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review\u201d the agency\u2019s determination of whether an application was timely filed. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Jiang\u2019s asylum application as untimely. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir.2006). However, there is no such jurisdictional restriction on our ability to review the IJ\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, overturning them only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004). Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s well-reasoned adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The IJ based her credibility determination on the reasonable findings that (1) Jiang\u2019s testimony and asylum application were not consistent, where he testified that the police came to search for him at his home and his friend\u2019s father was arrested by the police for practicing Christianity, but omitted such allegations from his asylum application, (2) Jiang\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent, where he claimed that the only province he hid in was Zhe-jiang Province, but later testified he hid in Jiangsu Province, (3) Jiang\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his brother\u2019s testimony, where Jiang testified that he decided to leave China in August 1999 after the police ordered him to go to court, but his brother testified that Jiang told him in June 1999 that he couldn\u2019t stay in China anymore, and (4) Jiang lacked available corroborating evidence to support his inconsistent testimony, where he failed to provide recent documentary or testimonial evidence of his Christian faith, testimony from his brother who had previously been available, or a written statement from his parents detailing what happened to them after Jiang left China.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on substantial evidence. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, which was based upon Jiang\u2019s incredible statements, was also reasonable. Additionally, Jiang\u2019s argument that the IJ erred by not mentioning country conditions when denying him CAT relief fails, as the reasons Jiang gave for fearing torture were found to be unbelievable. Accordingly, Jiang\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>this petition is DENIED. Any pending request for oral arguments is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule' of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
