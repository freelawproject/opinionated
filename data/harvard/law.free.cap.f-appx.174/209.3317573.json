O\u2019Connor (\u201cO\u2019Connor\u201d) brings this appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>abstention, vacatur and remand of his adversary proceeding in bankruptcy. As this court lacks jurisdiction to review the decisions of the district court, O\u2019Connor\u2019s application for a writ of mandamus is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This case began in Texas state court, where Marie and Vijay Goradia (\u201cthe Gor-adias\u201d) sued O\u2019Connor International, Inc. (\u201cOCI\u201d) for breach of contract and various torts related to the construction of their home. The Goradias later amended their state complaint to include tort claims against O\u2019Connor, the owner of OCI, in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The case between the Goradias and OCI was sent to binding arbitration, and the Goradias prevailed, obtaining a judgment against OCI. On April 2, 2003, after the judgment was issued, OCI filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. Claiming \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b), O\u2019Connor then removed the state court case against him to bankruptcy court, where it became an adversary proceeding within the OCI bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In bankruptcy court, the Goradias moved to remand the adversary proceeding to state court, and O\u2019Connor moved for summary judgment on the basis of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The bankruptcy court granted O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion and dismissed the Goradias\u2019 motion as moot. The Goradias then appealed to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">On appeal, citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1), the district court abstained from ruling on the adversary proceeding, vacated the decision of the bankruptcy court, and remanded the O\u2019Connor case to state court. O\u2019Connor has appealed the court\u2019s decision to vacate and remand, and also filed a mandamus petition challenging the court\u2019s abstention, which was consolidated with his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">As an initial matter, this court must determine whether its limited jurisdiction encompasses O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal. <em>Webb v. B.C. Rogers Poultry, Inc., </em>174 F.3d 697, 699 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Castaneda v. Falcon, </em>166 F.3d 799, 801 (5th Cir.1999). Because the district court\u2019s decisions to abstain and remand are not reviewable here, we need not reach the merits of the bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">This case was removed to bankruptcy court through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452, which allows removal of state cases related to a bankruptcy proceeding. O\u2019Connor asserts that federal jurisdiction exists in this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b), which gives the district court \u201coriginal but not exclusive\u201d jurisdiction over all claims \u201crelated to\u201d title 11 bankruptcy proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Goradias argue that removal was inappropriate, as a state law case involving two nondebtors is not sufficiently \u201crelated to\u201d OCI\u2019s bankruptcy. In its opinion, the district court appeared to agree with the Goradias, though the court ultimately declined to decide the jurisdictional issue and proceeded on the assumption that \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction existed under \u00a7 1334(b). It is true that \u201cno pussy-footing around is allowed on jurisdictional issues.\u201d <em>In re Southmark Corp., </em>163 F.3d 925, 929 (5th Cir.1999). However, the result in the instant case is the same regardless whether \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">In the event that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the adversary pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ceeding, abstention would have been unnecessary, and remand was required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c); a decision to remand on this basis is not reviewable by this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d); <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 712, 116 S.Ct. 1718, 135 L.Ed.2d 1, - (1996); <em>Schexnayder v. Entergy La., Inc., </em>394 F.3d 280, 283 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">However, the district court appears to have assumed the existence of \u00a7 1334(b) jurisdiction, and in abstaining from hearing the adversary proceeding, the court cited its authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1). For \u201cbankruptcy cases commenced after the 1994 amendments to the bankruptcy law, decisions either to abstain or not to abstain are not, with very limited exceptions, reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>In re Southmark, </em>163 F.3d at 929. Section 1334(c)(1) gives district courts discretion to abstain from hearing \u201crelated to\u201d cases in the interests of justice, comity with state courts, or respect for state law. Indeed, in light of \u00a7 1334(c)(1), the district court listed numerous state law and equitable factors that made the state court a more appropriate venue for the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Code, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d), makes clear that any decision of the district court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">to abstain or not to abstain made under this subsection (other than a decision not to abstain in a proceeding described in subsection (c)(2)) is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section 158(d), 1291, or 1292 of this title or by the Supreme Court of the United States under section 1254 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Under this plain language, the district court\u2019s decision to abstain based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1) is not reviewable here. The statute provides no exception dependent on whether the district court\u2019s order exercised original or appellate jurisdiction. Thus, this court lacks any jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s abstention order, and a writ of mandamus will not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The district court\u2019s decision to remand the O\u2019Connor case is also not reviewable by this court, regardless of whether subject matter jurisdiction exists. As discussed <em>supra, </em>assuming that the courts lacked jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding, the district court\u2019s decision to remand would not be reviewable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Alternatively, a district court may remand a claim based upon valid \u00a7 1334 jurisdiction \u201con any equitable ground.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452(b). Remands made under \u00a7 1452(b) are not \u201creviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals ... or by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Adams, </em>809 F.2d 1187, 1189 (5th Cir.1987). Again, this court lacks jurisdiction over O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s citation to <em>Quackenbush </em>is misplaced. <em>Quackenbush </em>held that \u201conly remands based on grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c) are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d),\u201d and concluded that the district court\u2019s exercise of <em>Burford </em>abstention in that case was appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>Quackenbush, </em>517 U.S. at 712, 116 S.Ct. at 1718. However, <em>Quackenbush </em>is readily distinguishable from the instant case in that <em>Quackenbush </em>was originally removed from state court based upon diversity jurisdiction; in that case, removal could not be premised upon \u00a7 1447(c), and the Supreme Court therefore concluded that the invocation of the \u00a7 1447(d) bar to review was improper. In the instant case, \u00a7 1447(d) is appropriately used if subject matter jurisdiction did not exist, and if O\u2019Connor had \u00a7 1334(b) jurisdiction, then \u00a7 1334(d) and \u00a7 1452(b) prevent review, not \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Finally, with regard to the district court\u2019s vacatur of the decisions of the bankruptcy court, we find that the decisions of the bankruptcy court, including its grant of summary judgment to O\u2019Connor, were neither separate from the remand nor conclusive for the purposes of reviewability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Doleac v. Michalson, </em>264 F.3d 470, 478-83 (5th Cir.2001) (discussing reviewability of issues on appeal where remand order was not itself reviewable; none of the cases discussed were related to bankruptcy). The district court\u2019s decision to abstain and remand could not be given its full effect without the court\u2019s vacating the earlier decisions of the bankruptcy court, and the district court\u2019s actions are not conclusive, as O\u2019Connor will be able to reargue his claims of res judicata and collateral estoppel in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The decisions of the district court are not reviewable here. Therefore, O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s application for a writ of mandamus is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-10\">. Without \"related to\u201d jurisdiction, there is no federal jurisdiction in this case, as the parties are nondiverse and the Goradias\u2019 suit raised only state law tort claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
