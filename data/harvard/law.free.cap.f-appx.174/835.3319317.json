Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>For the following reasons, we find that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendant-Appellant Juan Birula-Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b859-25\">In October 2003, Birula-Hernandez pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The presentence report (PSR) calculated a total offense level of 13. This, combined with a criminal history category of V, resulted in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 30 to 37 months. The statutory maximum sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) was only 24 months, however, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>PSR, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adopted the statutory maximum as the Guidelines range. In February 2004, the district court accepted the PSR\u2019s recommendations and sentenced Birula-Hernan-dez to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by one year of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">On appeal, Birula-Hernandez challenged the constitutionality of the illegal reentry statute but conceded that his claim was foreclosed by precedent. Additionally, Blakely<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was decided during the pendency of the appeal, and Birula-Hernandez cited that decision as an alternative ground for reversal. We affirmed the conviction and sentence in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Biru-la-Hernandez then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certio-rari, and while his petition was pending the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker. </em>Birula-Hernandez amended his petition to include a <em>Booker </em>argument and, as noted above, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to us for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Birula-Hernandez raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal. Therefore, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This means that we will not remand for resen-fencing unless there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines constitutes (1) error (2) that is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He carries his burden if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">Birula-Hernandez satisfies the first two prongs of our plain error review because his sentence resulted from application of the Guidelines in their mandatory form. He has not, however, met his burden of showing that this error affected his substantial rights, as required under <em>Mares. </em>Indeed, in his supplemental letter brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Birula-Hernandez concedes that \u201c[biased on the current record ... [he] admittedly cannot make such a showing of prejudice.\u201d He further expresses disagreement with the application of the plain error standard to his case, but acknowledges that his challenge is precluded by our holding in <em>Mares. </em>He makes his argument only to preserve it for further review. Birula-Hernandez also acknowledges in his supplemental letter brief that his other arguments, that <em>Booker </em>error is \u201cstructural\u201d and presumptively prejudicial, are likewise foreclosed by precedent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, and we may revisit it only en banc or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it. As Birula-Hernandez presents no viable ground for remand under <em>Mares, </em>we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Birula-Hernandez has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the plain error at his sentencing affected his substantial rights. His sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
