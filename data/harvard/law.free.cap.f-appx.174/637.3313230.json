We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms or adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidenee standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. Guan Shan Liao v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">Dodoo argues that the IJ improperly applied an \u201cactual harm\u201d standard in determining his past persecution claim and any resulting presumption of future persecution, but does not address the IJ\u2019s determination that he did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution due to changed country conditions in Ghana. Because the IJ\u2019s conclusion regarding well-founded fear of future persecution is not challenged and is substantially supported by the record as a whole, Dodoo\u2019s argument regarding past persecution is moot. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir. Oct.2005) (issues not raised in brief considered waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-18\">Dodoo also argues that the IJ\u2019s failure to make an explicit adverse credibility finding was in error in light of the requirements set out in <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279 (2d Cir.2000). Because Dodoo did not raise this issue before the BIA, however, he has not properly exhausted all administrative remedies available to him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-19\">Finally, Dodoo disputes only the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum claim; because he has not addressed the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, he has waived any challenge to those findings. <em>Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-20\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED. Having completed our review, any stays of removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>that the Court previously granted in these petitions are VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in these petitions are DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
