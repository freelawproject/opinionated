We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">On October 23,1991, Anderson, a Jamaican national, was sentenced in New York State court to imprisonment for one year for the attempted sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and for one to three years for attempted robbery. As a result, he was deported in 2001. But Anderson returned, and he came to the attention of the authorities in August 2004 after an altercation with a customer at a restaurant he owned at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">Thereafter, the government charged Anderson with illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Attached to the indictment was a Notice of Prior Convictions, which charged that he had been convicted of the two New York State felonies. Also attached was a Notice of Additional Factor, which charged that he had been deported \u201cafter a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence, as described in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).\u201d If the 2001 deportation was found to be \u201csubsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), Anderson faced a statutory maximum sentence of twenty years in prison as opposed to two years. On December 14, 2004, he pled guilty to the charge of illegal reentry and admitted having been convicted of both prior felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">At the April 6, 2005 sentencing hearing, the District Court calculated Anderson\u2019s total offense level to be 21. One aspect of that calculation was a 16-level increase resulting from his prior conviction for an aggravated felony. His counsel informed the Court of his Ghent\u2019s \u201caware[ness] that the ... attempted robbery triggers the 16-level enhancement.\u201d (A65) The result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ing Guidelines range was 41 to 51 months, and the District Court, after recognizing that the Guidelines were only advisory, sentenced Anderson to 41 months in prison. Anderson appeals, arguing that \u201cprior convictions that enhance the statutory penalty must be charged in the indictment and, if not admitted, proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), held that prior convictions that increase the statutory maximum for a particular offense are not elements of the offense of conviction and, consequently, may be found by a sentencing judge by a preponderance of the evidence. This did not change as a result of the Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, Anderson concedes as much, \u201crecogniz[ing] that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) is contrary to [his] position on appeal, and that this Court has recognized the continuing vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in the wake of <em>United States v. Booker </em>.... \u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7) As we stated in <em>United States v. Ordaz, </em>398 F.3d 236 (3d Cir.2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">We do not gainsay that there is a tension between the spirit of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>that all facts that increase the sentence should be found by a jury and the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Tor-res, </em>which upholds sentences based on facts found by judges rather than juries. Nonetheless, as an inferior federal court we have the responsibility to follow directly applicable Supreme Court decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">The holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding law, and nothing in <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker </em>holds otherwise. Thus, because we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we hold that the District Court\u2019s determination regarding the facts of Or-daz\u2019s prior convictions did not violate the Sixth Amendment, notwithstanding that the sentences were based, in part, on facts found by a judge rather than a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 241. So, too, here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">We will affirm the judgment of sentence.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. Our review of this purely legal question is plenary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. Under <em>Booker, </em>sentencing judges are still required to make findings relevant to sentencing, but may not treat the resulting Guidelines range as mandatory. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162, 163 (3d Cir.2005) (\"[T]he <em>Booker </em>majority held that mandatory enhancement of a sentence under the Guidelines, based on facts found by the court alone, violates the Sixth Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
