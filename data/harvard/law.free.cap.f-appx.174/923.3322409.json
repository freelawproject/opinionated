GUY COLE, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b947-25\">Plaintiff Gregory Hardy appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendant Robert Vieta in a prisoner\u2019s civil rights case brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Because there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Vieta\u2019s conduct constituted cruel and unusual punishment as prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s order and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-27\"><em>Pro se </em>plaintiff Gregory Hardy is a prisoner incarcerated at the Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan. He alleges that on September 13,1999, Robert Vieta, an officer employed at Parnall, was assigned to yard patrol. He alleges that Vieta waited for Hardy to enter the \u201cunit (16) block.\u201d When he entered the unit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>Hardy alleges that Vieta told prisoner James Mathieu, an inmate who was working as a porter in unit (16) block, \u201cwatch what I do to this \u2018Mother Fucker,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cHere comes that Faggot Sitch [sic], watch this.\u201d Mathieu states that Vieta entered the unit (16) block at approximately 3:00 p.m. In an affidavit, Mathieu avers that he saw Vieta purposefully and intentionally push a steel door on Hardy. Hardy alleges that Vieta smashed him between the steel door and a brick wall, injuring his arm and lower back. Mathieu states that he \u201cheard what sounded like the door hitting something, and then defendant Vieta, push on through the door was heading out [sic], and laughing as he left.\u201d Hardy alleges that he reported the assault, after which Vieta approached him, and told him \u201che would get [Hardy] by planting something in his cell.\u201d Hardy also alleges that Vieta called him \u201cYou Mother Fucker\u201d and \u201cNigger.\u201d Hardy alleges that at the time of the event, he was being treated for a back injury, and was wearing a back support brace. He states that he sought medical, treatment on September 13, 1999, but did not receive treatment until September 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">On October 4, 2002, Hardy filed a civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Relevant to this appeal, his complaint alleges that Vieta: (1) violated Hardy\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights by assaulting him; (2) unnecessarily and wantonly inflicted pain, constituting an Eighth Amendment violation; (3) made threats against Hardy in order to degrade, intimidate, harass and assault him; (4) violated the chain of command and the uniform code of ethics; and (5) violated Hardy\u2019s rights under the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">On October 21, 2002, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Hardy\u2019s state law claims, and dismissed those claims without prejudice. The remaining issues were referred to a magistrate judge. Vieta filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b) and 56; the magistrate judge recommended that Vieta\u2019s motions be granted and the case dismissed. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report in its entirety, granted Vieta\u2019s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, and dismissed the case with prejudice. This appeal follows, challenging only the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hardy\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo. Palkow v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>431 F.3d 543, 548 (6th Cir.2005). We also review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Myers v. Potter, </em>422 F.3d 347, 352 (6th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). This Court must assume the truth of the non-moving party\u2019s evidence and construe all inferences from that evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>A genuine issue of material fact exists when there is sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>the non-moving party. A \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence will not be enough for the non-moving party to withstand summary judgment. <em>Skousen v. Brighton High School, </em>305 F.3d 520, 526 (6th Cir.2002). Furthermore, the non-moving may not rest on his pleadings, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">\n<em>A. Eighth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 319, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). An assault on a prisoner by a guard can constitute an Eighth Amendment violation, despite the fact that the prisoner does not suffer severe physical injury. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 4, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">A claim of unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain has both a subjective and objective component. <em>Moore v. Holbrook, 2 </em>F.3d 697, 700 (6th Cir.1993). The objective component requires that the pain be \u201csufficiently serious.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 299, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). The Supreme Court has clarified that in order to be sufficiently serious, \u201ca prison official\u2019s act or omission must result in the denial of \u2018the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (citing <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981)). Contemporary standards of decency determine whether a condition of confinement is sufficiently serious to constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>Hadix v. Johnson, </em>367 F.3d 513, 525 (6th Cir.2004). \u201cWith respect to the objective prong, prisoners have the right not to be subjected to the unreasonable threat of injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">The subjective component requires that the offending conduct be wanton. <em>Wilson, </em>501 U.S. at 299, 111 S.Ct. 2321. For a claim of excessive force, the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d <em>Whitley, </em>475 U.S. at 320-21, 106 S.Ct. 1078 (citing <em>Johnson v. Glick, </em>481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1973)). We consider factors such as \u201cthe need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used, and the extent of injury inflicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321. \u201cFrom such considerations inferences may be drawn as to whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary, or instead evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must also consider factors such as the extent of any threat to the safety of staff and other prisoners, \u201cas reasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pain inflicted in the complete absence of penological justification is, by definition, unnecessary and wanton. <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 731, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">\n<em>B. Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">The district court dismissed Hardy\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim based on the conclusion that any use of force was <em>de minimis </em>in nature. This conclusion was based on the fact that Hardy suffered no \u201crecorded objective injuries,\u201d that Hardy made it to first aid without difficulty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>that Hardy suffered back pain prior to the event. Certainly, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment does not generally prohibit <em>de minimis </em>uses of force, \u201cprovided that the use of force is not of the sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>508 U.S. at 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995. The Court has made clear, however, that whether force is <em>de minimis </em>does not depend on the extent of the prisoner\u2019s injury. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 112 S.Ct. 995 (\u201cWhen prison official maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decency are always violated. This is true whether or not significant injury is evident.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Hardy has alleged an injury that is \u201csufficiently serious\u201d to make out an Eighth Amendment violation at this stage of litigation. According to Hardy, Vieta pushed a steel door on him. Although the extent of Hardy\u2019s injuries is not known, the record reflects that Vieta did not push the door on Hardy during the course of a prison security measure. \u201cWith respect to the objective prong, prisoners have the right not to be subjected to the unreasonable threat of injury.\u201d <em>Hadix v. Johnson, </em>367 F.3d at 525. Furthermore, the record contains evidence that Vieta acted wantonly. Mathieu testified that upon seeing Hardy, Vieta uttered words indicating wantonness and premeditation. Mathieu also testified that after slamming the door on Hardy, Vieta left the cell block laughing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Although the district court correctly noted that the absence of a serious injury may be relevant to the calculus to determine whether a use of force may be have been necessary, <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 7, 112 S.Ct. 995 evidence of serious injury is not required \u201c[wjhen prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 112 S.Ct. 995. Hardy has both sufficiently alleged, and provided evidence from which an inference can be drawn, that Vieta wantonly inflicted harm upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the order of the district court granting summary judgment and dismissal, and REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-5\">. Both Vieta and Grayson were considered defendants, although Hardy does not allege any specific counts against Grayson, nor does he specifically name Grayson as a defendant. In response to an Order to Show Cause, Hardy stated that \u201cMr. Grayson was <em>not </em>intended to be a defendant in this matter.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Order to Show Cause. Grayson was dismissed as a defendant on May 5, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
