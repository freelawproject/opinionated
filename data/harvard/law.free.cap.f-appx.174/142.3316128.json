Linney pleaded guilty to one count of failure to account for and pay over federal income tax in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202 (2000). Linney appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court improperly imposed a four level enhancement based on his leadership role in the offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">Linney served as president and CEO of Progressive Financial Group (PFG), a holding and management company that ultimately controlled seven small businesses. In July, 1997, Linney began instructing employees at PFG\u2019s small businesses not to pay taxes. In 1998, Linney set up a check-kiting scheme that operated among PFG\u2019s various businesses and accumulated millions of dollars in debt from bad checks. Linney continued instructing employees not to pay taxes owed, telling them that he was negotiating with the IRS and that he had secured a loan to pay off the taxes. Five of the businesses operating under PFG\u2019s umbrella ultimately owed over $500,000 in unpaid taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">At sentencing, the district court found that Linney qualified for a four level enhancement because of his leadership role in a criminal scheme that was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Linney\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 27-33 months; the court found that \u201ca sentence at the top of the guideline range is appropriate\u201d and sentenced Linney to 33 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-18\">Linney asserts that it was improper for the district court to consider the check kiting scheme when determining whether the scheme at issue was extensive for purposes of the guidelines. We review a district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006). Section 3B1.1 of the Guidelines Manual indicates that a four level enhancement is appropriate \u201c[i]f the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d The introductory commentary to this section of the manual directs the district court to consider all relevant conduct as defined by \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>See also United States v. Fells, </em>920 F.2d 1179, 1183-84 (4th Cir.1990) (holding that a district court should consider all relevant conduct). In addition, \u00a7 3B1.1 instructs the sentencing court to consider \u201call persons involved during the course of the entire offense,\u201d regardless of whether those persons are knowing participants in the scheme. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual [hereinafter USSG] \u00a7 3B1.1 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Linney argues that the check kiting scheme was not relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3 because the check kite did not facilitate the tax evasion. However, even assuming that the check kite was not relevant conduct under \u00a7 IB 1.3, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that the tax evasion scheme alone was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d Linney instructed at least four employees to refrain from paying taxes owed. The district court specifically noted \u201cthe number of people involved\u201d and that although \u201cperhaps not all of them were criminally responsible ... Application Note Number 3 [to USSG \u00a7 3B1.1] indicates that a factor in considering whether [a criminal activity is] otherwise extensive is the extent to which other people are used even if they\u2019re not criminally responsible for the conduct.\u201d In addition, Linney does not dispute the fact that five distinct corporate entities\u2014 all operating under the umbrella of PFG\u2014 participated in the tax evasion scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">These facts are sufficient to support a finding that the tax evasion scheme alone was extensive; thus, the district court did not err in imposing a four level enhancement for Linney\u2019s leadership role in an extensive criminal scheme. Given the extensive nature of the tax evasion scheme, we need not decide whether the check kiting scheme was relevant conduct according to \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
