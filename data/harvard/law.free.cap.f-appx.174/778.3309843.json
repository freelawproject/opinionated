We have reviewed the record and find that Andrews\u2019s motion should have been entertained as a motion to compel, rather than as a \u00a7 2255 motion. However, because the motion to compel was properly denied in any event, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Andrews\u2019s motions for abeyance and to recuse and affirm the district court\u2019s order on the modified grounds that the motion to compel was properly denied. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>Nos. CR-01-27-F; CA-02-44-7-F (E.D.N.C. Aug. 1, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED ON MODIFIED GROUNDS</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
