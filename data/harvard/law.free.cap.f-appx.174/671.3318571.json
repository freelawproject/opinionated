Hannah, </em>No. 96-cr-00262 (M.D.Pa.1997). Hannah was sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed. <em>See United States v. Hannah, </em>No. 97-7506, 159 F.3d 1354 (3d Cir. July 14, 1998). In 1999, Hannah filed a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the District Court. After that motion was denied, Hannah appealed. We denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">On October 4, 2005, Hannah filed in the District Court a document titled \u201cWrit of Error Audita Querela Under the All Writs Act,\u201d in which he argued that his sentence was invalid because it was based on a 16-point enhancement derived from facts that were not found by the jury, in violation of the rule announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Hannah requested either a new trial or a new sentence. The District Court held that Hannah\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim was appropriately brought via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not via a petition for writ of <em>audita querela. </em>Because Hannah had not obtained this court\u2019s authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), the District Court held that it could not\u2014in any event\u2014proceed under \u00a7 2255. It denied Hannah\u2019s petition. Hannah filed a timely notice of appeal and has filed a statement opposing summary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the appeal presents \u201cno substantial question\u201d under Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We will, therefore, summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">We have held that <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>See Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608 (3d Cir.2005); <em>In re Olopade, </em>403 F.3d 159 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>is not a basis for authorizing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion). Apparently aware of these holdings, Hannah seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>raise a <em>Booker </em>challenge by employing the common law writ of <em>audita querela.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In support of his argument, Hannah cites to <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 510-11, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954), in which the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 2255 did not \u201cencompass the entire field of post-conviction relief\u2019 for federal prisoners. <em>Morgan </em>has come to stand for the proposition that common law writs such as <em>coram nobis </em>and <em>audita querela </em>can be used to the extent that they \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d in post-conviction remedies. <em>United States v. Valdez-Pacheco, </em>237 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Obado v. N.J., </em>328 F.3d 716, 718 (3d Cir.2003). Hannah argues that because <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, this creates a \u201cgap\u201d in the available post-conviction remedies which justifies his use of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We disagree. Section 2255 is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence or conviction. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). We have held that a federal prisoner can seek collateral relief via habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the rare situation where \u00a7 2255\u2019s scope or procedure makes it \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to challenge a conviction or sentence. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). However, a previous denial of \u00a7 2255 relief does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Similarly, Hannah cannot use <em>audita querela </em>in order to evade the AEDPA\u2019s stringent requirements for filing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See Valdez-Pacheco, </em>237 F.3d at 1080. <em>See also United States v. Kimberlin, </em>675 F.2d 866, 869 (7th Cir.1982). Hannah\u2019s claim is cognizable under \u00a7 2255; therefore, there is no \u201cgap\u201d in post-conviction remedies. <em>See Valdez-Pacheco, </em>237 F.3d at 1080. The fact that <em>Booker </em>cannot be applied retroactively in his case does not create such a gap. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538 (\u201c[i]t is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">For these reasons, we agree with the District Court\u2019s refusal to entertain Hannah\u2019s petition. We will, therefore, summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\">. We understand the District Court to have denied Hannah <em>audita querela </em>relief, not to have actually recharacterized Hannah\u2019s pleading as a \u00a7 2255 motion and then denied relief. If the District Court had denied Hannah relief pursuant to \u00a7 2255, he would need a certificate of appealability to proceed in this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). To the extent, if any, that the District Court actually did recharacterize Hannah\u2019s pleading, we DENY him a certificate of appealability. <em>See Robinson v. Johnson, </em>313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir.2002) (noting that a District Court may not entertain a second or successive habeas petition when this court has not issued the required certification). We note, too, that although a pleading such as Hannah's should, in certain circumstances, be recharacterized <em>only </em>after issuance of notice to the filer, such notice is not necessary when, as here, the \u00a7 2255 motion would be second or successive. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003); <em>United States v. Torres, </em>282 F.3d 1241, 1246 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
