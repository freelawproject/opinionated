The district court calculated Rivera\u2019s advisory Guidelines range as 188 to 235 months. On appeal, Rivera argues that the district court clearly erred in assessing a two-level increase in his offense level for an aggravating role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.1(c). After review, we affirm Rivera\u2019s 188-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-25\">A. Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b532-26\">Section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines allows the sentencing court to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by two, three or four levels as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-27\">(a) If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-28\">(b) If the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-29\">(c) If the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSection 3B1.1 requires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993). The four-level enhancement in \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) also requires criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). However, \u201cthe assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000). In assessing a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the factors the courts should consider include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">the exercise of decision making authority, [2] the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, [3] the recruitment of accomplices, [4] the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, [5] the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, [6] the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and [7] the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">B. Rivera\u2019s Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in enhancing Rivera\u2019s sentence by two levels for his aggravated role in the offense. Through the testimony of an undercover agent, the government demonstrated that Rivera (1) negotiated the price of a pound of methamphetamine from $11,000 to $12,500; (2) negotiated the terms of another sale, including allowing the agent to take the drugs to New York and pay later; and (3) gave direction to a subordinate in the presence of the agent. Further, on one occasion, the undercover agent attempted to negotiate prices with the same subordinate, who told the agent to call Rivera directly. In short, Rivera exercised decision-making authority, was the main participant in the commission of the offense, had a large, if not exclusive, role in planning or organizing the offense, and appeared to control a subordinate\u2019s activities. Thus, there is no reversible error in the role enhancement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">. Rivera was sentenced on September 1, 2005, and after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines under the same standards as we did <em>pre-Booker, </em>namely, that the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo </em>and factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). We first determine, utilizing pre<em>Booker </em>precedent, whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the Guidelines to determine the appropriate advisory Guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 1178. On appeal, Rivera argues only about the role enhancement and does not raise a reasonableness issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
