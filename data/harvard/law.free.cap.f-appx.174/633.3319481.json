Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Attorney General Alberto R.

We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), a petitioner must exhaust all administrative remedies available to him as of right. A petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust precludes review on appeal to this Court. <em>See Cervantes-Ascencio v. U.S.I.N.S., </em>326 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir.2003). Section 1252(d)(1) has been held to, more specifically, preclude review by this Court of <em>issues </em>not raised below. <em>See Gill v. I.N.S., </em>420 F.3d 82, 85-87 (2d Cir.2005) <em>citing, inter alia, Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 77 (2d Cir.2004). This Court, however, may assume jurisdiction even if a claim was not administratively exhausted to avoid manifest injustice. <em>See id. </em>at 87 <em>citing Marrero Pichardo v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 46, 53 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-18\">Lin\u2019s appeal to the BIA challenged the denial of his asylum and withholding of removal claims, but did not challenge the adverse credibility finding. That finding, which rests on inconsistencies and implausibilities in his testimony and the lack of documentary corroboration, was the basis for the IJ\u2019s holding. Lin did not at all challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. Lin has thus waived all the arguments he makes to this Court. A review of the IJ\u2019s decision confirms that no manifest injustice will occur if this Court declines to address the claims that Lin has administratively waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-20\">Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
