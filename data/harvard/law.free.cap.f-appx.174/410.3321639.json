R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b434-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">Jon Johnston, a state prisoner convicted of two counts of aggravated murder, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Johnston asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) in the negotiation of his plea and sentencing agreement, which included a waiver of his right to seek post-conviction and federal habeas corpus relief in exchange for the State\u2019s commitment not to seek the death penalty. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">The State argues that Johnston\u2019s state court waiver of the right to seek federal habeas relief precludes review of his \u00a7 2254 petition. However, Johnston\u2019s federal habeas petition raises an IAC claim that challenges the validity of the waiver itself. \u201cA plea agreement that waives the right to file a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is unenforceable with respect to an IAC claim that challenges the voluntariness of the waiver.\u201d <em>Washington v. Lamport, </em>422 F.3d 864, 871 (9th Cir.2005). Because Johnston\u2019s waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>is unenforceable with respect to this claim, the district court had jurisdiction over the petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Although there is some question whether Johnston properly raised an IAC claim premised on an alleged conflict of interest in state court, we need not resolve this issue because Johnston\u2019s IAC claims fail on the merits. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2); <em>Cassett v. Stewart, </em>406 F.3d 614, 623 (9th Cir.2005). As in <em>Washington, </em>Johnston does not demonstrate that \u201cany conflict, actual or theoretical, adversely affected his attorneys\u2019 performance,\u201d or that, \u201chad his attorneys performed differently, he would have rejected the [plea and sentencing agreement]\u201d and insisted on going to trial. 422 F.3d at 873. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Johnston\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b434-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
