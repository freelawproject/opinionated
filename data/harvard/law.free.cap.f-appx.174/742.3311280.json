Johnson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the propriety of the colloquy pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, and Johnson\u2019s sentence as an armed career criminal. At the direction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>court, the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing the validity of Johnson\u2019s sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Johnson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We find that Johnson\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Rule 11. Johnson was properly advised of his rights, the offense charged, and the maximum sentence for the offense. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Johnson questions whether the district court properly counted his South Carolina burglary convictions as violent felony offenses for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act. The statute defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include burglary. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000). Thus, the district court properly considered Johnson\u2019s burglary convictions as predicate offenses under the armed career criminal statute. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598-99, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>71 F.3d 115, 117 (4th Cir.1995) (applying categorical approach to definition of violent felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In his supplemental brief, Johnson raises three grounds of error under <em>Booker. </em>First, he asserts that the district court erred in applying <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(a) (2002) as mandatory and imposing his federal sentence to run consecutive to the state sentences that he was serving. Because this issue was not presented in the district court, this court reviews for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The district court\u2019s imposition of Johnson\u2019s sentence under the mandatory sentencing guidelines regime was error, which was plain. <em>White, </em>405 F.3d at 216-17. In determining whether an error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights\u2014the third prong of the analysis\u2014the defendant must show that the error \u201c \u2018affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Johnson asserts that the district court did not have the opportunity to consider an alternative application of the guidelines because <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Booker </em>had not yet been decided. He states that \u201cit might appear that the district court considered a concurrent sentence.\u201d The asserted confusion arose due to a misstatement in the presentence report. The district court corrected this error, stating that \u201cit actually should have said consecutive. It\u2019s mandatory. I have no discretion.\u201d The court later explained, \u201ceven if [a consecutive sentence] is not mandated [by the guidelines], I believe a consecutive sentence is appropriate in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Because our review of \u201cthe record as a whole provides no nonspeculative basis for concluding that the treatment of the guidelines as mandatory \u2018a\u00a3fect[ed] the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u2019 \u201d <em>White, </em>405 F.3d at 223 (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)), we conclude that Johnson has not shown that he was prejudiced by the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>trict court\u2019s determination of his sentence under the mandatory guideline regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Johnson next contends that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>because the district court sentenced him as an armed career criminal based on facts not included in the indictment, admitted by him, or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We have recently held that a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant had qualifying felony convictions that supported an armed career criminal designation does not violate <em>Booker. See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The final issue asserted in Johnson\u2019s supplemental brief is whether the district court\u2019s finding that he had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies committed on different occasions from one another and sentencing him under the Armed Career Criminal Act runs afoul of <em>Booker. </em>We have recently held that the dates of commission of the prior offenses is a fact of a prior conviction and need not be alleged in the indictment, admitted by the defendant, or found beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 286 (4th Cir.2005), <em>pet. for cert. filed (Oct. </em>25, 2005) (No. 05-7266). Accordingly, we find no <em>Booker </em>error, much less plain error, by the district court in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel's motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
