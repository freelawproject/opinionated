Her principal contention on appeal is that she should be held responsible only for the amount of money that was actually laundered and not the entire amount she received.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-24\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, laundered funds include the amount of funds involved in a \u201cfinancial transaction.\u201d Ramirez, in this case, received $148,500 for the purpose of laundering knowing that the funds were a proceeds of illegal drug activity. The fact that she only returned approximately $69,000 is irrelevant to the proper application of the statute. The transaction was comprised of the $148,500. There was no error. <em>See United States v. Gough, </em>152 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir.1998) (delivery of drug proceeds is financial transaction for purposes of \u00a7 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-25\">The government correctly concedes that the district court sentenced on the basis of Guidelines it believed were mandatory, and that remand pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005), is required. The sentence is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-26\">AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b431-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
