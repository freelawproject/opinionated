Montrevil filed this proceeding in the district court as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) petition for habeas corpus relief. The district court properly transferred the proceeding to this court upon enactment of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 311 (\u201cthe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In accordance with the Act, we have reviewed Montrevil\u2019s case \u201cas if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review\u201d under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252 (West 2000 &amp; Supp. II 2005). 119 Stat. at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Although a current challenge to a 1994 Board decision would normally be untimely under \u00a7 1252(b)(1), \u00a7 106(c) renders the normal time limits inapplicable to cases transferred under that provision. 119 Stat. at 311. The Board found Montrevil ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because, by the time of its decision, Montrevil had been imprisoned for over five years on an aggravated felony conviction. Under a 1990 amendment to \u00a7 212(c), \u201caliens convicted of an aggravated felony who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years\u201d are barred from seeking the discretionary waiver under \u00a7 212(c). <em>De Osorio v. INS, </em>10 F.3d 1034, 1036 (4th Cir.1993). At the time of the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying Montrevil \u00a7 212(c) relief in the exercise of his discretion, Montrevil was ten days short of having served five years on his aggravated felony. By the time of the Board\u2019s decision, he had served over five years, and the Board therefore found him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. On appeal, Montrevil challenges this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">The First Circuit has recently affirmed the position taken by the Board in this case that \u201can alien continues to accrue time toward the five-year bar to section 212(c) relief after the issuance of a final order of removal.\u201d <em>Fernandes Pereira v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 38, 42 (1st Cir.2005). <em>See also Buitrago-Cuesta v. INS, </em>7 F.3d 291, 293-96 (2d Cir.1993) (holding that the five year period is not measured as of the date the \u00a7 212(c) application is filed but as of the time of the final administrative decision). We agree with these decisions and therefore deny Montrevil\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-15\"> Section 106(c) of the Act requires the transfer of any \u00a7 2241 petition filed by an alien and challenging, among other things, a final administrative order of deportation pending in the district court on the effective date of the Act, May 11, 2005. 119 Stat. at 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
