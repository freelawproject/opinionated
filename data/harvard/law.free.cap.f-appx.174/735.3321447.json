Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae (West Supp. II 2005), this court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s discretionary decision to deny adjustment of status. A narrow exception to this jurisdictional bar exists when the petitioner raises constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West Supp. II 2005); <em>see Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir.2006) (finding no jurisdiction where Higuit raised no constitutional claims or questions of law). Here, as Jassiem challenges only factual issues and the Board\u2019s exercise of discretion, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
