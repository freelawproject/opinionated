HOLLOWAY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">Defendant-appellant Bruce Holder entered a plea of guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm after a former felony conviction, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). He now brings this appeal, raising only one issue\u2014whether his sentence should be set aside under the holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The government has moved to dismiss the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>peal, contending that jurisdiction is lacking because Holder does not present any col-orable claim that his sentence was imposed in violation of law or as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The plea agreement in this case recites that it is entered into under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the agreement, \u201c[t]he parties stipulate that sentencing in this case will be determined by application of the sentencing guidelines, issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Although Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c) permits agreements of greater specificity, in this case the government only agreed to a sentence at the lowest end of the applicable range. And, under the language just quoted, the parties specifically agreed that the guideline range was to be calculated by the district court in the ordinary way.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">A defendant\u2019s right to appeal his sentence is limited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), which provides that an appeal may be taken if the sentence was imposed in violation of law or as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines (along with two other grounds that are plainly not applicable here). The government points out that Mr. Holder does not allege any error in the application of the guidelines. Thus, this appeal can be maintained only if it was imposed in violation of law. The government argues that there can have been no violation of law here, because after the guidelines range had been calculated, the sentence was imposed based on the agreement, leaving no possibility for <em>Booker </em>error. We agree, as this issue has recently been resolved in this circuit. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>413 F.3d 1283 (10th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">We conclude that this case is not distinguishable from <em>Silva, </em>and so is controlled by it. Accordingly, we must DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\">. Rule 11(c) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">(c) Plea Agreement Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">(1) In General.
