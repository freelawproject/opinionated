Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>For the following reasons, we find that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendant-Appellant Manuela Delarosa Civil\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Civil pled guilty to and was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Her base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6) of the Sentencing Guidelines was 28, based on the quantity of methamphetamine involved. Her offense level was then increased by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(3), based on a finding by the district court that the object of the offense was the distribution of a controlled substance in a federal prison. Civil met the stringent criteria for the safety valve exception of USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 and thereunder received a two-level reduction. Finally, Civil received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 25. With a criminal history category of I, the applicable guideline range for imprisonment was 57-71 months, and the district court sentenced Civil to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. Although the district court sentenced Civil to the minimum Guidelines sentence, it made no statement whatsoever concerning whether it would be inclined to impose a lesser sentence under an advisory sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">Civil appealed her conviction and sentence, arguing that she was erroneously denied a downward adjustment to her sentence under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based on her minor role in the offense. We affirmed in an unpublished opinion, upholding the district court\u2019s finding that Civil was in fact a key participant in the drug trafficking transaction for which she was convicted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Civil then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. As noted above, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-B\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">Civil raised her <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in her petition for certiorari. Therefore, we will not review her <em>Booker </em>claim absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The extraordinary cireum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>stances standard is more demanding than the plain error review that we employ when a defendant has raised her <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant cannot satisfy the plain error standard, she certainly cannot satisfy the extraordinary circumstances standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Civil\u2019s claim does not survive plain error review, we need not address the question of extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines (1) constitutes error, and (2) that error is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. She carries her burden if she can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when she identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">In her supplemental letter brief, Civil concedes that there are no statements by the district court in the record indicating that it would have sentenced her differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, Civil calls to our attention the fact that the district court imposed only the minimum sentence under the Guidelines. However, we have held that \u201c[t]he fact that the sentencing judge imposed the minimum sentence under the Guideline range ... alone is no indication that the judge would have reached a different conclusion under an advisory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Civil thus fails to demonstrate from the record that her sentence would have been significantly different under an advisory Guidelines scheme, and she therefore has not carried her burden to establish error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Civil next argues that she should not be required to carry this burden at all, because <em>Booker </em>error is (1) structural and (2) presumptively prejudicial. We have specifically rejected both of these contentions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Civil further urges us to abandon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>our approach under <em>Mares </em>and instead apply the law of the Fourth,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Sixth<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Ninth<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Circuits. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">As Civil has failed to satisfy plain error review, we do not reach her argument that error in her sentencing seriously affected the fairness, integrity and public reputation of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Civil\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
