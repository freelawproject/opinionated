We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ accurately observed that Jata\u2019s accounts of the events of September 1998 were inconsistent. While Jata testified that he was able to avoid detention at that time, he claimed in his written application that the police detained and beat him. The IJ properly relied on this obvious inconsistency, which was material to Jata\u2019s claim of having been persecuted on account of his political beliefs, and afforded \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in support of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, although the IJ did not solicit an explanation from Jata for the inconsistency. <em>See Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 121 (2d Cir.2006), <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">The IJ appropriately factored Jata\u2019s demeanor into his adverse credibility finding, having the advantage of observing Jata as he testified. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 290; <em>Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 398-99 (2d Cir.2005) (indicating that a factfinder\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s demeanor as a witness, provides a \u201ccrucial means\u201d of distinguishing between persuasive and unpersuasive claims of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">Additionally, the IJ reasonably found Jata\u2019s response to the submission of the letter from the Tirana court directing him to appear at the police station, implausible. Jata initially testified that he did not know \u201cat all\u201d what had happened to the letter, denied that his parents sent it to him in the United States, and denied that he had seen the letter since leaving Albania. After being presented with the letter and told that it had been in the Government\u2019s file since Jata had provided it during his asylum interview, Jata explained that he had \u201cforgot[ten] all about it.\u201d The IJ acknowledged Jata\u2019s explanation, but appropriately discredited it, finding it \u201cabsolutely impossible to believe that the applicant would forget about the existence of the very document that cause him to flee his home land.\u201d <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 403 (2d Cir.2005) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>(indicating that an IJ is not required to credit an applicant\u2019s explanations even if they appear plausible, but is required to take those explanations into account as significant factual assertions supporting the applicant\u2019s claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding rested on valid grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
