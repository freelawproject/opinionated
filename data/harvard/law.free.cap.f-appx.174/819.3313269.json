Dayse contends that the defendants placed him in a holding cell for three hours in retaliation for his threats to file a grievance against defendant Doe, a prison guard, when Doe refused to change the television channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-26\">Dayse\u2019s complaint and his response to the district court\u2019s questionnaire reveal that he failed to allege facts to establish retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right. <em>See Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310-11 (5th Cir.1997). Dayse\u2019s allegations also fail to show that he was deprived of any constitutionally protected interest, or that any defendant acted with deliberate indifference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>to his health or safety. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Dayse is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). If Dayse accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b843-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
