New Jersey </em><footnotemark><em>***</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>and that district court abused its discretion by requiring that Ayala cooperate with the probation officer in the collection of DNA as a condition of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">The Government concedes that Ayala preserved his challenge to the application of mandatory sentencing guidelines by objecting that the sentencing proceeding violated <em>Blakely v. Washington. </em><footnotemark><em>****</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As the sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime, the Government has not borne its burden of establishing that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">Ayala\u2019s argument that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ayala contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ayala properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">Ayala\u2019s challenge to a condition of his supervised release requiring that he cooperate with the probation officer in the collection of a DNA sample is not ripe for review on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 761-62 (5th Cir.2003), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1136, 124 S.Ct. 1116, 157 L.Ed.2d 943 (2004); <em>see United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number><em>filed, </em>(U.S. Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 8662). Accordingly, we dismiss this argument for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING; DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b854-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
