On appeal, this Court affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part for the District Court to \u201caddress Tucker\u2019s claims of involuntary administration of medication and violation of his right to refuse treatment,\u201d as well as \u201cto consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Tucker\u2019s state law claims.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Ann Klein Forensic, et al, </em>C.A. No. 03-1135 (3d Cir. July 17, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">On remand, Tucker filed an amended complaint in which he alleged that the defendants, employees of the Ann Klein Forensic Center (\u201cAnn Klein defendants\u201d) and the Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital (\u201cGreystone defendants\u201d), violated his due process rights by involuntarily medicating him for chronic paranoid schizophrenia. Tucker also asserted state law claims of negligence and malpractice. Tucker sought 300 billion dollars in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">In September 2003, while Tucker\u2019s action was proceeding in the District Court, he filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey against the Ann Klein defendants, as well as Superior Court Judges Vena and Falcone. <em>Tucker v. Vena, </em>MRS-L-2620-03. In his complaint, Tucker alleged that between July 11, 2001 and January 4, 2002, the Ann Klein defendants, <em>inter alia, </em>involuntarily medicated him, medicated him without citing appropriate symptoms, falsely testified in the Superior Court, and violated the New Jersey Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights. In October 2004, the Superior Court dismissed Tucker\u2019s complaint with prejudice on the ground that \u201cthe matter [was] pending in another Court, and there [was] no good cause for both cases to proceed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tucker apparently did not file an appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">The defendants then filed a motion in the District Court to dismiss Tucker\u2019s action arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his claims were barred by the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine. <em>See Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). In an order entered on December 17, 2004, the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>specifically relied on the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine, and held that resolution of Tuckei'\u2019s claims would impermissibly interfere with an ongoing state court proceeding. Tucker filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the District Court on February 2, 2005. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The District Courts have \u201cdiscretion to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over a particular claim where resolution of that claim in federal court would offend principles of comity by interfering with an ongoing state proceeding.\u201d <em>Addiction Specialists, Inc. v. Township of Hampton, </em>411 F.3d 399, 408 (3d Cir.2005). However, \u201cabstention rarely should be invoked, and is only appropriate in a few carefully defined situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Yang v. Tsui, </em>416 F.3d 199, 201 (3d Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cthe general rule is that the pendency of a state court proceeding is not a reason for a federal court to decline to exercise jurisdiction established by Congress\u201d). The proponent of <em>Younger </em>abstention must show that: (1) there are ongoing state proceedings that are judicial in nature; (2) the state proceedings implicate important state interests; and (3) the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims. <em>See, e.g., Gwynedd Properties, Inc. v. Lower Gwynedd Township, </em>970 F.2d 1195, 1200 (3d Cir.1992). We exercise plenary review over the legal question of whether the requirements for <em>Younger </em>abstention have been met and, if so, we review the District Court\u2019s decision to abstain for abuse of discretion. <em>Yang, </em>416 F.3d at 201; <em>see also Gwynedd Properties, </em>970 F.2d at 1199. \u201cIn conducting this review, we are mindful that the mere existence of a pending state proceeding between the parties that parallels the facts of the federal action is not itself sufficient.\u201d <em>Addiction Specialists, </em>411 F.3d at 408. Instead, all three prongs must be satisfied in order for the District Court to properly abstain from exercising jurisdiction over a complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Generally, <em>Younger </em>precludes federal intervention in ongoing state proceedings. The state action, however, need not predate the federal action for <em>Younger </em>abstention to apply. <em>See, e.g., For Your Eyes Alone, Inc. v. City of Columbus, Ga., </em>281 F.3d 1209, 1217 (11th Cir.2002). Instead, the Supreme Court has held that federal courts are to abstain if the state action was commenced \u201cbefore any proceedings of substance on the merits have taken place in federal court,\u201d <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 349, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975), or if \u201cthe federal litigation [is] in an embryonic stage and no contested matter [has] been decided.\u201d <em>Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 929, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); see <em>also Hawaii Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff, </em>467 U.S. 229, 238, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 81 L.Ed.2d 186 (1984) (concluding that the federal action should be dismissed in favor of the state action if there have been no \u201cproceedings on the merits ... in the federal court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Tucker submitted his federal complaint in August 2002, 13 months before he filed <em>Tucker v. Vena, </em>MRS-L-2620-03, in the Superior Court of New Jersey. Between August 2002 and September 2003, Tucker\u2019s federal action was dismissed by the District Court as legally frivolous in an order which was appealed to this Court. On appeal, we agreed with the District Court that a number of Tucker\u2019s claims lacked merit and were properly dismissed. However, we remanded the matter to the District Court in July 2003 for consideration of Tucker\u2019s claims of forced medication. Thereafter, Tucker filed two motions to reinstate his claims, as well as his first amended complaint. It was only after all of these events had occurred that Tuck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>er filed his complaint in the Superior Court. Thus, by the time Tucker filed his complaint in the Superior Court, his federal action had been pending for more than one year, both the District Court and this Court had addressed and resolved the merits of several of Tucker\u2019s claims, and there had been one appeal to this Court. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Tucker\u2019s federal action had progressed beyond the point at which <em>Younger </em>abstention could properly be invoked. Accordingly, the District Court erred in dismissing Tucker\u2019s complaint pursuant to <em>Younger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Finally, we note that in their brief on appeal, appellees argue, <em>inter alia, </em>that as an alternative to <em>Younger, </em>we may affirm the order of the District Court on the ground that Tucker\u2019s complaint failed to comply with the notice provision of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act. However, as the New Jersey Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe notice provision of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, N.J.S.A. 59:8-8, does not apply to Section 1983 cases.\u201d <em>Schneider v. Simonini </em>163 N.J. 336, 749 A.2d 336, 355 (2000); <em>see also Fuchilla v. Layman, </em>109 N.J. 319, 537 A.2d 652 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s February 2, 2005 order, and remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\">. Tucker was enjoined by the District Court on November 18, 2002, from further litigation unless he either paid the filing fee or obtained leave of court. <em>Tucker v. Walsh, et al., </em>D. N.J. Civ. No. 02-cv-04667 (Bissell, J.), <em>aff'd </em>C.A. No. 02-4483 (3d Cir. December 1, 2003). Although Tucker's complaint in this action was not \"filed\u201d until December 16, 2002, when the District Court granted him leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we deem his complaint constructively filed as of August 5, 2002, the date on which his complaint and <em>in forma pauperis </em>application were received in the District Court. <em>See Urrutia v. Harrisburg County Police Dept., </em>91 F.3d 451, 458 n. 13 (3d Cir.1996). Accordingly, the underlying action does not violate Judge Bissell's order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-14\">. There is no citation in the October 2004 order to the other \"pending\u201d case, nor is there any indication in the order as to whether the case was pending in state or federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
