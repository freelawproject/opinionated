The district court sentenced Juarez-Huarte to twenty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> JuarezHuarte\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the sentence imposed was reasonable. JuarezHuarte was given an opportunity to file a <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We review Juarez-Huarte\u2019s sentencing claim on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed \u201cwithin the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006). We find the district court here properly consulted the Guidelines and took them into account in determining Juarez-Huarte\u2019s sentence, that it made all the factual findings appropriate for that determination, considered the sentencing range along with the other factors described in \u00a7 3553(a), and imposed a sentence that was \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Juarez-Huarte\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\"> The probation officer calculated a sentencing guideline range of 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment. This calculation was founded on an adjusted offense level of 20 (the base offense level was 8 pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\"USSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (2004), to which the probation officer added twelve levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) because Juarez-Huarte had a prior conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense), yielding a total offense level of 17, after a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). The probation officer also assigned Juarez-Huarte a criminal history category of II based on the aforementioned felony drug trafficking offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
