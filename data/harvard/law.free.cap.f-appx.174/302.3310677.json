Her application was denied by both an administrative law judge (ALJ) and the Commissioner of Social Security. Liebhart then filed a cpmplaint in federal district court, alleging that the administrative decision was improper. A magistrate judge concluded that the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>decision was supported by substantial evidence. The district court agreed, resulting in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We must uphold the ALJ\u2019s conclusions if they are supported by substantial evidence and if the ALJ applied the correct legal criteria. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Heston v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>245 F.3d 528, 534 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201cJudicial review is limited to determining whether the district court erred in finding that the ALJ\u2019s ruling was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). When reviewing the ALJ\u2019s conclusions, we \u201cmay not try the case <em>de novo, </em>nor resolve conflicts in evidence, nor decide questions of credibility.\u201d <em>See Garner v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 383, 387 (6th Cir.1984); <em>see also Foster v. Halter, </em>279 F.3d 348, 353 (6th Cir.2001) (noting that the court should defer to the agency\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence, \u201ceven if there is substantial evidence in the record that would have supported an opposite conclusion\u201d) (quoting <em>Key v. Callahan, </em>109 F.3d 270, 273 (6th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The ALJ found that Liebhart was suffering from vestibular disturbance, dysto-nia, and Lyme\u2019s disease. According to the ALJ, these impairments were \u201csevere\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act\u2019s Regulations, \u201cbut not severe enough to meet or medically equal one of the impairments listed [in the Regulations].\u201d Despite finding that Liebhart suffered from severe impairments, the ALJ concluded that she could still perform the job of a cashier as of the date that her insured status expired\u2014that date being December 31,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Because the persuasive reasoning that supports the judgment in favor of the Commissioner has been clearly articulated by the magistrate judge in her comprehensive Report and Recommendation that was adopted by the district court, the issuance of a detailed written opinion by us would be unduly duplicative. The judgment rendered by the Honorable John R. Adams on April 26, 2005, adopting the September 14, 2004 Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Nancy A. Vecchiarelli, is accordingly AFFIRMED on the basis of the reasoning contained in those documents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
