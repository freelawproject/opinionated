Cline\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising several issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Cline was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">Counsel questions whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Chile\u2019s guilty plea. Because Cline did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing leads us to conclude that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11. We therefore find no plain error in the court\u2019s acceptance of Cline\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">Next, \u2019 counsel raises as potential issues whether the district court properly classified Cline as a career offender pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2004), and whether, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), such classification violates the Sixth Amendment. Cline did not object in the district court; thus, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 245 (4th Cir.) (stating standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005). We conclude that the district court properly designated Cline as a career offender. <em>See id. </em>(discussing elements of USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)). We also find that Cline\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-17\">Counsel also suggests that the district court erred in sentencing Cline to a 180-month sentence. Our review of the record convinces us that the district court properly calculated the advisory sentencing guideline range, which included a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s., based upon Cline\u2019s substantial assistance, and that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.2006) (discussing process in which district courts must engage to sentence defendants post-Booker); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>sonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Finally, with regard to Cline\u2019s suggestion that counsel provided ineffective assistance, we \u201cmay address [such claims] on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006) (No. 05-8667). Because counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness does not conclusively appear from the face of the record, we decline to review this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Cline\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
