The district court concluded that Mumford qualified for sentencing as a career offender pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2004), and sentenced him under an advisory sentencing regime, after considering the applicable sentencing range and the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005), to a sentence within the applicable guideline range. On appeal, Mumford asserts that his sentence violates the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because his guideline sentencing range was determined based upon facts that were not alleged in the indictment or admitted by him. However, Mumford concedes that his argument is against current Fourth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">Contrary to Mumford\u2019s position, his sentence was not violative of <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>or <em>Booker. </em>A district court may enhance a sentence based on the \u201cfact of\u2019 a prior conviction without running afoul of the Sixth Amendment, where the facts necessary to support the enhancement are \u201cinherent\u201d in the conviction rather than being \u201cextraneous\u201d to it. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282, 283-86 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006) (No. 05-7266); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 354 (4th Cir.) (holding that defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury was not violated by district court\u2019s reliance on prior convictions for purposes of sentencing under Armed Career Criminal Act), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). Moreover, on appeal, Mumford does not challenge any factual findings regarding the prior convictions, and he does not dispute the factual basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>district court\u2019s conclusion that he was a career offender. Hence, his assertion that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Mumford\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
