On April 15, 2005, the District Court revoked the supervised release and sentenced Serrano to 48 months incarceration. Serrano filed a timely appeal to this Court seeking a remand for re-sentencing. In support of his appeal, Serrano claims that the District Court (1) failed to provide advance notice of its intention to depart upwards from the sentencing guideline range applicable to Revocation of Supervised Release and (2) failed to articulate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>basis for the upward departure. For the reasons stated below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Serrano\u2019s first issue on appeal is that the District Court\u2019s failure to provide advance notice of its intention to depart upwards from the sentencing guideline range applicable to Revocation of Supervised Release justifies a remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Where, as here, a defendant \u201cfailed to object to a purported error before the sentencing court,\u201d we review the District Court\u2019s interpretation of law for plain error. <em>United States v. Couch, </em>291 F.3d 251, 252-53 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Knight, </em>266 F.3d 203, 206 (3d Cir.2001)). Revocation of Supervised Release proceedings are subject to Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2) which does not expressly or implicitly require advance notice of the sentencing court\u2019s intention to depart upwards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the District Court was not required to notify Serrano of its intent to impose a sentence that exceeded the range recommended under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">Serrano\u2019s second issue on appeal is that the District Court failed to articulate its basis for the upward departure, therefore justifying a remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">We review a District Court\u2019s decision to exceed the sentencing range prescribed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Schwegel, </em>126 F.3d 551, 555 (3d Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Blackston, </em>940 F.2d 877, 894 (3d Cir.1991) (noting that under such a standard we will only disturb a sentence if it is \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d). When a court imposes a sentence in accordance with Revocation of Supervised Release proceedings, it must <em>\u201cconsider\u201d </em>the sentencing range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), as well as \u201cstate on the record its <em>general </em>reasons under [18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a) ... for imposing a more stringent sentence.\u201d <em>Blackston, </em>940 F.2d at 893-94; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5), (c). Additional factors a court must consider include: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (4) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (5) the need to provide the defendant with appropriate treatment.\u201d <em>Blackston, </em>940 F.2d at 893-94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>(3d Cir.1991); <em>see also 18 U.S.G. </em>\u00a7 3553(a); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We agree that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when the sentence it imposed upon Serrano exceeded the sentencing range suggested under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). The record shows that the District Court explicitly acknowledged the advisory guideline range, as well as the appropriate statutory factors for consideration. The sentence imposed was particularly warranted given the numerous occasions on which Serrano appeared before the District Court and the variety of failed drug rehabilitation opportunities afforded him since he was indicted for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base and other related charges in the early 1990\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">. The first Petition was for a Grade \"C\" violation and the second Petition was for a Grade \"A\u201d violation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1 (classifying supervised release violations). The first Petition was filed on April 9, 2001, as a result of Serrano being in possession of a cup of beer and then eloping from the Community Correction Center without authority. The second Petition was filed on April 6, 2005, as a result of Serrano\u2019s admitted drug dealing activity. The government withdrew a third Petition as a result of a jury acquittal of the underlying charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-18\">. Serrano was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base (\"crack\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and other violations. On March 27, 1991, Serrano pled guilty to the conspiracy charge. On January 4, 1993, the District Court imposed a sentence of 117 months imprisonment, followed by five years supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\">. Serrano relies on Fed. R.Crim. P. 32(h) which states: \"Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s pre-hearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such departure.\u201d Rule 32.1(b)(2), in contrast to Rule 32(h), does not require this advanced notice because the sentencing guideline provisions for violations of supervised release, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a), are merely policy statements which never have been considered mandatory. <em>See United States v. Schwegel, </em>126 F.3d 551, 552 (3d Cir.1997). Rule 32(h) remains in full force notwithstanding that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), all sentencing guidelines must be considered advisory, rather than mandatory. Thus, although notice would be required if this case involved a departure from a guideline range for purposes of initial sentencing, this is not such a departure. <em>See Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
