We have jurisdiction to review the sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742 (West 2000). We review post-<em>Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-26\">Derrick Kimbrough pleaded guilty to distributing fifty or more grams of crack cocaine, distributing cocaine, conspiring to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, and possessing a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime. The sentencing guideline range was 168 to 210 months imprisonment for the drug counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>and 60 consecutive months for the firearm count. Based, in part, on the district court\u2019s disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine violations, the district court sentenced Kimbrough to 120 months on each of the three drug violations, to be served concurrently, and sixty months on the firearms charge, to be served consecutively. According to our recent decision in <em>United States v. Eura, 440 F.3d 625 </em>(4th Cir.2006), a sentence that is outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses. Because the district court concluded that the crack to powder cocaine disparity warranted a sentence below the applicable sentencing guideline range, we are constrained to vacate Kim-brough\u2019s sentence and to remand the case for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
