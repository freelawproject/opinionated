Jewson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas petition, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-23\">Whether the district court violated <em>Clis-by v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), by failing to address appellant\u2019s claim that the district court judge lacked jurisdiction to issue an order on an evidentiary hearing held before another judge, as set forth in claim 11 of appellant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-24\">Normally, we deem issues not argued in the petitioner\u2019s brief abandoned. <em>See Hartsfield v. Lemacks, </em>50 F.3d 950, 953 (11th Cir.1995) (considering abandonment in context of a \u00a7 1983 action). For example, in <em>Isaacs v. Head, </em>the district court certified 16 grounds for appeal in the COA, but Isaacs only argued 8 of these in his brief. 300 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2002). We held the other eight grounds were abandoned. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-25\">We granted a COA on the issue of whether the district court erred by not addressing the merits of Jewson\u2019s claim 11, that the state trial court conducting his post-conviction evidentiary hearing did not possess subject matter jurisdiction to rule on the hearing once the initial judge re-cused himself. Jewson\u2019s brief only addressed the merits of the claim, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>whether the district court erred by not addressing it. Jewson abandoned the sole issue on which we granted the COA by failing to argue the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Even if Jewson had not abandoned the claim, the district court did not fail to address Jewson\u2019s claim. All claims regarding defects, jurisdictional or otherwise, in Jewsoris state collateral proceeding were resolved by the district court\u2019s finding that such claims were not properly brought in a \u00a7 2254 petition because those claims did not attack Jewsoris confinement, but only attacked a proceeding collateral to that confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Jewson abandoned the <em>Clisby </em>issue on appeal. Furthermore, the district court resolved each issue related to Jewsoris state collateral proceeding in deciding his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
