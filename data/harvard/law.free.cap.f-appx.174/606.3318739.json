We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a short decision that primarily adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s opinion, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including credibility, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 156-58 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The IJ found that Lumaj failed to establish that her last entry to the United States was in April 2000 rather than in October 1997. We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s factual conclusion that Lumaj failed to file her asylum application within one year of entry to the United States, or to demonstrate exceptional circumstances justifying the late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (a)(3). Although we retain jurisdiction over related constitutional challenges and issues of statutory interpretation, Lumaj has not raised any such issues. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>434 F.3d at 154. Even to the extent Lumaj\u2019s fact-based argument is read to include an implicit challenge to the IJ\u2019s interpretation of <em>\u201clast </em>arrival in the United States,\u201d <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(2)(ii) (emphasis added), the IJ was reasonable in calculating the one-year deadline from the 1997 entry because the alleged 2000 entry followed a brief trip to Canada rather than a flight from persecution. <em>See Joaquin-Porras v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 172, 179-80 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Lumaj\u2019s withholding and CAT claims were not subject to any time bar. However, her failure to address these claims meaningfully in her brief to this Court severely constrains our ability to review the BIA\u2019s findings. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998) (explaining that issues not sufficiently developed in a petitioner\u2019s brief are considered abandoned). Although it would not have changed the outcome petitioner unfortunately did not receive effective assistance in this appeal. Even construing her eonclusory statements as substantive arguments, however, we would find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s factual findings. The IJ pointed out various discrepancies between Lumaj\u2019s testimony and asylum application that were both present and material to her claim of persecution. Moreover, she only described three relatively brief incidents of personal harm, one of which consisted only of a vague, unsubstantiated threat, and another where she could not prove who the perpetrator was. Finally, her substantial delay in applying for asylum undermines the seriousness of the threat of persecution or torture, and Lumaj has pointed to no further evidence to suggest that the threat of persecution or torture is objectively greater now. Substantial evidence thus supports the denial of withholding and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
