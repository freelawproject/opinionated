We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">To the extent that Jia challenges the IJ\u2019s underlying order denying his application for relief, this Court lacks jurisdiction because Jia failed to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s February 2004 final order of removal. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89 (2d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). Similarly, Jia\u2019s petition for review is not timely as to the BIA\u2019s June 2004 denial of his motion to reopen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Jia has filed a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his July 2004 motions to reopen and for reconsideration, which this Court reviews for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>We find no such abuse, because as the BIA correctly concluded, Jia\u2019s July 2004 motion to reopen is his second such motion and, thus, proeedurally barred. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Additionally, the motion to reopen is time-barred, as it was filed more than ninety days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal entered in February 2004. Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Jia\u2019s motion for the BIA to reconsider its June 2004 denial of his first motion to reopen because the motion to reconsider failed to make any showing that the BIA\u2019s June 2004 decision was based on a legal or factual error.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
