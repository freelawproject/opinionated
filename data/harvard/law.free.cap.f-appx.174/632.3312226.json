We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Where, as here, the BIA issues an independent decision without adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The BIA held that Xie failed to establish that he suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution or torture. These findings are supported by substantial evidence. Xie\u2019s past persecution claim is that the police confiscated flyers related to Christianity that he was passing out in front of a Church, and warned him not to continue distributing them. These experiences did not rise to the level of persecution, an \u201cextreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Ai Feng Yuan v. DOJ, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995)). Xie\u2019s future persecution claim is based solely on his testimony that his mother had told him that two church members had been arrested and remained in detention for having distributed Christianity-related flyers. This unsubstantiated hearsay is of little weight, and does not rebut the State Department report indicating that official and underground churches exist unmolested in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">With respect to Xie\u2019s CAT claim, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s determination that Xie failed to show that he would more likely than not be tortured if he returned to China. This determination was also supported by substantial evidence: Xie did not mention torture during his testimony before the IJ, and he has not presented any evidence to substantiate his claim that he would likely be the victim of torture if he returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
