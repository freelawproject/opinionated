We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Zhao\u2019s motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zhong Guang Sun v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 105, 107 (2d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">A motion to reconsider must specify errors of fact or law and be supported by pertinent authority. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Chen did not identify any errors of law or fact that were not previously raised. His motion to reconsider argued that the IJ and BIA erred in denying his claims for relief because he established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his participation in Falun Gong activities. Because the BIA had already rejected these arguments, it did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 110 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Strato v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 651, 655 (8th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay <em>of </em>removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
