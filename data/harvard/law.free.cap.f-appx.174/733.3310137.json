Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-23\">The Board ruled that Bezabeh did not warrant the exercise of favorable discretion because he did not produce evidence sufficient to overcome the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding. We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Bezabeh fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we find that no abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>cretion occurred, and therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
