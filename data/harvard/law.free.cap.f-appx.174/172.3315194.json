The bankruptcy court denied the motions and the district court dismissed the appeals because they were not filed by a licensed attorney. We have reviewed the records in these appeals and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeals for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Terry v. Sparrow, </em>Nos. CA-04-432-1; CA-04-742-1; BK-01-11367 (M.D.N.C. filed Mar. 30, 2005; entered Mar. 31, 2005 &amp; Apr. 22, 2005). Additionally, we deny Terry\u2019s motions for a rehearing of the denial of his motion to disqualify counsel for the Appel-lee, for sanctions, for appointment of counsel, for review under the Administrative Procedures Act of Appellee\u2019s informal brief, and to expedite oral argument. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
