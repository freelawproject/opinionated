Saevoon was employed as a computer specialist with the FDIC. The district court held that Saevoon\u2019s discrimination claims failed because she had not shown that the nondiscriminatory reasons given by the FDIC for not promoting her were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-18\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court correctly decided the issues before it. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Sae-voon v. Powell, </em>No. CA-04-765-1 (E.D. Va. filed Mar. 31, 2005 <em>&amp; </em>entered Apr. 6, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
