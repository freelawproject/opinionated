The Immigration Judge (IJ) found his testimony incredible and denied his application. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision, we deny Av/s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-25\">Born in Mauritania in 1952, Aw grew up in a small village where he worked on his family\u2019s farm. As a young adult, Aw moved to Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, where he earned a living buying and selling clothing. In early 1986, Aw testified, he received a message from his father instructing him to return to the family\u2019s village, and after traveling six hours by car to reach the village, he discovered \u201cmilitary soldiers\u201d \u201cconfiscating\u201d his family\u2019s land \u201cby [ ] order of the government.\u201d JA 123-24. According to Aw\u2019s testimony, the soldiers claimed that the land did not belong to \u201cblack people\u201d but instead belonged to \u201call of us.\u201d JA 124. Aw informed the soldiers that the land belonged to his father, who had lived there his entire life and who had inherited the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>from Aw\u2019s grandfather. The soldiers, Aw\u2019s testimony continued, beat him in front of the other villagers, tied him up and transported him to a prison in another town. Aw testified that while in prison he was placed in a \u201ctiny room\u201d where he was beaten for most of the day and had cold water thrown on him every morning. JA 124. He was released after approximately one week of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Aw further testified that when he returned to his village he found that his family had been forced across the border to Jung, Senegal. On May 2, 1986, he traveled to Jung, where he found his family staying \u201cin somebody\u2019s house,\u201d JA 136, living in what he described as \u201cnot a pleasant situation,\u201d JA 126. His 80-year-old father, he learned, had died during the family\u2019s forced removal. While attempting to cross a river on the way to Jung, his father had fallen into the river and swallowed a great deal of river water, which caused him to become ill and eventually to die two days later. Aw testified that before the forced removal his sister had been raped and had become pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Aw testified that he stayed with his family for a little over two weeks before leaving for Dakar, Senegal, where he found work selling \u201clittle stuff.\u201d JA 127. After spending six to eight months in Dakar, he paid 500,000 francs to travel on a ship bound for the United States. After a four-month journey, he arrived in Miami, Florida on August 6,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Aw submitted two applications for asylum and withholding of removal\u2014one in 1991 and one in 1997. On September 30, 1991, he submitted a hand-written application that is at odds with his testimony before the IJ and the information contained in his 1997 application. On the 1991 application form, for example, Aw checked \u201cno\u201d in response to a question asking if he had ever been detained, interrogated, convicted and sentenced, or imprisoned in any country. JA 407. And he checked neither \u201cyes\u201d nor \u201cno\u201d in response to a question asking if he \u201cor any member of [his] immediate family\u201d had \u201cever been mistreated by the authorities,\u201d although he did check boxes marked \u201crace\u201d and \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d as possible reasons for mistreatment. <em>Id. </em>The 1991 application contains no mention of any mistreatment that he or his family suffered at the hands of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">On August 13, 1997, Aw submitted another application. The second application was inconsistent with the 1991 application and contains some inconsistencies with his testimony before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">After hearing Aw\u2019s testimony on July 30, 1998, the IJ denied Aw\u2019s application without explicitly ruling on Aw\u2019s credibility. Aw appealed, and the BIA remanded, asking the IJ to make a finding about Aw\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">On October 1, 2002, the same IJ reviewed the transcript from the earlier hearing and concluded that Aw\u2019s \u201ctestimony [was] not worthy of belief,\u201d IJ Op. at 11, and that the \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the record \u201ccast doubt upon [Aw\u2019s] entire testimony,\u201d making it \u201cvery difficult, if not impossible,\u201d to assess which aspects of the testimony were true and which were false, <em>id. </em>at 8. Noting that Aw had not produced any evidence corroborating his story, the IJ found Aw incredible and once again denied his application. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Invoking its streamlining procedures, the BIA affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must show that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b), which means he is \u201cunable or unwilling to return to ... [his] country because of persecution or a well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>founded fear of persecution on account of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An applicant\u2019s testimony, \u201cif credible, may be sufficient to sustain [his] burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding without issuing a separate opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion, <em>Denko v. INS, </em>351 F.3d 717, 726 (6th Cir.2003), to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence, <em>Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 700, 703 (6th Cir.2004). As a finding of fact, the IJ\u2019s credibility determination must be upheld unless any \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yu, </em>364 F.3d at 703. At the same time, an IJ\u2019s credibility finding \u201cmust be supported by specific reasons\u201d relating to \u201cissues that go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>388 F.3d 924, 926 (6th Cir.2004); <em>see also Daneshvar v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 615, 623 n. 7 (6th Cir.2004). \u201c[irrelevant inconsistencies.\u201d and discrepancies that \u201ccannot be viewed as attempts ... to enhance [the applicant\u2019s] claims of persecution [] have no bearing on [his] credibility.\u201d <em>Sylla, </em>388 F.3d at 926 (internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of a series of minor inconsistencies may \u201cgive[ ] support to the other grounds\u201d for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Yu, </em>364 F.3d at 703-04; <em>see also Abbo v. Gonzales, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 524, -, 2005 U.S.App. LEXIS 22805, at *12 (6th Cir.2005). \u201cLike affirmative inconsistencies, omissions may [also] form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, provided that they are substantially related to the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Liti v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 631, 637 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Aw argues that the IJ committed \u201ca harmful and material error\u201d by discrediting his testimony on the basis of \u201cminor and immaterial\u201d inconsistencies and that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Aw Br. at 8. Some of the inconsistencies and omissions identified by the IJ, it is true, do not involve \u201cissues that go to the heart of [Aw\u2019s] claim,\u201d <em>Sylla, </em>388 F.3d at 926, and thus do not support the adverse credibility finding. For example, Aw\u2019s initial application indicated that he left Mauritania in April 1986 yet he testified that he left the country in May 1986, IJ Op. at 8; his initial application indicated that he was a tailor yet he testified that he sold children\u2019s clothes and did not work on clothes, <em>id. </em>at 8-9; and he could not recall the name of the ship on which he spent four months at sea and claimed he was given a uniform from the ship\u2019s captain yet could not recall the captain\u2019s name, <em>id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">But other inconsistencies and omissions go to the heart of his claim and in the end support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Perhaps the most glaring inconsistency stems from the gap between Aw\u2019s 1991 application (stating that he had never been detained, interrogated, convicted, sentenced or imprisoned) and his 1997 application and testimony before the IJ (stating that he had been imprisoned for a week). Because the events surrounding Aw\u2019s alleged incarceration lie at the heart of his claim for asylum, the IJ justifiedly viewed the difference between the 1991 application on the one hand and the 1997 application and testimony before the IJ on the other as an improper attempt by Aw to \u201cenhance his claims of persecution.\u201d <em>Sylla, </em>388 F.3d at 926 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Compare, e.g., Koxha v. Gonzales, </em>166 Fed. Appx. 835, 837-38 (6th Cir.2006) (finding that inconsistencies between two applications and testimony before the IJ as well as omissions in application materials sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ported adverse credibility finding) <em>and Dosa v. Gonzales, </em>143 Fed.Appx. 674, 676-77 (6th Cir.2005) (finding that inconsistencies between application and testimony as well as omission of important detail supported adverse credibility finding) <em>with Abbo, </em>150 Fed.Appx. at - -, 2005 U.S.App. LEXIS 22805, at *19-23 (finding that inconsistency in applicant\u2019s testimony and omissions in his application did not amount to substantial evidence in support of an adverse credibility finding where the omissions and inconsistency were \u201cmore apparent than real and [were] [ ] technical and minor in nature\u201d) <em>and Nwakanma v. Gonzales, </em>126 Fed. Appx. 699, 701-02 (6th Cir.2005) (finding that inconsistencies and omissions in applicant\u2019s testimony were not substantial evidence in support of an adverse credibility finding because many of the labeled inconsistencies were not actually inconsistent and the omissions and remaining inconsistencies did not \u201cgo to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Also supporting the IJ\u2019s finding were inconsistencies between Aw\u2019s 1997 application and his testimony, as well as omissions in his 1991 application. Aw stated in his 1997 application, for instance, that when he traveled to Senegal to look for his family, he found them in a refugee camp in N\u2019dioum and that he \u201cstayed at N\u2019dioum for a few months.\u201d JA 288. Aw contradicted this version of events in his testimony (and in an affidavit filed on March 3, 1998) when he stated that his family had not been held in a refugee camp and that the refugee camps in N\u2019Dioum were not created until 1989. JA 276. Making matters worse, Aw\u2019s 1991 application omitted significant events featured in his 1997 application and testimony: his confrontation with the authorities at the family farm; his incarceration by the authorities; his family\u2019s forced exodus to Senegal; his father\u2019s death; and the rape of his sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Nor can Aw sidestep the consequences of these omissions and inconsistencies by blaming others who helped to prepare the documents. He blamed the inconsistencies between his 1997 application and his testimony on his lawyer, <em>see </em>JA 140 (explaining an inconsistency in his application by stating that \u201cmaybe the person who wrote the application put it\u201d in), and asserts that he paid someone to fill out his initial 1991 \u201capplication for him, and [that he] did not know the contents of\u2019 it, Aw Br. at 13. Aw does not contest, however, that he freely signed both applications and that his signature on each amounts to a declaration under penalty of perjury that the application is \u201ctrue and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief.\u201d JA 408; <em>see also Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>86 Fed.Appx. 827, ---, 2004 U.S.App. LEXIS 397, at *3-6 (6th Cir.2004) (stating that where asylum applicant\u2019s friend filled out his application and applicant \u201cdid not ask ... what was on the application\u201d but \u201cjust signed it,\u201d the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on the inconsistent application was appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">In the final analysis, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. And because Aw has \u201cfailed to establish eligibility for asylum, he [also] cannot satisfy the more stringent standards necessary\u201d to qualify \u201cfor withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Hassan v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 429, 435 (6th Cir.2005). Aw\u2019s request for withholding of removal necessarily must be rejected as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">Aw, lastly, argues that the BIA abused its discretion in invoking its streamlining procedures and affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. As he sees it, the BIA\u2019s \u201cuse of the affirmance without opinion procedure was not appropriate\u201d because the IJ \u201charmfully and materially erred in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>termining that [] Aw was not credible.\u201d Aw Br. at 8. The government responds that the courts of appeals do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s implementation of its own streamlining procedure. Resp. Br. at 22 n. 3. We need not resolve the government\u2019s jurisdictional defense, however, because no abuse of discretion occurred here. As we have said (and done) on many occasions before, <em>see, e.g., Hassan, </em>403 F.3d at 438; <em>Denko, </em>351 F.3d at 731-32; <em>Kacaj v. Gonzales, </em>132 Fed. Appx. 584, 589-90 (6th Cir.2005); <em>cf. Tapu-cu v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 736, 743 (6th Cir.2005); <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>117 Fed. Appx. 440, 442-43 (6th Cir.2004), we need not address this defense where \u201c \u2018the facts and legal issues\u2019 of the case fit Veil within the boundaries\u2019 of the [BIAj\u2019s summary-affirmance authority, and accordingly the [BIA] did not err in invoking the streamlining procedure,\u201d <em>Kacaj, </em>132 Fed.Appx. at 589-90 (quoting <em>Denko, </em>351 F.3d at 732); <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)\u00ae (permitting affirmance without opinion when \u201cthe result reached in the decision under review was correct\u201d and the \u201cissues on appeal are squarely controlled\u201d by settled precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">For these reasons, we deny the petition for review.
