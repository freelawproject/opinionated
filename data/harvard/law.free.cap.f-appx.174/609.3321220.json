We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a brief decision adopting the reasoning of the IJ, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In this case, the adverse credibility finding was based primarily on apparent deficiencies in Aleksi\u2019s documents, rather than in his testimony. The IJ relied on the forensic examiner\u2019s findings that the birth certificate could not be authenticated, the political party and employment ID cards contained copies of the birth certificate picture, and the work ID was \u201cprobably\u201d not what it purported to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Because of the suspicious nature of Aleksi\u2019s documents, the IJ also reasonably faulted Aleksi for failing to provide a corroborating statement from his father, when he did provide a considerably less probative statement from his uncle. The IJ\u2019s findings supporting the adverse credibility determination are therefore adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">This Court lacks jurisdiction to vacate the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum altogether because the IJ also based the denial on a discretionary determination, which Aleksi failed to challenge before the BIA. Under the strict exhaustion requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), a petitioner may not raise an issue or category of relief to this Court if he failed to raise before the BIA. <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 77-78 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Beharry v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 51, 62 (2d Cir.2003). Because Aleksi\u2019s arguments below were too generalized to alert the BIA that the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination was even an issue, this Court may not address that specific issue itself. <em>See Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005). Therefore, we affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal is this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
