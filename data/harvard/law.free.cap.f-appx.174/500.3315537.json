Jaime Moreno-Valencia, appeals his 135-month sentence for two drug charges. Asprilla contends that the district court erred by denying his request for a mitigating role reduction pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 (November 1, 2004). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI), on February 20, 2005, Asprilla and three other men were aboard a speed boat carrying cocaine in international waters when they were apprehended by the Coast Guard. Before being stopped, the boat fled from the Coast Guard at high speed while the crew threw bales of cocaine overboard. After disabling the vessel, the Coast Guard boarded. The vessel was determined to be without nationality and therefore it and its crew were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Asprilla and the other crew members were taken into custody. The Coast Guard subsequently recovered 118 bales of cocaine weighing approximately 2,674 kilograms from the ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">In a two-count indictment, a grand jury charged Asprilla with: (1) possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii); and (2) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii). On May 16, 2005, Asprilla entered a guilty plea as to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">Because the offense involved more than 150 kilograms of cocaine, the probation officer assigned Asprilla a base offense level of 38 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The probation officer applied a two-level \"safety valve\u201d reduction pursuant to \u00a7 5C-1.2, granted a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a), and granted a one-level reduction for assisting the authorities under \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). The probation officer made no adjustment for Asprilla\u2019s role in the offense pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2 and assigned a total offense level of 33. Because Asprilla had no criminal history points, he was given a criminal history category of I, resulting in a guideline range of 135 to 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">Asprilla objected to the PSI for failure to include a mitigating role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 and reiterated his objection at the sentencing hearing. The district court overruled Asprilla\u2019s objection and sentenced him to concurrent sentences of 135 months for each count. -</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">Asprilla argues that the district court clearly erred in faffing to grant him a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>downward adjustment for his role in the offense pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2. A district court may award a two\u2014 to four-level reduction to a defendant who played a \u201cmitigating role\u201d in the criminal offense charged. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A defendant who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group\u201d is a minimal participant eligible for a four-level reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. A defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal,\u201d is a minor participant eligible for a two-level reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. An intermediate reduction of three levels is also available. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">A defendant seeking a mitigating role reduction bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to the reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in a criminal offense \u201cis heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C). Accordingly, we review that determination \u201conly for clear error.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 937. As long as the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record, \u201ca district court is not required to make any specified findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>we established a two-part test for determining whether a mitigating role reduction is appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 940\u2014\u00cd5. The district court must first measure the defendant\u2019s role in the offense against the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 940. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [ ]he played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which []he has already been held accountable\u2014not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2014should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. \u201c[I]n many cases this method of analysis will be dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The court then may compare the defendant\u2019s culpability to that of other participants in the offense. <em>Id. </em>However, the court should use other participants as comparators \u201conly to the extent that they are identifiable or discernable from the evidence\u201d and, then, \u201conly those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Asprilla contends that he should have been granted a mitigating role reduction for six reasons: (1) he had no financial interest in the cocaine found aboard the speed boat; (2) he did not plan or organize the criminal enterprise; (3) he did not know the scope or structure of the offense; (4) his role was only that of a crew member\u2014he had no decisionmaking authority; (5) he had no control over the drugs and did not stand to benefit from the profits from their sale; and (6) he did not possess a firearm during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">Those bald assertions are unavailing. Asprilla had the burden of offering evidence from which the court could conclude either that his actual conduct was different than the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable or that he was less culpable than other crew members on the boat. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939, 940-45. He did not do so. In fact, Asprilla, through counsel, did not object to the factual accuracy of the PSI; therefore, he is deemed to have admitted the facts contained in it. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). No evidence in the PSI supports Asprilla\u2019s contention that he played only a mitigating role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Even if we could consider the information which, according to Asprilla, warrants a mitigating role reduction, we would not find clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a reduction based on the facts contained in the PSI. Asprilla was one of only four men aboard a speed boat carrying a substantial amount of cocaine. He participated in dumping cocaine overboard while the boat fled from the Coast Guard. These facts are ample to support our conclusion under the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis that Asprilla did not have a minor or minimal role in the offenses with which he was charged. This is so regardless of whether he was not the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the conspiracy, had no financial interest in or control over the drugs, and did not possess a firearm. Moreover, the facts of the PSI to which Asprilla admitted indicate that he was no less culpable than the rest of the crew. Instead, the facts show that he was of average culpability, and that is insufficient to support a finding that he was a minor or minimal participant under the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we find that the district court did not clearly err in denying Asprilla a mitigating role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence of Asprilla.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
