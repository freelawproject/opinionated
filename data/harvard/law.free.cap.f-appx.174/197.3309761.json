Zuniga argues that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The erroneous application of the Guidelines as mandatory is technically a \u201cFanfan error.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); see <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. The Government concedes that Zuniga preserved his Fanfan claim for appeal. The Government falls short of meeting its burden of proving that the district court\u2019s sentence under Guidelines it deemed mandatory was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the Government fails to cite to any record evidence showing that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 171 (5th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>error). We therefore vacate the sentence and remand the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Zuniga also argues that the enhancement provisions set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
