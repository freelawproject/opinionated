Arroyo-Santiago appeals, arguing that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice and denying his request for a sentence reduction for minor or minimal participation in the offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-31\">At trial evidence was presented that Arroyo-Santiago was involved in two controlled methamphetamine purchases ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ranged by undercover officers. Arroyo-Santiago testified that he was \u201cnot involved\u201d, that he was not in \u201cthat type of business\u201d, and that \u201call [the witnesses] have said is not true.\u201d The jury convicted Arroyo-Santiago of violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(B)(vm), 846, and 860(a). At the sentencing hearing on May 27, 2005, the court added a two level enhancement for obstruction of justice based on his false testimony at trial and declined to reduce his sentence based on mitigating role and sentenced Arroyo-Santiago at the low end of the guideline range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Arroyo-Santiago argues that perjury is a separate crime that should have been proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), it is clear that sentencing facts do not need to be found by a jury because judicial factfinding in an advisory guideline regime does not implicate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. Consequently, a district court may make findings to support an enhancement provided that it does so with the \u201cunderstanding that the guidelines are to be applied in advisory fashion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Morell, </em>429 F.3d 1161, 1164 (8th Cir.2005). The district court acknowledged that the guidelines are advisory and explicitly found that Arroyo-Santiago committed perjury at trial, and its finding is supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Denton, </em>434 F.3d 1104, 1114 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Arroyo-Santiago further asserts that the court erred in denying him a mitigating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A defendant is entitled to such a reduction only if he played a minimal or at most minor role. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Since there was evidence that Arroyo-Santiago was an active player in both drug transactions and was deeply involved in the conspiracy, the district court did not err by not granting a mitigating role reduction. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>145 F.3d 959, 963 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\">.
