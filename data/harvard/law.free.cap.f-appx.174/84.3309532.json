We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">As we write essentially for the parties, we need not describe the facts of this case in detail. Briefly, after a non-jury trial in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, Cox was convicted of first degree murder, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. The offenses were related to Cox\u2019s fatal shooting of Lawrence Davis. Cox has never denied shooting Davis, but he has always contended that he did not have the intent to kill and therefore was not guilty of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">After Cox\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, Cox sought relief in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas pursuant to the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d). The trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on Cox\u2019s claim that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to impeach two of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses\u2014Kimberly and Mary Little\u2014 with their criminal records and motives to lie.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Trial counsel conceded that he made no effort to investigate the witnesses\u2019 criminal records and that he had no reasonable basis for failing to do so. The judge found that trial counsel\u2019s performance had been deficient, but she concluded that Cox did not suffer prejudice and, as a result, dismissed Cox\u2019s PCRA petition. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied allo-catur.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">On October 12, 2000, Cox filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The District Court referred the matter to a Magistrate Judge, who issued a Report and Recommendation in which he found that all but one of Cox\u2019s claims had been procedurally defaulted. The Magistrate Judge addressed the remaining claim\u2014that Cox\u2019s trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to impeach Kimberly and Mary Little\u2014on the merits and concluded that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s opinion rejecting that claim was neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201ccontrary to\u201d nor an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The District Court issued an order adopting the Report and Recommendation and denying Cox\u2019s application for habeas relief. In a separate order issued the same day, the District Court granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability as to whether the state court\u2019s resolution of Cox\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach Kimberly Little with evidence of her criminal record was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law, and whether Cox had established cause and prejudice to overcome the procedural default of his remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. As to the issues on which the District Court granted a certificate of appealability, this Court exercises plenary review because the District Court relied exclusively on the state court record and did not hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Jacobs v. Horn, </em>395 F.3d 92, 99 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">A federal court may grant relief to a habeas applicant \u201cwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d only if the state\u2019s adjudication of the claim was either \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or it \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court precedent under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) where the state court reached a \u201cconclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) if the court \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal rule from the Supreme Court\u2019s cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.\u201d Ga<em>ttis v. Snyder, </em>278 F.3d 222, 228 (3d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">A. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Because Cox claims that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated, habeas relief is available if the state court\u2019s rejection of his claim is either \u201ccontrary to\u201d or involved an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 the familiar two-pronged test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Cox first argues that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision rejecting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Strickland </em>because the Superior Court applied an outcome-determinative test for determining prejudice rather than Strickland\u2019s \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard. Specifically, at the outset of its analysis, the Superior Court stated that in order to establish prejudice, a PCRA petitioner must show that \u201cbut for the act or omission [of trial counsel] the outcome of the case would have been different.\u201d (JA 20.) According to Cox, this prejudice standard is an erroneous \u201cpreponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the evidence\u201d standard, and thus is \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Although the Superior Court initially articulated a standard for reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims that neither cited <em>Strickland </em>nor described its prejudice standard with complete accuracy, the key question here is whether the Superior Court rejected Cox\u2019s claim based on reasoning that was consistent with <em>Strickland. See Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002) <em>(per </em>curiam) (explaining that qualification for deference under AEDPA \u201cdoes not require citation of our cases\u2014indeed, it does not even require awareness of our cases, so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them\u201d); <em>Priester v. Vaughn, </em>382 F.3d 394, 398 (3d Cir.2004) (observing that \u201cas long as the reasoning of the state court does not contradict relevant Supreme Court precedent, AEDPA\u2019s general rule of deference applies\u201d). After the Superior Court enunciated the prejudice standard and reviewed evidence from Cox\u2019s trial that was unaffected by counsel\u2019s error, the Superior Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">As such, we cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s omission <em>rendered the verdict unreliable, </em>because the witness\u2019 testimony was not critical to the prosecution\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">(JA 21 (emphasis added).) This language mirrors the <em>Strickland </em>Court\u2019s explanation that to satisfy the prejudice prong</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7\">the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, <em>a trial whose result is reliable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added). Thus, despite the Superior Court\u2019s enunciation of an ineffective assistance of counsel standard that, on its face, appears to require a higher showing of prejudice, its rejection of Cox\u2019s claim is not \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Strickland </em>for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Cox next argues that the Superior Court\u2019s rejection of his ineffective assistance claim was \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Strickland </em>because the Superior Court did not properly assess the effect of trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach Kimberly Little on the guilty verdict. In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court described how courts should assess prejudice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">In making [the prejudice] determination, a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury. Some of the factual findings will have been unaffected by the errors, and factual findings that were affected will have been affected in different ways. Some errors will have had a pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, altering the entire evidentiary picture, and some will have had an isolated, trivial effect. Moreover, a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support. Taking the unaffected findings as a given, and taking due account of the effect of the errors on the remaining findings, a court making the prejudice inquiry must ask if the defendant has met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-11\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694-95, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">In finding that prejudice did not exist, the Superior Court reviewed the evidence unaffected by counsel\u2019s error and stated: \u201cBecause there is additional evidence to sustain a conviction for first degree murder without taking into account the testimony of the witness in question, Cox has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>failed to show that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach that witness.\u201d (JA 21-22.) The Superior Court further noted that Kimberly Little\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot critical to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d (JA 21.) Based on these statements, we cannot conclude that the Superior Court\u2019s assessment of prejudice is \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We also agree with the District Court that the Superior Court\u2019s rejection of Cox\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 <em>Strickland. </em>According to Cox, the Superior Court disregarded the importance of Kimberly Little\u2019s testimony to the prosecution\u2019s case and gave too much weight to other, wholly circumstantial, evidence presented at trial. However, even without Kimberly Little\u2019s testimony, the verdict was supported by circumstantial evidence. For example, Cox admitted to police that he shot the victim from a distance of two feet, and the victim sustained three gun shot wounds to vital parts of the body, specifically the neck and chest. In addition, the ballistics expert explained that the likelihood of an accidental shooting was diminished by the number of shots fired. It is true that the ballistics expert testified that he could not exclude the possibility of an accidental shooting without examining the weapon; nonetheless, the expert\u2019s testimony about the likelihood of an accidental shooting weighs against Cox\u2019s claim that he shot the victim accidentally. Accordingly, the District Court properly rejected Cox\u2019s \u201cunreasonable application\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">B. <em>Procedurally Defaulted Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALz\">Finally, Cox argues that the District Court erred in finding that his remaining seven claims for habeas relief were procedurally defaulted because Cox did not \u201cfairly present\u201d them to the state court. \u201cTo \u2018fairly present\u2019 a claim, a petitioner must present a federal claim\u2019s factual and legal substance to the state courts in a manner that puts them on notice that a federal claim is being asserted.\u201d <em>McCandless v. Vaughn, </em>172 F.3d 255, 261 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Anderson v. Harless, </em>459 U.S. 4, 6, 103 S.Ct. 276, 74 L.Ed.2d 3 (1982); <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 277-78, 92 S.Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Cox first argues that he \u201cfairly presented\u201d claims III and IV<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of his federal habeas application to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in his <em>pro se </em>Petition for Allowance of Appeal. The District Court properly rejected this argument. <em>See Castille v. Peoples, </em>489 U.S. 346, 351, 109 S.Ct. 1056, 103 L.Ed.2d 380 (1989) (holding that a Pennsylvania habeas petitioner who submitted a new claim in a petition for discretionary review on direct appeal did not fairly present the claim to the state court for purposes of exhaustion).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Cox further contends that claims III and IV are exhausted because he attempted to raise them in his first PCRA proceeding and again in the second, time-barred PCRA petition. To be sure, these claims were included in the amended petition that his counsel filed during the first PCRA proceeding. However, Cox\u2019s counsel\u2014appointed pursuant to Cox\u2019s request\u2014chose to abandon these issues and proceed only on trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to impeach Kimberly Little with her criminal history. Likewise, in Cox\u2019s appeal from the denial of PCRA relief, he pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>sented no argument in support of the claims which he had abandoned before the PCRA court. Accordingly, Cox failed to \u201cfairly present\u201d claims III and IV to the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Finally, Cox argues that even if claims III and IV are procedurally defaulted, the District Court should have addressed their merits because he can establish \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d to overcome any default. To show \u201ccause,\u201d a petitioner must \u201cshow that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). Cox argues that if any procedural default occurred, it arose because the state courts did not follow their own procedures as set forth in <em>Commonwealth v. Ellis, </em>398 Pa.Super. 538, 581 A.2d 595 (1980), with respect to his <em>pro se </em>petition for allowance of appeal and his <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition. However, Cox cannot show \u201ccause\u201d because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was not bound by the procedure outlined by the Superior Court in <em>Ellis. </em>Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s-conclusion that the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to remand to the trial court to determine whether Cox wanted to proceed <em>pro se </em>or with counsel does not establish \u201ccause\u201d to overcome a procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We have considered all of the arguments advanced by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-13\">. At the time they gave their initial statements to the police, both Kimberly and Mary Little faced pending felony and misdemeanor charges of robbeiy, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, theft, receiving stolen property, and criminal conspiracy. These charges stemmed from an incident that occurred one month prior to the shooting they claimed to have witnessed. By the time they testified at Cox\u2019s trial, both Kimberly and Mary Little had been convicted of the lesser offenses of simple assault, reckless endangerment of another person, and conspiracy, and they each received a sentence of two years\u2019 probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. In claim III, Cox asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Kimberly and Mary Little with evidence that they were related to the victim. In claim IV, Cox asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Kimberly Little with an allegedly prior inconsistent statement regarding her location at the time of the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
