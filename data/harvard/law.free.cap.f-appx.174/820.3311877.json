He raises three issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">First, he argues that robbery as defined in California Penal Code \u00a7 211 (\u00a7 211 robbery) is not a crime of violence as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) because it is broader than \u201cthe generic contemporary meaning\u201d of robbery, since it can be committed by inducing the fear that property will be damaged. He also asserts that \u00a7 211 robbery is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) because it does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">This court need not resolve whether \u00a7 211 robbery is a crime of violence because the amended information establishes that Estrada-Borjas\u2019 conviction for first-degree robbery under California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5, and 12022(a)(1) qualifies as an enumerated offense because its elements required proof that (1) EstradaBorjas robbed \u201can inhabited dwelling house ... or the inhabited portion of any other building,\u201d \u00a7 212.5; and (2) he or an accomplice was armed with a firearm during the first-degree robbery. \u00a7 12022(a)(1). Estrada-Borjas\u2019 conviction for first-degree robbery under \u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5, and 12022(a)(1) qualifies as the enumerated offense of robbery \u201cas that term is understood in its ordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005) (brackets in original; internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>accord Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Moreover, Estrada-Borjas\u2019 first-degree robbery conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5, and 12022(a)(1) had as an element, at least, the threatened use of physical force against the person of another. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)); <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 257 (5th Cir.2004). Thus, EstradaBorjas\u2019 prior first-degree robbery conviction was a \u201ccrime of -violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-19\">Second, Estrada-Borjas argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Estrada-Borjas\u2019 constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Estrada-Borjas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almenda-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>rez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Estrada-Borjas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Finally, Estrada-Borjas argues for the first time on appeal that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a condition of supervised release that requires him to cooperate in the collection of his DNA. This claim is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1100-01 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim, and this portion of the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">CONVICTION AND JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
