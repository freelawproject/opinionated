Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the decision of the IJ and supplements that decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. Dre-ni\u2019s testimony was inconsistent, in that, among other reasons cited by the IJ: (1) Dreni testified that he had participated in a 1991 demonstration, which resulted in the government building being set afire, and that he had a validly issued Albanian passport, but had failed to mention both facts in his asylum application; and (2) the political party dues booklet that Dreni entered as evidence and purportedly often carried on his person did not comport with his testimony regarding the party\u2019s method for collecting dues. The IJ\u2019s finding that Dreni did not provide corroborating documentation or witnesses further undermined Dreni\u2019s credibility. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d. Cir.2000). These inconsistencies, and the lack of corroboration, provide substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and, therefore, the remaining grounds for the adverse credibility determination need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Because Dreni failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). In addition, as argued by the government, Dreni has waived the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief, because he failed to exhaust that issue before the BIA. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 77-78 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
