KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b462-24\">Defendant-Appellant Alejandro Salome-Gonzales appeals from the district court\u2019s imposition of his sentence. He argues on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him in accordance with an approach that the district court developed the day after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and refined a few weeks later. Under this approach, the district court gives \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Guidelines, and will impose a guideline sentence in all but \u201cunusual cases for clearly identified and persuasive reasons.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>350 F.Supp.2d 910, 911-12 (D.Utah 2005); <em>see also United States v. Wilson, </em>355 F.Supp.2d 1269, 1272 (D.Utah 2005) (on motion for reconsideration). Mr. Salome-Gonzalez argues that the district court imposed too high a standard in refusing to give him a non-guidelines sentence. Specifically, he argues the court should have sentenced him outside the guidelines range based upon strong family support, economic hardship, and lack of criminal history. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The parties are familiar with the facts leading up to Mr. Salome-Gonzales\u2019s guilty plea and we need not repeat them here. Mr. Salome-Gonzales pled guilty to possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The probation office prepared a pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Initially, the PSR calculated a guidelines range of 135-168 months imprisonment. Mr. Salome-Gonzales objected to the PSR and argued several grounds for a lower sentence, including his limited role as a courier, his lack of criminal history, his personal and family characteristics including four young children and a supportive family, his stable employment history, and that a lower sentence would fulfill societal and governmental interests. I R. Doc. 24 at 4-6. He also argued for a downward adjustment based upon his limited role in the offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a)-(b), and for a safety valve reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. In response to these objections, the probation office amended the PSR, concluding that Mr. Salome-Gonzales was a minor participant in the offense and that he qualified for the safety valve reduction. Based on this amended PSR, Mr. Salome-Gonzales\u2019s guidelines range was 70-87 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The district court conducted a sentencing hearing. At that hearing, Mr. Salome-Gonzales indicated he had no objection to the amended PSR. II R. at 4. The district court informed the parties that it would follow the approach discussed above. Mr. Salome-Gonzales\u2019s counsel argued that even under the court\u2019s approach, this was an unusual case and that the elements in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) would justify a lower sentence. The district court announced that it would not vary from the guidelines and sentenced Mr. Salome-Gonzales, at the lower end of the guidelines range, to 70 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Subsequent to sentencing, we decided <em>United States v. Kristi, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006), holding that a sentence properly calculated under the sentencing guidelines is entitled to a rebutta-ble presumption of reasonableness \u201cthat either the defendant or the government may rebut by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when viewed against the other factors delineated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d This is not a conclusive presumption; were it so the advisory guidelines would become mandatory contrary to <em>Booker. Kristi, </em>437 F.3d at 1054. Though concerned with our appellate standard of review, we think that such an approach informs what role the guidelines have in a district court\u2019s sentencing procedure. Rather than comment on the frequency with which properly-calculated guideline sentences will be appropriate, the paramount inquiry is whether the sentence imposed is reasonable or unreasonable when considered against the record developed in relation to the factors contained in \u00a7 3553(a). Plainly, the district court must consider the guidelines sentence, but it also must consider the parties\u2019 presentations on the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>propriate sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The district court recognized that the guidelines are advisory, and stated that \u201cthe defendant has already gotten considerable benefit from the way things have played out in this case, and in light of that I think that a 70-month sentence is appropriate, having considered all the arguments.\u201d II R. at 8. We do not require a recitation by a district judge on each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and though the district court perhaps could have justified a lower sentence based upon the nature and circumstances of Mr. Salome-Gonzales\u2019s personal history and characteristics, it was not required to do so. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>441 F.3d 1152, 1161 (10th Cir.2006). Having reached this conclusion in light of our now more developed precedent, we need not address the district court\u2019s comprehensive views on the Sentencing Guidelines contained in its published opinions. Sentencing must be an individual endeavor. Regardless of the district court\u2019s enthusiasm for the Sentencing Guidelines, sound reasons were apparent for the sentence imposed, including the need to avoid sentencing disparities and the seriousness of the crime as reflected in the quantity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), (6); <em>United States v. Galarza-Payan, </em>441 F.3d 885 (10th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we find that any error in the process was harmless because it did not affect the selection of the sentence imposed. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (remand appropriate only when error was not harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b462-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
