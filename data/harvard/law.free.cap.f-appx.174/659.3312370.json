He was sentenced to 81 months imprisonment. The question presented for review is whether it was plain error in light of no objection for the court not to adjust the appellant\u2019s offense level downward for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Defense counsel gives a plausible interpretation of why he did not press the acceptance responsibility issues. The government\u2019s response is conciliatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">By letter dated November 18, 2004, the court advised the parties that the Appellant would only be held responsible for 21 ounces of cocaine as opposed to the fifteen but less than fifty kilograms of cocaine found by the Probation Department. (A-065). This resulted in a guideline imprisonment range of 70-87 months as opposed to 240 months; in other words, more than a 60% reduction in his possible imprisonment range based upon the district court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Blakely </em>should apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Indeed, as Appellant\u2019s counsel noted at sentencing, the Appellant was \u201cthe beneficiary of an enormous break just be [sic] a felicitous convergence of circumstances.\u201d (A-068). Counsel went on then to explain why he believed the court should depart from the applicable guideline range based upon the United States\u2019 Motion for Departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (A-068-069). It is presumably in light of this windfall that Appellant made no objection at sentencing to the Pre-sentence Investigation Report\u2019s conclusion that he was not entitled to acceptance of responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">This might well in and of itself be grounds for remand. However, at all events, there is a <em>Booker </em>problem. See the companion cases of <em>USA v. Kemp, </em>No. 05-1224, - Fed.Appx. -, 2006 WL 623057 (3d Cir. Submitted March 9, 2006)(non precedential), and <em>USA v. Abbott, </em>No. 05-1140, \u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2006 WL 623099 (3d Cir. Submitted March 9, 2006) (non precedential). In <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162 (3d Cir.2005) (en) (banc), an opinion relating to the denial of a government petition for rehearing en banc consideration of a <em>Booker </em>claim on plain error review, this Court stated that except in limited circumstances we will presume prejudice and direct a remand for re-sentencing where the district court imposed a sentence in the belief that the applicable Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory. That was the situation here, and we perceive no circumstance in this case which warrants a different result from that found in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">We will therefore vacate the judgment and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
