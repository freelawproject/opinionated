Nicholson, </em>No. 04-1448, 2005 WL 1076783 (Vet.App. April 14, 2005) <em>(Order). </em>Because the Veterans Court did not err in treating Ms. Winsett\u2019s petition as one for a writ of mandamus, and because the Veterans Court did not abuse its discretion in denying her petition, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b591-25\">Ms. Winsett has been a plaintiff in a number of appeals to this court concerning: the service connection for the death of Mr. Gary Jacks; the denial of Ms. Win-sett\u2019s status as a surviving spouse of Mr. Jacks; and the entitlement to accrued benefits of Mr. Jacks\u2019 two adult children. <em>See In re Winsett, </em>90 Fed.Appx. 398 (Fed.Cir.2004); <em>Winsett v. Principi, </em>341 F.3d 1329 (Fed.Cir.2003); <em>Winsett v. Principi, </em>65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Fed.Appx. 301 (Fed.Cir.2003); and <em>Winsett v. West, </em>217 F.3d 854 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In 2003, Ms. Winsett appealed three decisions of the Board of Veterans Appeals (the Board) to the Veterans Court, which were subsequently remanded to the Board. <em>Winsett v. Principi, </em>18 Vet.App. 419 (2003) <em>(Remand Decision). </em>On May 18, 2004, the Board remanded the matter to a Regional Office (RO). On July 30, 2004, after a hearing, the RO issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) and sent a copy to Ms. Winsett. With that copy, the RO included a cover letter advising Ms. Winsett that her records would be returned to the Board for further adjudication if the RO did not receive any additional information from her within sixty days. <em>See Order, </em>slip op. at 1. On August 16, 2004, Ms. Winsett filed an informal petition, styled \u201cPetition for Rule Nisi,\u201d with the Veterans Court. Ms. Winsett also filed a number of \u201cinformal correspondence\u201d documents and motions with the Veterans Court between September 2004 and March 2005. <em>See id. </em>The Veterans Court construed Ms. Winsett\u2019s \u201cPetition for Rule Nisi\u201d as a motion for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of mandamus, which alleged that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs had failed to comply with the Veterans Court\u2019s <em>Remand Decision. Order, </em>slip op. at 1. The Veterans Court denied the petition, concluding that Ms. Winsett had not proved that she was entitled to such a writ or that alternative remedies were unavailable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Although this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions by the Veterans Court is limited by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, review of decisions under the All Writs Acts, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) is not so limited. <em>Lamb v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (Fed.Cir.2002). This court reviews the denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus by the Veterans Court for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The Veterans Court was correct to construe Ms. Winsett\u2019s informal petition as a motion for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of mandamus. Ms. Win-sett has not directed this court to any legal basis for her petition that would make her request for relief distinct from a petition for a writ of mandamus. Moreover, rules nisi are not a creature of federal law. <em>See </em>5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1195 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201c[Rjules nisi are not provided for in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">To obtain mandamus, petitioner must demonstrate that she \u201chas a \u2018clear and indisputable right to the writ\u2019 \u201d and that she \u201chas no alternative way to obtain the relief sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lamb, </em>284 F.3d at 1382 (quoting <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)). In addition, the issuance of a writ of mandamus is \u201cin large part a matter of discretion with the court to which the petition is addressed.\u201d <em>Kerr, </em>426 U.S. at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119 (citing <em>Schlagenhauf v. Holder, </em>379 U.S. 104, 112 n. 8, 85 S.Ct. 234, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964); <em>Parr v. United States, </em>351 U.S. 513, 520, 76 S.Ct. 912, 100 L.Ed. 1377 (1956)). Although Ms. Winsett devotes a substantial portion of her brief to restating and rearguing factual issues with respect to her claims, this court agrees with the Veterans Court that Ms. Winsett has failed to explain why she cannot address the issues in her petition with the Board. Ms. Winsett filed her petition with the Veterans Court only seventeen days after the RO issued its SSOC, well within the sixty days provided to Ms. Winsett to provide additional information to the RO before her case would be returned to the Board for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>adjudication. Moreover, the RO issued the SSOC less than one year after the remand of the case by the Veterans Court to the Board. Although Ms. Winsett is frustrated with the duration of this process, her frustration does not entitle her to a writ of mandamus. \u201cThe extraordinary writs cannot be used as substitutes for appeals, even though hardship may result from delay and perhaps unnecessary trial____\u201d <em>Lamb, </em>284 F.3d at 1384 (quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 383, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953)). In her brief to this court, Ms. Winsett relies on <em>Stegall v. West, </em>11 Vet. App. 268 (1998), for a number of propositions, including that the Veterans Court can be petitioned to direct the Secretary to comply with a remand order. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. While not commenting on <em>Ste-gall </em>itself, this court notes that <em>Stegall </em>concerned an appeal to the Veterans Court of a decision by the Board, which the Veterans Court then vacated. <em>Stegall, </em>11 Vet.App. at 269. Rather than raising these issues with the Board like the appellant in <em>Stegall, </em>Ms. Winsett is attempting to circumvent the standard administrative appellate process through her petition to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Because Ms. Winsett has not demonstrated a clear and indisputable right to such relief or that alternative avenues of relief were unavailable, the Veterans Court was well within its discretion in concluding that Ms. Winsett is not entitled to a writ of mandamus, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
