The Garcias engaged in a drug conspiracy to transport cocaine and marijuana from the Texas/Mexico border to southwest Florida, where they organized its distribution. Miguel and Ernesto organized the distribution of the cocaine and marijuana to their brother Jesus. Jesus acted as the wholesale distributor in the Fort Myers, Florida area, delivering drugs, picking up payments for prior deliveries and conducting counter-surveillance. All three brothers pled guilty. On February 10, 2005, the district court sentenced the Garcias under an advisory guidelines system. The district court sentenced Jesus Garcia to a 262-month sentence and Ernesto and Miguel Garcia to 328-month sentences. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">A. Extra-verdict Enhancements</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">On appeal, the Garcias argue that the district court violated their Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), when it enhanced their sentences based on facts that were neither admitted by them nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have repeatedly rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>In <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2005), we held that, when the district court applies the guidelines in an advisory manner, it does not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right under <em>Booker </em>by applying extra-verdict enhancements. <em>Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1323-24; <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.) (explaining that <em>Booker </em>error \u201cis not that there were extra-verdict enhancements\u2014enhancements based on facts found by the judge that were not admitted by the defendant or establish by the jury verdict\u2014that led to an increase in the defendant\u2019s sentence. The error is that there were extra-verdict enhancements used in a mandatory guidelines system\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The sentencing proceedings in this case began three weeks after <em>Booker </em>was decided. Throughout the hearings, the district court recognized that the Guidelines were no longer mandatory, but advisory. Accordingly, because the Guidelines were applied in an advisory fashion, the district court\u2019s use of extra-verdict enhancements did not constitute <em>Booker </em>error. <em>See Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">B. <em>Booker </em>Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The Garcias also argue that their sentences are unreasonable under <em>Booker </em>because the record does not adequately reflect whether the district court analyzed and considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) prior to imposing their sentences. After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 258-63,125 S.Ct. at 764-66; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for unreasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the reasons given by the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">We reject the Garcias\u2019 arguments that their sentences were unreasonable. First, with the exception of Miguel Garcia\u2019s safety-valve argument discussed below, the Garcias do not argue on appeal that the district court failed to calculate their guidelines ranges correctly. Instead, they assert only that the district court erred in enhancing their sentences based on extra-verdict factors. Second, the court-imposed sentences were within the correctly calculated guidelines ranges and below the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Third, the district court stated that it had considered all the statutory factors in crafting the sentences, which was sufficient to satisfy its obligations under <em>Booker. See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (explaining that \u201cacknowledgment by the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker\u201d). </em>In addition, the district court\u2019s comments reflect consideration of several \u00a7 3553(a) factors apart from the advisory guidelines ranges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the district court did not explicitly discuss each statutory factor, it was not required to do so. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. We find nothing on this record that convinces us that the Garcias\u2019 sentences were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">C. Miguel Garcia\u2019s Safety-valve Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Miguel Garcia also argues on appeal that the district court erred by not allowing him to debrief with the government in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, thereby wrongfully denying him a safety-valve reduction. <em>\u201cPost-Booker, </em>we continue to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines just as we did <em>pre-Booker </em>.... \u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005). When reviewing the denial of safety-valve relief, we review a district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error and the court\u2019s legal interpretation of statutes and the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004). Here, we find no error because, regardless of whether Miguel Garcia was given an opportunity to provide information to the government, he was ineligible for safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">To be eligible for safety-valve relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, among other things, the defendant must not have possessed a firearm in connection with the offense or have been a leader or organizer of others in the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(2), (4); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2), (4). The district court found that Garcia possessed a firearm during the offense and that he was an organizer or leader of the conspiracy. Garcia has not challenged these findings on appeal except to argue that these extra-verdict findings violate <em>Booker. </em>As we have already discussed, this <em>Booker </em>argument is without merit. Because Garcia was ineligible for safety-valve relief based on the district court\u2019s firearm possession and role-in-the-offense findings, Garcia\u2019s argument concerning his opportunity to debrief is immaterial. The district court properly denied Miguel Garcia\u2019s request for safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">For all these reasons, we affirm the Garcias\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-13\">. Specifically, the Garcias object to the following findings by the district court: (1) that their offenses involved between 50 kilograms and 150 kilograms of cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 36 for each defendant pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2); (2) that the defendants possessed firearms, resulting in a two-level increase in each defendant's offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1); and (3) that Miguel and Ernesto Garcia were leaders or organizers in the criminal activity involving five or more participants, resulting in a four-level increase in their offense levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Because the Garcias preserved their objections to the enhancements below, we review their sentences <em>de novo, </em>and will reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">. We reject the government\u2019s argument that this Court lacks subjectmatter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) to review for unreasonableness a sentence within the guidelines range. See <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1321-22 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">. The district court calculated Jesus Garcia\u2019s guidelines range to be 262 to 327 months' imprisonment and sentenced him to 262 months. The district court calculated Ernesto Garcia\u2019s guidelines range to be 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment and imposed a 328-month sentence. The district court calculated Miguel Garcia\u2019s guidelines range to be 292 to 365 months and sentenced him to 328 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">. In imposing Ernesto Garcia's sentence, the district court stated it had chosen his sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range \"based on the defendant\u2019s legal status in the United States, and the fact that his criminal history, while it exists, consists of driving offenses, and he has no prior felony convictions.\" With regard to Miguel Garcia\u2019s sentence, the district court explained that it had imposed a sentence at the middle of the guidelines range \"because [of] the defendant's participation in the conspiracy, the length of the conspiracy, and his activities with regard to the fraudulent identification while in the United States....\u201d Finally, with regard to Jesus Garcia\u2019s sentence, the district court declined to sentence below the advisory guidelines range because Jesus Garcia had \"so many felony convictions\u201d and had been \"using a false name.\u201d The district court also explained that, while his role in the offense was less than his brothers\u2019, it was not a minor role and that \"[h]e was in this thing for a long time, and he and his brothers were responsible for, as I found, a significant amount of cocaine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
