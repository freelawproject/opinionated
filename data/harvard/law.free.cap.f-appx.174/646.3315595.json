We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">This Court reviews the IJ (Sandy K. Horn) decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d. Cir.2005)(citing) <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2004). The record indicates that Chen\u2019s prior counsel, Jaime Castiblanco, Esq., was misled into believing that Chen\u2019s testimony from the previous hearing was not in dispute. It is clear from Castiblanco\u2019s statements that he anticipated a \u201cnew hearing,\u201d and that it was not until after the IJ indicated that the BIA had agreed with Chen\u2019s prior testimony that Castiblanco decided to submit only the additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The affidavit referred to by the Government in its brief before this Court is consistent with Chen\u2019s argument that his pri- or counsel relied on the assurances of the IJ. The affidavit, dated November 19, 2003, and not September 19, 2003 as the Government asserts, was submitted to the IJ <em>after </em>the hearing containing the exchange in question. In it, Castiblanco stated that he was submitting further documents on behalf of Chen, that he had reviewed the transcript of the proceedings, and did not \u201csee a need to take further testimony\u201d because Chen relied upon \u201cthe judgement (sic) of the Board as to not agreeing with the [IJ\u2019s findings] as to [Chen\u2019s] not having well founded fear of persecution.\u201d These circumstances support Chen\u2019s argument that the attorney relied on the assurance of the IJ and the IJ\u2019s subsequent adverse credibility finding was therefore rendered in error without a full development of the record below. We note that the IJ erroneously concluded that Chen had failed to submit an affidavit from his father. That affidavit had been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
