The district court dismissed the appeal because it was not filed by a licensed attorney. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauper-is and dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Terry v. Sparrow, </em>Nos. CA-04-743-1; BK-01-10059 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 31, 2005). Additionally, we deny Terry\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, for review under the Administrative Procedures Act of Appellee\u2019s informal brief, and to expedite oral argument. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
