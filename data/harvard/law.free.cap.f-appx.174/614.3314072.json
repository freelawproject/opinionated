We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history. Where, as here, the BIA issues a short decision modifying the IJ\u2019s holding in one respect, but otherwise affirming it, we review the judgement of the IJ as modified by the BIA. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Jiang was not credible. First, the IJ reasonably found that Jiang stated different dates in his application and his testimony concerning when his wife\u2019s IUD was inserted and removed. Second, the IJ accurately noted that Jiang initially stated that his wife hid at her mother\u2019s house before relocating to her sister\u2019s home, then testified that the mother and sister lived in the same home. Third, the IJ accurately noted that Jiang stated in his application that he was practicing Falun Gong with friends when the public security officials arrived at his home, but later testified that only his wife and children were present at the time. Fourth, the IJ reasonably found that Jiang\u2019s statements that he did not have a good memory failed to adequately explain the discrepancy. Finally, the IJ also reasonably found that Jiang testified inconsistently where he first testified that he practiced Falun Gong secretly, and then testified that he sometimes practiced publicly.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Individually, the discrepancies cited by the IJ might not be fatal if they were isolated, and his testimony was otherwise generally consistent, rational, and believable. <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). However, in the aggregate, the discrepancies in Jiang\u2019s statements provide substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Jiang\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to raise this category of relief before the BIA, and thus failed to exhaust it. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Accordingly, Chen\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED. Any pending request for oral arguments is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
