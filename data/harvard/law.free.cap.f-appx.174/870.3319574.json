The district court found that Cook had two prior state convictions for bank robbery and, therefore, was a Career Offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2003). Cook argues on appeal that he did not qualify for Career Offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because his two prior state bank robbery convictions were \u201crelated,\u201d having been functionally consolidated at his state sentencing. We conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Cook\u2019s prior convictions were not related and, therefore, did not err in sentencing Cook as a Career Offender. Therefore, we will AFFIRM Cook\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) provides that a defendant may be sentenced as a Career Offender if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-10\">(3) the defendant has at least <em>two prior felony convictions </em>of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(e) explains that the requirement of \u201ctwo prior felony convictions\u201d is satisfied if \u201cthe sentences for at least two of the aforementioned felony convictions are counted separately under the provisions of \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b), or (e).\u201d To discover what convictions count separately under \u00a7 4A1.1, however, one must turn to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), which states that \u201cprior sentences imposed in <em>related </em>cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b), and (c).\u201d (Emphasis added.) As a result, for \u201ctwo prior felony convictions\u201d to count separately under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), they cannot be <em>related </em>for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b), and (c). The Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 gives the meaning of the term \u201crelated\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-14\">Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (ie., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Otherwise, <em>prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that (A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">Cook argued before the district court, as he does now, that his two state convictions for bank robbery are \u201crelated\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) and, therefore, the concurrent sentences imposed for each robbery conviction should be \u201ctreated as one sentence\u201d for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Before the district court Cook argued that the two prior robberies were related because they \u201cwere part of a single common scheme or plan\u201d and the two cases \u201cwere consolidated for ... sentencing.\u201d Before this court, Cook has dropped the \u201ccommon scheme\u201d argument and claims only that the two sentences were functionally consolidated at the state sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-18\">In <em>United States v. Hazelwood, </em>we held that \u201cthe \u2018functional consolidation\u2019 of two sentences is an inherently fact-specific de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>termination and should be reviewed deferentially.\u201d 398 F.3d 792, 797 (6th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 66, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001)). A district court\u2019s fact determinations are binding on this court, unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 797-98. In <em>Hazelwood, </em>we upheld the district court\u2019s decision that there was no functional consolidation where concurrent sentences were \u201cseparatefand] individualized\u201d and the \u201cdocket numbers\u201d were also separate. <em>Id. </em>at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Likewise, in <em>United States v. Horn, </em>we held that \u201c \u2018cases are not consolidated when offenses proceed to sentencing under separate docket numbers, cases are not factually related, and there was no order of consolidation.\u2019 \u201d 355 F.3d 610, 614 (6th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. McAdams, </em>25 F.3d 370, 374 (6th Cir.1994)), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 1082, 124 S.Ct. 2436, 158 L.Ed.2d 998 (2004). In <em>Horn, </em>we also dismissed the argument that functional consolidation could be shown by such things as a joint trial date, a joint sentencing hearing, or concurrent sentences. <em>Id. </em>Our cases make clear that similar treatment of convictions is insufficient to sustain a finding of functional consolidation absent \u201csome explicit indication that the trial court intended to consolidate the prior convictions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">In support of his functional consolidation theory, Cook points out that he was sentenced for the prior robberies at a single sentencing hearing; that both offenses were discussed in a joint pretrial statement; a joint plea agreement for the robberies was entered at a joint hearing; and he was given concurrent sentences. In addition, he offers as evidence of functional consolidation both an affidavit by his former defense attorney stating that the two cases were functionally consolidated and the language printed on the form used to return him to jail after the sentencing hearing. On this foundation, Cook argues that the two state convictions were functionally consolidated for sentencing. The district court did not think they were and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">No published case in this circuit has held that two or more convictions were \u201crelated\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because they were functionally consolidated. Defendants have often argued the theory, but not successfully. Cook offers nothing to distinguish his argument from those that have failed in the past. He is content to point to facts that are the same or logically similar to those argued before us in <em>Hazelwood </em>and <em>Horn </em>without attempting to show any \u201cexplicit indication\u201d by the trial court that it \u201cintended to consolidate the prior convictions.\u201d Those evidentiary matters our court has not previously considered, such as the affidavit by Cook\u2019s attorney and the language printed on the form used to return Cook to jail, also give no indication of what the trial court intended. Finally, the sentencing transcript provides clear evidence the two robberies would not have been consolidated for trial. The state court made a point of informing Cook that, absent his plea, he would be entitled to \u201ctwo different trials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">We do not hold that there cannot be a case in which two or more prior convictions were functionally consolidated at sentencing, only that this is not such a case. The learned district court did not err in its conclusion that Cook\u2019s prior state convictions were not functionally consolidated and, therefore, were not related.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
