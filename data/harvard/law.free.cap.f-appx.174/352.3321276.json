Ashcroft, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>360 F.3d 915, 917-19 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review). Further, because Leon failed to meet the burden of proof on his asylum claim, his application for withholding of removal necessarily fails as well, <em>see Turay v. Ashcroft, </em>405 F.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir.2005) (withholding-of-removal standard is more rigorous than asylum standard), and we see no basis in the record for CAT relief, <em>see Habtemicael v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 774, 780-82 (8th Cir.2004) (discussing considerations relevant to relief under CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-26\"><em>. </em>The IJ\u2019s decision, therefore, constitutes the final agency determination for purposes of judicial review. <em>See Dominguez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 678, 679 n. 1 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
