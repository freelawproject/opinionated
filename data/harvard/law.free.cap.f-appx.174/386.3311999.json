We grant Soto-Ar-menta\u2019s petition for review because his California conviction is not an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">The court does not have jurisdiction to review \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed [an aggravated felony,]\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), but we have jurisdiction to determine whether the jurisdictional bar applies in a given case. <em>Murillo-Espinoza v. INS, </em>261 F.3d 771, 773 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-20\">Soto-Armenta\u2019s conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor more than three years younger in violation of Cal. Pen.Code \u00a7 261.5(c) does not qualify as an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) under the categorical approach laid out in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>See Valencia v. Gonzales, </em>439 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>F.3d 1046, 2006 WL 522452, at *6 (9th Cir. Mar.6, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Because Cal. Pen.Code \u00a7 261.5(c) reaches conduct that would not constitute a crime of violence and is therefore not categorically an aggravated felony, we therefore proceed to apply a \u201cmodified categorical approach, in which we look to the charging paper and judgment of conviction to determine if the actual offense the defendant was convicted of qualifies as a crime of violence. We do not, however, look to the particular facts underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted). \u201cThe purpose of this \u2018modified categorical approach is to determine if the record unequivocally establishes that the defendant was convicted of [a crime of violence], even if the statute defining the crime is overly inclusive.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Montanez, </em>421 F.3d 926, 931 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The original complaint charged Soto-Armenta with two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor more than three years younger and with one count of committing a lewd act upon a child. However, \u201c[e]harging papers alone are never sufficient\u201d for purposes of the modified categorical approach, but \u201cmay be considered in combination with a signed plea agreement.\u201d <em>Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1211. Soto-Armenta only pled guilty to one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor more than three years younger and admitted in his plea agreement that he \u201cengaged in sexual intercourse with a minor at least 3 years younger than [himself].\u201d When read together, the complaint and the plea agreement add nothing to our analysis beyond the terms of the statute itself. We therefore hold that Soto-Armenta\u2019s conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Because we conclude that petitioner did not commit an aggravated felony, we GRANT the PETITION and REMAND this case to the BIA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b411-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
