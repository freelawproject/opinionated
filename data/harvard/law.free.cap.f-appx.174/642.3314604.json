We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) decision without opinion, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, this Court does not review issues that were not exhausted before the BIA as it lacks the jurisdiction to do so. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that, whether the cause for failure to exhaust is an applicant\u2019s failure to file an appeal with the BIA or his failure to present the \u201cdiscrete issue\u201d later raised in a petition for review, this Court lacks jurisdiction over unex-hausted issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Here, although Thein and Fei seek to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, they recognize that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding that their asylum application was time-barred under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Further, although Thein and Fei generally challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding and CAT relief in their counseled brief to the BIA, at that stage, they did not challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination or point to any errors in the IJ\u2019s decision. Instead, they reiterated the same facts that the IJ found to be incredible, and sought to show how those facts qualified them for refugee status. Since Thein and Fei failed to exhaust their administrative remedy before the BIA regarding the issue of the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review such determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d); <em>Foster, </em>376 F.3d at 78 (\u201cTo preserve a claim, we require petitioner to raise <em>issues </em>to the BIA in order to preserve them for judicial review.\u201d) (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, all we have before us is incredible testimony to support Thein and Fei\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Such evidence does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in the petitions is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in the petitions is DENIED. Any pending request for oral arguments is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
