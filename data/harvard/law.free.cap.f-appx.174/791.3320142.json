See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b816-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Orlando Jones appeals the imposition of a 120-month term of incarceration following his plea of guilty to disqualified possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) (2000). Because we find that Jones\u2019 claims of sentencing error are without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Jones first asserts his convictions at ages nineteen and twenty for which he was placed in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, Youthful Offender Division, should be considered juvenile convictions and not used to compute his criminal history. We find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines in determining Jones\u2019 criminal history. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(d) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Jones next asserts the district court erred by enhancing his offense level two points for reckless endangerment during flight pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.2. We review the district court\u2019s determination of the facts for clear error; its decision that the adjustment applied based on those facts is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 345 (4th Cir.2002). The district court found that when Jones fled from a traffic stop he reached speeds of seventy-five miles per hour in a residential neighborhood on icy roads and ignored traffic signals in his flight. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, comment (n.2). We find the enhancement was properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">Moreover, we find that Jones\u2019 South Carolina conviction for burglary second degree (dwelling) is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of computing his base offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1. Burglary of a dwelling is a listed offense in the definition of a crime of violence, USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 -2K2.1, comment (n.5). We reject Jones\u2019 contention that whether the South Carolina burglary offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of determining his base offense level is controlled by South Carolina\u2019s characterization of the offense as non-violent. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 590, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (noting that elements of state offenses are determinative regardless of technical definitions and labels under state law); <em>see also United States v. Sacko, </em>247 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that \u201cbecause a state\u2019s classification of a crime generally reflects different policy considerations than the federal classification, it is simply not relevant to the determination of whether a crime is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 \u201d under federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Jones\u2019 arguments relating to enhancements not imposed at sentencing are not properly before this court. <em>See Texas v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 296, 300, 118 S.Ct. 1257, 140 L.Ed.2d 406 (1998). Because the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the 120-month sentence, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West Supp.2005); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005), we find that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated [guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm Jones\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
