In 1991, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> commenced deportation proceedings against petitioner through issuance of an Order to Show Cause (\u201cOSC\u201d), charging him with deportability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) for remaining in the United States longer than permitted. A final hearing was scheduled before Immigration Judge Robert D. Vinikoor for December 12, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">At the hearing before IJ Vinikoor, petitioner conceded deportability and his case was transferred to IJ Gossart in the Immigration Court in Baltimore, Maryland. An individual calendar hearing was scheduled for April 24, 1992. This hearing was then rescheduled, by IJ Gossart, for July 21, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">On July 21, 1992, IJ Gossart denied petitioner\u2019s application for suspension of deportation, on the grounds that he was statutorily ineligible for suspension under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> due to petitioner\u2019s 1988 conviction for retail theft. Castello appealed this order to the BIA on July 23,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">On December 9, 1995, the BIA remanded petitioner\u2019s case to the Immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Court because during the time his case was pending before the BIA, petitioner had become eligible for suspension of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 23, 1996, IJ Debernardis explained to Castello that he was re-eligible for suspension of deportation due to his accrual of seven years of continuous presence in the United States, and a hearing on the merits was set for May 15, 1996. On May 15, 1996, IJ Debernardis rescheduled the hearing for July 23, 1996. On July 23, 1996, IJ Debernardis rescheduled the hearing again, this time for October 25, 1996.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By the date of Castello\u2019s hearing in October of 1996, Congress had enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">At the October 25, 1996 hearing, the INS challenged petitioner\u2019s eligibility for suspension under newly enacted \u00a7 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA, which prevented an alien from accruing \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d following service of a notice to appear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Castello was served with an OSC in 1991, approximately four years and nine months after entering the United States. IJ Debernardis reserved his ruling on the INS\u2019s challenge and allowed petitioner to present all evidence in support of his application for suspension. The parties were directed to submit memoranda regarding application of IIRIRA \u00a7 309 to petitioner\u2019s application for suspension of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">On September 27, 1997, almost a year after petitioner\u2019s hearing, the IJ informed the parties that he had reserved decision pending review of <em>In re N-J-B- </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 812 (BIA Feb. 20, 1997), in which the BIA held service of an OSC ended an alien\u2019s period of continuous physical presence in the United States. Because the Attorney General had vacated the <em>N-J-B-</em>decision, however, the IJ informed the parties on September 27, 1997, that he was going to advise the Chief Immigration Judge of his desire to grant petitioner application for suspension of deportation contingent upon the availability of visa numbers. The Chief IJ, however, had ordered all suspension of deportation applications to be delayed because Congress was planning to enact new legislation clarifying IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">On November 19, 1997, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (\u201cNA-CARA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, which clarified that, upon service of an OSC, an alien stops accruing time toward the seven-year physical presence. The IJ granted petitioner the opportunity to file a motion asserting whether he had established seven years of continuous residency in the United States despite his absence in the mid^l980s while he served in the Spanish military.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>On May 3, 1999, the IJ denied petitioner\u2019s application for suspension of deportation on the grounds that he could not meet the continuous physical presence requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">But for his inability to meet this requirement, the Immigration Court would have granted suspension of deportation to the respondent. His criminal conviction is now more than ten years in the past. He would indeed suffer \u201cextreme hardship\u201d if required to depart from the United States at the present time. All of his family members live in the United States, all of whom have legal status in this country. Respondent has devoted himself to working as a practical nurse in a nursing home for many years, thoroughly integrated himself into the community of the United States, and provided good works for the community as well. With the exception of the one year that he spent in the Spanish army, the respondent has lived in the United States for the past 25 years. All of his formative experiences have been in this country. Deportation from the United States at this stage in his life will indeed be an \u201cextreme hardship\u201d for him. Nevertheless, the respondent is unable to meet the continuous physical presence requirement of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Immigration Court, May 3, 1999 (J.A. at 14-15).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2003), on November 4, 2003, the BIA affirmed without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision that Castello was ineligible for suspension of deportation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The oral decision of the IJ is the final agency determination. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii). Castello filed a timely petition of review in this court. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a) as amended by IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">When the BIA affirms without opinion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 245 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc). We review factual findings for substantial evidence and legal determinations de novo. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 347, 349 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Castello claims that the IJ erred in its application of IIRIRA\u2019s \u201cstop-time\u201d provisions to the calculation of his continuous physical presence in the United States. According to petitioner, the delays in his deportation proceedings\u2014which he claims were caused entirely by the INS\u2014resulted in application of more stringent calculation standards than would have been applied had his case been evaluated on the merits when it was first scheduled for hearing. If the IJ had not repeatedly rescheduled his hearing, Castello argues, his case would have been decided under the pre-IIRIRA and pre-NACARA rules. Under these rules, his application for suspension of deportation would have been granted. He believes the Immigration Court\u2019s delays, therefore, violated his due process rights by effectively denying him relief which would have otherwise been available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Prior to 1996, \u00a7 244(a) of the INA gave the Attorney General broad discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>grant suspension of deportation to illegal aliens who satisfied certain requirements. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a) (1994) (repealed 1996). \u201cSuspension of deportation\u201d was available to aliens who could demonstrate seven years continuous physical presence in the United States, good moral character, and prospective \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to himself or to his immediate family members upon his removal. <em>Id. </em>One of the defects of \u00a7 244\u2019s discretionary relief was that it encouraged illegal aliens to prolong their deportations proceedings, in order to accrue seven years of residency in the United States and then apply for suspension of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">With the enactment of IIRIRA in 1996 Congress made several significant changes to the immigration laws, including limiting the availability of discretionary relief from deportation. Particularly relevant to this case, IIRIRA limited the availability of \u201csuspension of deportation.\u201d Congress replaced \u201csuspension of deportation\u201d with \u201ccancellation of removal\u201d and made the eligibility requirements somewhat stricter, changing the required period of physical presence from seven to ten years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">A key change in immigration law under IIRIRA concerns how to calculate the time of an alien\u2019s \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d in the United States for purposes of eligibility for cancellation of removal. Pri- or to the enactment of IIRIRA in 1996, accrual of \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d began upon the alien\u2019s entry into the United States and continued to accrue during deportation proceedings. Under IIRIRA, however, the initiation of removal proceedings by the INS \u201cstops the clock\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on an alien\u2019s accrual of \u201ccontinuous physical presence.\u201d This change was specifically designed to eliminate the problem of aliens prolonging their deportation proceedings in order to satisfy the continuous physical presence requirement. IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(5) now provides that \u201cany period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed to end ... when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a) of this title\u201d or when the alien is convicted of one of several specified offenses, \u201cwhichever is earliest.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l); <em>see also </em>NACARA \u00a7 309(c)(5) (amending IIRIRA \u00a7 309 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>clarify that the new accrual rules applied to proceedings initiated by way of an Order to Show Cause, in addition to those initiated by service of a Notice to Appear). This is referred to as the \u201cstop-time\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Deportation proceedings pending at the time of IIRIRA\u2019s enactment were generally excluded from the Act\u2019s changes. Certain provisions, however, were made applicable to pending cases as well as new cases. Section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA, as modified by section 203(a)(1) of NACARA (Transitional Rules With Regard To Suspension Of Deportation), states in relevant part that the stop-time rule \u201cshall apply to orders to show cause ... issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\u201d IIRIRA was enacted September 30, 1996 and took effect April 1, 1997. NA-CARA\u2019s amendments to it were effective \u201cas if included in the enactment\u201d of IIRI-RA. NACARA \u00a7 203(f); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 note (Supp. IV1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The text of these statutes establishes Congress\u2019s intent to apply the stop-time rule to all cases, including those\u2014like Cas-tello\u2019s\u2014which were pending as of September 30, 1996. NACARA \u00a7 203(f); <em>see also </em>\u201cExplanatory Statement of the Senate Committee on Appropriations,\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12658-01, S12660 (1997) (\u201cSection 203 modifies certain transition rules established by IIRIRA with regard to suspension of deportation and cancellation of removal. The changes state that the \u2018stop time\u2019 rule established by that Act in section 240A of the INA shall apply generally to individuals in deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997, with certain exceptions.\u201d). Accordingly, for deportation proceedings pending on September 30, 1996, accrual of \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d in the United States for purposes of suspension eligibility ended upon service of an OSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The INS initiated deportation proceedings against Castello in the winter of 1991 by service of an Order to Show Cause. The IJ reasoned that because IIRIRA\u2019s stop-time rule applied to Castello, the OSC stopped the clock on his accrual of continuous physical presence in the United States. Because only four years had passed at the time proceedings commenced, the Immigration Judge found Castello ineligible for suspension of deportation under INA \u00a7 244(a) as amended by IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Petitioner\u2019s primary argument on appeal involves the delays which occurred during his deportation proceedings. Had his hearings proceeded as scheduled, he claims, he would have been evaluated under the more lenient rules in place prior to enactment of IIRIRA. He cites <em>Aoun v. I.N.S., </em>342 F.3d 503 (6th Cir.2003), for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">In <em>Aoun, </em>the INS commenced deportation proceedings in August 1985 against Nemer Ahmad Aoun, an illegal alien who entered the United States in October 1978. After four years of proceedings, his case was administratively closed by the BIA. The INS moved to re-calendar the appeal in late 1993. In June 2000, the BIA reinstated the proceedings and dismissed his appeal. Aoun moved to reopen his application for suspension of deportation, which was summarily denied by the BIA on grounds that, under the IIRIRA, his continuous physical presence in the United States ended with service of the OSC on August 15, 1985. Due to his failure to satisfy the continuous presence requirement, the BIA found him ineligible for suspension. <em>Aoun, </em>342 F.3d at 504\u201405.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">The Sixth Circuit reversed, noting that the lengthy delays in his case, which caused his eligibility to be evaluated under stricter rules, were not his fault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Had Aoun\u2019s application not been delayed by an \u201cadministrative closure\u201d of his application by the INS in the late 1980s, he would have had his application ruled on well before the new rules took effect in 1997 and he would have been subject to the former rule that allowed him to accrue time towards continuous physical presence during the pendency of the proceedings.... As a result of the INS\u2019s administrative closure of Aoun\u2019s appeal, he was denied the benefit of the earlier, more lenient rules concerning accrual of time towards continual physical presence in the United States. Because the administrative closure was not the fault of Aoun, he should not suffer the extremely adverse results that flowed from that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 507. Castello argues the reasoning of <em>Aoun </em>compels a similar result in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Aliens in removal proceedings are entitled to due process, though the procedural protections accorded to them in that context \u201cmeasure less than the panoply available to a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres, </em>383 F.3d 92, 103 (3d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 238-39 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc)). In the removal context, \u201cdue process requires that an alien who faces [removal] be provided (1) notice of the charges against him, (2) a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal, and (3) a fair opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, </em>344 U.S. 590, 597-98, 73 S.Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576 (1953)). Castello does not contend he was denied any of these. Rather, he argues that the repeated delay of his merits hearing ultimately denied him due process by subjecting him to newer\u2014and more stringent\u2014eligibility rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">But cancellation of removal relief is discretionary, and it is well-established that no due process violation arises from the denial of discretionary relief. In <em>United States v. Torres, </em>this Court joined our sister circuits in holding that \u201cbecause discretionary relief is necessarily a matter of grace rather than of right, aliens do not have a due process liberty interest in consideration for such relief.\u201d 383 F.3d at 104. Castello had no \u201cright\u201d to relief from deportation; thus denial of such relief cannot rise to the level of a due process violation. <em>See also Pinho v. I.N.S., </em>249 F.3d 183, 189 (3d Cir.2001) (suspension of deportation is discretionary relief that does not impair any vested rights and does not give rise to due process violations); <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1301 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cNo constitutionally protected interest arises from the INS\u2019s actions in granting or denying applications for suspension because the Attorney General exercises \u2018unfettered\u2019 discretion over applications for suspension. Therefore, regardless of the ultimate disposition of an application for suspension of deportation, Plaintiffs do not possess a constitutionally protected interest in their expectancy of receiving suspension.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Next, Castello claims that he was denied due process and equal protection by the Chief Immigration Judge\u2019s directive that decisions in cases pending in October 1997 be reserved until November 14, 1997, due to the possibility of congressional legislation clarifying IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c). With respect to Castello\u2019s due process claim, our holding in Section II controls. Because Castello had no constitutionally protected interest in suspension from deportation, a directive from the Chief Immigration Judge in light of pending legislation cannot operate to deprive appellant of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Castello also claims he was denied equal protection under the law because other aliens had their cases heard and ruled on between February 1996 and October 1997, when his case was undergoing delay. But the record contains no evidence that Castello\u2019s application for suspension of deportation was treated differently than were the applications of other similarly-situated applicants. To the contrary, the Chief IJ\u2019s directive applied to all applications for suspension of deportation pending immediately prior to the enactment of NACARA.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In light of the dramatic changes wrought on the immigration laws by the enactment of IIRIRA and by the imminent enactment of NACARA, the Chief IJ necessarily had to have flexibility in formulating a case management plan for those applications pending in the Fall of 1997. The Equal Protection Clause requires only that the Chief IJ\u2019s directive rationally further a legitimate governmental interest, <em>Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, </em>473 U.S. 432, 439-41, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985), which we believe it does. Accordingly, we find no violation of Castello\u2019s rights under the Equal Protection Clause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">In the alternative, Castello claims the IJ erred by not counting the seven years\u2019 continuous presence he accrued subsequent to the initial issuance of the OSC in 1991. Assuming the stop-time provision applies to him, Castello argues that it does not preclude the accumulation of a new period of seven years, beginning in 1991 and going forward. We disagree. Three cases inform our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">In <em>In re Mendoza-Sandino, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1236 (BIA Feb. 23, 2000), Sandra Carolina Mendoza-Sandino entered the United States on February 28, 1986, and was served with an Order to Show Cause and an arrest warrant the next day. By the time her application for suspension of deportation was heard by an Immigration Judge in 1996, she had accrued seven years of continuous physical presence. An en banc panel of the BIA held that an alien may not accrue the required seven years\u2019 continuous physical presence after service of an Order to Show Cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">The language of section 240A(d) makes it clear that Congress appreciated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>difference between a \u201cbreak\u201d in continuous physical presence and the \u201cend\u201d of continuous physical presence. Congress has distinguished between certain actions that \u201cend\u201d continuous physical presence, i.e., service of a charging document or commission of a specified crime, and certain departures from the country that only temporarily \u201cbreak\u201d that presence. Service of an Order to Show Cause or a notice to appear is not included as an interruptive event under section 240A(d)(2), which merely breaks continuous physical presence. Rather, under section 240A(d)(l), such service is deemed to end an alien\u2019s presence completely. Therefore, a reading of section 240A(d)(l) that would allow an alien to accrue a new period of continuous physical presence after the service of a charging document is not supported by the language of either section 240A(d)(l) or (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1240. The BIA also set forth the legislative history of the IIRIRA, concluding that its holding in <em>Mendoza </em>was consistent with the goals of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">The House and Conference Reports make it clear that the legislators intended to remove the incentive for aliens to prolong their cases in the hope of remaining in the United States long enough to be eligible for relief from deportation. Therefore, reading section 240A(d)(l) to allow an alien to accrue a new period of continuous physical presence after the issuance of a charging document would be contrary to the intent of Congress as expressed in the legislative history of the IIRIRA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1243 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Departing from this bright-line rule, the BIA in <em>In re Ignacio Cisneros-Gonzalez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 668 (Sept. 1, 2004), created an exception for aliens served with charging documents on separate occasions. Ignacio Cisneros-Gonzalez was served with an Order to Show Cause charging him with deportability on December 28, 1990. He was deported to Mexico on January 10, 1991, and he returned (illegally) to the United States the next day. Ten years later he was again served with charging documents by the INS (now DHS). Gonzalez requested cancellation of removal, contending he satisfied the 10 years continuous physical presence requirement of section 240A. Applying <em>Mendoza, </em>the Immigration Judge denied his application. The BIA reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">The BIA in <em>Cisneros </em>framed the issue narrowly: \u201cwhether an alien who departs the United States after being served with a valid charging document can, upon his subsequent return to the United States, accrue a period of continuous physical presence\u2014measured from the date of his return\u2014so as to demonstrate eligibility for cancellation of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Relying heavily on both the statute\u2019s structure and the legislative history of the stop-time rules, the BIA in <em>Cisneros </em>held an alien may accrue a second period of continuous physical presence under section 1229b(b)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 672. The BIA emphasized that Cisneros-Gonzalez was involved in a second round of removal proceedings, and held the \u201cstop-time rule was not intended to extend to charging documents issued in earlier proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672. Because service of the clock-stopping notice to appear applies only to those notices \u201cserved in the proceedings in which the alien applies for cancellation of removal,\u201d the BIA held that a second clock had started and Gonzalez had demonstrated the requisite continuous physical presence under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Although the en banc panel in <em>Cisneros </em>did not explicitly overrule <em>Mendoza, </em>it did interpret <em>Mendoza </em>to hold that it \u201cresolved the question whether service [of an OSC] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>precluded an applicant for relief from accruing a qualifying period of continuous physical presence <em>in the proceedings </em>that arose from service of that charging document.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670 (emphasis added). By imposing an \u201cin the proceedings\u201d requirement that effectively limits the application of <em>Mendoza, </em>the <em>Cisneros </em>rule left open the possibility that, in limited instances, section 1229b permits multiple periods of \u201ccontinuous physical presence.\u201d We considered one such instance in <em>Okeke v. Gonzales, </em>407 F.3d 585 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Anderson Jude Okeke, a Nigerian citizen, entered the United States in 1981 on a student visa. In 1983 Okeke was arrested for possession of marijuana and sentenced to five years\u2019 probation. In 1984, after a trip to Nigeria, Okeke was lawfully readmitted to the United States. He lived in the U.S. without interruption since then. He and his wife had six children, all of whom are U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In 1997 the INS served Okeke with a Notice to Appear, charging him with re-movability for failure to comply with the terms of his student visa. He applied for cancellation of removal. The IJ found he had failed to establish the required seven years of continuous physical presence, however, because his controlled substance offense in 1983 \u201cstopped the clock\u201d on his accrual. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). Because Okeke arrived in the United States in 1981 and committed the offense in 1983, the IJ held he accrued only two years of continuous physical presence under \u00a7 240A. The IJ denied his application. On appeal, the BIA affirmed. This Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The majority\u2014in two separate opinions\u2014held Okeke was entitled to relief. But Judges Garth and Ambro reached this result via different routes. Judge Garth reasoned that Okeke\u2019s lawful re-entry into the United States in 1984, at which time he was still covered by his student visa, \u201crestarted\u201d the clock for purposes of \u201ccontinuous physical presence.\u201d <em>Okeke, </em>407 F.3d at 590 (Garth, J.). Judge Ambro, concurring, focused instead on the statute\u2019s plain language and Congress\u2019 intent, stating that <em>Mendoza </em>was incorrectly decided. <em>See id. </em>at 597 (Ambro, J., concurring) (\u201cCongress intended in \u00a7 1229b(d)(l) to allow the continuous physical presence clock to restart after the commission of a specified offense\u201d). Although no single <em>ratio deciden-di </em>is clear, and although each would carve out a rule that would allow for the accrual of the requisite period of time subsequent to some clock-stopping event, neither Judges Garth\u2019s nor Judge Ambro\u2019s opinion allows us to disregard <em>Cisneros\u2019 </em>s rule\u2014 that \u201cservice [of an OSC] precluded] an applicant for relief from accruing a qualifying period of continuous physical presence in the proceedings that arose from service of that charging document.\u201d 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Adopting Judge Garth\u2019s rationale would not alter the application of <em>Cisneros </em>to this case. Interpreting the more stringent bright-line rule in <em>Mendoza, </em>Judge Garth determined it did not address \u201cwhether <em>lawful reentry </em>after commission of an offense, rendering the alien inadmissible, restarts the clock.\u201d <em>Okeke, </em>407 F.3d at 589 (Garth, J.). He then interpreted <em>Cisneros </em>as creating an exception to <em>Mendoza, </em>allowing \u201cfor the accrual of a new period of continuous physical presence upon an alien\u2019s reentry into the United States,\u201d and held where there is a \u201clawful reentry after a clock-stopping event, ... the clock starts anew.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590. However, here, Cas-tello did not leave and then reenter the country. Under Judge Garth\u2019s rationale, and applying the appropriate standard of deference, under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>to both <em>Mendoza </em>and <em>Cisneros, </em>we are unable expand <em>Cisneros\u2019 </em>exception to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Nor would adoption of Judge Ambro\u2019s reasoning alter the application of <em>Cisne-ros. </em>After arguing that <em>Cisneros </em>did not apply to Okeke\u2019s case, Judge Ambro stated that he would have held Mendoza\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)\u2014that \u201cthe clock cannot be reset so that an alien accrues continues physical presence after the commission of a specified offense\u201d\u2014 impermissible under <em>Chevron. Id. </em>at 593. Whatever the merits of this rationale, the clock did not stop for Castello because of his commission of any \u201cspecified offense\u201d (that is, his time did not stop because of the commission of any particular crime). Instead, the clock stopped because Castel-lo was served with one, and only one, OSC, premised on his staying in the U.S. longer than permitted. <em>Okeke </em>dealt specifically with an individual convicted of a controlled substance offense, and Judge Ambro focused on Mendoza\u2019s effective \u00a7 1229b(d)(l) rule, that \u201cif you commit a specified offense you can never get cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229(b)(b)(l).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594-95. But this reasoning does not extend further than Judge Ambro\u2019s proposed holding in <em>Okeke. </em>Even were we to agree that either the bright-line rule in <em>Mendoza, </em>or the more limited rule in <em>Cisneros, </em>should not apply to instances in which an alien has committed a \u201cspecified offense,\u201d that limitation on Mendoza\u2014and, by extension, Cisneros\u2014would not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Applying <em>Cisneros, </em>because Castello did not accrue seven years of continuous physical presence prior to issuance of a charging document by the INS, we find no error in the IJ\u2019s calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review of the final order of deportation entered by the BIA on November 4, 2003.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We deny the motion to withhold decision in No. 03-4475 and deny the motion to remand in No. 05-3166.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-12\">.

On a related issue, Castello-Diaz requests that we withhold our decision and remand this issue to the District Court in order for the parties to present further evidence that the Chief IJ's interference deprived Castello-Diaz of due process, and claims that our jurisdiction to order the parties to provide further evidence is barred under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Castello-Diaz argues that, because the issue he raises here is \"the same issue\u201d raised in a class action settlement, <em>see Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>243 F.Supp.2d 1029 (N.D.Cal.2002), we should give Castello-Diaz the opportunity to reach the same resolution reached there.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">We disagree with Castello-Diaz for two reasons. First, the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. 109-13, Div. B, Title I, \u00a7 106(c), limits the district courts\u2019 habeas jurisdiction over removal orders. <em>See Kamara v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>420 F.3d 202, 210 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201d[I]t is readily apparent, given Congress\u2019 clear intent to have all challenges to removal orders heard in a single form (the court of appeals), that those habeas petitions that were pending before this Court on the effective date of the REAL ID Act are properly converted to petitions for review and retained by this Court.\u201d) (citing <em>Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442 (3d Cir.2005)). Second, even assuming Castello-Diaz could be entitled to a resolution obtained by settlement in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (and not through a judicial resolution of an outstanding question of law), the settlement outcome in <em>Barahona </em>was tied to an internal directive concerning \u00a7\u00a7 304(a)(3) and 309(c)(7) of the IIRIRA\u2014provisions not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b754-5\">. The IJ has discretionary authority to reopen a case upon his own motion at any time pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). Castel-lo arrived in the U.S. as a minor, and has been living continuously in this country for almost twenty-one years\u2014fifteen of which have involved litigation arising from the initial Order to Show Cause. His family lives in the United States, and he has worked as a nurse in a nursing home for several years. Even though he cannot prevail in this case, Castello seems to be an appropriate candidate for discretionary relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
