He argues, for the first time, that, because Government objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for safety-valve relief, and remained silent as to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the Government manifested its intent to renounce the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Whether the Government has breached a plea agreement is a question of law subject to de novo review; however, when the defendant does not raise the issue at sentencing, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In the plea agreement, the Government pledged to not oppose a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility if Jar-amillo met the requirements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 and the reduction was recommended by the presentence report (PSR). The PSR did not recommend that Jaramil-lo receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Also, the plea agreement did not require that the Government refrain from opposing Jaramillo\u2019s request for safety-valve relief. Consequently, the Government did not breach the plea agreement and Jaramillo has not shown error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The Government contends that, because it did not breach the plea agreement, the appellate waiver provision in the agreement is valid and Jaramillo\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. This court reviews de novo whether a waiver provision bars an appeal. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). A defendant may waive his statutory right to appeal as part of a valid plea agreement, provided that the waiver is knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). When the record shows that the defendant read and understood the plea agreement and that he raised no question regarding the sentence appeal waiver provision, he will be held to the bargain that he has struck. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Here, the record reflects that Jaramillo read and understood the plea agreement and raised no question regarding the sentence appeal waiver provision. As such, Jaramillo\u2019s appeal waiver is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Jaramillo argues that the enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice based on judicial fact-finding violates the principles announced by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Under the terms of the appeal waiver, Jaramillo waived the right to appeal his plea, his conviction and sentence, or the manner in which his sentence was determined based on the grounds set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, except for an upward departure. His appeal does not fall under any exceptions to the waiver and his appeal is barred. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that the \u201c \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 in an appeal waiver means \u2018the upper limit of punishment that Congress has legislatively specified for violations of a statute\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, Jaramillo\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
