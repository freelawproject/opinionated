Because Walton has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-20\">On November 24, 2003, Walton pled guilty to one count of distributing five grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Walton was sentenced on February 9, 2004, to a term of imprisonment of 188 months, and judgment was entered in his case February 11, 2004. Walton did not file a direct appeal. On February 9, 2005, Walton filed a \u00a7 2255 motion arguing that he was entitled to resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court denied Walton\u2019s motion, concluding that neither <em>Blakely </em>nor <em>Booker </em>applied retroactively to Walton\u2019s case, which became final prior to the issuance of both decisions. The district court subsequently denied Walton\u2019s request for a COA. Walton has now renewed his request with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-21\">The denial of a motion for relief under \u00a7 2255 may be appealed only if the district court or this court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). A COA \u201cmay issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s procedural dismissal of Walton\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was clearly correct. As noted by the district court, we have held that neither <em>Blakely </em>nor <em>Booker </em>apply retroactively to convictions, such as Walton\u2019s, that were final at the time these cases were decided. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>400 F.3d 844, 849 (10th Cir.2005) (holding <em>Blakely </em>does not apply retroactively to convictions that were final when that case was decided on June 24, 2004) and <em>United States v. Bellamy, </em>411 F.3d 1182, 1186-87 (10th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to convictions that were final at the time it was decided on January 12, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The request for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-18\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
