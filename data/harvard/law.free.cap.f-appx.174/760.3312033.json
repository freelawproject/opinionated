We affirmed Divine\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Divine, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 959 (4th Cir.2005) (No. 04-4459). On remand, the district court sentenced Divine to 120 months of imprisonment. Divine\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the district court should have applied a beyond a reasonable doubt standard at sentencing to find that the offense involved a certain number of firearms and that Divine possessed the firearms in connection with another felony offense and whether Divine\u2019s sentence is reasonable, in light of this court\u2019s statement in our prior opinion that the maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict was ninety-six months. Divine has filed pro se supplemental briefs challenging his conviction and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Counsel suggests that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard in determining the advisory sentencing guideline range. We disagree. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201cremedial portion of <em>Booker </em>held that decisions about sentencing factors will continue to be made by judges, on the preponderance of the evidence, an approach that comports with the [Sjixth [Ajmendment so long as the guideline system has some flexibility in application\u201d). Moreover, our review of the record convinces us that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\"> With regard to Divine's challenges to his conviction, we find that those issues are foreclosed by the mandate rule. <em>See Invention Submission Corp. v. Dudas, </em>413 F.3d 411, 414-15 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing mandate rule), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1024, 163 L.Ed.2d 854 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
