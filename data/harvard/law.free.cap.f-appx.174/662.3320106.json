The district court sentenced Riddle to a 42-month custodial term to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">On this appeal Riddle does not challenge his conviction but advances the following contentions with respect to his sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-18\">I. The district court erred in enhancing Riddle\u2019s sentence based upon its finding by a preponderance of the evidence, that he believed he transported guns to be used for crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-19\">A. Riddle had no reason to believe that he was transporting guns for criminal purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-20\">B. The district court improperly based its finding on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-21\">II. The district court erred when it imposed sentence without explicitly articulating its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, making the sentence unre-viewable and unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-22\">Riddle\u2019s first contention relates to the court applying a 4-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). By reason of that 4-level enhancement Riddle\u2019s total offense level was increased from 17 to 21, thus increasing his sentencing range from 27 to 33 months to 41 to 51 months predicated on his Criminal History Category of II. Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides for a 4\u2014 level enhancement if the defendant possessed or transferred any firearm with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>nection with another felony offense. Riddle asserts that the court erred in applying this enhancement as the facts did not support it. Moreover, he contends that the court erroneously found the facts justifying application of the guideline by a mere preponderance of evidence whereas the beyond the reasonable doubt standard was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We reject these contentions for the following reasons. First, the court indicated that it was making its findings both beyond a reasonable doubt and by a preponderance of the evidence. Second, in any event, under <em>United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 261 (5th Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Miller, </em>417 F.3d 358, 363 (3d Cir.2005), a finding by a preponderance of the evidence was adequate. Third, the record supports the court\u2019s findings, and thus we cannot upset them. <em>See United States v. Ortiz, </em>878 F.2d 125, 126-27 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We also reject Riddle\u2019s second contention. In this regard we point out that the court was well aware of the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as it explicitly found that it was imposing a \u201creasonable [sentence] in view of the considerations expressed\u201d in that section. App. at 75. Moreover, we are satisfied from the court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing that it adequately considered the applicable sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of conviction and sentence entered May 25, 2005, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
