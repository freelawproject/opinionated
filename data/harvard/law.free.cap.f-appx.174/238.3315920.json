Wafiq argues that the summary disposition procedure of the BIA violates the Administrative Procedure Act because the procedure \u201cresults in arbitrary and capricious decision-making.\u201d He also asserts that the IJ improperly relied on evidence outside of the record to refute Wafiq\u2019s claim that he did not receive notice of his 1989 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005). Wafiq does not challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that his motion to reopen, which was not filed until July 22, 2004, was untimely. Wafiq\u2019s failure to challenge the conclusion that his motion to reopen was time-barred is the same as if he had not appealed that aspect of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Consequently, he has not shown that the IJ\u2019s ruling was an abuse of discretion, much less arbitrary and capricious. Nor has shown that he suffered any prejudice by the IJ\u2019s reference to the comments made by Wafiq\u2019s former counsel at the 1989 hearing. Accordingly, Wafiq\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
