We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-21\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Brice v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>806 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1986). An abuse of discretion will be found \u201cin those circumstances where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusions statements; that is to say, where the [BIA] has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-22\">A motion to reopen \u201casks that the proceedings be reopened for new evidence and a new decision, usually after an evi-dentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90 (citation omitted). An alien is limited to one motion to reopen exclusion or deportation proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(A) (2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(2) (2005). This motion must be filed within ninety-days of the final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C) (2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2005). A motion that does not comply with these time and numerical limitations can only be brought where the alien can establish \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(c)(7)(C)(ii) (2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h) (2005). Such a motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence offered \u201cis material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented\u201d at the previous hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In this case, the BIA properly found that Lin\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely filed under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and that Lin did not qualify for the exception to the time limitations permitted by <em>Matter of X-G-W, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 71 (BIA 1998), or the \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d exception listed under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). The BIA addressed and rejected Lin\u2019s claim that circumstances in China had changed for birth control violators since his last apphcation. The BIA based its determination on Lin\u2019s failure to substantiate that any specific birth control measure will be implemented against either him or his wife. Additionally, the birth of Lin\u2019s two children in the United States, as the BIA correctly held, does not amount to \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d <em>See Jian Huan Guan, v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the BIA properly exercised its discretion in concluding that Lin had failed to satisfy the heavy burden relevant to reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">For these reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
