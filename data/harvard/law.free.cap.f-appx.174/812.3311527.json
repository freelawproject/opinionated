Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and (3) the statutes under which he was convicted, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, are unconstitutional. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction and VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">On November 1, 2003, four border patrol agents responded to a sensor activated on the Dolores Ranch in Laredo, Texas and set up surveillance in the area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Agents Marco Lara and Duke Canch\u00f3la were stationed on the ground, and the other two agents remained in their marked vehicle. Agent Lara notified the other agents that he saw a man walking across the ranch, later identified as the defendant-appellant Jose Guadalupe Molina. Agent Lara then observed a second man approach Molina, and after the two men spoke with each other and scanned the area, Molina began walking toward Agent Canchola\u2019s undetected position on the ground. Agents Lara and Canch\u00f3la also observed approximately ten individuals carrying duffel bags on their backs, who appeared to be following Molina.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Once Molina approached Agent Cancho-la\u2019s position, he was arrested. Around the time Agent Canch\u00f3la was arresting Molina, the individuals with the duffel bags dropped their bundles and fled. Agent Lara arrested a man in the group who was not carrying any narcotics, later identified as Gerardo Mendez-Sanchez. Although the agents did not arrest any of the individuals carrying the narcotics, they recovered ten duffel bags, which contained approximately 239.72 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Molina and Mendez-Sanchez were advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights, and both agreed to make statements to the agents. Molina told the agents that his job was to go north of the narcotics load-up area and watch for law enforcement. In addition to receiving his statement, the agents seized the cell phone that Molina had been carrying in a plastic bag. The cell phone screen displayed the word \u201cmula,\u201d slang for mule or courier in Spanish. In his statement to the agents, Mendez-Sanchez explained that his job was to erase the footprints left in the grass by those carrying the narcotics. He also told the agents that Molina was a scout for the drug operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">On November 18, 2003, Molina and Mendez-Sanchez were charged in a two-count indictment with: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and 846; and (2) possession with intent to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Mendez-Sanchez pleaded guilty to the possession count. Molina pleaded not guilty, and his case proceeded before a jury. At Molina\u2019s trial, Mendez-Sanchez testified as a government witness that the group was following Molina and that Molina was acting as a guide. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>On January 14, 2004, a jury found Molina guilty of both counts in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the probation officer recommended a base offense level of 26, using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7), for an offense involving at least 100 kilograms of marijuana. After concluding that Molina was a manager or supervisor in the drug conspiracy pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), the probation officer recommended adding three levels to arrive at a total offense level of 29. With Molina\u2019s criminal history category of I, the recommendation resulted in a guideline imprisonment range of 87 to 108 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Molina objected to the PSR, disputing the three-level aggravating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) and requesting a minimal or minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a)-(b). In an addendum to the PSR, the probation officer maintained that Molina acted as a supervisor or manager of the drug conspiracy, thus warranting the three-level increase. The probation officer also recommended denying the role adjustment under either \u00a7 3B1.2(a) or (b) because she concluded that Molina\u2019s role in the drug conspiracy was \u201c[i]n no way ... minimal or minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">At sentencing, Molina re-urged his objections, this time citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in support of his contention that the aggravating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was not warranted because there was no jury finding that he had a managerial or supervisory role in the drug conspiracy. He also argued that he should receive a mitigating role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a)-(b), given that his role in the conspiracy was minimal or minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The district court found that the facts did not support a three-level enhancement for Molina\u2019s role in the offense and therefore did not apply the aggravating role adjustment. The district court denied Molina\u2019s request for a downward adjustment, finding that Molina was \u201cclearly not just one of the mules.\u201d After re-calculating Molina\u2019s total offense level as 26, the district court determined that the guideline imprisonment range was sixty-three to seventy-eight months. In sentencing Molina, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">I\u2019m going to sentence you at that lower level, 26. But I am going to sentence you around the middle, slightly above the middle, because of the weight of the marijuana, first of all. And because, as I say, you\u2019re clearly not just one of the mules. So I\u2019m going to sentence you to 72 months. When you get out, you will be on supervised release for five years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Molina filed this timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">A. Mitigating Role Adjustment Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">Molina argues that he should have received a downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because there is no evidence showing that he had a role in coordinating the drug smuggling or that he knew anything about who supplied the marijuana or where it was to be delivered. According to Molina, his limited role of scouting the area for law enforcement and serving as a guide supports his contention that the district court erred in denying him a mitigating role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s offense level by four levels if the defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the criminal activity or by two levels if the defendant was a \u201cminor participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a)-(b); <em>United States v. Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d 276, 296 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cSuch an adjustment is \u2018generally appropriate only if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d at 296 (quoting <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 181 (5th Cir.1996)); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">As the commentary points out, the decision of whether to apply \u00a7 3B1.2(a) or (b) \u201cinvolves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C) (noting that the court \u201cis not required to find, based solely on the defendant\u2019s bare assertion, that such a role adjustment is warranted\u201d). Given this fact-intensive inquiry, we will not reverse the district court\u2019s finding that Molina\u2019s conduct did not warrant the downward adjustment unless that finding is clearly erroneous. <em>See Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d at 296. \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005); <em>see also Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74,105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in hght of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The district court\u2019s finding that Molina was \u201cclearly not just one of the mules\u201d is supported by the record. Molina admitted to the border patrol agents that he was scouting the area for law enforcement, which means that his criminal activity was not confined to \u201cmule\u201d or courier status. Additionally, Mendez-Sanchez testified that the individuals carrying the bundles of marijuana were following Molina and that Molina was acting as a guide. <em>See United States v. Pofahl, </em>990 F.2d 1456, 1485 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that there was no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s role was not minimal or minor where the defendant\u2019s \u201crole was not confined to that of a mule\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Bethley, </em>973 F.2d 396, 401 (5th Cir.1992) (stating that \u201ca \u2018mule\u2019 or transporter of drugs may not be entitled to minor or minimal status\u201d). The district court also considered the weight of the marijuana involved in this case in denying Molina\u2019s request. Our case law supports such a consideration in denying an adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Leal-Mendoza, </em>281 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2002) (concluding that the district court did not clearly err in refusing an adjustment where the defendants were paid a substantial sum of money and moved a large quantity of drugs); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 943 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc) (stating that drug quantity may be the best indication of a drug courier\u2019s participation in the criminal activity). Based on our review of the record in its entirety, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in refusing Molina an adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">B. Sentencing Under Mandatory Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Although Molina contends that the district court committed <em>Booker </em>error by sentencing him under the mandatory Guidelines, he concedes that he failed to raise this issue before the district court and therefore plain-error review applies. The government correctly notes that this case involves <em>Fanfan </em>error, and not <em>Booker </em>error, because Molina is complaining only about the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005) (discussing the difference between <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan </em>error). With regard to Molina\u2019s suggested standard of review, the government readily accepts plain error as the appropriate blueprint for this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">As an initial matter, we observe that we are not bound by Molina\u2019s concessions\u2014or the government\u2019s acceptance of those concessions\u2014because it is this court, and not the parties, that determines the proper standard of review. <em>See United States v. Vontsteen, </em>950 F.2d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc) (\u201c[N]o party has the power to <em>control </em>our standard of review.... If neither party suggests the appropriate standard, the reviewing court must determine the proper standard on its own\u201d) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also St. Tammany Parish Sch. Bd. v. Louisiana, </em>142 F.3d 776, 782 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cOf course, we, not the parties, determine the proper standard of review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Our review of the record reveals that Molina made a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, thereby preserving <em>Fan-fan </em>error for harmless-error review. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>\u2014 F.3d -, 2006 WL 633280, at *5 (5th Cir. Mar.15, 2006) (stating that the defendant preserves <em>Fanfan </em>error by raising a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court). Under harmless-error review, we will normally vacate and remand for resentencing unless the government can prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.) (stating that if the issue presented in <em>Fanfan </em>is preserved, this court will vacate and remand unless the error is harmless under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). \u201c[T]he government must shoulder the heavy burden of demonstrating that the district court would not have imposed a different sentence under the advisory regime-in essence, the [gjovernment must prove a negative.\u201d <em>United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 259 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005) (stating that the government must \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced [the defendant] differently had it acted under an advisory Guidelines regime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">We have reviewed the record in its entirety, and there is nothing in the record indicating that the district court would not have sentenced Molina differently under advisory Guidelines. In fact, the district court judge did not make any statement at sentencing regarding what he would have done under an advisory sentencing regime. Under the harmless-error standard, \u201c[t]he judge\u2019s silence as to whether or not he would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory regime does not satisfy th[e] [government\u2019s] burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we must vacate Molina\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">C. Constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), 841(b), 846</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Finally, Molina argues, for the first time on appeal, that the statutes under which he was convicted, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), 841(b), and 846, are facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As he correctly concedes, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>claim is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe see nothing in the Supreme Court decision in <em>Apprendi </em>which would permit us to conclude that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and (b), 846, and 860(a) are unconstitutional on their face.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Molina\u2019s judgment of conviction as imposed by the district court, and VACATE and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b836-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\">.
