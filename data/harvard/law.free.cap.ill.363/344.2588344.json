The proceedings were had pursuant to the statute (Smith\u2019s Stat. 1933, chap. 46, art. 2, sec. 13,) which provides for the summary punishment for misbehavior by judges and clerks of election. The judgments against the plaintiffs in error have been affirmed by the Appellate Court for the First District and the cause is here on a writ of error.</p> <p id=\"b345-3\" pgmap=\"345\">The question presented by this writ of error is identical with that considered and passed upon in People v.
