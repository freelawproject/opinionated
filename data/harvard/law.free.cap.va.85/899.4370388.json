The propriety of this conviction depends upon the question of the constitutionality of the act of assembly imposing a tax upon the business of a coupon-broker. See section 65, ch. 450, Acts 1888-84, p. 590. In the case of <em>Com\u2019th </em>v. <em>Maury, </em>reported in 82 Va. 882, this precise question was submitted to this court and determined in favor of the constitutionality of that act,</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>and the reasons for that decision are fully stated in the opinion of Richardson, J., speaking for the court in that case. We are now asked, without the citation of a single additional authority, or the presentation of a new reason, to reverse that deliberate decision. This we cannot do. The State has, in our opinion, the power to tax the business of a coupon-broker just as it has a right to tax persons engaged in other avocations within its jurisdiction. The case is therefore ruled by the case of <em>Com\u2019th </em>v. <em>Maury, supra, </em>and the judgment of the hustings court of the city of Petersburg must he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
