In this action of the circuit court there was no error. There is no obligation upon the officers of the court to receive coupons in payment of their fees. These fees were not for \u201ctaxes, debts, and demands due the Commonwealth,\u201d hut were the property of the officers of the court, to which the State had and could have no valid claim; and there is no obligation upon these officers in any case to receive the coupons of the State, genuine or spurious, in payment of their fees. It follows that there is no error in the said judgment, and the same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Lewis, P., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
