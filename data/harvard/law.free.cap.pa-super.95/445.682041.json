The parties were married in 1918. Together they conducted a small store and restaurant (a \u201cquick lunch affair,\u201d respondent called it) in Northampton. She did the housework, opened the place early in the morning, cooked, washed the dishes, served patrons, etc. He kept the place open late at night and took charge after he came in during the morning. They got on amicably until 1920; some time during that year he began \u201cdrinking [what she called \u201chomemade drink\u201d] continuously for about two months\u201d and when she remonstrated with him about it, \u201che got mad and came at\u201d her, \u201ccaught\u201d her and \u201chit\u201d her and \u201cthrew [her] into the comer, tore the watch and ring off [her] and told [her] he was finished with [her];\u201d she says she had a \u201cblack and blue arm for days\u201d as a result of the encounter. She states that during the period he was \u201cdrinking every day and wasn\u2019t able to work or take care of business, I [she] had to attend it all.\u201d He told her \u201cto \u2018get the hell out\u2019 \u201d saying \u201cI am not going to stop drinking, and you and no other ....... will stop me drinking, get out of here.\u201d She then complained to her husband\u2019s counsel, who told her, as she testifies, that if she couldn\u2019t live with her husband, she could leave him, whereupon she left. Her husband\u2019s couns\u00e9l contradicts her, and testifies that she came to him and exhibited the marks on her arm and that he told her \u201cshe hadn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>sufficient [cause] for her to leave him and secure a support order.\u201d Libellant admits this assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">After staying away about a week, she returned for some clothes, and her husband \u201ctold [her] to come back and he\u2019d be all right.\u201d He then quit drinking for some time. The evidence justifies our finding that between that occurrence and October, 1924, he went on prolonged periodical sprees, during which he became very nasty. He admits those drinking spells but suggests that she exaggerates them. We accept her account of them and observe that if he expected us to adopt his statement of the facts, he should have offered evidence that was available to him, or at least, should have explained why he did not do so. She testifies that four or five times a year she had to call in Dr. Meixell of Northamption to treat libellant when in such drunken condition; as the doctor was not called by libellant to testify, we assume that he would have corroborated respondent. In these cases in which the court must make up its own mind as to the facts (Nacrelli\u2019s case, 288 Pa. 1) it is sometimes difficult to reach satisfactory conclusions, but in this case, with her testimony, his admissions concerning his drinking, and his omission to produce the physician\u2019s testimony or to explain its absence, we have no difficulty in finding the fact in accordance with her testimony and that of several other witnesses, in part, corroborating her. While such drunkenness in itself may not constitute indignities to the person of the wife rendering her condition intolerable and life burdensome, when accompanied with ill treatment and abusive language, it is a material element in a course of conduct producing that cause for divorce: Mason v. Mason, 131 Pa. 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In another drunken passion, libellant pushed respondent up-stairs and \u201chit [her] with his fist\u201d accompanying the assault with foul talk. Again, while drunk, he \u201cpointed in [her] face\u201d a loaded revolver and said \u201cdo you want this;\u201d some talk ensued and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>he put away- the weapon; asked \u201cThen you weren\u2019t afraid\u201d she said, \u201cNot exactly.\u201d After one of these occurrences she left him a second time, and remained away about two weeks. He asked her to return and she said she would if he quit getting drunk; the result was that on the advice of a friend, who was present and who testified, she returned. For a week, she states, \u201che was all right.\u201d Then he went on another drunk and accused her of having been \u201cout again with\u201d a man; she denied it and asked him to confront her with any one who said she was, but he declined to do so; she states that then he broke down and she called in Dr. Meixell to treat him. He then sobered-up and there was no difficulty until the night preceding the separation. He came home drunk and again accused her \u2014 falsely, she says \u2014 of having been out with another man. Accordingly on October 10, 1924, she left. While drunk, he called his wife opprobrious names in the presence of others; one witness said in corroborating respondent, \u201cWell, the customers there in the store and restaurant could hear him very easily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In October, 1924, he tried to persuade her to return ; she says she agreed to return if he gave up geting into these drunken states; he says, she stated to him that she would never return, and in this, he is corroborated by his counsel who testified that one of the interviews between the parties took place in his office in October, 1924. Assuming, that in October she did say that she would never return, the law permits her to change her mind, provided she does so in time: Neagley v. Neagley, 59 Pa. Superior Ct. 565, 568. After October (and even as late as the master\u2019s hearing, to which we refer only as perhaps corroborating her previously expressed state of mind) she told him she would return if he would quit getting drunk. It was a fair condition to impose; her prior experience had shown his inability to drink moderately, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>any event, the law prohibited his manufacture or possession of intoxicating liquors.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">A study of the record convinces us that the cause of the differences between these parties was the conduct of libellant during his prolonged drunken sprees \u2014 conduct of which he was apparently not conscious after he became sober and of which he would not have been guilty while sober. In 1922 he gave her a Christmas gift of beads in a box he described as 8 by 4 inches; she was in bed; he says he \u201cchucked them to her as you would give any one a present.\u2019 \u2019 She says he was drunk, came home at 2 A. M. and addressing her with an opprobrious epithet threw the box at her and struck her on the chest, leaving a \u201cblack and blue mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The record shows such a course of conduct on the part of libellant, persisted in from some time in 1920 to October 10, 1924, as constitutes indignities to the person of respondent rendering her condition intolerable and life burdensome within the statute: Lynn v. Lynn, 76 Pa. Superior Ct. 428, and cases cited on page 431. In such circumstances, her leaving was not desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">To find for libellant on this record would be to dispose of the case on a \u201cdoubtful balance of the evidence\u201d and on \u201c.unsubstantial inferences\u201d and this we may not do: Rommel v. Rommel, 87 Pa. Superior Ct. 511, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Decree reversed; record remitted with instructions to dismiss the libel at libellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
