L. 54. A correct understanding of the case cannot be obtained from the record as printed by appellant. In his petition for preference, claimant avers \u201cthat the above named defendants employed and hired\u201d him, etc., but as printed in the record, the caption to the case is omitted so that it doe's not appear to whom the words \u201cthe above named defendants\u201d apply. The confusion is continued throughout the petition by other references \u201cto the defendants.\u201d At the conclusion of the petition, the fund is alleged to be \u201cderived from the sale of property of Philip Kremer, Nathan Hoffman and R. M. McGinnis, trading as the Belmont Drug Company......\u201d A reference to the original record discloses that the petition was filed in a case entitled \u201cWalter Rothwell v. Philip P. Kremer and Nathan Hoffman.\u201d It therefore appears that petitioner avers employment by those two men \u2014 in what capacity they were associated is neither averred nor proved \u2014 and that his claim accrued, in the words of the petition, \u201cwhile working as a clerk in the defendants \u2019 store at 6190 Ridge Avenue......\u201d What the relation, if any, of these two defendants may be to the three parties described as trading as Belmont Drug Company, does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Further examination of the original record shows that judgment was entered in Court of Common Pleas No. 1 in favor of Walter Rothwell against Philip Kremer and Nathan Hoffman on a judgment note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>dated August 4, 1927, payable one day after date, in the amount of $9,945.17. Execution was issued and the sheriff\u2019s return is: \u201cLevied August 20th, 1927 upon the personal goods of the defendants at 6190 Eidge Avenue and afterwards to-wit on October 11, 1927, I sold the said personal property so levied upon for the sum of Two Thousand Nine Hundred Eighteen Dollars ($2,918.00).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Eothwell filed an answer to claimant\u2019s petition, averring that claimant had brought suit against Philip Kremer, Nathan Hoffman and E. McGinnis, trading as Belmont Drug Company, and in the Municipal Court of Philadelphia County, on July 14, 1927, obtained judgment for want of an affidavit of defense for the two weeks\u2019 wages now involved, and had in the statement of claim filed in that action, averred that he was employed in the capacity of manager of the store of the defendant located at 6190 Eidge Avenue, Philadelphia. He also averred that in consequence of- that judgment, claimant was \u201cestopped and concluded ......\u201d to claim that he earned the wages now claimed as wages in the capacity of clerk, and that on the contrary it appeared that the sum earned by him was earned as salary for services as manager. In addition, he averred that claimant was not entitled to preference in the proceeds of the sale of the property of Philip P. Kremer and Nathan Hoffman for a debt \u201cadjudicated to have been owed by different partnership, to-wit: Philip Kremer, Nathan Hoffman and E. McGinnis, trading as Belmont Drug Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In the record as printed there is a deposition of the claimant and a stipulation that the record mentioned above, of the judgment obtained in the Municipal Court, should be considered in evidence in disposing of the petition for the preference. We observe that the depositions are not in the original record and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>does not appear that they have ever been filed as required by the Act of April 18, 1919, P. L. 72. As appellee has made no objection to our considering the deposition as though it had been filed, we have examined it.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The court below held that upon two grounds claimant was not entitled to preference: 1. If the plaintiff \u201cwere employed as manager, he does not belong to any of the classes fixed by the several Acts of Assembly giving priority to the claims for wages.\u201d In his deposition, claimant testified a's follows: \u201cQ. What were your duties? A. Just filling prescriptions and taking care of the business. Q. Waiting on the business? A. Yes. Q. What were your hours? A. 8 in the morning until 11 at night. Q. Was any one of the partners there? A. In and out all day long.\u201d In view of that uncontradieted evidence, we differ from the court below and are of opinion that claimant would be within the preferred class created by the statutes, if the fund were within the class out of which a preference is payable; see Scull\u2019s Appeal, 15 Pa. 141, in which the superintendent of a factory was held entitled to a preference for his 'salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">. 2. The court below was also against the claim on the ground that the proceeds were not realized from the sale of the assets of the partnership, the Belmont Drug Company \u2014 but of the property of two individuals, Philip P. Kremer and Nathan Hoffman. We are in accord with that view, for there is no evidence in the case that any property of the partnership, Belmont Drug Company, was sold. Wage earners employed by the partnership may claim on the proceeds of partnership assets, but not, in the first instance, on the proceeds of the sale of property of individuals who may happen to be members of a firm or firms: Ward\u2019s Appeal, 81* 270, 273; Hartman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Appeal, 107 Pa. 327, 335. The answer gave notice of this objection and claimant had an opportunity to produce testimony. On the record he has not shown himself entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
