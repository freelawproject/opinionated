Superior Ct. 518 and 521. We need not repeat what is there said by this court and in the adjudication of the Orphans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Court set forth at page 522, etc., in construing the will and codicils. In the first appeal we agreed with the court below in bolding that on the death of testator\u2019s sister Mary, one-half of the income from her original share was payable by the trustee to testator\u2019s brothers and sisters, who survived Mary, and the other half to Mary\u2019s son, F. Percy Yail, whose share in the income payable to Mary under the will as originally drawn, was reduced to one-half by the first codicil. In the other appeal we also affirmed the conclusion that by the third codicil there was an implication that on the death of Charles, his children were to be benefited only to the extent of the legacies specified in that codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The present appeal comes from another adjudication \u2014 that on the account of the trust for the sisters Eudora and Cynthia (see 87 Pa. Superior Ct. 524). Of the five brothers and sisters only two now survive, George and Cynthia; Mary\u2019s son, F. Percy Yail survives andclaims all of the income released byEudora\u2019s death, which his mother had been receiving after Eudora\u2019s death; George and Cynthia contend that they are entitled to one-half of it on the theory that the first codicil reducing by one-half the share F. Percy Yail would have taken by the original will, applies to such portion's of income as may be released by the death of one for distribution among surviving brothers and sisters. \u201cThe rule is well established that a codicil shall not disturb the dispositions of the original will further than is absolutely necessary'for the purposes of giving it effect\u201d: Schattenberg\u2019s Est., 269 Pa. 90, 93; Yernier\u2019s Est., 282 Pa. 194, 198. Applying that rule to testator\u2019s will and codicils when it was sought to exclude George from participating in the income released by the death of Eudora, Judge Gest said in one of the adjudications below: \u201cNow in his will the testator contemplated equality of interest in his residuary estate among his five brothers and sisters, but gave Charles his share absolutely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>while he gave the \u2018shares\u2019 of George and the three sisters in trust during the life of the survivor \u2018of all his brothers and sisters,\u2019 and the income of one dying without issue was to be paid among all his brothers and sisters then living or their issue, etc., while, on the termination of the trust, the principal was to be divided among the desqenclents of George and the sisters, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u201cThe first codicil of January 4, 1909, altered the trust as to the \u2018share\u2019 of Mary O. Vail; the second codicil of December 7, 1909, made the change noted as to the \u2018share\u2019 of George V. Onderdonk, and the third codicil, of November 10, 1914, \u2018revoked and cancelled\u2019 the estate given to Charles S. Onderdonk, and gave his \u2018share\u2019 in trust for him, subject to the trusts relating to the sisters and George V. Onderdonk, with remainders over at his death. What the testator did therefor by the second codicil was to give in trust for George V. Onderdonk, not a one-fifth interest in the residuary trust estate, but $15,000 \u2018to be held in trust under all the terms and conditions set forth in the trusts contained in the will,\u2019 but the terms and conditions of the trust for Eudora and Cynthia, however, were not changed by the codicil, which reduced the interest of George to a flat $15,000 instead of a one-fifth of the entire residue. These provisions, were, on the contrary, \u2018ratified, confirmed and republished in every particular\u2019 by the third codicil, and I therefore can see no just reason for excluding him [George] from participating in the income released by the death of Eudora without issue. Indeed, in the last codicil, which makes a very similar direction in reference to Charles\u2019 share, this portion is given to the tru'stee in trust for Charles, and the testator significantly adds, \u2018under and subject to all terms and conditions set forth in the trusts contained in my will relative to my sisters and George V. Onderdonk,\u2019 and this codicil was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>written after the second codicil revoked George\u2019s \u2018share\u2019 of the residuary estate and substituted the $15,000 trust for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u201cI therefore hold that the income released after the death of Eudora, namely one-half of the income of the present trust estate held for her benefit and that of Cynthia, should be awarded ........ one-fourth in trust for Charles S. Onderdonk; one-fourth in trust for George V. Onderdonk; one-fourth in trust for Mary O. Vail and one-fourth in trust for Cynthia O. Hunt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The same process of reasoning leads to the conclusion reached below in the adjudication now before us that the only purpose of thg first codicil was to deprive Mary\u2019s child, F. Percy Vail, of one-half the original share theretofore given in the will; that the scope of the codicil in question will not be extended beyond what it clearly states; and that F. Percy Vail is therefore entitled to the share of his mother\u2019s income from Eudora\u2019s share of principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The decree is affirmed, at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-9\">Keller, and Gawthrop, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
