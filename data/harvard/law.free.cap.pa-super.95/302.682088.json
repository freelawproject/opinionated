Levenight, Appeal of Ney and Fitzkee.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Submitted November 12, 1928.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Adf\">Before Henderson, Trexler, Keller, Linn, Gawthrop and Cunningham, JJ.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-8\"><em>Charles E. Workman, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkY\">The administrator\u2019s acts bring him within the terms of the Act of 1917, providing for the discharge of administrators for mismanagement of the estate: McCullough\u2019s Est., <em>292 </em>Pa. 422; Witmer\u2019s Est., 41 Lancaster Law Review 182; Miller\u2019s Est., 264 Pa. 310; Kellberg\u2019s Est., 86 Pa. 129; Kaurene\u2019s Est., 3 D. &amp; C.

Charles, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AYx\">Dismissal of the petition for discharge of administrator was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion: Stambaugh\u2019s Est., 246 Pa. 555; Parson\u2019s Est., 82 Pa. 465.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ALk\">January 25, 1929:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A2DR\">Gawthrop, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">The sole question raised by this appeal is whether the court below erred in refusing to discharge the administrator, husband of the deceased, on the petition of her collateral heirs. It must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">The petition alleged that the administrator' failed to charge himself; in his account with all the money that earn'd dr should havfe edmd i-ntd his hands; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>claimed improper credits therein; and that he has not paid the collateral inheritance tax assessed. There was no allegation and no proof that the inventory of the personal estate filed was not correct and true. He converted the assets of the estate and filed his account, in which he charged himself with the amount of the inventory, and the same was advertised to be called for an audit to be held on April 16,1928. The petition to discharge was filed April 12,1928. The only proofs presented to support the averment's in the petition were that the administrator had withdrawn from his bank deposit as administrator a substantial amount of cash and used it. He testified that he was \u201cin a position to make good\u201d whatever he owed the estate. There was no proof that there were any assets concealed or not included in the inventory filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Conceding, but not deciding, that the admitted delinquencies of the administrator bring him within the terms of Sec. 53 of the Act of 1917, P. L. 447, giving the orphans\u2019 court having the jurisdiction of accounts of administrators power to remove an administrator when he is wasting or mismanaging the estate under his charge, or when he neglects to render a full and just account of the estate or property coming into his hands, or when for any reason the interests of the estate or property are likely to be jeopardized by the continuance of such fiduciary, we are of opinion that the discharge of the rule was not an abuse of the discretion lodged with the orphans\u2019 court. Unless there was an abuse of discretion, the decree is conclusive: Stambaugh\u2019s Estate, 246 Pa. 555. We agree with the court below that in the circumstances \u201cit would serve no useful purpose to now discharge him (the administrator) or vacate the letters and set aside all subsequent proceedings. Even if the prayers of the petitioners were granted, it would still be necessary for him to account for his administration of the estate as far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>he has gone, as an administrator de son tort.\u201d The appeal is void of merit and has merely caused delay in the settlement of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
