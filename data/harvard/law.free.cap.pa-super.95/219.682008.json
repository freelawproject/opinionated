Hogg, 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 419, 420. In this we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">. The defendant\u2019s property was three stories high in front. The plaintiff leased only the first floor, as a bowling alley. At the rear the property was only one story high, so that this part of plaintiff\u2019s leasehold was next to the roof; but the defendant had constructed on the roof of this portion of the building a walk for use by the tenants of the second and third floors of the front portion of the building to secure supplies from the rear. The verdict of the jury is conclusive that the roof of the one-storv part of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ant\u2019s building did not pass to plaintiff as part of the pleased premises but remained under the dominion and control of the defendant. The clause in the lease, that \u201call <em>inside </em>changes and repairs are to be made by the lessees and at their own expense in the future,\u201d is consistent with this finding. The duty of keeping the roof of the entire premises in repair thus rested on the defendant; none of it appertained to the plaintiff in connection with its lease; and defendant recognized her duty in this respect by numerous promises to repair the roof, so as to prevent damage to plaintiff\u2019s bowling alley. Her failure to perform this duty, thus recognized, rendered her liable, under the authority of Minor v. Hogg, supra, for the plaintiff\u2019s resulting damage. Along somewhat similar lines, see Sloan v. Hirsch, 283 Pa. 230; Lewin v. Pauli, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 447, 451; Koplo <em>&amp; </em>Koplo v. Ettenger, 84 Pa. Superior Ct. 358, 361; Will v. Knoblauch, 92 Pa. Superior Ct. 537, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
