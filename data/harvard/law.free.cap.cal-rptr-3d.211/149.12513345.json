(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1161a, subd. (b)(3) [\"Where the property has been sold in accordance with Section 2924 of the Civil Code, under a power of sale contained in a deed of trust executed by such person, or a person under whom such person claims,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the title under the sale has been duly perfected.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Italics added.) ].)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   It has long been recognized that the unlawful detainer statutes are to be strictly construed and that relief not statutorily authorized may not be given due to the summary nature of the proceedings. [Citation.]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The remedy of unlawful detainer is a summary proceeding to determine the right to possession of real property. Since it is purely statutory in nature, it is essential that a party seeking the remedy bring himself clearly within the statute.

Respondent's interpretation, on the other hand, would suggest that a post-foreclosure plaintiff could routinely prematurely issue a three-day notice that includes legal and factual misstatements (e.g., that the purchaser has already duly perfected title when it had not yet done so). And as argued by Appellant, such a practice would practically prevent a defendant from effectively verifying the identity of the alleged purchaser of a property as a search of recorded documents would prove futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Absent a sale in accordance with Section 2924 of the Civil Code\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a duly perfected title prior to the issuance of the notice, a post-foreclosure purchaser cannot avail itself of a summary unlawful detainer eviction proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Respondent's prematurely issued notice was fatally defective, and the unlawful detainer judgment must be reversed.
