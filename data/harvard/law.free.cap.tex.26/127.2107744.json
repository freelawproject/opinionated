R., 164. Tiie cause being then remanded to the district court, the plaintiff amended his petition, making S. Hare a party defendant, and alleging that Hare was an attorney, and that when plaintiff Talk and defendant Austin were adjusting the settlement of damages, he, Talk, consulted Hare for legal advice on the subject; that Hare advised him that his only recourse was upon Hash &amp; Co., the shippers at Port Lavaca, and that he had better execute the receipt for his freight money to Austin and settle with him for the damages, and that then he, Talk, could go on Hash &amp; Co. for the freight money and for the damages so settled with Austin; and that Hare thereupon Wrote out the statement signed by himself, Austin and others. That this advice and these representations made by Hare, as also by Austin, were fraudulent and false, and that plaintiff was induced by them to execute the receipt to Austin for the freight money; that at that very time Hare was a secret partner of Austin to the extent of \"one-third interest, and was thus liable to plaintiff for the freight money, which fact he fraudulently concealed from the plaintiff When he induced him to execute the receipt to Austin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">Hare adopted as his answers those already filed by his co-defendant Austin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-8\">The fourth instruction given to the jury, commented upon in the opinion, is as follows: \u201cFraud is not to be presumed, but must be proved; but if the jury believe from the evidence that Talk, being in doubt and uncertainty as to what he should do, applied to defendant Hare as an attorney-at-law for advice, and that said Hare acted as his attorney, counseled with him, and did not disclose to Talk that he was Austin\u2019s co-partner and interested in the goods, this would be a fraud upon the part of Hare, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>would release Talk from his settlement made with Austin under the advice of Hare; and the court charges that if the jury believe from the evidence such to be the facts, they will find for Talk the amount due him with\u2019 interest at 8 per cent, since the goods were delivered, provided they shall further believe that the goods were damaged before Talk receipted for them to E. Nash &amp; Co. at Port Lavaca.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">It was admitted by defendants that at the time of the delivery of the goods, Hare was a practising attorney-at-law in Belton, keeping his office near Austin\u2019s store, and that he was then also a partner of Austin and liable for one-third of the freight upon the goods. It was further admitted that Hare wrote the statement with regard to the condition of the goods, signed by himself, Austin and others, and gave the statement to Talk to show to E. Nash &amp; Co. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">Verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $242 37.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak5k\">Since this case was before us on a former appeal, (20 Tex. R., 164,) the plaintiff has amended his petition, making a nerv party and charging specifically and sufficiently the facts constituting the alleged fraud in procuring the settlement .\u00bf\u00a1and receipt for freight, which the plaintiff seeks to avoid in order to enable him to recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The fact that there have been several concurring verdicts, should, I think, strongly incline this court against disturbing the present, if it is to be regarded as a finding of the jury upon the evidence, uninfluenced and unbiased by the instructions given by the court. Upon a question of positive fraud, the court will be very slow to disturb the verdict of a jury where the evidence discloses suspicious circumstances of a character to induce the belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that any artifice, concealment or misrepresentation, has been practiced, or that confidence reposed has been abused to the prejudice of the party complaining. The relation of attorney and client, if shown to exist, would authorize the court and jury, in a case like the present, to scan the transaction between the parties with severe scrutiny. But especially where the question of fraud in fact rests upon circumstantial and inconclusive evidence, it is essential that the finding of the jury upon the evidence be wholly uninfluenced by anything contained in the charge of the court. And we cannot say that such has been the case in' this instance. We think the case more strongly put for the plaintiff than the evidence warranted, in the fourth instruction given by the court. In the abstract, we do not doubt the correctness of the charge in point of law, nor' do we doubt its correctness upon the state of facts supposed by the charge; but we think the charge calculated to induce the jury too readily to adopt the conclusions of facts supposed, without sufficiently considering whether there was evidence to warrant the adoption of all those conclusions. We think there is reason to apprehend that the jury may have been misled by this charge. There is reason to believe the finding of the jury was induced by their opinion of the agency of the new party upon the record in bringing about the settlement sought to be avoided. The evidence upon that point was certainly very inconclusive. This, it is to be observed, is the first verdict since the new party was made; and in view of the character of the evidence, and the charge of the court upon it, we incline to think a new trial ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">To support a recovery by the plaintiff in this case, he ought to, satisfy the jury by competent evidence that the goods were damaged before they came into his possession; and that when he made the settlement and gave the receipt for freight, he acted in ignorance or under a mistake of fact; or that he was induced or influenced thereto by some imposition practiced upon him by one or both of the defendants; that some artifice was used, or there was some misrepresentation, concealment, or suppression of some fact which it was material for the plaintiff to knowj a knowledge of which might have caused him to act differently. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>We are of opinion that the judgment he reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
