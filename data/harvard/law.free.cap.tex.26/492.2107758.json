McGown.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-14\">The plaintiff set forth in his petition that he and defendant, McGown, had been partners in the publication of a newspaper styled the \u201c Union Advocate \u201d in the \u201c Presbyterian \u201d office, then belonging to McGown; that plaintiff sold all his right, title and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>interest in the Advocate to the defendants as co-partners, Who o\u00f1 settlement were indebted to him in the sum of $&gt;280 42, for which they executed their written instrument, above set out; and that the defendants, though often requested, had refused to allow the plaintiff any claims, or to make any arrangements whereby he could collect his said debt, and have refused to pay the sam\u00e9 oi* any part thereof. Wherefore, p\u00ed\u00e1ys for judgment for the said sum and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-4\">Both defendants were served with process, but Davies made n\u00f3 appearance or defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The defendant, MoGoWn, answered with a general denial, and, also, answered specially, under oath, denying that he ever was \u00e1 partner of the plaintiff, alleging that he had simply allowed the plaintiff the use of his printing office, types, &amp;c., for the publication of the Advocate at the plaintiff's own expense; that if plaintiff made any profits in the publication of the Advocate, he was to pay half of them to this defendant; that if plaintiff made no profits, defendant was to receive no pay. Denies that he ever purchased any interest in the Advocate from the plaintiff, or that h\u00e9 and his co-defendant, Davies, were partners, either in the purchase of the Advocate from the plaintiff, o\u00ed in its publication. Alleges that on the settlement referred to by the plaintiff, the lattei claimed to be loser of about two hundred and eighty dollars in the publication of the Advocate, and, in consequence, this defendant released him, as he had agreed to do, from all charges for the use of the office, type, ko.; ahd averred that the written instrument sued on was only intended by plaintiff and this defendant as evidence that defendant did hot and would not charge the' plaintiff anything for the use of the office, &amp;d., and was intended for no other purpose, so far as this defendant Was concerned. Further alleges that said instrument was not intended to evidence any indebtedness to plaintiff from this defendant, but was intended td operate and apply only between plaintiff and Davies, on an arrangement or contract between them in relation to the said Union Advocate paper. That if said written instrument be construed to affect this defendant further than as a release, the sam\u00e9, except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>a release, is wholly without consideration, and void as to this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-5\">The plaintiff amended his petition by striking out the allegation that the defendants were partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">At the Spring Term, 1857, there was a mistrial, in consequence of disagreement of the jury. Thereupon the plaintiff propounded interrogatories to the defendant, Davies, for the purpose of establishing by his answers the allegations of the' petition. Notice, with a copy of the interrogatories, was served on the attorney of defendant, McGoWn, and the plaintiff sued out a Commission to the Chief justice, district clerk, or any notary public of Leon cotinty, to take the answers of Davies. The commission wad executed and returned with the answers of Davies, certified in the usual form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-7\">The defendant, McGown, filed no cross-interrogatories to Davies, but on the trial at the ensuing term of the court, moved to strike Davies\u2019 answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories from the file, assigning for cause, 1st, that they were not taken in pursuance of law, because DaVies was not a competent witness against Ms co-defendant; 3d, because the testimony of one defendant is not admissible against another in this manner; and 4th, because his co-defendant\u2019s testimony is not admissible against this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-8\">The court overruled the motion, and permitted the answers to go to the jul*y as evidence for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-9\">\u2022 The court instructed the jury to the effect Set out in the syllabus. There was verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $292 82. McGown moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment; both of which motions w\u00e9rO overruled, and McGown appealed. ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-10\"><em>Leigh \u00e9f Bdlc\u00e9r, </em>for plaintiff in erro?,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcP\">in the rulings \u00a9\u00a3 the eourt below, there is ePror; 1st, because the aHsWerS of Davies Were not taken in accordance with laW. And here the question arises, by What authority, or under what kw, cOuld the plaintiff Sue out a Commission authorizing the officer to Whom it was directed to Compel the defendant, Davies, to come before him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>answer the interrogatories propounded ? We answer, that there is no law to authorize such a proceeding. The means by which either party to a civil suit may obtain the testimony of the other are clearly set forth in article 735 of Hartley\u2019s Digest, and under that statute no party could be compelled to testify either for or against himself. And there is but one penalty affixed to the neglect or failure of, the' party to answer, atid that is that the facts about which he has b\u00e9en interrogated shall be taken for confessed, But in this case the plaintiff was not content with this penalty. The defendant, Davies, Was forced upon the stand, and made to testify, and his testimotiy was held to be legal and Competent, both against hiniself and against Mt\u00edDown. But, again: Is it contemplated by this statute that the answers of one' should be' evidence against all the defendants ? We think not; for if such be the case, the neglect or failure of the one interrogated to answer,- would be construed into a Confession of the fact by all of the\u2019 defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">Di interpreting a staitite,.we are required to consider all of its-parts in order to enable us to come to a proper conclusion as to the intent of the language and the?-meaning of the law; and surely it will not be contended that the neglect of one' defendant to answer Would be\u2018 a confession of all the defendants. But such Would be the case,- if the answer erf One were binding evidence tipoit all. But the truth is-, the statute never contemplated the filing of interrogatories to one' of the plaintiffs or one of the* defendants. Such is not the meaning of intent, and to prove this5 let uS refer to the article 785 itself. What Says' it ? That either party to a civil suit, &amp;c., (not one of either party',) may propounds Written interrogatories to the' other, (not to dhe' of the other party.-) Then it is clear, at least to our minds, that the' plaintiff in the Court beloW should have propounded his' interrogatories to both of the defendants, \u00e1nd that he1 had no right uiider the statute to pfopou\u00f1d to one. At any rate', the ahswdrS to interrogatories thus propounded ealffiot be evidence against the other defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">2. The defetidant, Davies, is not a Competent wittiest against McG\u00f3wh. This position We think tenable\" upon the ground of interest, Already had Davies permitted one court to pass',- after M <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u25a0had been duly cited, before interrogatories were propounded t'b him. It is true, that he had not been condemned to pay the Amount of -the instrument sued, on; but he had failed to answer, Und was subject to judgment by default, and he might well haV6 argued, that whatever amount there may be, it would be well foi\u2018 him to tlix-ide the responsibility.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-4\"><em>A. P. Wiley </em>and <em>A. </em>Middleton, for the defendant in err\u00f3r.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b504-5\">Wheeler, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdN\">We are of opinion that the court did not err in the instructions to the jury as to the legal interpretation of the contract and undertaking on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We think it competent for the plaintiff to propound interroga-1 tories to one only of several defendants under the statute. He inay be willing to make one of them &amp; witness to testify against his interest, when he -would not another, or one of them may be cognizant of the facts, and the other not. The ansxverS of the d\u00e9-1 fend\u00e1nt appear to have been taken i\u00f1 conformity to the Statute, (Hart. Dig., 735, 739.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The only remaining question Which seems to require notice iS Whether the answers of the defendant, Daffies, were admissible against Ms co-defendant. And We are of opinion that they were, &amp;nd entitled to the s'ame weight \u00e1s the testimony of any other Witness. He xvas not incompetent merely because a party to the ^record. (Parsons v. Phipps, 4 Tex. R., 341.) He xvas not disqualified by his interest, because it Was adverse to the party calling him, and in favor of the party dbjecting 'to Ms deposition. (Id.; Tucker v. Willis, 24 Tex. R., 247; Gill v. Campbell, Id., 405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The objection that hiS Co-defendant did not hav\u00e9 the opportunity to cross-examine, w\u00e9 d\u00f3 not think well founded in fact. The requisite notice was gixmn of the taking of the deposition of the Witness, and the appellant might have propounded interrogatories if he had seen proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Wh are Of opinion that there is no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
