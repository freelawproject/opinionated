Tried below before the Hon. A. W. Terrell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">This suit was instituted by B. D. Flack in his lifetime against the appellee, upon the promissory note of the latter for the sum Of $416 52, dated February 12th, 1853, and due the 1st of January, 1854. B. D. Flack having died, the suit proceeded in the name of his administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">Besides a general denial, the defendant pleaded specially that the note was obtained from him by the false and fraudulent representations of B. D. Flack. The defendant, in 1844, was appointed administrator upon the estate of Charles S. Smith, deceased, and in 1845 closed the administration and was regularly discharged by the County Court. The fraudulent representations' relied on were, in substance, that at the time the note was executed, Flack falsely stated to Neill, who was an ignorant and illiterate man, that he held a valid and subsisting claim against Smith\u2019s estate, which had been allowed by an administrator who preceded Neill, and had been properly approved by the Chief Justice of the County Court; and that in closing his administration without settling this claim, he (Neill) had become legally responsible for the same in his individual capacity; and that unless he, the defendant, would execute his note for the debt, he, Flack, would sue and break him up. The defendant\u2019s answers averred that these representations were wholly false and fraudulent, and that by means of them and the accompanying threat, he was induced to execute the note sued on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-9\">On the trial the defendant offered in evidence a deposition of B. A. Butherford, for the purpose of proving statements made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Flack to the witness, with regard to the consideration of the note and the manner in which it had been obtained from the defendant. In response to an appropriate interrogatory, the witness answered ; <em>\u201c </em>Flack told me it (the note) was given for a debt himself and some one else, a partner in merchandise, had against the estate of one Charles S. Smith; that he had managed Neill Well to get it, or something to that effect. Before the note was executed, Flack had told me of a claim he had against said estate, and stated that he thought he could scare Neill into executing to him his individual note for the debt. After he had succeeded in getting it, and when he exhibited it to me, as before stated, he exulted over his success; he said he not only threatened Mm with a suit, but that he had misrepresented the facts to Mm, Neill. Flack said at first he was under the impression that his claim was properly-proved up, or a good claim Against the estate, but he was after-wards informed that there was some defect about it. \u2022 He stated to me that he had made Neill <em>believe </em>he was liable, because his debt was a good outstanding claim against said estate, he, Neill, hating been the administrator of the same, and neglecting \"to pay it. I understood him that he had imposed upon Neill in this; that he had told him, Neill, that his claim was good against said estate.? and he, Neill, was consequently liable, when he, Flack, had been informed to the contrary.\u201d From other portions of Rutherford's* evidence, it appeared that he was an attorney-at-law, and had once-been employed in that capacity by Flack, previous to the conversation of which he testified; but he denied that he was Flack's attorney with respect, to the claim upon Smith's estate or the note of Neill, although Flaolc asked his opinion about whether it could be collected, for which he neither received or charged a fee. This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, but admitted by the1 court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">There was verdict and judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-6\">C.

If the character of the attorney, as such, formed the basis of the communication, then it is privileged. (Chirac v.

A. Rutherford. The plaintiff objected to the admission of so much of one of the depositions of the witness Rutherford as stated the terms of a conversation between himself and the deceased, R. D. Flack, in relation to the note sued on, and the manner in which the said Flack procured the execution of the note by the defendant, Neill, upon the ground that the communications made to Rutherford by Flack were privileged communications, made by Flack to Rutherford, in his character of an attorney-at-law. A communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>cation cannot be considered as privileged, because made in professional confidence, unless the person to whom it is made is acting for the time being in the character of legal adviser of the person who makes it. The communication must also he made for the purpose of obtaining professional advice or aid in the matter to which the communication relates. (1 Grreenleaf\u2019s Evid., sec. 239 and 240.) Tested by these rules, we are of opinion that the communication in question in this case cannot be considered as privileged. It does not seem to have been made for the purpose of obtaining professional advice. The most important part of it, in its bearing upon this- case, was made after the note was executed by Neill, and seems to have been a voluntary narrative of the circumstances attending a past transaction. Nor is it shown that Rutherford was the legal adviser of Flack at the time the conversation to which Rutherford testifies transpired between them. It was for the jury to attach that weight they thought proper to the testimony of the witness, and we think the court below did not err in refusing to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
