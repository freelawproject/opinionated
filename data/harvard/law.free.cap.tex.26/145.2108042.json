The State.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b153-9\">A jury room forming part of a courthouse is a public place within the contemplation of law, and the fact that it is occupied and appropriated hy a particular citizen as a sleeping apartment will not make it a private place, or deprive it of its public character, unless such occupancy is by permission derived from the County Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b153-10\">Permission for such an occupancy obtained from the Sheriff and one of the County Commissioners would not suffice to divest the jury room of its public character.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b153-11\">On an indictment for playing cards in a public place, it is not incumbent on the State to prove that anything was bet or dependent on the game.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b153-12\">To entitle the defendant to an acquittal, he must prove affirmatively that nothing was bet or dependent upon the result of the game.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b153-13\">Appeal from Guadalupe.

Terrell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-14\">The appellant and two other persons were indicted for playing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201c at a game of cards at a public house, to wit, in the courthouse of said county, upon which game played as aforesaid money was bet.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">It appeared from the evidence that the gamo was played in one of the jury rooms of the courthouse, which was occupied, when, court was not in session, as a sleeping apartment by a person who had obtained the permission of the Sheriff and one of the County Commissioners so to occupy it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">The Court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIf the evidence shows that the defendant-within twelve months before the date of the finding of the indictment in this cause, played in a public house, as charged, at a game of cards, he would be guilty without the necessity of showing that anything was bet upon the game. If the defendant played in the public house as charged, he would be guilty unless the evidence shows affirmatively that nothing was bet or dependent on the result of the game. A jury room forming part of the courthouse is a public place in contemplation of law, and the fact that it is occupied and appropriated by a particular citizen as a sleeping apartment will not make it a private place, or deprive it of its public character, unless such occupancy is by permission derived from the County Court.
