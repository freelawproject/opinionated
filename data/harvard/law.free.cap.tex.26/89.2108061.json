They alleged in their petition \u201cthat the only consideration which the said William Norris and Bebecca, his wife, had received from said Tarrant county for said donation, was the location of the county site upon the same,\u201d and prayed that the title to so much of the land as had not been alienated by the county might be decreed to them and the other heirs of I^illiam Norris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The defendant demurred and answered with a general denial, .and for further answer alleged that the donation was an absolute gift.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">There was verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed in behalf of the county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>John J. </em>Good, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-7\"><em>J.

It is well settled that <em>\u201c </em>where the whole of the estate is conveyed or devised, but for particular objects and purposes, and those objects or purposes by accident or otherwise fail, a resulting trust will arise for the benefit of the grantor, &amp;c. (2 Story, 634; 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 307, 4th ed.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-8\">This in substance was the charge of the court. The conveyance in this case was regarded, not as <em>conditional </em>as argued by appellant\u2019s counsel, but as an absolute conveyance for a particular purpose, which purpose having failed, a trust is raised in favor of the grantors, and the conveyance was subject to be defeated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-9\">2d. The verdict of the jury is sustained by the evidence, at least sufficiently so as not to authorize a reversal. The object of this grant-was clearly for the purposes of a county seat, and for no other purpose. The term \u201c or for what other use the county may see proper to convert the same,\u201d evidently was intended to mean <em>uses </em>pertaining to a county seat. No other uses could have been contemplated. All this, however, was peculiarly within the province of a jury, selected from the county and who were conversant with the facts, to decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">The county has abandoned the property for all county purposes, and equity will decree a return of the unappropriated land to the donors.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b98-11\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARu\">It is unnecessary to notice the uncertainty of the petition, verdict and decree, in ascertaining the particular parts of the land sought to be recovered, as the important question arising upon the deed of donation must determine the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">There will be a \u201c resulting trust when the purposes for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>an estate has been conveyed fail, by accident or otherwise, either in whole or in part, or if a surplus remains after the purposes of the trust are satisfied.\u201d (4 Kent\u2019s Com., 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">This is the principle which is invoked to sustain the verdict and judgment in this case. But an examination of the deed will show that it is not applicable. The deed donates the land to \u201c the county of Tarrant \u201d\u2014\u201c to have and to hold the same forever for a town site, on which the town of Birdville, the county seat of Tarrant county, is now located, <em>or for what other use the county may see proper to convert the same.'1'1 Now </em>the fact that the county seat of Tarrant county remained at Birdville for several years, and was afterwards removed six miles to Fort Worth, does not raise a resulting trust in favor of the donors for that part of this tract which remains unsold in lots by the county. For as to the streets and public squares that may have been dedicated in the plan of the town, the lot holders as well as the public may have an interest. (Campbell County Court v. Town of Newport, 12 B. Monroe\u2019s R., 538.) And as to the balance, the county has a right, under the express terms of the deed, to convert it to what use it may see proper. . A distinction must be taken between the use declared in the deed and the motive or consideration which prompted the donation. The latter may have in whole-or in part failed, but the former has not. Being a donation, there was no legal consideration, and therefore there could be no failure of consideration. The motive of the donors may have been the enhanced price in the sale of their adjoining lands. They may have realized that, while the town remained at Birdville, or they may not. That is a consideration speculative in its nature, and not a legal consideration, upon which the deed was based; and therefore no consideration in law at all. The county is not bound by contract to continue its county seat at one place, with persons who make donations for the benefit of the county seat. And if in any case it should lose the right to retain land donated, upon its removal, it would not be upon the principle of a breach of contract, which would authorize a recision; but it would be on account of receiving a donation of land limited to a particular use or purpose which had failed.

Bd. of Coms., 4 Blackf., 218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>We are of opinion that this deed was an absolute donation for any use, and that a removal of the county seat did not give appellees a right to recover the land back.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">' Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Wheeler, C J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
