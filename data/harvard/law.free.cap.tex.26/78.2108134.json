Thomas J. Devine,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This action was brought by Barrera an'd wife as administrators Of Jose Maria Salmas, deceased, against John 0. Hays and Samuel Calvert, for the recovery of two leagues and two labors of land in Bexar county, which, as the plaintiffs allege, were originally granted to their said intestate, but to which, they charge, the defendants pretend title under execution sale made under a pretended judgment obtained by one J. M. Vann against their intestate in the year 1889, which judgment they aver to be fraudulent and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">The defendants first pleaded in abatement, \u201c that the plaintiffs ought not to have or maintain their said suit for this, that the parties\u2019 or plaintiffs\u2019 intestate are and were aliens to the State of Texas, and that the heirs of the plaintiffs\u2019 intestate, for whose benefit this suit is brought, are and ever have been aliens to the State of Texas, and are and ever have been citizens of the Republic of Mexico.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">The issue under this plea being submitted, to a jury, the court charged that, <em>\u201c </em>if you believe from the evidence that the wife of Barrera is the sister of the deceased Salinas, and that she is a resident or citizen of Texas, or that Salinas was living in Texas in June, 1836, you will find against the plea in abatement;\u201d which charge is assigned by the appellants for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">\"Upon the merits, the defendants pleaded the statutes of limitation of three, five, and ten years, and set up title in themselves by purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale under execution issued upon the judgment in favor of Vann against Salinas, already referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">With reference to the statutes of limitation, the evidence showed that the defendants, by a tenant, had been in actual possession of a small part of the land, paying taxes thereon, for a period sufficient to constitute a bar; and that the plaintiffs, before the bar was complete, went into possession, by their tenants, of other portions of the land. The defendants asked the court to charge the jury, <em>\u201c </em>that the possession of Hays was uninterrupted until suit brought by the plaintiff;\u201d which the court gave, with the modification, <em>\u201c </em>only so far as a possession by plaintiffs might cut down or limit his right to recover to the bounds of his improvements or actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>possession.\u201d The modification of the charge thus given is also assigned by the appellants as error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-4\">The judgment under which defendants set up title was rendered by the District Court of Bexar county, at the October term, 1839, upon a proceeding styled a \u201cbill of injunction,\u201d instituted by \u201c Samuel Williams, attorney for J. M. Vann, against Jose Maria Salinas,\u201d in which it was alleged that Salinas was a non-resident of the State of Texas, and citation by publication therefore prayed and ordered. There was no attachment sued out, no curator appointed, nor was the mode of citation of non-residents provided by the decree of Coahuila and Texas, No. 277, of April 17th, 1834, pursued. The judgment upon this proceeding was excluded from the jury by the court below, and the jury were instructed that there was no judgment against Salinas before them; which is also assigned by appellants as error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">The issue under the plea in abatement was. found in favor of the plaintiff; and the verdict on the merits was also in their favor, \u201c with the exception of the patch enclosed and improved by Smith,\u201d (defendant\u2019s tenant,) \u201con the land, 5 acres.\u201d Judgment accordingly, from which defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-6\"><em>N.

The petition showed- that the land sued for was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to Salinas by the government, and the administrators of his estate Were bringing this suit for its recovery. It was therefore immarterial whether his heirs, for whose benefit the suit may have been brought, were aliens, resident in Mexico, or not. (White v. Sabariego, 23 Tex. R., 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The plea in abatement states what might be a good plea if it did not appear in the petition that the land sued for was granted to Salinas. A plea to be good must be shaped so as to constitute an answer to the material facts alleged in the petition. (Id., 246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The court did not err in rejecting the record of the judgment and sale of the land in the case of Vann v. Salinas, offered by appellants to make out a title. The petition in that case shows that both plaintiff and defendant were non-residents, and the only service was by publication, and no attachment was taken out. The attachment law of 1839 was then in force, and provided an ample remedy for the case where plaintiff and defendant were nonresidents. The mode of obtaining service in that \u25a0 suit did not comply with that law, nor did it conform to the practice under the Chambers\u2019 decree. No statute then authorized publication upon such a proceeding, and a plain remedy by attachment was open to the plaintiff. The judgment was therefore upon its face a nullity, and the court was correct in so treating it and excluding it from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The court did not err in qualifying the charge asked by appellants. The charge asked was, \u201c that the possession of Hays was uninterrupted until suit brought by the plaintiffs,\u201d which was qualified by adding, \u201c only so far as a possession by plaintiffs might cut down or limit his right to recover to the bounds of his improvements or actual possession.\u201d This was excepted to and assigned as error. Although it was shown that Hays had been in possession, by his tenant, under his deed, five years before the institution of the suit, it was also shown that before the expiration of such five years possession, appellees took and held possession through their tenant. In the case of Lessee of Clark et al. v. Courtney et al., the Supreme Court of the United States held, that \u201c where a person enters into land under a deed or title, his possession is construed to be co-extensive with his deed or title; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and although the deed or title may turn out to be defective or void, yet the true owner will be deemed to be disseized to the extent of the boundaries of such deed or title. This, however, is subject to some qualification. For, if the true owner be at the same time in possession of a part of the land, claiming title to the whole, then his seizure by construction of law extends to all the land, which is not in the actual possession and occupancy, by enclosure or otherwise, of the party so claiming under a defective deed or title.\u201d (5 Peters\u2019 U. S. R., 353.) This will suffice to sustain the correctness of the charge as qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">There being no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
