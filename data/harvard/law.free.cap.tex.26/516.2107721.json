D., the mother of the plaintiff, and soon afterwards separated from her; that subsequent to the separation the plaintiff was born, and the said S. and M. D., never again cohabited, but that M. D., the plaintiff\u2019s mother, cohabited with sundry other persons, and was generally profligate; that the land in controversy-was acquired by S., after his separation from M, D.; wherefore defendant says that the land was the sole property of S., and was subject to liis disposition by donation to the plaintiff and to defendant\u2019s intestate, according to the la- s of Texas in 1832. <em>Held, </em>that the matters set up by the ans\u00ab er had no legal significance, and that exceptions to it were properly sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-6\">According to the laws of\u2019Texas in 1832, a person who had a legitimate child could not adopt a stranger as his eo-beir with such child.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-7\">Under the same la\u00ab s, a person could only donate his property to the extent of one-fifth of his whole estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-8\">In 1832, the owner of a league of land in Texas donated by deed one undivided half thereof to his nephew, and the other half to his sole heir held, that the donation to his nephew, if not renounced, vas good, provided it did not exceed in value the one-fifth of the donor\u2019s entire estate; but if such donation did exceed in value the said one-fifth, then it was void foi the excess.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-10\">Where such a deed was impeached by the heir on the ground that \"it exceeded the proportion which the donor could give, and there was no evidence showing the proportion which the value of the donation bore to the whole estate of the donor, it was error to leave it to the jury to determine whether the donation w as excessive or not, and to refuse to instruct the jury that the burden was on the heir to show the excess.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-11\">An act of donation made in 1832 being proposed as evidence, it was proved that the judge before whom it was executed was dead, and his signature was proved.

Tried below before the Hon. M. P. Norton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">This was an action of trespass to try title, instituted originally, in Victoria county by the appellees against the appellant, for the recovery of a league of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-6\">The land in controversy was granted by the government of Coahuila and Texas to John B. Sideclc, by two different grants, one made in 1830 and the other in 1834. The plaintiffs claimed the whole of the league in virtue of the sole heirship of Louisa, the wife of E. G. Sevier, in whose joint names the suit was brought. The fact that she was the only child of Sideck was admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">The defendant appeared in the character of administratrix of Peter Teal, deceased, and answered, 1st, not guilty. 2nd. That Sideck, on the 15th of December, 1832, in good faith and for a valuable consideration alienated and donated the land in controversy to Peter Teal, the defendant\u2019s intestate, and to the plaintiff Louisa, and at the same time placed the said Peter Teal in possession of the land; that Teal accepted the land in good faith, and kept possession of the same for more than ten years next preceding the death of said Sideck, and while said Sideck was in the country, and that during said ten years Sideck made no demand of the land of her intestate, the said Teal;\u2014wherefore defendant pleads title to one undivided half of the land by the conveyance of December 15th, 1832, and by prescription. 3rd. That the land in controversy is part of the estate of John B. Sideck, owned by him in his lifetime; that said Sideck in his lifetime legitimatized and adopted as his son this defendant\u2019s intestate, the said Peter Teal, who was the nephew of said Sideck, and who was then known and recognized by the name of Peter Sideck; by which act of legitimation and adoption the said Peter Sideck, <em>alias </em>Peter Teal, became an heir at law of the said John B. Sideck, and as such was entitled, at the death of said John B., to a child\u2019s part of all the estate then owned by him; and defendant avers that her said intestate, up to the time of his death, was rightfully in possession of the said land, and that she, this defendant, is now rightfully in possession of the same as his representative. 4th. That in the year 1818 and for a short. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>time thereafter, the said John B. Sideck cohabited with one Mary Dill, from whom he separated, and after the separation the said Mary'became the mother of the said Louisa, one of the plaintiffs; that the said John B. Sideck and said Mary never again cohabited, but that Mary afterwards cohabited with one Villers, and also with one Nelson, and with oth\u00e9r persons, and was generally profligate in her manners; that the land in <em>controversy </em>was acquired after the separation, and that said Mary and said Sideck never cohabited thereafter; and so defendant avers that the said John B. Sideck was the sole owner of the whole of said acquired land, and was in law fully authorized to dispose of the same to the said Louisa and this defendant\u2019s intestate, in manner and form as aforesaid. That the plaintiffs have been in possession of a portion of the land for many years, and have sold a 'large portion of the same, and themselves, their vendees and tenants, have cut down the trees, &amp;c., to the great damage of the land. Wherefore the defendant prays judgment confirming her intestate\u2019s title to one-half of the land, and for partition by commissioners instructed to allot to the plaintiffs their half of the land to include the portion so sold and damaged by them, and to this defendant her portion to include her homestead, improvements, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">To all these answers, except that of not guilty, the plaintiffs excepted for insufficiency. The court sustained the exception to the fourth answer, above set out, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">The venue having been changed from Victoria county to Goliad county, the cause came to trial at the Fall Term, 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">As a portion of his evidence, the defendant offered the act of adoption and donation made by John B. Sideck on the 15th of December, 1832, and referred to in the opinion of the court. This instrument was executed before the constitutional alcalde and primary judge of the town of Goliad, and was also subscribed by two assisting witnesses. This instrument recited that John B. Sideck appeared, and having legitimatized for a son his nephew, Peter Sideck, was desirous of securing him in his inheritance, and proceeded to donate to him one-half of his league of .land, of his stock of cattle, horses, &amp;c., and the other half to his daughter Louisa.' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The defendant proved the identity of her intestate, Peter Teal, with the Peter Sideck named in this instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">In rebuttal, the plaintiff introduced a transcript from the records of the County Court of Refugio county, evidencing the inventory of the estate of John B. Sideck, returned to that court in 1845, by Peter Teal, defendant\u2019s intestate, as administrator. In this inventory, the league of land in controversy was returned by Teal, as the property of John B. Sideck\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">There was much other evidence on both sides; but as it bears no relevancy to the opinion of the court, it is not necessary to detail it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for nine-tenths of the land in controversy. The defendant moved for a new trial, which was refused, and she appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-8\"><em>A. H.

Owens, 15th Tex. R., 241, and authorities there referred to. Counsel contended that the act of adoption and donation executed by John B. Sideck on the 15th December, 1832, was a public or authentic act, and as such was \u2022evidence without proof of execution, and cited 1st Partidas, Tit. 18, L. 1, page 222; 1 Pothier Ob., top page 369, 371. That in donations <em>inter vivos, </em>a donor, under the Spanish law, was not restricted to one-fifth of his estate, cited 2 Partidas, Tit. 4, L. 1, page 643; 1 Domat, Tit. 10, see. 906, page 396. That there .were exceptions to the restrictions imposed on donors by that law, kcited 2 Paitidas, Tit. 4, L. 9, page 651; and that when there is but one child, its <em>legitime, </em>or legal portion, was but one-half of the estate of the ancestor, cited 2 Domat, pages 464, 465, and articles 3403 to 3406. That appellant was not estopped by the return of the land in the inventory of Sideck\u2019s estate, made by Teal in 1845, cited 1 Greenl. Ev., 244, note 4; Comstock\u2019s N. Y. Rep., 19; 19 Tex., 308.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-9\"><em>A. 8. Cunningham, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b527-10\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnY\">We are of opinion that the court below did not err - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>in sustaining the exception of the plaintiffs to the fourth plea of the defendant. The plea in question did not aver that any marriage ever existed between John B. Sideck and Mary Dill, but only alleged that they cohabited, and that after separation, the said Mary Dill cohabited with several other persons. These facts have no legal significance, and could not in any way affect the rights of the parties to this suit. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">It is true that it appears from the evidence that John B. Sideck and Mary Dill were lawfully married, but the court ruled upon the defendant\u2019s plea, before hearing the evidence, and upon exception to it as a plea. The defendant might, under the general issue, have shown the adulterous conduct of Sideck\u2019s wife, if to have done so would have availed him anything, but no such evidence was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We do not deem it necessary to express any definite opinion as to the effect of the adulterous and dissolute conduct of the wife- of John B. Sideck upon the rights of the plaintiff, Louisa.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We are of the opinion that the instrument which bears date- on the 15th day of December, A. D. 1832, executed by the alcalde and primary judge, Juan Jose Hernandez, is effectual as a gift by-John B. Sideck to Peter Teal of so much of the league of land therein described, as the laws then in force permitted Sideck to dispose of by free gift. It appears to have been the intention of Sideck in the execution of the instrument to make a present gift to Teal of one-half of the property named, and also to adopt Teal as his heir. But the law then in force did not permit any one who had a legitimate child living, to adopt a stranger as co-heir with such child. Sideck could at that time give away the one-fifth part of his estate, but he could not give away more than the fifth part, nor could he adopt a stranger to be co-heir with his legitimate child, one of the present plaintiffs. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">See Escriehe, the word adopci\u00f3n, also the word legitima, the word Herencia, and the word <em>Quinto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">By the instrument of the 15th of December, 1832, Sideck made to Teal a gift of one-half of the property named in the instrument, and intended that the gift should take effect immediately. The instrument must therefore be held to be effectual to the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>vesting the half of the property in Teal, unless the half so donated exceeded the one-fifth part of Sideck\u2019s whole estate at the time of the execution of the instrument, which it was the duty of the-plaintiff to show; or unless Teal renounced the gift. The court below left it to the jury to determine whether the land given by the instrument in question to Teal exceeded the one-fifth part of Sideck\u2019s estate, when there was no evidence by which the jury could be guided to a conclusion as to the fact; and, also, refused the 12th instruction asked by the appellant\u2019s counsel, to the effect that if the plaintiffs claimed that the gift to Teal was excessive, the burthen was on them to. show the excess, in both of which particulars the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">There was an objection to the introduction of the act of donation from Sideck to Teal, on the ground that its execution was not sufficiently proven. It was shown that Hernandez, the judge, before whom the instrument was. executed, was dead. His signature was-proven. There is- some proof about the absence of both the subscribing witnesses to the instrument, which is not very intelligible.. If it was shown that they were beyond the limits of the State, or could not be found, after reasonable efforts, and their signatures were proved, we think this would be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We are of opinion that Teal was not estopped by his acts as the administrator of Sideck, from claiming under the act of donation. He did nothing upon which the plaintiffs have acted, so that they would be injured if he is now permitted to claim against his acts.. His acts as administrator must be held to be open to explanation-He might have thought himself entitled as heir, by virtue of the adoption, in which case it might still be proper to administer upon the estate of Sideck.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The views entertained by the judge below were in the main correct\u2014but he erred in permitting the jury to find that the donation to Teal exceeded the fifth of Sideck\u2019s estate, when there was-no evidence on the point, and he also erred in refusing to give the 12th in number of the instructions asked by the counsel for the defendant below\u2014for which errors the judgment is reversed, and. the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Reversed and remanded. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
