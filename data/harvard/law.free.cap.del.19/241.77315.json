The only distinction whatever between the writ ordinarily issued to Justices of the Peace in this State from the Superior Court and the common law writ is that, under Section 7 of Chapter 92, in which section the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is provided for, such writ shall be granted of course and not upon petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-14\">Section 15 of Chapter \u00cd06 provides the method by which a party may obtain such a writ of <em>certiorari </em>from the Superior Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>but says nothing whatever about the form of the writ, or the form of return to be made thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-4\">It is important in connection with this latter section to notice that it is contemplated that other writs of <em>certiorari </em>may be necessary to complete the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">By Section 34, Chapter 97, it is made the duty of the Justices of the Peace, upon the tender of the legal fee, to make and certify a true transcript \u201cof all the docket entries in any cause before him.\u201d \u201c Upon an appeal a transcript shall be sufficient, unless a full copy be specially requested. Upon a certiorari, the Justice shall make a full copy of the entire record and proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">The first part of this section denotes the duty of the Justice when a party asks him for his record, the latter part relates solely to the duty of the Justice. Although, as above stated, it is made the duty of the party on an appeal to file a duly certified transcript of all the docket entries in the case, there is no statutory provision which requires a Justice of the Peace to make any certified copy of the record for a <em>certiorari </em>proceeding. At common law, however, it was the duty of the inferior court to certify its record to the superior court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">It is the writ of the superior court commanding the inferior court to send up the record in question. It is simply a method of getting the record into the superior court. The party has,' and can have, no control over the Justice to whom the writ is directed, and unlike an appeal, he has no control over the contents of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-8\">\n<em>1 Tidd\u2019s Practice, 397.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">The practice at common law was that where the Justice to whom the writ had been directed had failed in his duty for the Court, by proper proceedings, to compel him to perform it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-10\">This same procedure has been followed in this State in the case of <em>Watson vs. Lockwood, 2 Harr., 364. </em>In this case the Justice certified as follows,\u2014\u201c I do hereby certify the above to be a true copy of the warrant, and also of the execution, issued by me in the above case. As witness,\u201d etc. \u201c The Court of their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>motion directed a further return, though this was the second term. The certificate does not show that a full copy of all the record and proceedings has been sent up; if it did, we would not now allow diminution to be alleged.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-3\">OPINION.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">In this case the English practice was strictly carried out, and it is submitted it must be the correct practice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">There is no rule of court or statute of this State bearing upon the subject. Section 8 of Rule 9, relating to the allegation of diminution, does not cover the matter, as diminution can only be alleged for incompleteness of the record as sent up by the Justice. The certificate forms no part of the Justice\u2019s record, and could not be reached by such an allegation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\"><em>Bouvier\u2019s Law </em>Dictionary\u2014title <em>\u201c </em>Diminution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-8\">Section 16 of Rule 9 has nothing to do with matters of <em>certiorari, </em>and there is no reason why the Justice at this time should not be compelled by the Court to amend his certificate. Before the making of the said Section 16 of Rule 9 it was the uniform practice in this State to allow the Justice to amend his certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-9\">\n<em>Green vs. Kinney, 2 Harr., 160; Waters vs. Kirby, 1 Houst, 364.</em>\n</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b252-11\">Lore, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AH9\">The Court have considered this motion to dismiss the <em>certiorari </em>and have reached a unanimous conclusion. Although we have ruled otherwise, I am quite convinced that the Court inadvertently made that ruling and we should take this prompt method of correcting ourselves. The basis, to some extent) of our action then was that this defective certificate should be brought to the attention of the Court by allegation of diminution) and that not having been done, there was no properly certified record before us, and, therefore, we ought to affirm the judgment below. But upon careful consideration of the arguments made, and looking over the whole ground, we think it is not a jurisdictional matter in any sense. It is a formal defect upon the part of the Justice in not properly certifying his record, and it would seem unreasonable for this Court to affirm the judgment below upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u00a1 record sent up, although improperly certified to, if on the face of the record the judgment was manifestly wrong..</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">For that reason I am free to say there was error in the former ruling. This Court now unanimously hold, that the defective certificate of the Justice is not a jurisdictional matter, but a mere failure upon the part of the Justice to perform his duty, and we will make a peremtory order upon the Justice to send up a properly certified record, making a full copy of the entire record and pro- \\ ceedings in the case, under seal, returnable the twenty-fourth of V this month. We should have the record properly certified before | acting upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><em>Mr, </em>H\u00fcles:\u2014The suggestion has been made to me, if the 1 Court please, that the term of this Justice of the Peace has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">) Lore, C. J.:\u2014Then we make the order upon the Justice of <em>f </em>the Peace who is his successor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
