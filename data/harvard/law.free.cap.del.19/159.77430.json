Hatton to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been occasioned by the negligence of the defendant. To the declaration a plea in abatement was filed, which plea set out that the plaintiff was a married woman, and that her husband was not joined as party plaintiff. To this plea in abatement a general demurrer was filed, going to the sufficiency of the plea.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-8\"><em>William 8. Hilles </em>for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">The question presented to the Court is whether a married woman may sue in her own name, and without joining her husband, for personal injuries inflicted on her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-10\">The common law was very plain upon this subject, and required that the husband and wife should both join in such an action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-11\">\n<em>1 Chitty on Pleading, 73; Louth vs. Thompson, 1 Pennewill, l49 and 151.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-12\">The language of <em>Brett, M. R., in Weldon vs. Winslow, 13 Q. B. D., 784 and 786, </em>on this subject is the best I have found. In speaking of an action by the wife to recover for personal injuries he says: <em>\u201c </em>She is suing for personal injury to herself. For such a cause of action no action could ever have been brought by the husband alone without joining his wife as a plaintiff. What is done to her is the cause of action, and under the old practice she might have sued in her own name, without joining her husband, and could have recovered, if the defendant did not plead her coverture ' in abatement, for he could not plead it in bar of her action. The injury to the wife was the meritorious cause of action, and if she had died before the commencement of the action the husband would not have been entitled to sue. If damages should be given, they would belong in the first place to the wife alone, and if they should not be reduced into possession by the husband and he should die, the damages would be hers and would not go to his executors. It seems to me that according to the law of England the action was always the action of the wife, subject to the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>on the part of the defendant of insisting on having the husband joined.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">The above authorities make it manifest that the property in the chose in action belonged at the common law to the wife, and not to the husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">Blackstone divides personal property into things in possession, and things in action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">\u201c The right of action,\u201d says Judge Cooley, \u201c is property in the same sense in which tangible things are property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">\n<em>Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 362.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-9\">By <em>Section 1, Chapter 166, Volume 15, Laws of Delaware, </em>it is provided \u201cthat the real and personal property of any married woman which has been hereto acquired, is now held, or which she may <em>hereafter acquire in any manner whatsover </em>shall be her sole and separate property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-10\"><em>Section 4, Chapter 550, Volume 14, Laws of Delaware, </em>provides as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-11\">\u201cAny married woman may prosecute and defend suits at law or in equity for the preservation and protection of her property as if unmarried, or may do it jointly with her husband.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-12\">It is respectfully submitted that a married woman in this State under the law may sue for the protection or preservation of her property in this way, and that this is such a suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-13\">So far as I have been able to ascertain there are no modern cases which hold a different doctrine under statutes similar to ours, and most of them have upheld the right of a married woman to sue in her own name under statutory provisions very much less explicit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-14\">\n<em>Chicago &amp;c.
