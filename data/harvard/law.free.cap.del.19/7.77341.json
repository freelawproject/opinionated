The pin was afterwards recovered and traced to the possession of Briscoe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-20\">The defendant, being placed upon the stand, testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>found the pin in question on the sidewalk near his wagon, in front of Mary LeCompt\u2019s house on the day above referred to; that he did not know whose pin it was, and stuck it in his coat, making no effort to conceal it; that shortly after finding the pin he heard Mary LeCompt make a remark about somebody stealing something, but did not know that she referred to the pin. The defendant further testified that he traded off the pin to a man on Market street, in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, for another pin and thirty-five cents in money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">There was no proof that any effort was made to find the owner of the pin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">Herbert White was produced as a witness on behalf of the defendant, and, after stating that he had known Edward Briscoe, the defendant, for three or four years and that the latter had been in his employ, was asked by Mr. Smith the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Did you ever hear of this man\u2019s stealing anything ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-8\">Objected to by the Attorney-General, on the ground that good character can only be proved by reputation, not by specific acts.

That principle of law has been very clearly stated by Greenleaf in his work on Evidence, page \"T39, Section 159, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b17-10\">\u201cIf the goods were found by the prisoner, the old rule was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>that his subsequent conversion of them to his own use was no evidence of a felonious intent in the taking. But this rule, in modern times, is received with some qualifications. For if the finder knows who is the owner of the lost chattel, or if, from any mark upon it, or from the circumstances under which it was found, the owner could reasonably have been ascertained, then the fraudulent conversion of it to the finder\u2019s use is sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding the felonious intent, constituting a larceny. On this ground, hackney-coachmen and passenger-carriers have been found guilty of larceny, in appropriating to their own use the parcels and articles casually left in their vehicles by passengers ; servants have been convicted for the like appropriation of money or valuables, found in or about their masters\u2019 houses <em>; </em>and so it has been held where a carpenter converted to his own use a sum of money found in a secret drawer of a bureau, delivered to him to be repaired. In a word, the omission to use the ordinary and well-known means of discovering the owner of goods lost and found raises a presumption of fraudulent intention, more or less strong, against the finder, which it behooves him to explain and obviate; and this is most readily and naturally done by evidence that he endeavored to discover the owner, and kept the goods safely in his custody until it was reasonably supposed that he could not be found; or that he openly made known the finding, so as to make himself responsible for the value to the owner when he should appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">Therefore, gentlemen of the jury, if you are satisfied that the State has proven the essential facts which we have stated, and that the prisoner has not satisfactorily accounted for the possession of the property, it would be your duty to find a verdict of guilty. If, on the contrary, you are not satisfied from the evidence that the State has proved such facts, or if the prisoner has satisfactorily accounted for the possession of the property, it is your duty to find a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">If after considering all the evidence you entertain a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, that doubt inures to his benefit, \u00a1 and it would be your duty to render a verdict of not guilty. j</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">Verdict, guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
