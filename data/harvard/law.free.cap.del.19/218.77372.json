Because, if you should be satisfied that this larceny, as described in this indictment, had been committed, but by some other person than John Conlan, then you could not find him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We have been asked to instruct you in accordance with the recent decision of the Supreme Court of this State <em>(Daniels vs. </em>State, 2 <em>Pennewill, </em>586) as to the rule for your guidance in considering evidence of general good character in a criminal case. In compliance with that prayer we say to you that the evidence of general good character in a criminal prosecution must be confined to the trait of character in issue in the case, as general reputation for honesty and fair dealing is in the present prosecution for larceny. The evidence of such good character is to be considered by the jury in connection with all other relevant testimony in the case in reaching their conclusion and rendering their verdict as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">General good character for honesty and fair dealing is proved by evidence of general reputation in that respect. That is, by proof of what the people in the neighborhood in which the accused dwells generally say of his conduct or character in regard to honesty and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In conclusion, we deem it only necessary further to say to you that you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>of the prisoner before you can render a verdict of guilty under this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">By reasonable doubt is not meant a vague, fanciful, whimsical or even possible doubt of guilt, but such a doubt as naturally arises out of all the relevant evidence in the case before you, and such a doubt as may reasonably be entertained by men of ordinary intelligence, impartiality and judgment, after a careful and conscientious consideration of all such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">With these remarks, we leave the case in your hands to render such verdict as under the law as we have given it to you, and under the evidence as it has been presented to you from this witness stand, you may deem right and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Verdict, not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
