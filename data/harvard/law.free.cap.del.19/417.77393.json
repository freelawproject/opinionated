Chorman to recover for immediate injuries to real estate, the declaration alleging \u201c injuries to the property seized in her fee as possessed,\u201d while according to the proof adduced on the part of the plaintiff, Comfort E. Chorman was not in possession of the real estate at the time the suit was brought, but the said real estate was then in pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>session of her husband, Philip H. Chorman. That there was therefore a fatal variance between the proof and the allegation in the declaration, and the plaintiff was therefore not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>Jackson vs. Prescott, Maul and Selwyn, 201.</em>\n</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-6\"><em>Mr. </em>White:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYW\">Without citing any authorities, our answer to the first point raised is this: The proof is that the husband and wife lived together, and while she gave up to him the use of the land, was that not possession in her as well as in him ? She was not dispossessed. She did not remove from the land at all, but was there living on the land and her husband had control of it.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-14\"> See case of <em>Philip H.
