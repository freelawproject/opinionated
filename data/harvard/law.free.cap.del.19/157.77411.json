In the case now before the Court, however, there is nothing but the word covenant, and we think it is not a sufficient statement to show that it was within the jurisdiction of the Justice. Covenant is a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>term, and the record must set out specifically what the cause of action is, so as to bring it within the jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace, as was done in the case cited above from <em>1 Harrington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">For that reason let the judgment below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
