Where such licenses have been granted they have come before us without objection as <em>bona fide </em>retailers of goods, wares and merchandise. The kind has never been inquired into, nor objected to. Here comes a person not claiming to be such, but a hotel keeper, and asks to combine the two\u2014hotel keeping and wholesale liquor selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">We refuse to grant this license, on the ground that the law does not contemplate the blending of the two lines of business named.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
