In order to describe to you what character of acts come within the designation of cheating, I will read to you from <em>3 Greenleaf on Evidence, (13th Edition), Section 84:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u201cThe indictment for this offense, <em>at common law, </em>must show, and of course the prosecutor must prove, <em>first, </em>that the offense was of a nature to affect not only particular individuals, but <em>the public at large, </em>and <em>against which common prudence and care are not sufficient to guard. </em>Hence it was held indictable for common players to cheat with false dice; and for a person to pretend to have power to discharge soldiers, thereupon taking money from them for false discharges. So, obtaining an order from the court to hold to bail by means of a false voucher of a fact, fraudulently produced for that purpose; furnishing adulterated bread to the government, for the use of a military asylum; and selling army bread to the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ment by false marks of the weight, fraudulently put on the barrels\u2019 have been held indictable offenses at common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">So that you have the crime clearly defined. If the prisoner, either by himself or in collusion with another, did obtain from this prosecuting witness certain money by using a false or trick penknife in connection with a true penknife, and in such a way as would deceive men of common prudence and care, then it would be of such a character that it would deceive people generally, and would come within the common law definition and would be an indictable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Verdict not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
