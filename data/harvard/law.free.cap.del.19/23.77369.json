D. 1900, at Clayton, Dela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ware, John S. Casperson, a Justice of the Peace, rendered judgment by default against your petitioner and in favor of Herman C. Wood in an action of assumpsit for the sum of fifty-five dollars and twelve cents and costs of suit. That afterwards, to wit, on the twenty-fifth day of August, A. D. 1900, the transcript of said judgment was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County and upon said transcript, judgment was entered in said Court, said judgment being Ho. 141 to the April Term, A. D. 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\">That said transcript upon which said judgment was entered by default does not show that the return of the service of summons was verified by the constable\u2019s affidavit in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">That said Justice of the Peace rendered said judgment against Charles W, Dickerson instead of against Willis C. Dickerson, the correct name of said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">The transcript of said judgment only was in Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Gooding:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1bV\">We admit that this Court in the exercise of equitable power, will inquire into the condition of the <em>judgment; </em>but we hold here that this ground of exception which is taken is simply a formal defect which does not go to the substance of the judgment and is not a defect upon which the rights of the parties could be determined. It is a judgment of this Court, and a proper remedy would be a writ of error on the face of the judgment.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b32-8\">Grubb, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"A8i\">This is merely a transcript of the docket. It does not show that the service of the summons was verified as the statute requires before the judgment by default was rendered. But it does not follow that if we had the writ here and examined the same that we might not find that it was verified upon the writ. The best way to get at that is to take out a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to require the Justice to send up not only the transcript of the docket entries but the whole record with the writs themselves.</p>\n<author id=\"b32-9\">Lore, C.
