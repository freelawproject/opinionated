If the mode of payment was to be any other than in money, the count must be on the special or original contract. And if it was to be in money, and a term of credit was allowed, the action, though on the common counts, must not be brought until the term of credit has expired. This election to sue upon the common counts, where there is a special agreement, applies only to cases where the contract has been fully performed by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We therefore instruct you, that if you are satisfied from the evidence, that these articles were furnished by the plaintiff to the defendant under a special contract\u2014at the stipulated price of $335\u2014and that the plaintiff has fully performed and executed its part of the contract, and that the contract price is due and unpaid, the plaintiff is entitled to recover said price under the common count for goods sold and delivered contained in his declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel also requests us to charge you that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for the item charged in his bill of particulars under date of September 26, viz., for one controller for motor car, $275, because there is evidence that this article was not delivered to the defendant, and no evidence to the contrary; and because there is no evidence that the defendant agreed to pay for it before delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">When the property in the goods has passed by sale to the buyer, but there has been no actual delivery to him, the plaintiff may recover the price under a count for goods bargained and sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\n<em>2 Ency.

The property is not vested in the defendant if the goods, being part of a larger quantity are not separated therefrom, and something remains to be done to distinguish them and ascertain their quantity, or number, or the amount of the price. This rule has been already considered. Nor is the property in goods vested in the defendant so as to render the common count ' for goods bargained and sold sufficient, unless the article has been finished, and specifically appropriated and set apart for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>chaser, and he has assented thereto. In these cases the declaration should be framed specially on a contract for not accepting the goods, or for refusing to complete the bargain; and in general, where the contract is not substantially for the sale .of goods, but is rather for work and materials, the value even of the latter is not recoverable upon a count for goods sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It is your duty to determine from the evidence the facts proved, and to apply to the facts so found by you the rules of law delivered to you by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Verdict for plaintiff for $829.99</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
