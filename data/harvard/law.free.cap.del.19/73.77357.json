That the <em>Constitution, Section 7 Article 5, </em>referring to these words was in the disjunctive\u2014\u201coffer <em>or </em>promise,\u201d thereby making \u201c offering \u201d and \u201c promising \u201d two distinct, offenses.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Lore, C.

What is your next step ?</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\"><em>Mr. </em>White:\u2014Taking up the Information No. 4 in <em>State vs. JReiman, </em>for promising to pay $15, we offer the bail bond in evidence upon that.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014That is the same bond, and the <em>only </em>bond in the two cases, and we certainly object to the Court\u2019s putting a double meaning upon it and construing it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Mr. </em>White:\u2014There are different counts upon it, the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014This is a different offense alleged in this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014Did we understand the counsel for the defendant to admit when arguing the question in the other case that this bail bond would sustain an information upon a promise ?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014I hold that that would be the most favorablet construction that could be put upon it, but I did not admit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">(The Court here heard further argument upon the question).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We were not aware that the State had two informations upon the one commitment. Now we think you ought to elect which of these two you will stand upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\"><em>Mr. </em>Cooper:\u2014Do I understand the Court to hold that we cannot set forth in two separate informations one transaction ?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014Your information must correspond with your commitment or with the proceedings below\u2014with the bail bond.</p>\n<author id=\"b85-14\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"ASA\">It is not a question of setting forth two counts in one information for the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014You do not do that, but you have two separate informations. We do not undertake to say that you could not in one information with the same transaction, in different counts aver, that he offered money in one and that he promised it in another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>but so far as it appears, you have two distinct and separate offenses not growing out of one transaction; it does not appear that it is one transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>Mr. </em>White:\u2014We will stand on No. 4. That is the one alleging a promise to pay, and not the one alleging an offer to pay. We will withdraw the bail bond in No. 5 and offer it in No. 4. We withdraw the information in No. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014We shall object to the bail bond in No. 4 on the ground that we have already stated to your Honors.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\"><em>Mr. </em>White:\u2014We will abandon or <em>nolle pros. </em>No. 5 and offer the bail bond in No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Boyce, J.:\u2014Do I understand that the proof that has been adduced in No. 5 applies to No. 4 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014The Attorney-General need not go through the formal proof again. That is as to the paper itself; nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\"><em>Mr. </em>Ward:\u2014We save our exception in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014Let a <em>nolle prosequi </em>be entered in No. S; you had better proceed regularly in No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014We want to save our exceptions. That is the reason we said we objected to the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014You had better go along regularly. You will prove this formally in No. 4; go on step by step.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">Ezekiel Y. Cooper, a Justice of the Peace was then sworn and proved the formal execution of the said bail bond, which was then offered in evidence by the Attorney-General and objected to by Counsel for the defendant on the same ground as before stated in No. 5 which had been <em>nolle prossed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Lore, C. J.:\u2014We hold that the bail bond sets out the offense with sufficient precision to sustain the information, and order judgment against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014We desire to note an exception to that ruling; we also note an exception to the decision of the Court that it is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\"><em>Mr. Ward </em>here raised the question as to whether said judgment was final, or a judgment of <em>respondeat </em>ouster, and asked, in order that there might be a ruling, that judgment of <em>respondeat mister </em>be entered. Counsel for State contended it was a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We have concluded what judgment we will render, and as giving our reasons better probably than we could state them off-hand, we will quote from <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, Sections 530\u2014a and 537:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u201cDouble Pleading.\u2014Can a defendant plead simultaneously the general issue, and one or more special pleas? At common law, this must be answered in the negative, whenever such pleas are repugnant; as at common law all the pleas filed in a case are regarded as one. This is the strict practice in England, where the judges in review have solemnly ruled that special pleas cannot be pleaded in addition to the plea of not guilty. And in this country, in cases where not guilty has been pleaded simultaneously with <em>autrefois </em>acquit, the same course has been followed, and the plea of not guilty stricken off until the special plea is disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\"><em>\u201c </em>In such case, after determining the special plea against the defendant, the present practice in the United States is to enter simply a judgment of <em>respondeat ouster </em>in all cases in which the special plea is not equivalent to the general issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\u201c This, which is technically the correct practice, is not, however, always pursued. A short cut is often taken to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>result, by directing when special pleas and the general issue are filed simultaneously, or are found together on the record before trial, that the special pleas should be tried first, and, if they are found against the defendant, then the general issue. But, under any circumstances, it is error to try the special pleas and the general issue simultaneously. The special plea must be always disposed of before the general issue is tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><em>\u201c </em>If a special plea is determined against the defendant, is the judgment always <em>respondeat ouster </em>? Unless upon a trial by jury on a special plea which embraces the general issue, this question ought now to be answered in the affirmative. The old distinction taken in this respect between felonies and misdemeanors, being no longer founded in reason, should be rejected in practice. And the only consistent as well as just course is, to harmonize the present fragmentary rulings in this relation into the principle that in all cases the question of guilty or not guilty is one which the defendant is entitled of right, no matter how many technical antecedent points may have been determined against him, to have squarely decided by a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">And in the latter part of Section 537 of the same work, the learned author says:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\"><em>\u201c </em>In England, the rule is that on a plea of abatement on the ground of misnomer, the judgment, if for the Crown, is final, and that the defendant cannot plead over. It seems otherwise, however, where the plea is to matter of law. In this country the practice is to require the defendant to plead over.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\"><em>\u201c </em>How far errors in the grand jury can be thus noticed has already been considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The above reasoning commends itself to our judgment, and we will follow it. Let the judgment be a judgment of <em>respondeat ouster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Counsel for State here announce that the State elects to stand on the first count in No. 4, abandoning the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>After \u2022 hearing the evidence on both sides the Court rendered the following judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014We have considered this case upon the proof, and a majority of the Court have reached the conclusion that under the proof in this case the guilt of the defendant is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the rule in all criminal cases. The judgment of the Court, therefore, is a judgment of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Judgment, not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
