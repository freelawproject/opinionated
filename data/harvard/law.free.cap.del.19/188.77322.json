The said instrument, which was admitted in evidence, was in the following form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-16\">\u201c Form 4.\u2014Monthly. 500-8, 22, 98.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4D\">\u201c In consideration of the firm of John Wanamaker, as now constituted or hereafter formed, granting credit for the purchase of merchandise to Mrs. Grover (Rebecca A.) Smith at present residing at No. 225 South Ninth St., Philadelphia, Pa., to an amount not exceeding Fifty dollars per month, I hereby agree to guarantee the payment of, and will pay on demand, said monthly accounts on the . fifth day of the month following said purchases. Notice of separate transactions is waived. This guarantee is to continue from month to month until revoked by me in writing and the amount due thereon is settled in full to date of revocation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4s\">Witness</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-19\">\u201cDated the 3d day of September, 1895.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-20\">\u201c G.

Plaintiff also proved his book account against Mrs. Grover Smith, and then rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-22\"><em>Bidgely, </em>for defendant, moved for a nonsuit on two grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-23\"><em>First. </em>That it had not been averred in the narr, nor proved, that the plaintiff ever gave notice to the defendant that he accepted his guaranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-24\"><em>Second. </em>That there was no proof of any notice given to the defendant of any transaction with Mrs. Grover Smith or of any default upon her part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\n<em>Taylor &amp; Co. vs. McClung, 2 Houst., 24; Farmers\u2019 Bank vs. Tatnall, 7 Houst., 287; Maybery &amp; Co. vs. Bainton &amp; Co., 2 Harr., 24.</em>\n</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-5\"><em>Van Dyke, </em>for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM1\">The principle of law contended for by the defendant\u2019s counsel does not apply to this case.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"ATC\">We think this nonsuit must be granted. The principle of law contended for by the plaintiff is very clearly settled in the cases of <em>Taylor &amp; Co. vs. McClung, 2 Houst., 24; </em>and <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank vs. Tatnall, 7 Houst., 287. </em>In the former case the statement is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u201c If the guaranty be prospective in its character to cover future credits, the party tendering it, is entitled to notice of its acceptance, and the party receiving it and for whom it is intended, is bound to give reasonable notice of its acceptance, or the party offering it will not be bound by it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Let a nonsuit be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
