They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201c16. In a process of heat-treating hydrocarbons, heating a petroleum stream to liquid-phase cracking temperatures, simultaneously heating another petroleum stream to vapor-phase cracking temperatures at less pressure, and discharging both highly heated substantially uncooled streams directly into 'mixture together in a further zone while abruptly lowering the pressure of the stream from the liquid-phase operation, the zone of admixture being under a super-atmospheric pressure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201c18.

Claim 19 is illustrative. It reads: \u201c19. In a process of heat-treating hydrocarbons, heating a petroleum stream to a liquid-phase cracking temperature not exceeding 975\u00b0 F. and a pressure of 400-1200 pounds per square inch, simultaneously heating another petroleum stream to a vapor-phase cracking temperature of 1025-1125\u00b0 F. and a pressure not exceeding 200 pounds per square inch, passing the vapor-phase stream to a time reaction zone guarded against substantial heat loss wherein the velocity is diminished, and discharging the highly heated vapor-phase cracking stream and the entire liquid-phase cracking stream into admixture together in a further zone while abruptly lowering the pressure of the stream from the liquid-phase operation to not exceeding 200 pounds per square inch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">It will be observed that claim 19 contains the limitation \u201cpassing the vapor-phase stream to a time reaction zone guarded against substantial heat loss <em>wherein the velocity is diminished.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">The Primary Examiner described the references as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-14\">\u201cLang shows an early use of a double tube system for cracking first a heavy hydrocarbon in tubes 5 and tubes 8 and vaporizing in these latter tubes and fractionating and returning light fractions to be heated to cracking temperatures coil 29 and vaporizing zones 8. Lang mentions no temperatures relying on the skill of the operator but he does destructively heat the vapors, see page 2, line 125.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-15\">\u201cIsom heats heavy oil to high pressure in coil 5 and temperatures of 750\u00b0 to 800\u00b0 F., the pressure dropping in drum 55, to atmospheric or higher pressures may be used, and maintains temperatures of 1000\u00b0 to 1200\u00b0 F. on coil 23 and only enough pressure to force the oil in the drum. Isom maintains a small time reaction zone 26 which also serves to remove residual heavy polymers and carbon. The light fractions from fractionators 12 and 16 are returned as charging stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-16\">\u201cIsom <em>1,722,223 </em>is similar to the above Isom patent.

He further stated: \u201cApplicant has attempted to distinguish over Pratt by the phrase \u2018discharging both highly heated substantially uncooled streams directly into admixture together\u2019 to show a difference between the time reaction step of Pratt in coil 36 but this step is already old in the other references and the time reaction zones of Pratt and the applicant are considered to be substantially the same in effect insofar as they are claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">In its decision, the Board of Appeals stated that the Examiner had relied mainly on the Isom and Pratt patents, and, after describing the Isom patents, stated that: \u201cIn neither one of these patents is there any abrupt lowering of the pressure of the liquid phase stream as it enters the drum 55 as called for by the claims. As shown, the pressure in the coil 5 is the same as in the drum 55. It is not evident that these patents anticipate the claims as they apparently lack the most essential feature stressed by applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The Board then described the patent to Pratt, and held that claim 16 was anticipated by that reference; that claim 17 was also unpatentable in view of the Pratt reference; that claim 18 included the limitation \u201cpassing the vapor-phase stream to a time reaction zone,\u201d which was a well-known step as shown \u201cin Isom\u201d; that it did not involve invention to add that step to the process disclosed in the patent to Pratt; that claims 20, 21, 23, and 31 included the step of \u201cfractionating the vaporous products from the zone of admixture, and returning a naphtha fraction as the petroleum supply stream to the vapor-phase cracking operation\u201d; that that feature of appellant\u2019s process was disclosed in the Isom patents; and that the addition of that step in the process disclosed in the patent to Pratt would not involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">In describing the Pratt reference, and in holding that it substantially anticipated appealed claims 16 and 17, the Board said: \u201cReferring to the drawing, oil from a supply tank A passes through a coil 7 where it is heated and then flows through the coil 17 where the temperature is raised to 800\u00b0 F. It is then discharged into the expansion chamber D kept at atmospheric pressure. Lighter oil from the dephlegmator is pumped through the coil 32 where it is heated to 1100\u00b0 F. and cracked in vapor phase under atmospheric pressure. The light vapor passes through the coil 35 where it cools the oil in the bottom of the expansion chamber and finally passes upward between the baffles in the expansion chamber and mixes with the heavy vapor from the coil 17. It appears to us that claim 16 reads in all substantial respects on this patent. We do not think that the vapor from the coil 32 is cooled to such an extent in the coil 35 so as to materially effect the result desired. Also it is believed of no patentable consequence whether the pressure in the expansion chamber D is atmospheric or above. Some pressure could readily be applied to the chamber if desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">We are unable to understand that portion of the Board\u2019s description of the disclosure contained in the Pratt reference, where it is stated that the light vapor from the heating coil in the cracking furnace passes through the heat exchanger, referred to by the Board as \u201ccoil 35,\u201d and cools the oil in the bottom of the expansion chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">The purpose of the heat exchanger coil, as stated by the patentee in his specification, is to \u201creboil all light distillates from the residual oil in the bottom of expansion chamber and <em>at the same time reduce the temperature of the oil entering the expan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>sion chamber from the cracking furnace coil\u201d-, </em>and that the \u201ccracked vapors from the coil 32 can be brought to a temperature such that they will, upon contacting with the films of preheated crudes in the vaporizing chamber D, crack and further vaporize said preheated crudes, leaving as a liquid in said chamber D the residuums and coke-forming constituents.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">It is clear from the patentee\u2019s specification that the light vapor, passing from the heating coil in the cracking furnace through the heat exchanger, was intended to be substantially cooled in the heat exchanger by its use as a medium for further vaporization of the \u201cpreheated crudes\u201d or \u201cresidual oil\u201d in the bottom of the expansion chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Appellant\u2019s process, on the contrary, as clearly stated in each of the appealed claims, discharges a stream of light hydrocarbons of relatively high temperature into admixture with a stream of heavy hydrocarbons of relatively lower temperature; neither stream being substantially reduced in temperature, although the pressure of the stream of hydrocarbons is abruptly lowered.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We think it is clear from the record that claims 16 and 17 are not \u201csubstantially met,\u201d as held by the Board of Appeals, by the disclosure contained in the patent to Pratt.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">It is true, as observed by the Board, that the patents to Isom disclose \u201cpassing the vapor-phase stream to a time reaction zone,\u201d one of the steps contained in appealed claim 18, and that they disclose the step of \u201cfractionating the vaporous products from the zone of admixture, and returning a naphtha fraction as the petroleum supply stream to the vapor-phase cracking operation,\u201d one of the steps included in claims 20, 21, 23, and 31. However, we are unable to agree that those references, combined with the disclosure contained in the patent to Pratt, are sufficient upon which to base a rejection of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Although we agree with the Solicitor for the Patent Office, that a combination of references may be cited in order to show that all the steps of a process are old, and that invention was not involved in combining them, see In re Downs et al., 45 F.(2d) 251, 18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 803; In re Armbruster, 47 F.(2d) 815, 18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1039, nevertheless, we are of .opinion that, in the case at bar, the references cited, neither singly nor in combination, suggest appellant\u2019s process as defined in the appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Other than the patents to Isom and Pratt, the references were not discussed in detail in either of the decisions of the tribunals of the Patent Office, and, although we have carefully considered them, we deem it unnecessary to discuss tliem here.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the appealed claims involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
