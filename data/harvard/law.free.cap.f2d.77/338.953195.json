Mrs. Ogle, the taxpayer, was one of the next of kin of one Rand, who died intestate on October 31, 1925, leaving some shares of stock as part of his estate, which his administrator distributed to her on January 28, 1927, and which she sold on May 28, 1928, at an advance above their value at distribution. The question is whether she. \u201cheld\u201d, the shares from October 31&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1925, or from January 28, 1927; on this depends her privilege under section 101 (a), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (a), to limit her tax to one-eighth of the gain. If she \u201cheld\u201d them only from the date of distribution, the gain was part of her ordinary income, as the Commissioner and the Board have held. The Circuit Courts of Appeal of the Third and Eighth Circuits have decided the point in favor of the Treasury; that of the First, contra. McFeely v. Helvering, 74 F.(2d) 1017 (C. C. A. 3); Dibblee v. Commissioner, Helvering, 75 F.(2d) 617 (C. C. A. 9); First National Bank v. United States, 76 F.(2d) 200 (C. C. A. 1). Although it is extremely likely that the Supreme Court will allow certiorari, we must nevertheless decide the case, else the taxpayer may not secure an independent hearing in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 50 S. Ct. 115, 74 L. Ed. 457, on which the taxpayer relies, does not help her. It did hold that the word \u201cacquired,\u201d in the Acts of 1918 and 1921 (40 Stat. 1057, 42 Stat. 227), referred to the death of the taxpayer\u2019s ancestor; it did not even intimate that \u201cacquired\u201d and \u201cheld\u201d were synonymous. But that aside, the question before the court was not of the two years period under section 101 (a), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (a), or its predecessors, but barely as to the proper \u201cbasis\u201d for a gain taxed as ordinary income. At least in the Act of 1921, section 202 (a) (3), 42 Stat. 229, expressly fixed the date of \u201cacquisition\u201d as the date for the \u201cbasis\u201d; section 113 (a) (5) of 1928, 26 USCA \u00a7 2113 (a) (5), fixes the date of distribution in the case of intestacies of the personalty, as the opinion in Brewster v. Gage observed. This taxpayer cannot afford to concede that the date of \u201cacquisition\u201d is the date of the \u201cbasis,\u201d even though \u201cacquisition\u201d and \u201cholding\u201d were the same. More'over, she cannot tack the administrator\u2019s tenure before distribution to her own; under the Act of 1928 tacking is controlled by subdivision B of section 101 (c) (8), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (c) (8) (B), and is permissible only when the \u201cbasis\u201d of the taxpayer under section 113 (26 USCA \u00a7 2113) is the same as that of a predecessor in tenure. The \u201cbasis\u201d of the administrator is fixed by section 113 (a) (5), 26 USCA \u00a7 2113 (a) (5), as the value at the death of the intestate. The taxpayer to succeed must prove as res integra that she \u201cheld\u201d the shares throughout the period of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Section 113 (a) (5) was pretty plainly drafted in conformity with the general municipal law relating to estates. Gains on devises, realty descended, and specific legacies were measured from the death of the ancestor; on pecuniary and residuary legacies and on intestacies of personalty, from distribution; in all cases coinciding with the vesting of title at common law. It seems to us that this pattern ought not only to determine the \u201cbasis,\u201d but the period on which the privilege should depend. The word \u201cheld\u201d is indeed colloquial; we need not say that it always implies possession; it does not. Helvering v. New York Trust Co., 292 U. S. 455, 54 S. Ct. 806, 78 L. Ed. 1361; Commissioner v. Nevius, 76 F.(2d) 109 (C. C. A. 2). But in this context we think it does. Otherwise we should have to say that between the intestate\u2019s death and distribution the administrator and the next of kin both \u201cheld\u201d the personalty. The administrator, had he kept the shares for more than two years after the intestate\u2019s death and then sold them, would surely have had the privilege conferred by section 101 (a), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (a), like an individual. If he \u201cheld\u201d during that period, the next of <em>kin </em>did not; yet unless he did, he may not limit the estate\u2019s tax. Moreover, in general the statute makes the time at which the \u201cbasis\u201d is fixed, the starting point of the period which determines the privilege. So strong is this as even to control the term \u201cheld,\u201d when its natural meaning is otherwise. Helvering v. New York Trust Co., supra, 292 U. S. 455, 54 S. Ct. 806, 78 L. Ed. 1361. Here we need do no violence to that word in order to conform with the general plan; rather we should have to wrench it unduly to do anything else. Finally, the privilege is in any case a partial exemption, and the taxpayer must bring herself clearly within it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
