It is deemed to he true that the products of both parties are \u2018household utilities\u2019 but this may be said also of any number of articles found in the home and is believed not a proper test as to whether the goods in question possess the \u2018same descriptive properties\u2019 within the meaning of section 5. Applicant\u2019s products, like those of the opposer, relate to a highly specialized art. Laundry and dish washing machines and wash boilers, it seems to the examiner, are widely different from the goods of the opposer consisting of refrigerating machines, liquid-fuel-burning devices and automatic electrically controlled and operated fuel heating systems, including the electrically operated controls therefor. The articles are adapted for different uses, are usually made by different manufacturers and are seldom, if ever, handled by the same retailers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">In affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, the commissioner stated that the differences in the goods and the differences in the marks of the respective parties were sufficient \u201cto support the holding that confusion is quite improbable,\u201d and that, therefore, appellee was entitled to register its mark. The commissioner cited, as authority for his holding, the decision of this court in the case of Williams Oil-O-Matic Heating Corp. v. Westihghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co., 62 F.(2d) 378, 379, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">It is contended by counsel for appellant that the goods of the respective parties are household utilities; that they are goods of the same descriptive properties; and that appellee\u2019s mark \u201cWash-O-Matic\u201d is confusingly similar to appellant\u2019s marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">In the case of Williams Oil-O-Matic Heating Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co., supra, this court, in holding that adjustable and electrically controlled sad-irons \u2014 flatirons, were not goods of the same descriptive properties as either electrically operated and thermostatically controlled refrigerators or fuel burning devices, among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-14\">\u201cThe goods of the parties are household utilities. They are adapted to be connected to the electric-light circuit, and are thermostatically controlled. They are not similar, however, in any other respect. They differ greatly in cost, use, appearance, and structure, and, of course, are not competitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-15\">\u201cWere it not for the fact that they are thermostatically controlled, we dare say that no one would contend that sadirons possess the same descriptive properties as either fuel-burning devices or refrigerators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-16\">\u201cIn this connection, it may be observed that electric toasters, heating pads, waffle irons, table grills, or sandwich toasters, and possibly other articles of household utility, are electrically operated and thermostatically controlled. Is it possible that those articles and either fuel-burning devices or refrigerators possess the same descriptive properties merely because they are electrically operated and thermostatically controlled? Might it not with equal force be argued that all electrically operated devices belong to the same class for trade-mark purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-17\">\u201cWe are of opinion that the mere attachment of automatic temperature regulators does not so change the character of sadirons as to give them, within the principles heretofore referred to, the same descriptive properties as either electrically operated and thermostatically controlled refrigerators or fuel-burning devices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">It may be observed, as stated by the Examiner of Interferences, that there is nothing of record to indicate that appellee\u2019s goods are electrically operated or thermostatically controlled, nor is there any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>evidence of \u25a0 record to establish that the goods of the respective parties are sold in the same establishments.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">We arc of opinion that the goods of the respective parties do not possess the same descriptive properties, and that the issues in this case are controlled by our decision in the case of Williams Oil-OMatie Heating Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">For an interesting discussion on a subj ect akin to that here involved, see All-American Mohawk Corporation v. Earl H. Rollinson, 22 C. <em>C. </em>P. A. (Patents) -, <em>77 </em>F.(2d) 926, decided June 3, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Although other matters are presented in the briefs of counsel for appellant, we deem it unnecessary to discuss' them.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">We are of opinion that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the right conclusion. Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Affirmed. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
