The application recited that it was a continuation of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>pellant\u2019s then pending application, serial No. 526,329, filed December 31, 1921 (which subsequently ripened into patent No. 1,599,-512 issued September 14, 1926), \u201cas to all subject matter common to both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Application serial No. 95,820 included both process and product claims, and the Primary Examiner made a ruling requiring division, which ruling, being traversed by appellant, was approved by the Classification Examiner with the statement, \u201cThe article is not limited by the method of making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The record in the instant case docs not contain the several office actions relating to application serial No. 95,820, but it does disclose that appellant, after the ruling requiring division, struck the product claims therefrom and on January 2, 1930, filed a divisional application containing them; it being serial No. 418,206, the application here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Application serial No. 95,820 containing only the process claims was prosecuted to completion and culminated in patent No. 1,755,049, issued April 15, 1930, some three and a half months after the filing of the divisional application containing the product claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The divisional application here involved seems to have been first tentatively rej ected by the examiner on June 26, 1931. Thereafter it was amended in certain respects, not clearly stated in the record, and, as amended, was finally rejected by the examiner on May 24, 1932. As so rejected, it contained three product claims numbered, respectively, 5, 11, and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Appeal was taken to the Board of Appeals and, from the examiner\u2019s statement to the board, it appears that his rejection of all three claims was based solely upon prior art; the references cited being:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Kirschbraun, 1,612,776, December 28, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Abraham, 1,126,932, February 2, 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Overbury, 1,482,090, January 29, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">Upon appeal, the Board of Appeals affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of claim No. 11 upon Kirschbraun (the other references apparently having been withdrawn) and reversed his rejection of claims 5 and 12 upon that ground, but itself rejected them upon \u201cthe ground of double patenting with respect to appellant\u2019s patent 1,755,049.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Appellant thereupon presented a petition for reconsideration, filing therewith an affidavit of the patentee Kirschbraun to which allusion will be made later. The board denied the petition as to claim No. 11 and adhered to its rejection of claims Nos. 5 and 12 upon the ground of double patenting. Later, the board, in response to a formal request, advised that it had considered the Kirschbraun affidavit but that it was not regarded as pertinent to the questions before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">The instant appeal followed, and at the hearing before us appellant moved to dismiss as to claim 11. This motion will be granted. We have, therefore, to consider only claims 5 and 12, which read as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">\u201c5. A roofing element comprising a felted fibrous base of sheet material cut to desired size and shape, a sealing coat of waterproofing material overlying both faces and all the edges of the element, and a masking layer of grit partially embedded in the coating on the surface and edges of the element which are exposed to the weather when the element is laid on a roof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">\u201c12. An individual shingle unit to be used for building construction cut from prepared roofing and having butt and adjacent side edges and being provided with vertical slots to provide shingle simulating tabs and a continuous protective bituminous coating covering at least the exposed portion of the upper face and the exposed butt and side edges and the edges of said slotted portions of the unit and a coating of comminuted grit applied to the upper face of said exposed butt and side edges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">The sole question to be determined is that of whether the allowance of the claims at issue will result in double patenting, in view of the patent, No. 1,755,049, of April 15, 1930, granted to Cady upon the process claims. The process claims of the said patent are two in number. Claim No. 1, which is typical, reads: \u201c1. The process of treating individual shingle units cut from prepared roofing and having butt and adjacent side edges which includes the successive steps of coating all portions of the units uniformly with waterproofing bituminous material and applying granular surfacing material to the units in a continuous operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-19\">The requirement of division respecting application serial No. 95,820 was made in consonance with rules 41 and 42 of the United States Patent Office, the here material provisions of which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-20\">\u201c41. Two or more independent inventions can not be claimed in one application; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>but where several distinct inventions are dependent upon each other and mutually contribute to produce a single result they may be claimed in one application: * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtY\">\u201c42. If several inventions claimed in a single application be of such a nature that a single patent may not be issued to cover them, the inventor will be required to limit the description, drawing, and claim of the pending application to whichever invention he may elect. The other inventions may be made the subjects of separate applications, which must conform to the rules applicable to original applications. If the independence of the inventions be clear, such limitation will be made before any action upon the merits; otherwise it may be made at any time before final action thereon, in the discretion of the examiner. A requirement of division will not be repeated without the written approval of the examiner of classification. After a final requirement of division, the applicant may elect to prosecute one group of claims, retaining the remaining claims in the case with the privilege of appealing from the requirement of division after final action by the examiner on the group of claims prosecuted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">.[1,2] It is presumed that the Primary Examiner and the Classification Examiner made the rulings requiring division before there had been any consideration of the application upon the merits, such as testing the claims by prior art or by other factors affecting their per se patentability, but it is also the presumption that those - tribunals, having measured the claims by each other, that is, having considered the process claims in the light of the product claims and vice versa, were of the opinion that, if invention did exist as to both classes, two independent inventions would be involved, not dependent upon each other and not mutually contributing to .produce a single result so as to render them claimable in one application.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">It was only upon such .theory that the examiner had authority -.to--make the divisional requirement, and the rulings, in legal effect, amounted to an. adjudication that, if invention were found to be present, two .distinct and independent. inventions were \u00a1claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">As -we understand it, 'under the Pat\u2019ent\u2019Officepractice,process applications relating to the roofing art are prosecuted :ih \u2022a different division from that imwhich-p'rodiit'ct\u2019 applications in\u2019the same'field, are prosecuted, and before a different examiner. This fact is of importance because of the practical difficulties which confront an applicant in attempting to prosecute two applications simultaneously so as to bring them to culmination upon the same. date.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Obviously, since appellant elected to take the course which he pursued, the qu\u00e9stion of whether tire requirement for division was proper was not presented for determination to the Board of Appeals, and' no definite opinion was expressed thereon by that tribunal. It is difficult to escape the conclusion, however, in view of its holding that there is no patentable distinction between the process and product claims and in view of its reversal as to prior art, that, had the question of division been before it, the holding would have been that the requirement was improper and both the process and product claims would have been allowed in one application. Such holding, at least, would appear to be in harmony with the principle applied by this court in the cases of In re Rupert E. Rundell, 55 F.(2d) 450, 19 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 932, and In re Wilfred J. Hawkins, 57 F.(2d) 367, 19 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">If such a holding would have been correct in the instant case, it becomes immediately apparent that appellant in acquiescing in the ruling of the examiners, and following the course permitted by the rules of the Patent Office, may have suffered a loss of substantial rights, and we agree with appellant\u2019s contentions that under the facts of this case every reasonable doubt appertaining to the issue should be resolved in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">\u2022It is noted that one provision of rule 42, supra, reads: \u201cIf the independence of the inventions be clear, such limitation [that of the description, etc., in the application elected to be prosecuted] will be made before any action upon the merits; otherwise it may be made at any time before final action thereon, in the discretion of the examiner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">In the instant case, as has been said, the requirement for division and procedure under rule 42 was made of appellant \u201cbefore any action upon the merits.\u201d Both \u2018the Primary Examiner and the Classification Examiner manifestly regarded the \u201cin'dependence of the inventions\u201d to be \u201cclear,\u201d else the order would mot 'have \u2019been made, i Their 'judgment as experts is entitled to great,weight,'-and, as.of-course, if there be an-independence of invention as to the proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ess and product claims, no question of double patenting arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We are in agreement with the contention of appellant that the legal precedents are uniformly to the effect that \u201cdouble patenting is not sustainable when the product can be fabricated by processes other than that secured by the issued process patent,\u201d and this doubtless was the basis upon which division was required in the instant case. Providence Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. (76 U. S.) 788, 19 L. Ed. 566; Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. (78 U. S.) 516, 20 L. Ed. 33; Leeds &amp; Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., 213 U. S. 301, 29 S. Ct. 495, 53 L. Ed. 805; United States ex rel. Steinmetz v. Allen, 192 U. S. 543, 24 S. Ct. 416, 48 L. Ed. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In General Electric Co. v. P. R. Mallory &amp; Co., Inc., 298 F. 579, 584, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit said: \u201cThat double patenting exists here * * * is a new point of law. It rests on the fact that Just\u2019s original American application contained disclosure of several processes by which a single result \u2014 i. e., the tungsten filament of the patent in suit \u2014 could be attained. The Office required division; the issue of the patent at bar was delayed * * * but one divisional application, covering one process only, became No. 878,463 in 1908, four years before the master patent for the product came out of the Office; hence it is said double patenting resulted. There would be force in the argument, if there were but one process, and the only possible result thereof was the single product; but the more philosophical way to view the question is to ask whether the two patents (878,-463 and 1,018,502) cover the same invention, when properly construed. Thomson, etc., v. Elmira, etc., Co., 71 F. 396, 18 C. C. A. 145. They do not; one being only for a process of making, and the other for the thing made, with disclosure of another process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">To the same effect was a holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit in the case of Aurora Mantle &amp; Lamp Co. v. Kaufmann, 243 F. 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">It is not, of course, intended to indicate here that there should be any modification of the doctrine stated by this court in the case of In re Albert C. Fischer, 57 F.(2d) 369, 370, 19 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1077, where we said: \u201cWe think the weight of authority is to the effect that an inventor is only entitled to one patent for one invention, and that he cannot prolong his monopoly by claiming nothing more than the same invention in different language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The rule there stated was sound; but, under the circumstances of this case, where the Primary Examiner in requiring division must have been of the opinion that the inventive distinction between appellant\u2019s process and product claims was clear, his decision should not be lightly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">We do not find in either of the decisions of the Board of Appeals any close analysis or careful comparison of the process and product claims, and we are unable to agree with the board\u2019s holding that the affidavit of Kirschbraun was not pertinent to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Upon the contrary, the said affidavit seems to us to be pertinent, and we regard it as quite persuasive in support of what must have been the reasoning of the primary tribunals in directing the division. It shows, we think, that appellant\u2019s product as defined in the appealed claims may be produced by processes other than the processes patented. It, at least, creates a substantial and reasonable doubt which, in our view, should be resolved in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Additional authorities, having more or less bearing upon the issue here involved, are Benjamin Electric Mfg. Co. v. Dale Co. (C. C. A.) 158 F. 617; American Hatters &amp; Furriers Co., Inc., v. Danbury &amp; Bethel Fur Co. (D. C.) 47 F.(2d) 268; Fulton Co. v. Janesville Laboratories, Inc., et al. (C. C. A.) 21 F.(2d) 428; Independent Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Halliburton et al. (C. C. A.) 54 F.(2d) 900. See, also, decision of Commissioner of Patents Allen in Ex parte Davis, 1904 C. D. 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">The appeal is dismissed as to claim No. 11, and the decision of the Board of Appeals rejecting claims 5 and 12 upon the ground of double patenting is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
