Smith and Julia, his wife, against loss or damage by fire, on their frame building, in the sum of $10,000. On its policy defendant indorsed a mortgage clause, making loss thereon payable to the plaintiff, Emma Myrkle Harder, on her mortgage given by Smith and wife to her. Subsequently the mortgagors defaulted on the mortgage and foreclosure was determined on. Thereupon Smith, to avoid publicity on such foreclosure, executed a deed of the property to his nephew, Turner, and recorded it. The grantee paid no consideration and did not know a deed had been made to him until some time later. The plaintiff, who had no knowledge of Smith making the deed, placed her mortgage in the hands of a law firm, to have the same foreclosed. In proceeding to foreclosure the lawyers found Smith had conveyed and named Turner as a terre-tenant. Not knowing the property was insured or that plaintiff was assignee of the policy, the lawyers gave no notice to her. Under this state of facts the court refused to consider the policy forfeited under its provision \u201cthat the mortgagee * * * shall notify this company of any change of ownership * * <em>* </em>which shall come to the knowledge of said mortgagee.\u201d We here note the plaintiff\u2019s contention that Smith\u2019s deed to Turner, made without consideration, without Turner\u2019s knowledge, and without delivery to him, and which was executed with no purpose of vesting ownership in Turner, but as a mere incident in the contemplated divesting of the Smith mortgage by foreclosure, was not such a change of ownership as forfeited the policy. See Wiley v. London &amp; Lancashire Fire Ins. Co., 89 Conn. 35, 92 A. 678, and cases cited in De Armand v. Home Ins. Co. (C. C.) 28 F. 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-21\">Waiving such matter for the present, we pass to the question: Was the court in error in holding that the knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s lawyer of the deed from Smith to Turner was not knowledge by the plaintiff and gave the defendant no right to forfeit the policy? Viewing the language of the policy in its ordinary meaning, we have the word \u201cknowledge,\u201d standing alone, without qualification, no mention of \u201cconstructive knowledge,\u201d of \u201cimputed knowledge,\u201d or \u201cpresumed knowledge.\u201d Can there be any doubt that what was required here was just knowledge \u2014 knowing, really actually knowing ? The policy provides that whatever the \u201cchange of ownership\u201d was, it was to \u201ccome to the knowledge of said mortgagee,\u201d and in point of fact it never did come to her knowledge. The policy might have provided \u201cshall come to the knowledge of her agent,\u201d \u201cof her attorney,\u201d and the like, but it did not. So far as words make plain, the policy provided for her personal, individual knowledge, and to write into it \u201cher attorney\u2019s knowledge,\u201d and make knowledge by him knowledge by her where the attorney was employed simply to foreclose, had no connection with her insurance, and no knowledge thereof, would in effect make a new contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-22\">After consideration, we are of opinion the court committed no error in holding that change of ownership had not come to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>knowledge of the plaintiff mortgagee and the defendant had shown no right to forfeit the insurance policy. 'Its conclusion was supported by authority. See Concordia Fire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Bank (C. C. A.) 39 F.(2d) 826; New York Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Central Union Bank (C. C. A.) 65 F.(2d) 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
