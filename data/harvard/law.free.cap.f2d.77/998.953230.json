In the exercise of that discretion, the court below, in a careful order, has seen fit to grant an injunction against the defendant and require the plaintiff to give a protective bond. After full consideration, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s action and therefore dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal; but, to insure the prompt bringing of the case to final hearing, this order is made conditional that, unless the plaintiff proceeds to bring the case to final hearing and closes its testimony within ninety days from this date, the defendant may apply to this court for a modification of the order dismissing the appeal, for which purpose this court retains jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
