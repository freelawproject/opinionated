This court finds that there was evidence which, if believed by the jury, would support its verdict. Error is assigned and urged on the refusal of the District Court to direct the jury to find the appellant not guilty at the conclusion of the government\u2019s evidence, in refusing to direct the jury to find defendant not guilty at the close of all the evidence, in improperly admitting evidence, and unduly restricting the cross-examination of appellee\u2019s witnesses. In our judgment, no useful purpose would be served by discussing these alleged errors since no reversible error appears upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
