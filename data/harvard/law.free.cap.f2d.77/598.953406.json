Thereafter five creditors, having provable claims against the debtor of more than $1,000 in excess of the value of securities held by them, filed their answer and application for dismissal of the petition. Hearing was had, and the court set aside and vacated the order approving the debtor\u2019s petition, and dismissed the proceedings at the cost of the debtor. The debtor petitioned this court for an appeal, which was denied. Having obtained an order in the District Court allowing appeal, the debtor now seeks to have the order reviewed and reversed. The creditors move this court to dismiss the attempted appeal on the grounds: (1) That the order of the District Court was not a \u201ccontroversy in bankruptcy\u201d from which an appeal might be allowed under the provisions of section 24a of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by Act May 27, 1926, 11 USCA \u00a7 47 (a); (2). that the order was not \u201ca judgment refusing to adjudicate the defendant a bankrupt\u201d appealable under section 25a of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by Act May 27, 1926, 11 USCA \u00a7 48 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">This court has considered the question of appeals taken from orders entered in proceedings under section 77B in Credit Alliance Corporation v. Atlantic, Pacific &amp; Gulf Refining Co., 77 F.(2d) 595, and Vitagraph, Inc., v. St. Louis Properties Corporation, 77 F.(2d) 590, this day decided. Particularly in Credit Alliance Corporation v. Atlantic, Pacific &amp; Gulf Refining Co., where the trial court, after hearing, denied a creditor\u2019s petition to vacate an order approving the petition of a debtor under section 77B and overruled a creditor\u2019s motion to dismiss the proceedings, we held that the orders were only appealable under section 24b, as amended by Act May 27, 1926, 11 USCA \u00a7 47 (b), as \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy\u201d which this court has jurisdiction to superintend and revise in matter of law upon appeal to be allowed in the discretion of the appellate court. We think the orders of the District Court here presented are of exactly the same nature as were the orders which we considered in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-20\">There the creditors were unsuccessful in the District Court in their effort to have the order approving the debtors\u2019 petitions vacated and the approval was adhered to. Here the creditors were successful, and the prior order of approval was vacated. But the nature of the proceedings is not changed by their outcome. They remain \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy\u201d appealable under section 24b, as amended, and not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>On the hearing of the application for appeal made to this court, the debtor presented the assignments of error relied upon and was heard in oral argument. The grounds upon which the discretion of the court was invoked were adequately presented, and, although the ruling was made without opinion published, it was made in the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Though not pertinent to the decision in this case, we take occasion to say that it seems to have been assumed by counsel in some cases that this court would grant appeals as a matter of course to review the proceedings of the several inferior courts of bankruptcy within its jurisdiction. But such is not the practice of this court. Section 24b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, confers jurisdiction upon the Courts of Appeals <em>\u201cto superintend and </em>revise in matter of law * * * the proceedings of the several inferior courts of bankruptcy within their jurisdiction,\u201d but it also provides that \u201csuch power shall be exercised \"by appeal * * * to be allowed in the discretion of the appellate court.\u201d For reading of the section, see Rutherford v. Elliott (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 956; Stanley\u2019s Incorporated Store, etc., v. Earl (C. C. A.) 25 F.(2d) 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
