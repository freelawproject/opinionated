The only question involved is whether the association is a social club or organization within the meaning of the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-20\">The District Court (7 F. Supp; 815, 818) found that \u201cthe main purposes and-activities of the club were * * * the serving of food, and * * * that the social aspects were merely incidental thereto.\u201d Having found these facts, among others, it ruled that it was not a social club or organization within the meaning of section 501 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA \u00a7 872 note) and section 413 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA \u00a7 872). See Regulations 43, Arts. 35 and 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-21\">In view of the facts found we think the ruling was correct, and the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-22\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
