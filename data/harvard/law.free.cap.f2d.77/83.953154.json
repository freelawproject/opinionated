The only question presented is whether the District Court had jurisdiction to vacate the order of dismissal after the expiration of the term in which the dismissal was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The record discloses the following facts: In 1929 the appellees, as plaintiffs, brought an action against appellant, Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company of Maryland, as the surety on an injunction bond, alleging that the surety company was liable on the bond for damages suffered by plaintiffs. After trial and submission of the cause to the court below, it was ordered, on June 2, 1930, \u201cthat judgment be entered in favor of plaintiffs, with costs,\u201d and \u201cthat the question of damages be and is hereby referred to U. S. Commissioner Arthur G. Fisk to hear evidence, make findings and suggest conclusions of law.\u201d Testimony was taken before the commissioner, and the matter was submitted to him, but, before a decision and before the time for filing a final brief had expired, the commissioner resigned, and the order of reference to him was terminated by order of the court dated May 9, 1931. By the same order A. B. Kreft was appointed special master \u201cto hear evidence, make findings and suggest conclusions of law, as to the matter of damages herein.\u201d After the appointment of the special master, it appears that the parties, through their respective attorneys, several times discussed what action should be taken, and were unable to agree thereon; the plaintiffs desiring to submit the matter on the testimony taken before the commissioner, and the surety company insisting that the testimony be heard again by the special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">On July 11, 1932, the case was dismissed by the court for want of prosecution, pursuant to rule 38 of the court, which provides that cases pending for more than one year without any proceedings having been taken therein during such time \u201cshall be dismissed, as of course, for want of prosecution by the court on its own motion.\u201d On April 15, 1933, at a subsequent term of court, plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the order of dismissal \u201cupon the ground that said order was without jurisdiction, that the same was made through the inadvertence of some officer of the court or of the court, and that said order did not divest this court of jurisdiction to vacate the same.\u201d On May 22, 1933, the motion to vacate the order of dismissal was granted.. Such a motion to vacate is in the nature of a common-law writ of error coram nobis, or coram vobis, the modern substitute for which is a proceeding by motion. See cases infra, and Freeman on Judgments (5th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 220, 256, pp. 432, 433, 514, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Where, as in this case, there has been a reference to a special master, the clerk\u2019s record would not show proceedings in respect to such reference unless some report be made or other action taken in respect thereto. The fact that the clerk\u2019s record might show no action taken within the year, it would not follow therefrom that no such action was taken. In such case the clerk\u2019s record would not be sufficient to support an order of dismissal. If, as' in this case, the order of dismissal was based solely on the clerk\u2019s record, the error thus made would be within the broad definition of clerical error, which may be corrected after the term.
