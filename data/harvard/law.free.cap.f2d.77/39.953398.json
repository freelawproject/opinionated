The bill was filed by appellant as a citizen of the state of Idaho, shortly after he had reached his majority, in the year 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-27\">Appellant is the youngest child of the decedent, and is one of the devisees under his father\u2019s will. Other devisees or legatees are the widow, two sons and four daughters of the decedent. Of these, the two sons and two of the daughters are not named as defendants in the complaint, nor is the omission accounted for therein. In his brief appellant states that the two daughters, Frances and Anna, died before the legacies matured. No explanation appears why the two other sons were not made parties defendant. William George, one of the sons, testified at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-28\">In our view of the case, it is not necessary to consider the merits of the controversy either as set forth in the pleadings or as disclosed by the evidence. Accordingly, we will state only the facts'pertinent to the question of jurisdiction, on which rests our determination of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-29\">The appellant is a citizen of Idaho, and all of the appellees save the Federal Land Bank of Spokane are citizens of Montana, or, if corporations, are organized under the laws of the latter state. The land bank is a corporation organized under an act of Congress, and has its principal place of business at Spokane, Wash. Jurisdiction of this case was alleged by reason of the diversity of citizenship of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-30\">William Montgomery died testate at Beaverhead county, Mont., on October 24, 1919. On November 25, 1919, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>filed a waiver of statutory notice, by which consent was given that hearing on the petition for the probate of the will might be had on that day. The waiver purports to - bear the signatures of the widow and six of the children of the testator.' As to James, Anna, -Elizabeth, and the appellant, after each of whose purported signatures appears the word \u201cMinor,\u201d appellant alleges that the signatures are forgeries, perpetrated by the widow at the \u201cinstance and request\u201d of J. H. Gilbert, one of the appellees, who at that time was cashier of the Bank of Dillon, another appellee, and named in the will as one of the executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">On November 25, 1919, the Montana court entered an order admitting the will to probate, and issued letters testamentary to Gilbert, who thereupon subscribed the oath and assumed the duties of executor. The order admitting the will to probate recited that \u201cdue proof\u201d had been \u201cmade that notice has been duly given of the time appointed for proving said Will and for hearing said petition, according to law, to all parties interested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">At the time the will was probated, appellant was less than ten years old. In his complaint appellant alleges that \u201cno copy of. any notice of the time appointed for the probate was ever addressed\u201d to the minor heirs, James, Anna, and himself, or to J. B. Poindexter, named as coexecutor in the will, and at that time residing at Honolulu, Hawaii. The appellant testified that no guardian was ever appointed for him during his minority, and that he \u201cdid not have any recollection\u201d of there ever having been any notice served upon him of the application to probate his father\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On this subject of waiver and alleged lack of notice, the court below made the following observations :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u201c * * * The order of probate of the will and letters to Gilbert recites that \u2018due proof\u2019 was \u2018made that notice has been duly given,\u2019 and there is no substantial evidence to the contrary. Inheritance the creation of statute is subject to statutory regulations, and probate is so far in rem that wills may be probated and estates administered without notice to or repr\u00e9sentation for minors (and adults too for that matter), save to the extent required by statute, which in this state does stipulate for notice \u2018addressed\u2019 to the heir and \u2018deposited in the postoffice,\u2019 or \u2018personal service is equivalent.\u2019 Plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he has \u2018no recollection\u2019 of receiving any such notice, may be taken as true and\u2019\u2019yet notice duly given. Notice mailed is legal and constructive notice even though not received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">\u201cA waiver of notice in plaintiff\u2019s behalf by some one signed and found in the files, must be presumed to have been as it should have been ignored by the Court if brought to its attention, for that a minor cannot waive notice or process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">\u201cStrange enough, the plaintiff presented the Clerk of the probate court as a witness who produced some of the probate records. He was not even asked whether or not the statutory notice had been given by him; so if necessary the presumption prevails he performed his official duty and did give it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">\u201cIt follows that the probate court had jurisdiction of plaintiff, and accordingly follows the usual consequence. That is, though plaintiff a minor and unrepresented other than by the Court at least obligated to protect his interests whether or not it did he none the less had his \u2018day in court,\u2019 and is bound and concluded by the proceedings even as adults in like circumstances, save certain statutory rights are his to be timely exercised in the probate or some other court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">In this connection it should be observed that the order of the state probate court authorizing the executor Gilbert to sell all of the real property belonging to the estate recited, \u201cdue proof of the due publication of a copy of said order to show cause having been made as required by law and the order of this Court,\u201d and that it appeared to the court it was \u201cfor the best interests of the estate and all interested therein, including the minor heirs, that said real estate be sold and that the proceeds thereof be applied upon the payment of the debts of said deceased.\u201d Appellant alleges in his complaint that there was never \u201cany necessity why any executor should have sold any of plaintiff\u2019s said land for the payment of any debts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">Paragraph 10 of the will reads as follows : \u201cI direct that my estate shall be settled as rapidly as possible, with due regard to the interest of my heirs, and upon distribution, the said J. B. Poindexter and J. H. Gilbert shall become trustees of the property remaining. I direct that they shall hold and operate the same as such trustees for the benefit of my said heirs respectively in the same manner as I have heretofore managed said property and until my youngest son shall arrive at the age of twenty-one (21) years, and I give them full power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sell my part of the property as they shall deem best, and to borrow money for the operation of the business and execute such necessary instruments to secure such loans as may be required or deemed \u00abessential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Attached as an exhibit to the complaint is the state probate court\u2019s \u201cdecree of settlement of account and order discharging executor,\u201d directing the executor to apply the balance of cash remaining in his hands to payment of the debts due to two banks. That decree, dated February 23, 1926, recites that the estate is insolvent, and that all its property has been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The appellant\u2019s complaint prayed that appellees be required to set forth the nature of their claims to the property therein described, and that all such adverse claims be determined by decree of the court; that the court make a complete adjudication of the title to the lands therein described, the title to which was sought to be quieted, and that appellant\u2019s title thereto be quieted; that the court direct the cancellation of all instruments constituting clouds upon appellant\u2019s title to the real property in question, or any part thereof, and direct the execution of conveyances where necessary, or the doing of any \u201cother act of a personal nature\u201d to give appellant the relief sought by him; that, if any conveyance, etc., shall not be made within the time specified in the decree, then the decree shall have the same effect as if such conveyance, etc., had been duly executed; that it be decreed that the appellees and all other persons have no right to the real property and that appellant\u2019s title thereto is valid; that the appellees and all other persons be forever debarred from asserting any claim to such property, adversely to appellant; that it be decreed, so far as appellant is concerned, \u201cthat the order, judgments, and decrees of the district court of Beaverhead County, Montana, made and entered in the administration of the estate of William Montgomery, deceased, and complained of in this complaint are illegal and that the same be held for naught in so far as they assume and purport to divest plaintiff of the ownership of the real estate described in the complaint\u201d; that the appellee J. H. Gilbert be required \u201cto make a full and complete account to the court and to the plaintiff of all personal property and money received by him or taken into his possession as executor of the will of William Montgomery, deceased, and the value thereof, and all sums of money received by him on sales of any such personal property, and that defendant The First National Bank of Dillon be required to make a full and complete account to the court and to the plaintiff of all sums of money received by it from the said J. H. Gilbert, and belonging to said estate\u201d; and that the appellant recover \u201cone-fifth of said personal property or one-fifth of the value thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The appellees filed motions to dismiss on the following grounds: (l)That it appeared from the face of the complaint that the court below had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit; (2) that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause in equity; (3) that there was a fatal defect of parties defendant, in that all of the heirs, devisees, and legatees were necessary and indispensable parties, \u201cand more particularly, Cecilia L. Montgomery, the widow of said deceased and the mother of said plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The court denied the motions. Leave was granted to amend the complaint by interlineation, adding Mrs. Montgomery as a party, and she later filed a disclaimer of any interest \u201cin any property, claim, or matter involved in this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">After a trial on the merits, the court below made findings that \u201cstatutory and due notice of the probate of the will and issuance of letters testamentary was given to plaintiff as in the probate court\u2019s order recited,\u201d and that \u201cthe conversion in the complaint charged is not proven.\u201d Accordingly, a decree of dismissal was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">There are a number of serious infractions of the rules of this court, attributable to the appellant. Twenty-five assignments of error appear in the record. Several of them are more than a typewritten page in length, and contain tabular and argumentative matter which has no place in an assignment of error. The Supreme Court and this court have repeatedly expressed disapproval of a multiplicity of assignments. After stating that he relies upon each assignment, appellant sets out in his brief twenty-six specifications of error. The additional specification, not found among the assignments, appears to be No. 20, which reads as follows: \u201cThe Court erred in holding that the State Court ever had jurisdiction to probate the will as against plaintiff or that he was ever brought by service, constructive or personal within the jurisdiction of that court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">The record, presented in forma pauperis, containing 848 typewritten pages, is not alphabetically indexed. The appellant\u2019s open<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ing brief, 131 pages in length, and his_ reply brief, contain no subject indexes, as required by the rules of this court. All these various violations of the rules have unnecessarily added to the burdens of this court in considering this appeal. The court below, in allowing an appeal in forma pauperis, admonished the appellant \u201cto strictly follow the equity rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Respecting the question of the jurisdiction of the probate court in Montana, we are of the opinion that the record in that court does not contradict the recital in the order admitting the will to probate that due proof was made \u201cthat notice has been duly given of the time appointed for proving said will and for hearing said petition, according to law, to all parties interested.\u201d In Charlebois v. Bourdon, 6 Mont. 373, 377, 12 P. 775, 778, the court said: \u201cIf the record of the proceedings by which the judgment was obtained was silent, then everything necessary to the validity of the judgment and its verity would be conclusively presumed; but no such presumptions arise when the record of the proceedings shows affirmatively that the recitals contained in the judgment are untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In the Montana probate record before us, it cannot be said the statement of the proceedings \u201cshows affirmatively that the recitals contained in the judgment are untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Wliile the Supreme Court of Montana in a more recent decision held that \u201cprobate proceedings generally are quasi in rem,\u201d in which \u201cnotice to the heirs and others interested and an opportunity to be heard are essential\u201d (Lamont v. Vinger, 61 Mont. 530, 542, 545, 202 P. 769, 773, 774), there appears nothing in that decision in conflict with the rule applied in the Charlebois Case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">It is not questioned, however, that the Montana probate court had jurisdiction over the subject-matter; and we hold that the record establishes that the state court likewise had jurisdiction over the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">It next becomes necessary to inquire into the jurisdiction of the court below. All the devisees and legatees under William Montgomery\u2019s will should have been made parties defendant in the court below. We can find no justification in the record or in the briefs for this want of parties. The two brothers of appellant should have been included among the defendants. We will assume that Mrs. Montgomery, the widow of the decedent, is a party defendant, since her name was, by leave of court, included by interlineation among those of the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">In Bland v. Fleeman (D. C.) 29 F. 669, the syllabus,\u201d prepared by the court, states : \u201c6. All the heirs to an estate of a decedent, in a suit against an administrator of such estate charging him with having fraudulently converted the assets of the estate, are necessary parties to such suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">See, also, Hoe v. Wilson, 9 Wall. (76 U. S.) 501, 503, 504, 19 L. Ed. 762; Loomis v. Rosenthal (C. C.) 67 F. 369, 371; Carrau v. O\u2019Calligan (C. C. A. 9) 125 F. 657, 671, 672, affirmed sub nom. Farrell v. O\u2019Brien (O\u2019Callaghan v. O\u2019Brien), 199 U. S. 89, 25 S. Ct. 727, 734, 50 L. Ed. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">We come now to a consideration of the question of jurisdiction of a federal court to set aside the decree of a probate court of a state, in whole or in part. This is precisely what the appellant, in his complaint, prayed that the court below should do; that is to say: \u201cThat it be * * * decreed, so far as plaintiff is concerned, that the orders, judgments, and decrees of the district court of Beaverhead County, Montana, made and entered in the administration of the estate of William Montgomery, deceased, and complained of in this complaint, are illegal and that the same be held for naught in so far as they assume and purport to divest plaintiff of the ownership of the real estate described in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">The fundamental question of the lack of jurisdiction of an equity court to set aside probate proceedings is fully dealt with in the case of Simmons v. Saul, 138 U. S. 439, 446, 447, 459, 460, 11 S. Ct. 369, 376, 34 L. Ed. 1054. In that case the allegation and the prayer of the bill were similar to those now before us. It was alleged that the probate court that rendered the judgment was without jurisdiction; that its proceedings in the matter did not conform to the statute under the authority of which it assumed to act; that the judgment itself was obtained by a fraud upon the court; and that necessarily the pretended succession sale had in pursuance thereof, from which the appellee therein derived title to the lands with respect to which he committed the wrongs complained of, was illegal and void as to the complainants. The prayer of the bill was, inter alia, that the complainants might be adjudged and decreed to be the true legal representatives of the decedent; that the proceedings in the state court in relation to the sale of the land claim might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>adjudged null and void; that an account might be taken, by and under the direction of the federal court, of the timber and other products removed from the land by the defendant; and that the defendant might be decreed to pay to the complainants the highest value of the lands, etc. The charges of fraud in that case were no more sweeping than the ones now before us, and were such as would ordinarily move the conscience of the chancellor. Yet the Supreme Court, mindful of the narrow limitations of equity jurisdiction in probate matters, declined to interfere, and affirmed the decree of the lower court dismissing the bill, on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The closing paragraphs of the opinion in Simmons v. Saul, supra, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cThe case of Broderick\u2019s Will, 21 Wall. [88 U. S.] 503 [22 L. Ed. 599], upon this point is absolutely conclusive against the appellants. That was a bill in equity, brought by the alleged heirs at law of Broderick to set aside and annul the probate of his will in the probate court of California, and to recover the property belonging to his estate, or to have the purchasers at the executor\u2019s sale thereof, and those deriving title from them, charged as trusl ees for the benefit of complainants. The bill alleged that the will was forged; that the grant of letters testamentary and the orders for the sale of the property were obtained by fraud, all of which proceedings, as well as the death of the decedent, were unknown to the complainants until within three years before the filing of the bill. A demurrer to the bill was overruled, and the case was appealed to this court. It was held, Mr. Justice Bradley delivering the opinion, that a court of equity will not entertain jurisdiction to set aside the probate of a will, on the ground of fraud, mistake, or forgery, this being within the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court; and that it will not give relief by charging the purchasers at the executor\u2019s sale, under the orders of the probate court, and those deriving title from them, as trustees, in favor of a third person, alleged to be defrauded by the forged or fraudulent will, where the court of probate could afford relief, in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cWith the single exception that that case was brought to set aside the probate of a will, and this was brought to set aside the granting of letters of administration upon a succession, the two cases are as much alike as two photographs of the same person, the lineaments of the alleged fraud being more distinctly brought out in the bill in the case of Broderick\u2019s Will than in the bill in this case. Both were bills in equity, brought by the alleged heirs at law of a decedent to set aside and annul a decree of a court of probate, and all the subsequent proceedings, including the order of sale and the sale itself. Both alleged fraud in the procurement of the respective decrees, and knowledge of the fraud by the defendants, \u2014 actual knowledge in the Broderick Case, and constructive knowledge in this case. Both showed a long period of delay, \u2014 nine years in the Broderick Case, and eighteen in this case; and both set up ignorance of the facts as the excuse for laches; and in both cases, according to the averments of the bill in each, the probate court had adequate power to afford relief. See, also, Ellis v. Davis, 109 U. S. 485, 3 S. Ct. 327 [27 L. Ed. 1006], We think the decision in that case is applicable to the whole of this case upon the question of fraud, and thus obviates the necessity of adverting any further to the question of the establishment of a trust, as against the defendant, in favor of the complainants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">See, also, Christianson v. King County, 239 U. S. 356, 372, 373, 36 S. Ct. 114, 60 L. Ed. 327; In re McDonald\u2019s Estate (D. C.) 42 F.(2d) 266, 268, 269; Dallas Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Holloway (D. C.) 50 F.(2d) 197, 198, 199; Grimes v. Grimes (D. C.) 52 F.(2d) 171, 177, 178; Carrau v. O\u2019Calligan, supra, 125 F. 657, at pages 667, 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Bearing in mind the test of a probate court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction laid down in Simmons v. Saul, supra, namely, that it should be able to \u201cafford relief, in whole or in part,\u201d we turn to the Constitution and statutes of Montana for the measure of the probate court\u2019s power in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Under the Constitution of the state, the District Court has \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all cases at law and in equity\u201d and \u201cof all matters of probate.\u201d Article 8, \u00a7 11. This language has been transported totidem verbis into section 8829 of the Revised Codes of Montana, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The Codes contain elaborate provisions governing \u201cProbate Proceedings,\u201d consisting of 411 sections, grouped into 39 chapters. Section 10026 requires that copies of the notice of the time appointed for the probate of the will must be addressed to the heirs and executors of the testator. Section 10042 permits any person interested to contest the will or its probate at any time within one year after such probate. Section 10048 reads as follows: \u201cIf no person, within one year after the probate of a will, contest the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>sa\u00edne or the validity thereof, the probate of the will is conclusive; saving to infants and persons of unsound mind a like period of one year after their r\u00e9spective disabilities are removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">-\u25a0 Sections 10235 and 10236 indicate the necessity for making all devisees and legatees parties to a suit under the will, which the appellant herein has failed to do. The former provides that the estate, real and personal, given by will to legatees or devisees, is liable for the debts, expenses of administration, and family expenses, in proportion to value. The latter sets forth that, when an estate is sold for payment of debts, all the devisees or legatees must contribute according to their respective interests. Section 10243 declares that an aggrieved party may recover, in an action on the executor\u2019s bond, or otherwise, for any neglect or misconduct. Section 10244 provides that any executor who fraudulently sells any real estate of a decedent \u201cis liable in double the value of the land sold, as liquidated damages.\" By section 10245, the period of limitation for actions to recover any estate 'sold by an executor is fixed at three years fro'm the date of the settlement of the executor\u2019s final-account, while section 10246 provides that, as to minors, the period of limitation shall not commence to run before they reach their majority. According to section -10328, the probate court\u2019s order of distribution \u201cis conclusive as to the rights of heirs, legatees, or devisees, subject only to be reversed, set aside, of modified on appeal.\u201d Section 10333 reads as follows: \u201cThe final settlement of an estate, as in sections 10318 to 10354 provided, shall not prevent a subsequent issue of letters testamentary or of administration, or of administration with the will annexed, if other property of the estate be discovered, or if it become necessary or proper for any cause that letters should be again issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">And, in part, section 10352: \u201cWhere any trust has been created by. or under any will to continue after distribution, the district court shall not lose jurisdiction of the estate by final distribution, but shall retain jurisdiction thereof for the purpose of the settlement of accounts under the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">From the foregoing it will be seen that .the laws of Montana provide ample means for the revision and correction of probate .decrees by the probate courts, themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">*\u2022 The appellant, however, relies upon the \u25a0following passage in Farrell v. O\u2019Brien, supra, as giving the federal court jurisdiction of his suit: \u201cSecond. That where a state law, statutory or customary, gives to the citizens of the state, in an action or suit inter partes, the right to question at law the probate of a will or to assail probate in a suit in equity, the courts of the United States, in administering the rights of citizens of other states or aliens, will enforce such remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Pursuing this argument, the appellant asserts that, under the doctrine of Hoppin v. Long, 74 Mont. 558, 241 P. 636, he \u201ccould have been and would have been granted the same relief by the District Court in Montana, sitting in equity.\u201d In that case the guardian of an insane woman alleged in his complaint that his ward had had no notice whatever of the proceedings in her son\u2019s estate. In the court\u2019s statement of the case, however, we find the following assertion: \u201c * * * Where, as in this case, no mention is made in the petition [for distribution] of an heir laboring under such disability and residing without the state, the decree is certainly voidable on behalf of such an heir, and the statutory notice cannot bar her right to appeal to a court of equity for her day in court and the establishment of her rights, if any she has, in and to the property of the decedent, at least where title thereto remains in the original distributee; and in this case we need go no farther than this.\u201d 74 Mont. 558, 575, 241 P. 636, 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">In the instant case different facts are presented. The appellant was a resident of Beaverhead county, Mont., at the time of the hearing of Gilbert\u2019s petition for letters testamentary, according to the allegation of appellant\u2019s own complaint, and the petition for the probate of the will set forth the appellant\u2019s name, kinship to the decedent, age, and address. These facts, in connection with the recital in the court\u2019s order admitting the will to probate, to the effect that \u201cdue proof\u201d had been \u201cmade that notice (had) been duly given of the time appointed for proving said Will and for hearing said petition, according to law, to all parties interested,\u201d was sufficient to give the probate court jurisdiction in proceedings quasi in rem.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">It is true that in Hoppin v. Long, supra, the Supreme Court of Montana stated that \u201cthe power of a court of equity to grant relief from a judgment obtained by fraud is inherent\u201d; that such power \u201cdoes <em>not </em>depend upon statute,\u201d and \u201cextends to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>crees of distribution in probate proceedings.\u201d 74 Mont. 575, 578, 579, 241 P. 636, 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">But the Montana court added the following important limitation to its statement by-quoting (74 Mont. 575, at page 579, 241 P. 636, at page 645) from the case of Clark v. Clark, 64 Mont. 386, 389, 392, 210 P. 93, 94, 95: \u201cNot every fraud committed in the course of a judicial determination will furnish ground for such relief. The acts for which a judgment or decree may be set aside or annulled have reference only to fraud which is extrinsic or collateral to the matter tried by the court, and not to fraud in the matter on which the judgment was rendered. * * * What, then, is meant by the expression \u2018fraud which is extrinsic or collateral to the matter tried by the court?\u2019 It is extrinsic or collateral within the meaning of the rule, when the effect of it is to prevent the unsuccessful party from having a trial or from presenting his case fully, as, for instance, keeping him away from court by false promise of compromise, or purposely keeping him in ignorance of the pendency of the action, or where an attorney fraudulently pretends to represent a party and connives at his defeat, or, being regularly employed, sells out his client\u2019s interest (15 R. C. L. 763), or where a party residing without the jurisdiction of the court is induced by false pretenses or representations to come within the jurisdiction for the sole purpose of getting personal service of process upon him, or where, through the instrumentality of the successful party, the witnesses of his adversary are forcibly or illegally detained from court or bribed to disobey the subpoena served upon them, or where a judgment is obtained in violation of an agreement between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellant\u2019s complaint discloses no substantial allegation of \u201cextrinsic or collateral\u201d fraud, such as is illustrated in the foregoing excerpt.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Appellant has not made out a case for the intervention of a court of equity under the jurisprudence of Montana. It therefore follows, under the authority of Farrell v. O\u2019Brien, supra, that the court below had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, not only because of the want of necessary parties defendant, but also because of want of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The court below dismissed the suit on the merits. While we are of the opinion that the dismissal should have been on jurisdictional grounds, it is well settled that an affirmance need not be based on the same grounds as those which influenced the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
