No patent was relied on, but, to illustrate a printing cylinder made in a single piece, the Examiner cited patent 1,261,642, issued to Emil T. Neben, April 2, 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-29\">In its original opinion the Board of Appeals rested its decision upon the same ground, but indicated that the claims might have been rejected solely upon Neben as well. A petition, which the Board construed as a petition for reconsideration, was granted, and in its second decision it again rested rejection upon the original ground, but also specifically included \u201ca further rejection on the patent to Neben.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-30\">The appealed claims read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-31\">\u201c12. As an. article of manufacture, a design printing ring comprising a plurality of segments united in ring form by partially melting the metal of the segments along their meeting edges at the inner sides thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201c13. As an article of manufacture, a design printing ring, comprising three cast stereotype metal segments united in ring form by partially melting the metal of the segments along their meeting edges inside the ring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">We quote allowed claim 10 for the purpose of showing the process in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201c10. The herein described method of making design printing cylinders; consisting in preparing the design in bas-relief on a plate, making a matrix from such plate, casting a seini-cylindric stereotype plate from such matrix, trimming such plate to a segment of less size containing a complete section of the design to insure registration of the edges of the design thereon with the design on the abutting edges of adjacent segments, assembling a plurality of such segments in a circle with their edges abutting, partially melting the abutting edges of the plates on the inner sides thereof to unite them into a continuous ring, and assembling such rings on a supporting roll.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The claims themselves seem sufficiently to disclose the character of the article. Appellant makes segments of a cylinder instead of making an entire cylinder in one operation, and unites the segments into a unit, as described in the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The Neben patent is entitled \u201cMold for casting peripherally-closed relief-engraved printing-cylinders,\u201d and each of the claims is limited to the mold; there being none for a printing-cylinder per se. The specification, however, discloses a printing cylinder made in one piece and no question is raised concerning the validity of Neben as a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">It is conceded, in effect, that from viewing the surface of a Neben cylinder and the surface of a cylinder made by the process of appellant no distinction of moment would be discernible. In other words, after appellant has united his segments, he has a cylinder which is as much a unit as is the cylinder originally made as a unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">In view of this showing, it does not seem to us essential to enter upon a discussion and determination of the issue respecting appellant\u2019s right to product claims which describe the product only in terms of the method of its production.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Appellant concedes that the general rule is' that claims so defined are not allowable but points' to authorities upholding such claims in exceptional cases, where it was found that the products could not be described in any other manner, and insists that his case constitutes a similarly exceptional case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">We feel convinced that, even were appellant\u2019s cylinder described in product terms, without reference to the method of its production, it would still have to be rejected upon the disclosures of the Neben patent, and that the method of making it cannot properly be held to lend patentability to it. In other words, while appellant has developed a new process for making a printing cylinder, he has not produced a new product patentably distinct from the old. In re Charles R. Butler, 37 F.(2d) 623, 17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 810; In re Robert H. Lawson, 39 F.(2d) 667, 17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1006; In re Holmes, 63 F.(2d) 642, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
