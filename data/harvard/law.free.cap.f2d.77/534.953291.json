It is urged that the claim on appeal is likewise allowable over the cited art.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cEach particular case presents for consideration facts peculiar to itself and must be decided on its merits. It is our opinion that there clearly would be no invention in providing the caps of Delaize and De Wagner with the particular type of ornamentation disclosed in Budd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">It is argued by counsel for appellant that the Budd reference does not disclose \u201cfacets which \u00e1re substantially vertical as in applicant\u2019s design, that there is no crowned top surface, and that there is no merging of flat substantially triangular facets with a crowned surface.\u201d It is frankly conceded, however, by counsel that the question of patentability should be determined not from a consideration of slight details of similarity or differences between applicant\u2019s design and the references, but rather from a consideration and comparison of applicant\u2019s design and the references in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">It has been established by appellant that the bottle cap, embodying the design in question, <em>is </em>commercially successful, and it is conceded by the Solicitor for the Patent Office that it is novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">It may be, as argued by counsel for appellant, that there are some slight differences in the design on the periphery of the cup, as disclosed in the patent to Budd, and the design on the periphery of appellant\u2019s bottle cap. There is, however, certainly no substantial difference between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">It seems obvious that a designer or artisan with the references before him would have little difficulty in producing appellant\u2019s design. It is true that some slight modifications of the references were required in order to produce it. However, such modifications are so slight as, in our opinion, to call for nothing more than the ordinary skill of the designer.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">We are in entire accord with the conclusion reached by the tribunals of the Patent Office, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
