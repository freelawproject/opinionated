Within the triangle, in smaller letters, appears the word \u201cQuality,\u201d which was - disclaimed apart from the mark as shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-24\">Each of the triunals of the Patent Office concluded that the dominant feature of the two marks was the word \u201cAce\u201d; that the word \u201cPenn,\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark, was an abbreviation of the word \u201cPennsylvania\u201d; that it was used in a purely geographical sense; and that as each of the marks was used upon lubricating oils, their concurrent use by the registrant, the Midwest Oil Company, and the appellant would be likely to cause confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-25\">In his decision, the Examiner, among other things, stated that: \u201cBoth marks are substantially the word \u2018Ace\u2019. The applicant has been allowed the notation \u2018Penn Ace\u2019, but if is believed that applicant\u2019s goods would be known and called for as \u2018Ace\u2019 motor oil. The smaller type of the word \u2018Penn\u2019 corresponding in size to that of the words \u2018Motor Oil\u2019 would quite probably lead to the association of the words \u2018Penn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Motor Oil\u2019 in a purely descriptive sense. Even if the goods were known and called for as \u2018Penn Ace\u2019, it is thought the \u2018Penn\u2019 portion of the mark would suggest .merely that the particular oils to which the mark was applied were \u2018Ace\u2019 oils from Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In affirming the decision of the Examiner, the Commissioner, among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\u201cA mere inspection of the drawing filed by the applicant discloses at once that the predominating part of its mark is the word \u2018Ace\u2019. It appears in the most advantageous location and in much larger type than any of the other words. It is true that the word \u2018Penn\u2019 is also employed but it appears in a less prominent manner and, furthermore, it is used purely in its geographical sense. It is common knowledge that Pennsylvania produces' high grade oils and any one seeing the abbreviation of the state employed in conjunction with lubricating oils would immediately and quite correctly conclude that they were products of the state in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cInasmuch as the predominating part of the applicant\u2019s mark is the same as that of the registrant and inasmuch as there would undoubtedly be a tendency to refer to applicant\u2019s product as \u2018Ace\u2019 oils, it is concluded that the applicant is not entitled to registration. Even if the oils were known as \u2018Penn Ace\u2019 oils, it is believed that the trade would'confuse them with the \u2018Ace\u2019 oils of the registrant, since the latter is free at any time to sell Pennsylvania oils and SO' designate them by the employment of an appropriate, geographical term, such as \u2018Penn\u2019 or \u2018Pennsylvania\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In his decision, the Commissioner cited the case of Miller Becker Co. v. King of Clubs, Inc., 56 F.(2d) 883, 19 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1024, in support of his holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">It is contended by counsel for appellant that the marks should be considered as a whole; that, when so considered, they are not confusingly similar; and that the words \u201cPenn,\u201d \u201cMotor Oil,\u201d and \u201c100% Pure Pennsylvania,\u201d together with the picture of the ace of spades playing card, are sufficient to distinguish appellant\u2019s mark from that of the reference cited by the tribunals of the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">It is further contended by counsel for appellant that the registrant is not entitled to a monopoly of the word \u201cA'ce,\u201d as a trade-mark for use on lubricating oils, because, it is argued, the word is publici juris, and, in support of that proposition, counsel stated that the trade-marks \u201cAce High,\u201d \u201cAcewood,\u201d \u201cAce-ite,\u201d \u201cAseol,\u201d and \u201cAseco\u201d have been registered in the United States Patent Office, for use on lubricating oils.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">\u2022 It appears from the record that the trade-mark \u201cAce High\u201d is also owned by the registrant, Midwest Oil Company, and that, of those referred to by counsel for appellant, it was the only mark registered prior to the registration of the trade-mark \u201cAce Quality,\u201d hereinbefore described.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">We are in entire agreement with the tribunals of the Patent Qffice that the word \u201cAce\u201d is the dominant feature of appellant\u2019s mark, as well as that of the registrant; that the word \u201cPenn,\u201d appearing in appellant\u2019s mark, was obviously intended to indicate to \u2022 the purchasing public that the oil upon which appellant\u2019s trade-mark was used was, as represented by the\u2019 words \u201c100% Pure Pennsylvania,\u201d appearing in the mark, although disclaimed by appellant, high-grade Pennsylvania oil; that the registrant was entitled to use its mark on Pennsylvania oil, as well as oils produced in other states; and that, considering the marks as a whole, their concurrent use by the respective parties would be likely to cause confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">If appellant is entitled to register its trade-mark, it might substitute for the word \u201cPenn,\u201d the name of each state, in abbreviated form or otherwise, in which oil is produced, and register each of those marks, with obviously disastrous results to the registrant of the marks \u201cAce Quality\u201d and \u201cAce High.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">But, it is argued by counsel for appellant, the word \u201cAce\u201d is publici juris, and therefore the registrant is not entitled to its exclusive use in a trade-mark for use on lubricating oils.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">Whether the word \u201cAce\u201d is publici juris or not, the registrant, of course, is not entitled to the exclusive use of- it for use on lubricating oils. However, in order to entitle appellant to register a mark in which it appears, the other features of its mark must be such that, when considered as a whole, it will not be confusingly similar with the registrant\u2019s mark. See Miller Becker Co. v. King of Clubs, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">Without intending to suggest that any of the registered marks referred to by appellant, to wit, \u201cAcewood,\u201d \u201cAce-ite,\u201d \u201cAse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ol,\u201d and \u201cAseco,\u201d each of which was registered subsequent to the registration of the registrant\u2019s trade-marks \u201cAce High\u201d and \u201cAce Quality,\u201d were or were not entitled to registration, we deem it sufficient to say that the doctrine of publici juris, as defined by this court in the case of Lever Brothers Co. v. Riodela Chemical Co., 41 F.(2d) 408, 17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1272, 1277, is not applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">We are in entire accord with the conclusion reached by the tribunals of the Patent Office,-and the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
