Collins (C. C. A.) <em>77 </em>F.(2d) 166, but its essential facts are relatively the same, except that here the foreclosure had proceeded to a master\u2019s sale of the property and approval by the court of the master\u2019s report of the sale before the debtor\u2019s petition in bankruptcy was filed \u2014 a few days prior to the expiration of mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption of one year under the Illinois law.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The specific contention made in the Sorenson Case \u2014 that \u201ca final decree\u201d in a foreclosure proceeding means a decree approving the master\u2019s sale \u2014 could not serve appellant in the instant case, since that stage of the proceeding had been passed when the petition under section 74 was filed. So it is maintained by appellant here that \u201ca final decree,\u201d as employed in the proviso of the amendment of June 7, 1934, of subdivision (m) of section 74 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA \u00a7 202 (m), implies the expiration of the period of redemption from the master\u2019s sale. Just what the insistence might have been if the period of redemption had then already expired we cannot know. Possibly it would have been the issuance and recording of the master\u2019s deed, or maybe the mortgagor\u2019s vacation of the premises, provided these same steps had not then severally been passed. The situation emphasizes the importance of adhering to the usual and well-understood meaning of \u201ca final decree\u201d as applied to a foreclosure proceeding. Our treatment of that question in the Sorenson Case is likewise applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Considerable discussion is here presented respecting the nature and extent of the title or interest in the property remaining in a mortgagor after entry of decree of foreclosure. Undoubtedly after such decree he does retain an interest in the property until such is by law thereafter terminated; but the quality and extent of such interest, and whether and how that interest may be subjected to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, are not here involved, where the only question is whether the bankruptcy court was empowered, under the amendment of June 7, 1934, to interfere with the foreclosure proceedings after entry therein of a decree of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Being of the view that the decree of foreclosure fixed the time which under the amendment of June 7, 1934, precluded the right thereafter to file in the bankruptcy court petition for suspension of further proceedings in the foreclosure case, we think it is immaterial what further or supplementary proceedings had thereafter taken place looking only to the carrying out of the decree of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">The order or decree of the District Court dissolving its theretofore entered injunctional order or decree restraining further steps in the foreclosure proceeding is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
