Brownell, as Receiver of Peoples National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Sullivan, Indiana, v. John E. Turman, 75 F.(2d) 913, decided by this court March 12, 1935. On May 14, 1932, Turman delivered to the same bank for collection certain matured bonds, with the agreement that the principal collected should not be credited to his checking account, but held by the bank for reinvestment in Indiana road bonds. The bonds delivered were promptly collected, but, unknown to Turman, the bank credited his account with the amount, though no entry was made on his passbook until after the bank\u2019s closing on June 27, 1932. Before the proceeds were invested as directed, the bank failed, and Turman claimed preference in its assets on the theory of a trust in his favor. The District Court found and decreed that there was a trust in his favor for the amount realized by the bank on his bonds. We quote a paragraph from the opinion of this court in the Turman Case: \u201cIt is quite probable that the District Court and appellee were misled, as well they might have been, with respect to the continuance of the trust relationship after the collection of the bonds by the Fletcher Bank, by reason of this court\u2019s decision in Adams v. Champion, 70 F.(2d) 956, and National Bank of America v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 71 F.(2d) 618, but since the filing of appellant\u2019s brief, those decisions were reversed by the Supreme Court in two decisions rendered on February 4, 1935 [55 S. Ct. 399, 79 L. Ed. -; Jennings v. U. S. Fid. &amp; Guaranty Co., 55 S. Ct. 394, 79 L. Ed. \u2014].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">The opinions of the Supreme Court in the cases cited in the paragraph, as well as in the case of Old Company\u2019s Lehigh v. Henry E. Meeker, 55 S. Ct. 392, 79 L. Ed. \u2014, decided by that court on the same day, have brought about necessary modification of the rule respecting such alleged trusts as was applied by us in deciding the appeals in Adams v. Champion, supra, and National Bank of America v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., supra. In appellee's brief here, and on the oral argument, much reliance had been placed upon the opinions of this court in the Adams and National Bank Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">It had been appellee\u2019s contention, and thereon the findings and decree of the District Court were predicated, that Bledsoe\u2019s funds in the bank realized from sale of his securities were segregated to a specific purpose, and that if the bank diverted them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>a trust in favor of Bledsoe arose in'the assets of the bank, to which trust appellee succeeded or was subrogated through \u2022 its bonds being turned over to Bledsoe by the Peoples Bank. . \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Upon the handing down of the opinions of the Supreme Court in the three cases, and in view thereof, further suggestions 'were requested from counsel for the parties herein, in response to which a supplemental brief for appellee was filed, wherein it is stated: \u201cThe effect of.the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Jennings, Receiver, v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., in holding that the bank collection code is inapplicable to national banks, is to give Bledsoe merely a general' claim in so far as the appellee relied on the \u00abbank collection code to establish a preference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Thus, and quite properly, appellee abandons the contention that through Bledsoe a trust in favor of appellee accrued in the assets of the failed bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Appellee now presses the contention' that, wholly apart from the relation of Bledsoe to the transaction, appellee is entitle to prevail because the Peoples Bank, contrary to the indorsement on the invoices reserving title unto appellee until the bonds are paid for, sold the bonds and converted the proceeds, and that thereby the Peoples Bank became a trustee ex maleficio for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We do not find in this record the elements essential to the creation of a trust ex maleficio. There is nothing that suggests conduct on the part of the Peoples Bank other than might reasonably have been expected in the exercise of good faith. Undoubtedly the reasonable anticipation was that the bonds were acquired to fill an order of some customer of the bank, and, when the transfer to its customer was consummated, the bank, in the ordinary course of banking, would draw its draft in payment and mail it to appellee\u2019s agent, the Indianapolis Bank. The delay between the Peoples Bank\u2019s receiving the bonds \u2022 from appellee and mailing the draft in payment was evidently within the anticipation and with the apparent approval of appellee and its agent, since no complaint or protest against such delay was made. What was done in the way of receiving and disposing of the bonds.and remitting therefor was, so far as anything to the contrary appears, in the usual course of banking and in good faith. The fact that the bank closed its doors before its draft sent in payment had cleared would not of itself indicate. fraudulent or unfair conduct of the bank. It is not the experience that banks which fail suspend their business long enough before closing their doors for their outstanding paper to clear. Doubtless in practically ;all bank failures the bank has some such outstanding paper when it suspends. If it followed that the issuance of its paper so shortly before failure 'manifested of itself a fraudulent purpose on the part of the bank, there would be few, if any, instances where preferences would not accrue in favor of the holders of such dishonored paper. Under i the rule, as defined by the Supreme Court in Jennings v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., supra, we are of the view that the evidence here does .not establish a trust ex maleficio.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">But at the threshold there is the question whether the evidence warrants the conclusion that there was in fact upon the face of these invoices purported reservation of title in appellee as the court found. If the evidence on the proposition were contradictory, it would likely be concluded that the determination of the court which saw and heard the witnesses would not be disturbed. There is here no contradiction of evidence, but a question whether the sustaining evidence sufficiently est\u00e1blishes the fact as the court found it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">It appears that appellee employed printed forms for making invoices of securities which it sells. These forms did not have printed thereon the reservation of title, but, when this was desired, it was effected by means of rubber stamp wherewith the indorsement was stamped on the invoice. Appellee\u2019s clerk testified that it was customary with them to stamp the reservation upon such invoices, that she usually did it, and that she presumed and believed it was on these invoices which were sent to the Peoples Bank, but that she had no personal recollection on the -subject. No one testified to any such personal recollection or to having actually seen the reservation clause on any of these invoices. It appears that neither of the two invoices which were sent to the Peoples Bank could be found. It was testified that one of these invoices would customarily have been returned to the forwarding bank (in this case the Indianapolis Bank); but the Indianapolis Bank, wherein appellee did its banking, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>could not find it, nor could any such be found in the files and papers of the Peoples Bank. Beyond this the record affords no evidence whatever to support the alleged reservation of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Some facts appeared tending in some measure to negative the contention. Appellee customarily made a number of copies of such invoices, retaining some of them for its own records. The copy offered in evidence showed the stamped indorsement, but it was explained for appellee that it was stamped on afterwards to make it like the original was assumed to be, and that the indorsement was not customarily stamped on the retained copies. Just why this important part of the contract should have been omitted from the retained copies, if it was upon the originals, is not readily apparent. Again, if it was the invariable custom to place this indorsement upon such original invoices, no reason appears why it should not have been printed thereon. The inference suggests itself that if a rubber stamp was used for this indorsement, it is because in some cases it was, and in others was not, used. This militates somewhat against the evidence of appellee\u2019s employee to the effect that the stamp was generally used.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Then there is the undisputed fact that, to appellee\u2019s knowledge, its agent, the Indianapolis Bank, through which the draft, with bonds attached, was drawn, delivered the bonds to the drawee of the draft without requiring payment to be made, whereby the protection which in general attends the process of drawing a draft with documents attached was entirely omitted. To appellee\u2019s knowledge, the bonds were delivered to the drawee of the draft without requiring payment to be made; and, with appellee\u2019s knowledge and without protest or objection, or without any undertaking to repossess the bonds, they remained two weeks in possession of the Peoples Bank before they were sold to Bledsoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We are inclined to the view that the act of delivering the bonds to this bank without first requiring payment, and of suffering it to hold them for this length of time without taking any action whatever for repossessing them, tends to indicate either that the reservation clause was not on the invoices, or, if there, was waived, and the credit of the Peoples Bank alone accepted and relied upon. But, apart from these negative circumstances, we are of the view that, considering only the affirmative evidence, it falls much short of justifying a finding by the court that the reservation clause was on these invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The decree of the District Court is reversed with direction to dismiss the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">FITZHENRY, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
