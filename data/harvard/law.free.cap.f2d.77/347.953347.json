Blackmer. He died on December 2,. 1931, while the policy was in force and effect. Eda E. Blackmer, the beneficiary named in the policy, brought this action to recover the death benefit provided for therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">The cause was tried to the court without a jury upon stipulation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">The material provisions of the policy are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-18\">\u201cThe Sentinel Life Insurance Company, Kansas City, Missouri * * * In Consideration of a first premium of $32.50 and policy fee $5.00 and of the statements in application for this policy, copy of which is endorsed hereon or attached hereto and made a part hereof, and subject to all the provisions and limitations hereinafter contained and endorsed hereon or attached hereto,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-20\">\u201cDoes Hereby Insure Dr. Frank J.

Did the insured incur a rupture or perforation of a duodenal ulcer on November 25, 1931, and if so, was it an accidental injury? 2. Was his death on December 2, 1931, the result thereof? 3. Was he unsound physically on October 7, 1931, in that he then had a duodenal ulcer? 4. If he had such ulcer on October 7, 1931, did he know or have reason to believe he was so afflicted? 5. Had he consulted any physician in the ten years prior to October 7, 1931, for duodenal ulcer?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The court made a general finding in favor of the plaintiff and gave judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, established these facts. On November 25, 1931, the insured emptied a 50-pound sack of flour into a bin about five feet high. Shortly thereafter he was seized with very severe pains in the upper abdomen which prostrated him. Insured was removed to the hospital at Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and attended by Doctors Willett and Sloan, who decided that an abdominal operation was necessary. Dr. Willett performed the operation and Dr. Sloan assisted. Upon opening the abdominal cavity, they found a ruptured duodenal ulcer, and performed a gastroenterostomy. There was considerable serous exudate from the stomach that had escaped through the perforation into the abdominal cavity. An operation was absolutely necessary, and a gastroenterostomy was the proper operation. During three or four days following the operation insured made good progress toward recovery. On November 30 he developed postoperative pneumonia from which he died on December 2, 1931. The shock of the operation and the anaesthetic lowered insured\u2019s vitality and caused him to contract pneumonia. The higher the point of the operation in the abdominal cavity, the greater is the probability of postoperative pneumonia. While pneumonia was the terminal cause of insured\u2019s death, the perforated ulcer set in motion and was the proximate cause of a natural sequence of events that resulted in insured\u2019s death, namely, the operation with its attendant shock, reduced vitality, and postoperative lobular pneumonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Insured was not aware that he was suffering from an ulcer at the time he made the application for the policy of insurance, and the statement in his application that he was physically and mentally sound, if untrue, was made by him in good faith and without knowledge that it was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Insured had not consulted a physician concerning a duodenal ulcer within ten years prior to the date of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Policies of accident insurance may be divided generally into two classes: (1) those that insure against accidental result, and (2) those that insure against the result of an accidental cause. There is a well recognized distinction between these two classes. To come within the coverage of the second class, the means or cause must be accidental, while to come within the coverage of the first class it is sufficient if the result or effect is accidental.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The policy in the instant case insures against accidental result.

Rep. 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines \u201caccident\u201d as follows: \u201cAn event that takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event.\u201d It defines \u201caccidental\u201d' as \u201chappening by chance, or- unexpectedly ; taking place not according to the usual course of things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In United States Mut. Acc. Ass\u2019n v. Barry, 131 U. S. 100, 121, 9 S. Ct. 755, 759, 33 L. Ed. 60, the court defines \u201caccidental\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Happening by chance; unexpectedly taking place; not according to the usual course of things;\u2019 or not as expected.\u201d See also Continental Cas. Co. v. Willis (C. C. A. 4) 28 F.(2d) 707, 709, 61 A. L. R. 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Here the rupture or perforation of the stomach wall at the point of the ulcer was an event that took place unexpectedly and not according to the usual course of things. It was clearly an accidental result. It set in motion and was the natural and proximate cause of a sequence of events that resulted in insured\u2019s death, namely, the operation, reduced vitality, and postoperative lobular pneumonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We conclude that insured\u2019s death resulted from an accidental injury, and was within the coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">A warranty in the law of insurance is a statement or stipulation in the policy which is breached unless absolutely true or literally fulfilled, and the breach of which results in the avoidance of the insurer\u2019s liability upon the policy. Capital Fire Ins. Co. v. King, 82 Ark. 400, 102 S. W. 194, 195; 2 Joyce on Insurance, \u00a7 1970; Union Nat. Bank of New Orleans v. Manhattan Ins. Co., 52 La.

The former affirms the existence of a fact at the time the policy is entered into; the latter requires that something be done or not done after the policy has taken effect. Orient Ins. Co. v. Van Zandt-Bruce Drug Co., 50 Okl. 558, 151 P. 323, 324; Rosenthal Cloth. &amp; Dry Goods Co. v. Scottish Union &amp; Nat. Ins. Co., 55 W. Va. 238, 46 S.

Co. v. McCullagh, 185 Ky. 664, 215 S. W. 821, 823; Maryland Casualty Co. v. First State Bank of Dewar, 101 Okl. 71, 223 P. 701, 703; Cooley\u2019s Briefs on Insurance (2d Ed.) vol. 3, p. 1865; Id., vol. 4, p. 3005.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">Unless it clearly appears that the parties intended statements made by an insured in his answers to questions in the application for insurance to be warranties, they will be construed to be representations.

A. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">A misrepresentation will not constitute a defense to an action on a policy of insurance unless it was intentionally untrue or was made with a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The questions and answers in the application are designated in the policy as \u201cstatements.\u201d The policy says that the insurance contract is made \u201cin consideration of a first premium of $32.50 and policy fee of $5.00 and of the <em>statements </em>in application for this policy.\u201d The application reads: \u201cI hereby apply for insurance in the Sentinel Life Insurance Company and for that purpose make the following <em>statements.\u201d </em>Then follow the questions and answers. Following those is the agreement: \u201cThat the right to recovery * * * shall be barred in the event that any one of the foregoing <em>statements, </em>material either to the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the company is <em>false, or made with intent to deceive.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">It is well settled in the national courts that contracts of insurance should be construed according to the sense and meaning of the terms the parties have used, that those terms ought to be given their plain, ordinary and popular meaning, and that it is only where, because of ambiguity in the language employed, the contract is fairly susceptible of two interpretations \u2014 one favorable to the insured and the other favorable to the insurer \u2014 that the rule of liberal construction in favor of the insured may be applied. Chase v. Business Men\u2019s Assur. Co. of America (C. C. A. 10) 51 F.(2d) 34, 35, and cases there cited; East &amp; West Ins. Co. of New Haven, Conn., v. Fidel (C. C. A. 10) 49 F.(2d) 35, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">But if the language of the policy is reasonably open to two constructions, the one more favorable to the insured will be adopted. Aschenbrenner v. U. S.

A. 10) 58 F.(2d) 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines \u201cfalse\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">\u201c3. Not according with truth or reality; not true; erroneous; as, a <em>false </em>statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">\u201c4. Not genuine -or real; assumed or designed to deceive; intentionally or wilfully untrue; counterfeit; artificial; hypocritical; sham; feigned; as <em>false </em>tears; <em>false </em>modesty; <em>false </em>colors; <em>false </em>jewelry; a <em>false </em>check or entry; <em>false </em>teeth; <em>false </em>gods; \u2014 in this sense often distinguished from <em>erroneous </em>or <em>mistaken.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Thus it will be seen that \u201cfalse\u201d is a word of double meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">In Moulor v. American Life Ins. Co., 111 U. S. 335, 345, 4 S. Ct. 466, 471, 28 L. Ed. 447, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-13\">\u201cIn one sense, that only is true which is conformable to the actual state of things. In that sense, a statement is untrue which does not express things exactly as they are. But in another and broader sense the word \u2018true\u2019 is often used as a synonym of honest, sincere, not fraudulent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>It follows that \u201cfalse\u201d should be construed to mean intentionally or wilfully untrue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">There was substantial evidence supporting the finding of the court that if the insured had a duodenal ulcer on October 7, 1931, the date he made application for the insurance, he did not know or have reason to believe he was so afflicted. His answer, not being intentionally or wilfully false, even if not literally true, constituted no defense to the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\"> In Landress v.

There is the same relationship between means and the event that results, that there is between cause and effect. The means may not have been in any way accidental, yet the event because of some unknown and unknowable factor highly accidental.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-14\"> Security Life Ins.

S. 335, 340, 341, 343, 4 S. Ct. 466, 468, 28 L. Ed. 447, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201cAssuming \u2014 as in view of the finding of the jury we must assume \u2014 that the insured was, at the date of his application,' or had been prior thereto, afliicted with the disease of scrofula, asthma, or consumption, the question arises whether the beneficiary may not recover, unless it appears that he had knowledge, or some reason to believe, when he applied for insurance, that he was or had been afliicted with either of those diseases. The circuit court plainly proceeded upon the ground that his knowledge or belief as to having been afflicted with the diseases specified, or of some one of them, was not an essential element in the contract; in other words, if the assured ever had, in fact, any one of the diseases mentioned in his answer to the seventh question, there could be no recovery, although the jury should find from the evidence that he acted in perfect good faith, and had no reason to suspect, much less to believe or know, that he had ever been so afflicted. If, upon a reasonable interpretation, such was the contract, the duty of the court is to enforce it according to its terms; for the law does not forbid parties to a contract for life insurance to stipulate that its validity shall depend upon condi-' tions or contingencies such as the court below decided were embodied in the policy in suit. * * * But, unless clearly demanded by the established rules governing the construction of written agreements, such an interpretation ought to be avoided. In the absence of explicit, unequivocal stipulations requiring such an interpretation, it should not be inferred that a person took a life policy with the distinct understanding that it should be void, and all premiums paid thereon forfeited, if at any time in the past, however remote, he was, whether conscious of the fact or not, afflicted with some one of the diseases mentioned in the question to which he was required to make a categorical answer. If those who organize and control life insurance companies wish to exact from the applicant, as a condition precedent to a valid contract, a guaranty against the existence of diseases, of the presence of which in his system he has and can have no knowledge, and which even skillful physicians are often unable, after the most careful examination, to detect, the terms of the contract to that effect must be so clear as to exclude any other conclusion. # * *i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">\u201cBut it is contended that if the answers of the assured are to be deemed representations only, the policy was, nevertheless, forefeited, if those representations were untrue in respect of any matters material to the risk. The argument is that if the insured was, at the time of his application, or had been at any former period of his' life, seriously or in an appreciable sense, afflicted with scrofula, asthma, or consumption, his answer, without qualification, that he had never been so afflicted, being untrue, avoided the policy, without reference to any knowledge or belief he had upon the subject. The soundness of this proposition could not be disputed if, as assumed, the knowledge or good faith of the insured, as to the existence of such diseases, was, under the terms of the contract in suit, of no consequence whatever in determining the liability of the company. But is that assumption authorized by a proper interpretation of the two instruments constituting the contract? We think not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">\u201cLooking into the application, upon the faith of which the policy was issued and accepted, we find much justifying the conclusion that the company did not require the insured to do more, when applying for insurance, than observe the utmost good faith, and deal fairly and honestly with it, in respect of all material facts about which inquiry is made, and as to which he has or should be presumed to have knowledge or information.\u2019\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
