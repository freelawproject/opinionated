The Tax Board held the gains and profits were corpus, and the tax was, therefore, payable by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">The case turns on the construction and effect of the will of Fred N. Chambers, which created the trust. The pertinent facts are discussed at length by the Tax Board and by reference thereto we avoid needless repetition. The Board\u2019s holding, \u201cThe petitioners have failed to show that any part of the gain here in question was from income or that it was actually distributed. They have, therefore, failed to overcome the respondent\u2019s (the Commissioner\u2019s) determination,\u201d was justified, and, agreeing therewith, we limit ourselves to affirming its orders.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
