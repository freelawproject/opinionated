Thompson\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and Mae Thompson Baxter (\"the Thompsons\"), and cross-appellants, Nathan J. Custer and Noelle M. Custer (\"the Custers\"), appeal from the June 28 and August 21, 2017 judgment entries of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Custers on the Thompsons' claims for slander of title, conversion, and unjust enrichment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Thompsons on their quiet title claim. The trial court's judgment is affirmed for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 18, 1950, Isabel Bacon, Lorene Bacon Langley, and Lawrence H. Langley (\"the Langleys\") transferred approximately 100 acres in Vernon Township, Trumbull County, Ohio (hereinafter referred to as the \"Real Estate\") to LeRoy H. Rufener and Sylvia Valot Rufener (\"the Rufeners\"). The Langleys reserved an interest in one half of the oil and gas rights. The deed was recorded on March 22, 1950.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Custers are the current surface owners of the Real Estate and have been since 2011. The Custers also own an undisputed one-half mineral interest in the Real Estate. Ownership of the remaining one-half mineral interest became the subject of dispute between the Custers and the Thompsons. The Thompsons claim the interest as the Langleys' living heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 11, 2012, the Custers entered into an oil and gas lease with appellee, BP America Production Company (\"BP\") for the mineral interests. Pursuant to the lease, BP agreed to pay the Custers a signing bonus of $3,900.00 per net acre contained within the leased premises, subject to BP's determination that the Custers have defensible title to the leased premises. A \"Memorandum of Oil and Gas Lease\" pertaining to the Custers' lease with BP was recorded in Trumbull County on April 12, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} BP sent the Custers a Title Defect Notice on September 22, 2012, as a result of the Langleys' reservation of the one-half mineral interest in the 1950 recorded deed to the Rufeners. This effectively reduced the net acres leased from the Custers to BP by one-half. BP paid the Custers half of the negotiated signing bonus, in the amount of $192,977.85, on or about October 25, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On October 11, 2012, BP entered into an oil and gas lease with the Thompsons for their share of the mineral interests. A \"Memorandum of Oil and Gas Lease\" pertaining to the Thompsons' lease with BP was recorded in Trumbull County on October 25, 2012. The lease itself is not included in the record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On December 6, 2012, the Custers filed an Affidavit of Abandonment with the Trumbull County Recorder, describing the disputed one-half mineral interest as\n   \"abandoned\" and averring they now hold the entire mineral interest as owners of the surface rights. Due to a timing issue with notice and publication, the Custers recorded a second Affidavit of Abandonment on March 18, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On March 20, 2013, BP sent the Thompsons a Title Defect Notice, as a result of its determination that the mineral interest was entirely vested in the surface owner. BP indicated it would not pay the Thompsons the signing bonus unless they were able to clear all defects to BP's satisfaction. On March 25, 2013, the Thompsons recorded a Notice of Claim to Preserve Mineral Interest, stating they do not intend to abandon but, instead, to preserve their rights in the mineral interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} BP subsequently decided, however, that the entire mineral interest was vested in the Custers and paid them the remaining half of the negotiated signing bonus, in the amount of $192,977.85, on or about July 30, 2013. They recorded a Ratification, Amendment and Memorandum of Oil and Gas Lease on August 2, 2013, which indicated BP had delivered the signing bonus to the Custers under the terms of their original lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On December 4, 2013, the Thompsons filed a two-count complaint against the Custers, BP, and the Ohio Attorney General, requesting (1) a declaratory judgment that the Thompsons are the lawful owners of the disputed one-half mineral interest and (2) a declaratory judgment that the 1989 Ohio Dormant Mineral Act is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The Thompsons and the Custers submitted competing summary judgment motions, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Custers. The trial court considered application of the current and former version of R.C. 5301.56, known as Ohio's Dormant Mineral Act (\"DMA\"). The trial court determined that under the 1989 DMA, the disputed one-half mineral interest merged with the surface rights in 1992. The trial court concluded the 2006 DMA did not revive a claim that was already abandoned and vested in the 1992 surface owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Thompsons filed a notice of appeal, and this court affirmed the trial court's judgment. We held that \"[t]he plain language of the 1989 version of R.C. 5301.56 provided for automatic vesting of the mineral rights in the surface owner unless a 'savings event' occurred within the preceding 20 years.\"\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Accordingly, we held the disputed one-half mineral interest in the Real Estate vested in the surface owners on March 22, 1992.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20N.E.3d%20278\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We further held that, as the 1989 DMA \"did not involve a retroactive application that would have stripped mineral rights owners of their rights upon its effective date, it is therefore constitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On September 15, 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed our decision and remanded the case to the trial court on the authority of\n   <em>\n    Corban v.

As of the 2006 effective date, \" R.C. 5301.56(E) directs the surface holder to give advance notice to the mineral rights holder, allowing it an opportunity to preserve its mineral rights from being deemed abandoned and merged with the surface estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.

In\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that, pursuant to the 2006 DMA, a mineral interest holder's Affidavit and Claim to Preserve Mineral Interests, filed within 60 days of the surface owner's Affidavit of Abandonment, \"was sufficient to prevent the mineral rights from being 'deemed abandoned and vested' in the surface owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On September 23, 2016, the Thompsons filed in the trial court a motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint instanter, pursuant to Civ.R. 15(E). The supplemental complaint alleged the following claims: (1) slander of title against the Custers and BP, alleging the Memorandum of Oil and Gas Lease, Affidavits of Abandonment, and Ratification, Amendment and Memorandum of Oil and Gas Lease were slanderous statements disparaging the Thompsons' title; (2) conversion, alleging the Custers' lease with BP was invalid and that the Custers converted all money, rents, and royalties therefrom; and (3) unjust enrichment, alleging the Custers should not be permitted to retain wrongfully obtained benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On October 3, 2016, the Thompsons filed a motion for leave to amend their supplemental complaint instanter, pursuant to Civ.R. 15(A), adding claims for (4) tortious interference with contract relations and (5) quiet title. The Custers and BP filed briefs in opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On November 29, 2016, the trial court issued a judgment entry in which it treated the motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint as a motion for leave to amend the original complaint and granted said motion. The trial court specifically referenced only the first three supplemental claims; it is clear from the record, however, that it was understood by the parties and the court that the Thompsons had been granted leave to prosecute all five supplemental claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On December 15, 2016, the Custers filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing they were entitled to summary judgment on the Thompsons' claims for slander of title, conversion, unjust enrichment, and tortious interference. On March 21, 2017, the Thompsons filed a brief in opposition and a cross-motion for summary judgment against the Custers. The Thompsons withdrew their claim for tortious interference and moved for summary judgment on their quiet title claim. The Custers filed a reply brief, arguing the 2006 DMA was unconstitutional as applied to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} BP also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the Thompsons' claim for slander of title. The Thompsons\n   filed a brief in opposition and a cross-motion for partial summary judgment against BP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On June 28, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of BP and the Custers on the Thompsons' claim for slander of title, and in favor of the Custers on the claims for conversion and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On August 21, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Thompsons on their quiet title claim. The trial court applied the 2006 DMA, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   . The trial court held the Thompsons filed a timely Notice of Claim to Preserve Mineral Interest in response to the Custers' Affidavit of Abandonment, which was sufficient to preserve their one-half mineral interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The Thompsons noticed a timely appeal, and the Custers cross-appealed. BP has not filed a brief on appeal. We consider the assignments of error out of order for ease of discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The Custers' first cross-assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} \"The trial court erred when it permitted appellants/cross-appellees to amend their complaint to file additional claims seeking monetary damages, after this case had already proceeded through the appeals process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The Custers submit that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Thompsons leave to assert additional claims seeking monetary damages, to wit: slander of title, conversion, unjust enrichment, and tortious interference with contract relations, because they relied solely upon facts in existence prior to the filing of their original 2013 complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Civ.R. 15(A) states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within twenty-eight days after serving it or, if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required within twenty-eight days after service of a responsive pleading or twenty-eight days after service of a motion under Civ.R. 12(B), (E), or (F), whichever is earlier. In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.

Subsequently and more recently on September 30, 2016, the Court of Appeals rendered an additional mandate reversing the summary judgment in accordance with precedent from the Ohio Supreme Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Therefore, from the perspective of an active docket in this Court, the matter is relatively young. As a result, the Court finds the undue prejudice and timeliness arguments are not well taken. The matter was pending in this Court for barely six months.

William reserved a one-half mineral interest in the land for himself but expressly gave the right to lease the entire mineral interest to Paul and Ida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   William then transferred his one-half mineral interest to his daughter, Mildred Reusser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Paul and Ida's interest in the land, including the right to lease the entire mineral interest, was eventually transferred to their children; Mildred Reusser's one-half mineral interest was transferred to her children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6-7. The Eisenbarths signed an oil and gas lease for the entire mineral rights, and the Reussers argued they were entitled to half the signing bonus from that lease, pursuant to their one-half interest in the mineral rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8-9. The trial court awarded half of the signing bonus to the Reussers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. On appeal, the Eisenbarths argued that because they were the exclusive owners of the right to lease the mineral rights, they were entitled to the entire bonus payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. The Seventh District Court of Appeals determined that the right to lease and the right to bonus payments are separate attributes of a severed mineral interest that can be separately transferred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. The Court further determined the Reussers had retained their right to bonus payments and were therefore entitled to their proportionate share of the bonus payment from the lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Here, the Thompsons have retained both the right to lease their one-half mineral interest and the right to receive bonus payments, as they did not convey either of those rights to the Custers. Thus, unlike the Eisenbarths, the Custers did not have the right to lease any portion of the mineral interest they did not own. There was no agreement or transfer of rights between the Thompsons and the Custers under which the Custers had any obligation to deliver any portion of the signing bonus to the Thompsons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The Custers were also under no obligation, under the terms of their lease with BP, to deliver half of the signing bonus to the Thompsons. The Thompsons were free to enter into their own lease for their one-half mineral interest, which they did. The lease itself is not included in the record before us, only the memorandum of lease, which does not include terms of any negotiated signing bonus. Regardless of whether the Thompsons' lease contains a provision for a similar signing bonus, the Thompsons are not entitled to half the signing bonus that was negotiated between the Custers and BP, as they were not party to that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The lease between the Custers and BP provides: \"The bonus payment shall be paid to the Lessor * * * subject to Lessee's determination that Lessor has Defensible Title to the Leased Premises[.]\" This provision does not assign any portion of the bonus payment to a third party. Rather, it indicates that BP will not pay the bonus payment unless BP determines the Custers have defensible title to the leased premises. As the bonus payment was part of the consideration for the lease agreement between the Custers and BP, any issue regarding a mistaken overpayment is an issue to be resolved between the Custers and BP. The Custers, however, have no legal obligation to pay any portion of what they received from BP to the Thompsons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The first issue under the Thompsons' sole assignment of error is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The second issue presented for review pertains to the Thompsons' unjust enrichment claim.

The Court concluded \"that the 2006 version of the Dormant Mineral Act, which is codified at R.C. 5301.56, applies to all claims asserted after June 30, 2006,\" even to those that allege mineral rights were abandoned and vested prior to the 2006 effective date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The 1989 DMA, codified in former R.C. 5301.56, stated: \"Any mineral interest held by any person, other than the owner of the surface of the lands subject to the interest, shall be deemed abandoned and vested in the owner of the surface,\" unless (a) the mineral interest was related to coal, (b) the interest was held by the United States, the state of Ohio, or another political body described in the statute, or (c) one or more of certain enumerated saving events had occurred within the preceding 20 years. Former R.C. 5301.56(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The lead opinion in\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   determined that the words \"deemed abandoned\" \"created a conclusive presumption by establishing that a mineral rights holder had abandoned a severed mineral interest if the 20 year statutory period passed without a saving event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. The lead opinion further explained that \"by providing a conclusive presumption that the mineral interest had been abandoned in favor of the surface owner if the holder failed to take timely action to preserve it, the legislature provided an effective method of terminating abandoned mineral rights through a quiet title action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 60} We first note that\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   is a plurality opinion, and a majority of the justices did not join in the \"conclusive presumption\" analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wendt v.

The Court concluded that, under the 1989 DMA, a property right to dormant mineral interests vested in the surface holder\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if the surface holder commenced a quiet title action and the mineral rights holder failed to prove certain conditions were met.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The 2006 DMA now provides that a dormant mineral interest \"shall be deemed abandoned and vested in the owner of the surface of the lands subject to the interest if the requirements established in division (E) of this section are satisfied[.]\" R.C. 5301.56(B). \" R.C. 5301.56(E) directs the surface holder to give advance notice to the mineral rights holder, allowing it an opportunity to preserve its mineral rights from being deemed abandoned and merged with the surface estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 30, citing R.C. 5301.56(E), (F), &amp; (G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Under the 2006 DMA, surface holders \"were not deprived of the right to bring a cause of action for abandonment\n   through a quiet title or declaratory judgment action. Rather, what changed was the procedural process, including statutory notice and recording procedures, by which mineral rights are deemed abandoned and vested in the surface holder.\"\n   <em>\n    Wendt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 29, citing\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 35. Thus, surface holders who had not succeeded in a quiet title action to obtain the mineral rights as directed under the 1989 DMA lost no property rights when the statute was amended in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Here, the Custers' due process rights were not violated because they never enjoyed a vested property interest in the disputed one-half portion of the mineral interests. Neither the Custers nor their predecessors in the surface rights ever commenced, let alone succeeded in, a quiet title action prior to enactment of the 2006 DMA. They argue that because an action did not require notice to the holder of the dormant mineral rights prior to June 30, 2006, but did so require thereafter-without any notice of such change to the surface holder-they were deprived of due process. We note, however, that the Custers did not own the Real Estate until 2011. Therefore, even assuming the 2006 DMA did deprive surface holders of a right to bring a cause of action, that right did not belong to the Custers when the statute was amended. At the time the Custers purchased the Real Estate, the 2006 DMA was already in full force and effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Thompsons on their claim for quiet title against the Custers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The Custers' second cross-assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 67} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   THOMAS R.
