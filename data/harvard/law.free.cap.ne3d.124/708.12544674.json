(NECS), dismissed its counterclaim against Vale for deceit, the judgment is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings on that counterclaim. In all other respects, the judgment for NECS is affirmed, as are the amended judgment for Vale, the order denying Valchuis's motion for indemnification for attorney's fees, and the orders denying Vale's and Valchuis's motions for judgment n.o.v. or for a new trial.</p></opinion>\n</casebody></body></html>"}}
