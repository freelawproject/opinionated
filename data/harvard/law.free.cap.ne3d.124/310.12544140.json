FISHER, Defendant-Appellant.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 18CA18\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Court of Appeals of Ohio, Fourth District, Meigs County.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  RELEASED: November 21, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  <em>\n   DECISION AND JUDGMENT ENTRY\n  </em>\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-6\">\n   Per Curiam.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   {\u00b61} After Dewayne R. Fisher pled guilty to three felonies, the trial court sentenced him to prison on one of the felonies and imposed community-control sanctions on the other two. However it imposed the community-control sanctions consecutively to the prison sentence. Rather than appealing the sentence, Dewayne R. Fisher filed a motion to vacate the judgment, claiming it was void. The trial court denied the motion and Dewayne R. Fisher appealed that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b62} First Fisher contends the court erroneously failed to merge the allied offenses of felonious assault and kidnapping, rendering them void. He did not raise this argument with the trial court or in a direct appeal. Thus it is barred by res judicata and he cannot raise it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b63} Fisher also argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion because his community-control sanctions for kidnapping and illegal cultivation of marijuana cannot be imposed consecutively to his prison sentence for felonious assault, thus making those sanctions void. Based on our precedent, we uphold the validity of this type of sentencing. The trial court\n   thus properly denied Fisher's motion to vacate his sentence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b64} The Meigs County Grand Jury returned a secret indictment charging Dewayne R. Fisher with two counts of felonious assault, two counts of kidnapping with an accompanying firearm specification, and one count of illegal cultivation of marijuana. Fisher entered a guilty plea to one count of felonious assault, one count of kidnapping, and illegal cultivation of marijuana in return for the dismissal of the remaining charges and the firearm specification. The trial court sentenced Fisher to an eight-year prison term for the felonious assault charge and five-year community control terms for the kidnapping and illegal cultivation of marijuana charges. Because community-control sanctions were to be served consecutively to the felonious assault sentence, his aggregate sentence was eight years in prison followed by ten years of community control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b65} Fisher did not appeal his convictions and sentence. Instead, two years later he filed a motion to vacate a void judgment. His motion claimed that: (1) he could not be sentenced for both felonious assault and kidnapping because they were allied offenses of similar import, rendering his sentences void for violating R.C. 2941.25 and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and Ohio Constitutions; and (2) he could not be sentenced to serve his community-control sentences for kidnapping and illegal cultivation of marijuana consecutive to his prison sentence for felonious assault, rendering these sentences void. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that \"the appeal time has expired and that said judgment is not a void judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b66} Fisher assigns the following errors on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN FAILING TO VOID PUNISHMENT FOR ALLIED OFFENSES OF SIMILAR IMPORT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   II.

THE TRIAL COURT INFLICTED DOUBLE PUNISHMENT FOR THE SAME OFFENSE, THEREBY RENDERING THE CONVICTIONS VOID PURSUANT TO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b67} Fisher's motion challenges the propriety of his felony sentences for his convictions.

LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Allied Offenses and Double Jeopardy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b610} Fisher's first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate his sentence because the felonious assault and kidnapping convictions constituted allied offenses of similar import; imposing a sentence on both thus violated R.C. 2941.25. Fisher's third assignment of error contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate because imposing a sentence on both the felonious assault and kidnapping convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Because these assignments of error raise similar issues, we consider them jointly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b611} The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" This protection applies to Ohio citizens through the Fourteenth Amendment and is additionally guaranteed by Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b612} This constitutional protection prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense in the absence of a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.
