The first phase of the trial involved Counts II and IV, and the jury found Springfield guilty of both. During the second phase, the jury determined that Springfield was guilty of Count V, the unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon. During the third phase, a bench trial, Springfield was adjudicated a habitual offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced Springfield to 10 years for\n   Count II, enhanced by 20 years for being a habitual offender; six years for Count IV; and 12 years for Count V. These sentences were ordered to be served concurrently, for an aggregate sentence of 30 years in the Indiana Department of Correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Springfield appealed, arguing that his conviction for Count V and the enhancements applied to Counts II and IV violated Indiana double jeopardy principles because they were based on the same evidence-his possession of a single firearm. This Court has held that \"two or more offenses are the 'same offense' in violation of Article I, Section 14 of the Indiana Constitution, if, with respect to\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the statutory elements of the challenged crimes\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the actual evidence used to convict, the essential elements of one challenged offense also establish the essential elements of another challenged offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11561966\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/717/32/#p49\">\n    717 N.E.2d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (Ind. 1999) (emphases in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals affirmed Springfield's convictions and sentences for Counts II and IV but reversed the conviction and sentence for Count V, the unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon. It remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to vacate the Count V conviction and sentence Springfield accordingly.\n   <em>\n    Springfield v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540672\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/116/1160/\">\n    116 N.E.3d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. Ct. App. 2018),\n   <em>\n    reh'g denied\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We grant transfer solely to eliminate the residual double jeopardy violation-Springfield's two drug-related convictions, both of which were enhanced based on the same evidence of his possession of a single firearm. Although the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   of the same weapon during the commission of two or more distinct offenses may be used to enhance the level of each offense without offending double jeopardy protections, enhancing the level of two separate offenses for the continuous\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   of a firearm would violate these principles.\n   <em>\n    Miller v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9117009,9117033\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/790/437/\">\n    790 N.E.2d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439 (Ind. 2003) (Sullivan, J., concurring). The appropriate remedy to address such violations is to reduce one of the offending convictions to a lesser included offense, if doing so will eliminate the violation.\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11561966\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/717/32/#p49\">\n    717 N.E.2d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Therefore, we remand this matter to the trial court for the entry of judgment on the jury verdicts of guilt for\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Count II\n   </strong>\n   : Possession of Cocaine as a Level 4 felony under Indiana Code section 35-48-4-6(c)(2) ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Count IV\n   </strong>\n   : Possession of a Narcotic Drug as a Level 6 felony under Indiana Code section 35-48-4-6(a) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   and for a determination of the appropriate sentence for each conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We summarily affirm the opinion of the Court of Appeals in all other respects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. R. 58(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   All Justices concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
