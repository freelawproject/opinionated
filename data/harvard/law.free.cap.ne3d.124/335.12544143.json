For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 17, 2016, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one\n   count of Medicaid fraud, a fourth-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2913.40(B), and one count of theft, a fourth-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(3). Appellant initially entered a plea of not guilty, he was appointed counsel, and the matter was scheduled for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 24, 2017, appellant entered an \"Alford plea\" of guilty to both counts in the indictment. (Entry of Guilty Plea at 1; Aug. 24, 2017 Tr. at 2.) At the plea hearing, the prosecutor set forth the facts giving rise to the indictment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   From November 4th, 2010 through February 6th, 2015, the defendant billed and received payments from the Ohio Department of Medicaid for services he did not provide to two Medicaid recipients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant was supposed to provide adult day and vocational services and personal care services for two developmentally disabled Medicaid recipients. The defendant claims to have helped one recipient obtain a job and provide on-site vocational assistance at Spaghetti Warehouse three to four times a week. However, both the recipient and the restaurant manager confirmed he did not provide any on-site vocational assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The second Medicaid recipient was supposed to be receiving transportation services which the defendant billed for, which several trips did not happen. This caused an overpayment in the amount of $25,285.80.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Aug. 24, 2017 Tr. at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court accepted appellant's guilty plea, and plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, elected to merge the theft count into the Medicaid fraud count for sentencing. The trial court scheduled the matter for sentencing and ordered a pre-sentence investigation (\"PSI\"). The following day, August 25, 2017, appellant filed a motion objecting to any sentence of the trial court that imposes a financial sanction, including an order to pay restitution to the victim, \"without first holding an 'ability to pay' hearing pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(E)\" because appellant \"maintains that due to life threatening medical conditions, for which [appellant] is currently receiving treatment for, that he is unable to maintain any employment so that he does not have the present or future ability to pay any financial sanction.\" (Aug. 25, 2017 Mot. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The court held the sentencing hearing on January 9, 2018. Appellant was again represented by counsel. The trial court stated the PSI had been completed, and counsel for both parties indicated they had an opportunity to review the PSI. Appellee told the court it is seeking restitution of $25,285.80 and noted that appellant took advantage of mentally disabled Medicaid recipients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant's counsel contested his ability to pay restitution because of his physical and medical problems. Specifically, appellant's counsel told the trial court that appellant is on dialysis, which he receives three times a week-\"Monday, Wednesday and Friday\"-is \"in basically late stage renal failure,\" has had \"a number of strokes\" and surgeries, and is living with friends and family who provide him with food. (Jan. 9, 2018 Tr. at 4.) According to appellant's counsel, appellant \"is in the process of getting Social Security himself\" and \"is unable to obtain employment because of his medical conditions.\" (Jan. 9, 2018 Tr. at 5.) Appellant's counsel presented the trial court with letters from appellant's doctors that, according to appellant, verify appellant's representations regarding his health. Appellant's counsel further stated that appellant \"always denied his guilt\" and \"would have liked to have gone to trial\" but took an Alford plea because going to trial would have been physically\n   impossible for him to endure due to his medical conditions. (Jan. 9, 2018 Tr. at 5.) The trial court confirmed with appellant that he was unable to obtain or maintain employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court then sentenced appellant to non-reporting community control for 2 years, which, if violated, would result in a 17-month prison term, and ordered appellant to pay $25,285.80 in restitution to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. The trial court waived fines and costs. Counsel for appellant noted his objection, and the trial court stated \"[i]f you want to file a motion with verification of the medical conditions, I will take a look at it.\" (Jan. 9, 2018 Tr. at 8.) The judgment entry memorializing the sentence, filed Jan. 11, 2018, states the trial court ordered and received a PSI and considered appellant's present and future ability to pay pursuant to R.C. 2929.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

For the following reasons, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} R.C. 2929.18(A) authorizes a trial court imposing a sentence for a felony conviction to sentence the offender to a financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized by law, including restitution. R.C. 2929.18(A)(1). Generally, a sentencing court has discretion to order restitution for the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the trial court must comply with certain statutory requirements in doing so.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) and 2929.19(B)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} For example, pertinent to this case, before imposing restitution under R.C. 2929.18, \"the court shall consider the offender's present and future ability to pay the amount of [restitution].\" R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). \"[W]hile a trial court may hold a hearing to determine if the defendant is able to pay the sanction, a hearing is not required by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant points to this court's language in\n   <em>\n    State v. Wiley\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 16AP-686,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-2744\">\n    2017-Ohio-2744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201900482\">\n    2017 WL 1900482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20, for the proposition that language in the trial court's judgment entry indicating it had considered ability to pay is not sufficient to show the trial court \"has given full consideration to the matter.\" (Appellant's Brief at 4.) In\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   , we stated that under R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) and\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   While the trial court stated in its judgment entry that, \"[t]he Court has considered the Defendant's present and future ability to pay a fine and financial sanction, pursuant to R.C. 2929.18,\" it made no express consideration of the issue or finding on the record to this end. (Jgmt. Entry at 2.) Regardless of what restitution amount may be ordered, even under the simple admonition in Conway, some genuine consideration of ability to pay must occur.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201900482\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 17} We first note the language cited by appellant is dicta, since\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22 found the assignment of error regarding ability to pay restitution moot based on its resolution of another assignment of error. Regardless, this is not a case where a trial court's judgment entry language stands as the lone evidence the trial court considered appellant's ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Here, the record shows the issue of appellant's ability to pay was squarely before the trial court. Appellant filed a motion prior to the sentencing hearing regarding his ability to pay, at the hearing the trial court provided appellant and his counsel the opportunity to speak on the issue, and appellant and his counsel testified regarding his alleged medical problems and ability to be employed. The trial court asked appellant about his ability to obtain and maintain employment. The trial court had the benefit of a PSI, which contained pertinent information about appellant's age, health, education, home ownership, and work history. As stated in\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10 and\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40, when a trial court considers a PSI, compliance with R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) is presumed. In its judgment entry, the trial court expressly stated that it considered appellant's present and future ability to pay a financial sanction pursuant to R.C. 2929.18. On review, we conclude the record contains sufficient evidence that the trial court considered appellant's present and future ability to pay restitution to comply with its statutory duty under R.C. 2929.19(B)(5).\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant next argues that even if the trial court gave proper consideration to his ability to pay, its conclusion was incorrect because appellant's medical conditions preclude him from obtaining employment, and, therefore, appellant had no realistic ability presently or in the future to pay restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We first note appellant's argument that he had no realistic ability presently or in the future to pay restitution is undermined by evidence in the record. Appellant was not sentenced to jail, and the PSI includes some information that challenges appellant's contention that he cannot work in some manner. While appellant's counsel presented letters from\n   appellant's doctors to the trial court, the trial court apparently did not consider them dispositive to appellant's medical state, telling appellant he would consider a further motion and evidence verifying the medical conditions. Appellant apparently did not provide any further information to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Regardless, appellant essentially argues, without citation to authority, that his alleged inability to pay should have limited or precluded the award of restitution. However, the pertinent statutes only require the trial court to \"consider\" the offender's present and future ability to pay the amount of sanction or fine and limit the amount of restitution to the \"economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense.\" R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) ; R.C. 2929.18(A)(1). No statute expressly limits the award of restitution to the offender's ability to pay.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Kruger\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.
