We previously determined that IBM materially breached the contract and remanded the matter to the trial court to determine damages and appropriate offsets. After the submission of evidence and a full-day hearing, the trial court issued detailed findings and conclusions. It determined that damages to the State resulting from the breach totaled $128 million and that IBM was entitled to offsets in the amount of $49,510,795, resulting in a final judgment of $78,178,109 to the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Both parties appealed, raising various issues. Today we address one of the issues raised: whether IBM is entitled to post-judgment interest on its $49.5 million damages award running from the date of the original judgment in 2012 or running from the judgment on remand. Finding that the original 2012 judgment was not \"final,\" we hold that the post-judgment interest due to IBM runs from the judgment on remand. We summarily affirm the Court of Appeals on all other issues and affirm the trial court on all issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the MSA was supposed to last ten years, the State terminated it less than three years in, citing performance issues on the part of IBM. Both parties sued each other for breach of contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a six-week bench trial, the Marion Superior Court found that the State failed to prove that IBM's breach of the MSA was material and awarded IBM damages\n   for assignment and equipment fees. It also awarded termination payments and pre-judgment interest. Both parties appealed. Ultimately, this Court reversed, in part, holding that IBM materially breached the MSA. We reversed IBM's termination payment and pre-judgment interest awards, but affirmed its assignment and equipment fees in the amount of $49,510,795. We remanded to the trial court with the following instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [W]e hold that IBM did materially breach the MSA through its collective breaches in light of the MSA as [a] whole. We therefore reverse the trial court's finding that IBM did not materially breach the MSA. We summarily affirm the Court of Appeals on all other issues including: affirming the trial court's award of $40 million in assignment fees and $9,510,795 in equipment fees to IBM, affirming the trial court's denial of deferred fees to IBM, and reversing the trial court's award of $2,570,621 in early termination close out payments and $10,632,333 in prejudgment interest to IBM. We also remand the case to the trial court to determine the amount of fees IBM is entitled to for Change Orders 119 and 133, and for calculation of the parties' damages consistent with this opinion, including any appropriate offsets to the State as a result of IBM's material breach of the MSA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794381\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/150/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794381\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/150/#p152\">\n    at 168-169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On remand, the trial court held a full-day hearing and considered both pre-hearing briefs and post-hearing submissions. It issued an 83-page order awarding the State $128 million in damages and credited IBM $49,510,795 for assignment and equipment fees this Court upheld plus the amount of fees for the change orders (an amount agreed to via stipulation of the parties). The trial court denied IBM's request for post-judgment interest on the $49.5 million-dollar award for assignment and equipment fees. Thus, IBM was ordered to pay the State $78.2 million, after offsets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both parties again appealed. IBM argued: 1) it is entitled to post-judgment interest on the fees upheld by this Court in IBM I; 2) the trial court erred by setting aside the factual findings of the original trial court; and 3) the trial court erred by holding IBM responsible for the costs of implementing a different and more expensive welfare system than the one contemplated by the MSA.

A final judgment \"disposes of all issues as to all parties thereby ending the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Georgos v.

While IBM wants us to consider its suit against the State separate and apart from State's suit, the two arise out of the same facts and circumstances and are inextricably tied. Case law is clear that a final judgment disposes of \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   issues as to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9117114\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/790/448/#p451\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Indiana Appellate Rule 2(H) (emphasis added). Not all the issues as to all parties were resolved at the time of remand and further, what was due and owed to IBM was necessarily contingent upon what damages were due the State for the breach. IBM could have recovered money from the State if the State's damage award was less than what was awarded to IBM or IBM award could have simply been applied to offset what was owed to the State. In\n   <em>\n    Beam,\n   </em>\n   we stated the rationale for awarding post-judgment interest as if the date of the original judgment when it has not been reversed: it \"compensates plaintiffs for the loss of money that has been determined to be have rightfully belonged to them throughout the time of the pending appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Beam,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449154\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/765/524/\">\n    765 N.E.2d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is no money that rightfully belonged to IBM as the amount awarded to it may have been and ultimately was, only an offset to what IBM owes the State. Accordingly, looking at the statute, our case law and the facts of this case, post-judgment interest going back to the original judgment is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We hold that the post-judgment interest due to IBM runs from the judgment on remand.

A central premise of the appellate ruling we affirm is that the \"Modernization\" approach required by the parties' Master Services Agreement is \"essentially the same\" as the more expensive \"Hybrid\" approach the State eventually implemented.\n   <em>\n    IBM v.

Just before announcing the termination, the State adopted a \"Plan B\" approach to welfare modernization-a decentralized model requiring additional personnel and physical space.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794381\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/150/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [In September 2009], the State decided to change approaches and adopt a hybrid approach to welfare modernization, referred to by the parties as \"Plan B.\" Plan B moved away from the centralized call center and moved eligibility determinations back to the local office, increasing face-to-face contact between clients and staff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794381\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/150/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The State initially asked IBM to implement its Plan B-\"Hybrid\"-system via the change-order process, but the parties were unable to agree on the price for IBM to take on these additional services.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794381\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/150/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After the termination, the State incurred substantial additional costs associated with implementing Hybrid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Our initial opinion agreed with the State that IBM had materially breached the Agreement by failing to deliver the Modernization system the State had procured, thus entitling the State to recoup damages resulting from the breach.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794381\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/150/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794381\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/150/#p152\">\n    at 168-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, the trial court awarded $125 million in direct damages for the State's increased costs associated with the transition to Hybrid and an additional $3 million in consequential damages.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12539257\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/112/1088/\">\n    112 N.E.3d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to damages, the court of appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12539257\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/112/1088/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12539257\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/112/1088/\">\n    at 1105-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And today our Court summarily affirms the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Agreement did not require IBM to incur the Hybrid-related costs of renting additional space, hiring additional personnel, and renegotiating subcontracts with subcontractors already under contract to implement Modernization. And the parties' conduct reflects as much. It is telling that the State initially asked IBM to implement Hybrid via change order. By entering into the change-order process, the State all but\n   admits that Hybrid is outside the scope of contracted services. Parties do not negotiate proposed changes to an agreement that already requires those things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court of appeals thus erred in treating the State's additional costs to implement Hybrid as \"reprocurement costs\"-a defined term under the Agreement. Such costs are the \"reasonable costs and expenses\" the State incurs to \"procure services similar to the applicable terminated Services ... to the extent such costs and expenses would not have otherwise been incurred by the State but for the Termination\". The State's post-termination costs of transitioning its welfare-reform system from Modernization to Hybrid were not costs to \"\n   <strong>\n    re\n   </strong>\n   procure\" anything; the additional Hybrid services had never been \"procured\" from IBM in the first place. Only Modernization had been procured from IBM, but IBM did not deliver, so it was in material breach. Thus, it was not IBM's breach but the State's decision to switch to the different, more expensive Hybrid system that caused the State to incur these additional expenses. The State's additional, Hybrid-related costs are at most consequential damages, not direct damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   One result of the court of appeals' ruling is that the State is better off than if IBM had not breached. To be sure, the State is entitled to the benefit of its bargain with IBM. It can recover the damages caused by IBM's breach-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the difference between what IBM had to provide under the Agreement and what IBM actually delivered. But the State is not entitled to a windfall. It cannot recover costs for additional services beyond what the Agreement required. Because I disagree with the court of appeals' award of damages attributable to IBM's breach, I respectfully dissent from our Court's summary affirmance of that portion of the appellate opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, though the Court's summary affirmance benefits the State in the short term, the longer-term consequence of our ruling for the State's future procurement efforts may not be so favorable. It will come as little surprise if prospective vendors respond to today's ruling in one of two ways. Either they will not do business with the State at all, thus reducing the supply of those willing to contract with the State. Or they will include a risk premium in their contracts to cover the unknown costs of fulfilling obligations beyond what they agreed to. Either way, the State and its taxpayers may soon learn that the future cost of obtaining third-party services will be higher-perhaps appreciably so-than otherwise. The magnitude of the increased cost may not be knowable, but it is a cost nonetheless.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-4.6-1\">\n     Ind.
