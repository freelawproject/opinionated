(\"MGM\") and Michael Lyon appeal from the trial court's summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee North Coast Commercial Roofing Systems (\"North Coast\"). For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 16, 2017, North Coast filed a complaint against MGM for $30,225.55 for the balance due on its account for goods provided at MGM's request. The complaint also alleged that Michael Lyon personally guaranteed payment of the account and that MGM had been unjustly enriched at North Coast's expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} MGM was served with the complaint on February 17, 2017, yet failed to timely answer the complaint. On March 31, 2017, North Coast filed a motion for default judgment. On April 28, 2017, MGM filed a motion for leave to file an answer instanter, which the trial court granted. Then on May 2, 2017, the court denied North Coast's motion for default judgment. The court scheduled a case management conference for May 11, 2017, wherein the court scheduled a discovery deadline of August 11, 2017. The parties agreed to refer the matter to mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 22, 2017, North Coast served upon MGM its request for admissions, along with other discovery requests. On June 20, 2017, MGM requested an additional 30 days in which to respond to North Coast's discovery requests, which the trial court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 15, 2017, a reportedly unsuccessful mediation hearing was held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On October 2, 2017, North Coast filed a motion for summary judgment, stating that there were no issues of material fact to be decided in the matter and North Coast was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In support of its motion, North Coast asserted that by failing to respond to North Coast's request for admissions, MGM admitted the following: (1) all merchandise had been provided as requested (Admission No. 2); (2) the supply agreement and personal guaranty signed by Lyon were true and accurate copies (Admission No. 3); (3) MGM was indebted to North Coast for $30,225.55 (Admission Nos. 1 and 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On November 10, 2017, MGM filed a motion to withdraw the deemed admissions. In this motion, MGM responded for the first time to North Coast's request for admissions that were served upon MGM in May. MGM contended in its motion that the matters addressed in the admissions were \"debunked in detail at the mediation.\" Then on November 13, 2017, MGM filed its brief in opposition to North Coast's summary judgment, stating that Lyon did not sign the personal guaranty, North Coast supplied nonconforming materials, and North Coast billed for materials at incorrect rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On January 11, 2018, the trial court denied MGM's motion to vacate the deemed admissions and granted North Coast's motion for summary judgment. In denying MGM's motion to vacate the deemed admissions, the trial court found MGM's actions in the matter troubling, as well as prejudicial to North Coast:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This court is disturbed by Defendants' disregard for deadlines and scheduled dates in this matter. The first written responses were submitted four (4) months after the leave granted by Plaintiff. Even if Defendants discussed answers at the September mediation, the mediation occurred two (2) months after the response deadline. All of this occurred after the August 11th discovery cut-off had long past. Only after Plaintiff filed the motion for summary judgment based on Defendants' admissions did Defendants properly respond, by rule, in writing. This tardiness is compounded by Defendants' initial failure to answer timely and their non-appearance at the final pretrial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Further, due to the tardiness of the admissions (most notably submission after the discovery and dispositive motion deadlines) and the looming trial date, the court finds that withdrawal or amendment would prejudice the Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In considering the motion for summary judgment, the trial court found that by failing to respond to the admissions and therefore admitting those requests, MGM conceded that all merchandise had been provided as requested, the supply agreement and personal guaranty signed by Lyon were true and accurate copies, and MGM was indebted to North Coast for $30,225.55. The trial court found that Lyon's \"self-serving affidavit, nearly undecipherable text messages, and a list of 'marked' invoices\" did not create a genuine issue of material fact, and therefore, North Coast was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} MGM now appeals the court's decision, assigning three errors for our review, which we will address together:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I. The trial court committed reversible error by granting a motion for summary judgment upon consideration of evidence: (1) not admissible under Civ.R. 56(C) ; and (2) privileged by its terms and under the rules governing mediation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   II. The trial court committed reversible error by discrediting the verified and sworn statements of a party in favor of an unsigned mediation statement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   III. The trial court committed reversible error by failing to substantively evaluate the factor of the two-prong test expressed in Civ.R. 36(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} MGM essentially contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion to vacate the deemed admissions and in granting North Coast's motion for summary judgment, because North Coast improperly relied upon a confidential mediation statement in support of its motion and the trial court, in turn, improperly relied on this same statement, rather than Lyon's sworn statement. Additionally, MGM argues that the trial court did not properly consider Civ.R. 36(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It is well settled in Ohio that in accordance with Civ.R. 36(A), \" 'the matter set forth in the requests for admissions is deemed admitted if they are not answered within rule.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y. v.

In June, MGM requested an additional 30 days in which to respond to North Coast's discovery requests, which the trial court granted. However, MGM failed to provide a response to the request for admissions until November, approximately five months after the request was made, when it filed its motion to vacate the deemed admissions. In its motion to vacate the deemed admissions, MGM offered no explanation for the untimely response. Rather, it asserted that the substance of the admissions was addressed at the mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In denying MGM's motion to vacate, the trial court noted MGM's general disregard for the court's orders and deadlines, including its failure to timely answer the complaint, thus prompting North Coast to file a motion for default judgment; its failure to timely provide discovery responses; and its failure to appear at the final pretrial. Regarding MGM's explanation that the parties \"discussed\" the admissions at the mediation, the court stated that even if MGM addressed its answers at the mediation, the mediation occurred two months after the response deadline, and \"[o]nly after [Northcoast] filed the motion for summary judgment based on [MGM's] admissions did MGM properly respond, by rule, in writing.\" Finally, the trial court determined that withdrawal or amendment of the admissions would prejudice North Coast. Pursuant to Civ.R. 36(B), the trial court has complete discretion to permit withdrawal of deemed admissions or accept late responses to a request for admissions, and under these facts, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying MGM's motion to vacate its deemed admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Summary judgment is appropriate when: (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) after construing the evidence most favorably for the party against whom the motion is made, reasonable minds can reach only a conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving party.

Through Admission Nos. 1 to 4, MGM conceded that all merchandise had been provided as requested, the supply agreement and personal guaranty signed by Lyon were true and accurate copies, and MGM was indebted to North Coast for $30,225.55.

We find no evidence, however, that the trial court in fact relied upon MGM's mediation statement. Rather, the record shows that the trial court based its decision to deny MGM's motion to vacate the deemed admissions upon MGM's \"disregard for deadlines and scheduled dates,\" including its failure to timely answer the complaint, its failure to file written responses to North Coast's discovery requests, and its failure to attend a final pretrial, as well as the prejudice to North Coast. The court refers to the premediation summary in its January 11, 2018 order, stating in part that \"[a]ccording to the mediation summary, the 'legal issues' [as argued by MGM] were non-conforming goods and expired products.\" However, the court's reference to the summary merely supports MGM's argument that the parties previously discussed the issues of material fact. And the trial court in fact found that this \"discussion\" that occurred two months after the discovery deadline did not satisfy the rules or the court. We therefore do not find the trial court improperly relied upon a confidential premediation summary in denying MGM's motion to vacate the deemed admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Because MGM admitted that North Coast provided all merchandise as requested, the supply agreement and personal guaranty signed by Lyon were\n   true and accurate copies, and MGM was indebted to North Coast for $30,225.55, there were no genuine issues of material fact that remain to be litigated and North Coast was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
