For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following are the relevant facts and procedural history. On May 25, 2015, appellant Byron Vallejo and his then four year old daughter, Daniella Vallejo, were walking on Shawbury Court East in Columbus, where they live, when they were attacked by an Old English Bulldog (\"the dog\"). The dog is owned by Paul Hughes, a tenant residing at 2037 Shawbury Court West (\"the property\"). The property is owned by appellee Johanna Coleman Haynes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On February 8, 2016, appellants commenced this action against Hughes\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and appellee. Appellants' complaint asserted two causes of action: failure to restrain the dog for which appellants allege strict liability under R.C. 955.28(B) and 955.22(C)(1) ; and negligent failure to assure the dog was confined on the property. Appellants further allege that the dog was previously involved in an incident where Hughes was found guilty of failure to keep the dog physically confined or restrained upon the premises. Appellants allege that appellee is the owner and landlord of the property, and that Hughes is the tenant. (Compl. at \u00b6 5 &amp; 7.) On February 26, 2016, appellee filed an answer and counterclaim admitting the allegations in \u00b6 5 and 7, i.e., that she is the owner and landlord of the property and Hughes was the tenant. In appellee's fourth defense, she claims that she is \"a landlord out of possession.\" (Answer and Counterclaim at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} As part of discovery, appellants requested that appellee \"[a]dmit that there is or was a lease or rental agreement for the rental of the property located\n   at 2037 Shawbury Court West.\" (Feb. 8, 2016 Request for Admissions at 7.) Appellee responded as follows: \"Denied. This answering Defendant has made reasonable inquiry and the information known or readily attainable is insufficient to allow this Defendant to admit this request.\" (Nov. 28, 2016 Response to Request for Admissions at 2.) However, at her deposition, appellee clarified that there was a lease signed in 2012 when Hughes moved into the property. Appellee indicated that her now deceased husband handled the lease signing, and she did not know where the signed lease was located. She indicated this was the only lease that was signed with Hughes and that she had briefly looked for it without success. (Haynes Depo. at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On November 11, 2016, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that she was not the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog under the strict liability claim. Additionally, as it relates to the negligence claim, appellee asserted that she had no knowledge of the dog and did not know the dog was a vicious animal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 17, 2016, appellants filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. Appellants' proposed first amended complaint attempted to add two declaratory actions: (1) that appellee is not a landlord as a matter of law; and (2) that appellants' claims are covered under appellee's homeowner's insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On November 28, 2016, appellants filed a response to appellee's motion for summary judgment arguing that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellee was a keeper or harborer of the dog. Specifically, despite the allegation in appellants' complaint and resulting admission in the answer, appellants argue that there is evidence that appellee is not the landlord of the property because there was no written lease between appellee and Hughes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} However, on December 5, 2016, appellee filed her own affidavit stating that Hughes entered into a written agreement to become the tenant at the property on June 12, 2012, and that a true and accurate copy of the lease agreement was attached. (Nov. 30, 2016 Aff. of Haynes at \u00b6 4-5.) Appellee further stated that she was provided a copy of the lease agreement by Hughes on November 28, 2016, and that prior to that time she had been unable to locate her copy. (Aff. of Haynes at \u00b6 6.) According to the lease, the tenancy commenced on June 1, 2012 and ended on May 31, 2013. The lease further stated that on expiration of the agreement, the tenancy would revert to a month to month tenancy. On December 6, 2016, appellee filed a reply in support of her motion for summary judgment attaching the affidavit and lease agreement. On the same day, appellants filed a motion for a declaration of law determining that appellee was not a landlord for purposes of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On December 13, 2016, appellants filed a motion to file a sur reply/motion to strike the reply. Appellants urged the trial court to strike the lease from the record because it was not authenticated, and that they had not had a chance to cross-examine appellee on the document since it was submitted after the discovery cut-off date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On April 25, 2017, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment and denied appellants' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, motion for declaration of law, and motion for leave to file sur reply/motion to strike. (Apr. 25, 2017 Decision and Entry.) The trial court found that appellee was a landlord of the property as a matter of law. As such, appellee was not strictly liable as the owner, harborer or keeper of Hughes' dog. Further, the trial court found Haynes had\n   no knowledge of an alleged propensity for violence on behalf of Hughes' dog, and therefore dismissed the negligence claim as a matter of law. The trial court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court finds that Defendant Haynes has met her initial burden of demonstrating to the Court that she was a landlord of the property and that she had relinquished occupation and control of the premises to Defendant Hughes at the time of the tragic incident. Defendant Haynes testified that she used to live on the property until 2012, when she executed a lease agreement with Defendant Hughes. Defendant Haynes since had moved to 3087 Framingham Circle, which is 15 minutes away. Defendant Hughes pays $875 per month for rent, he brings the rent to Defendant Haynes on the first day of the month * * *. Defendant Haynes further testified that she insures the property as a rental property, she pays for the property tax, and that she is responsible for repairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court further finds that Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of showing a genuine issue for trial. Plaintiffs brought to the Court's attention the following: Defendant Haynes insures the property as a homeowner under a homeowner's insurance policy; she pays the tax on the property; she took advantage of the owner occupier tax credit for the year of 2014 on the property; she did not register the property as a residential rental property with the Franklin County Auditor; * * * she has authority to remove Defendant Hughes and/or his dogs from the property; she has authority to enter the property; she chose to give notice to Defendant Hughes before entry out of courtesy; and her deceased husband may have put some of his belongings in the garage. The Court finds that these are common acts conducted by a landlord and do not constitute possession or control of the property necessary to establish liability under R.C. 955.28(B) or R.C. 955.22(C)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Construing the evidence most strongly in Plaintiffs' favor, reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion - Defendant Haynes was not a harborer of the dog. In light of the foregoing, Defendant Haynes is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the strict liability claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Under the common law, a plaintiff suing for injuries inflicted by a dog must show that the defendant owned or harbored the dog; that the dog was vicious; that the defendant knew of the dog's viciousness; and that the defendant was negligent in keeping the dog.\n   <em>\n    Pangallo v.

Landlords out of possession of the property can still be found liable for injuries caused by animals owned and kept on the leased premises where the landlord has knowledge of the dangerous animal but fails to take any action to have the animal removed or confined.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=608%20N.E.2d%20809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant Haynes that she did not harbor the dog in question, did not know about the dog, and that she did not know about the dog's vicious tendencies. The Court finds that Defendant Haynes has set forth facts to establish that she had no knowledge of the dog or the viciousness of the dog. Defendant Haynes testified that she had only been to the property once since January 2015, but she did not see any dogs. * * * Defendant Haynes denied\n   knowing any incident involving Defendant Hughes' dogs prior to this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Even though Plaintiffs set forth a report issued by the dog warden, there is nothing in the report to suggest that Defendant Haynes knew of this incident, or that a copy of the report was sent to Defendant Haynes. While summary judgment is not appropriate where the resolution of a factual dispute depends in part upon the credibility of the witness, in this case, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that there is no issue remain [sic] for trial on whether Defendant Haynes is negligent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Internal citations omitted.)

Appellee testified she used to live on the property until 2012, when she executed a lease agreement with Hughes; she has since moved to a new residence approximately 15 minutes away from the rental property; she testified she insures the property as a rental property; she pays for the property tax; she is responsible for repairs; and, finally, Hughes pays rent to live on the property. Considering all of those factors, the trial court determined appellee demonstrated she was a landlord. Nowhere in this reasoning did the trial court list the written lease agreement. In fact, all of the factors set forth came directly from appellee's deposition testimony which was conducted by appellants' counsel and for which counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Our review shows that the trial court properly determined appellee is the landlord of the property. The determination of which is not dependent on her credibility as a witness and, instead, is uncontroverted by the evidence supplied. Other than bare allegations on the face of the complaint, appellants have set forth no facts or evidence to contradict appellee's deposition testimony or the written lease provided.

Nothing in the lease or in appellants' deposition establishes an issue of fact as to whether or not she had possession and control of the property. Notably, Ohio courts have previously held that where the leased property at issue consists of a single-family residence, as in this case, situated on a normal sized city lot, there is a presumption that the tenants possessed and controlled the entire property.\n   <em>\n    Richeson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Based on our review of the evidence before the trial court, appellant did not harbor the dog in question; did not know about the dog; and did not know about the dog's vicious tendencies. Appellant testified that she had only been to the property once since January 2015, and did not see any dogs. Appellants have not set forth any evidence to suggest appellee was aware of or interacted with the dog, and the trial court properly found that appellee was a landlord out of possession and, therefore, was not a harborer of the dog. Appellants' second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR-STATUTE OF FRAUDS-ORAL LEASES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In the fourth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by finding (1) that the statute of frauds did not apply to leases for residential property, and (2) that oral leases can create transferred possession and control of a premise and concluding therefrom that appellee was a landlord and not a harborer of the dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In the first assignment of error, we have ruled that the written lease agreement between appellants and Hughes was properly before the trial court. As such, because a written agreement exists and was properly introduced into evidence, appellants' argument is irrelevant. However, even if we were to disregard the written lease agreement, a landlord-tenant relationship can exist under an oral agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellants argue that the Statute of Frauds precludes an oral lease agreement. While still true with respect to commercial lease agreements, this is no longer the case for residential leases. R.C. Chapter 5321 governs the relationships between landlords and tenants with regard to rental agreements pertaining to residential premises and supersedes all prior Ohio law concerning the rights and obligations encompassed by this chapter of the code and provides the exclusive remedies now available to landlords and tenants.\n   <em>\n    Laster v.
