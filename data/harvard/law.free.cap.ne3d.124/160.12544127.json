In their cross appeals, the parties raise various challenges to the judgment of divorce nisi. We modify, vacate, and affirm various portions of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize only those findings relevant to the issues on appeal. K.G.S. (husband) and D.S. (wife) were married on September 11, 1993. The husband served the wife with a complaint for divorce on August 19, 2012. The husband and his business partner had mutual business interests in fifty-five business entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The husband and wife have substantial assets and real property holdings, with various mortgages and rental and investment incomes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On December 10, 2014, before any evidence was taken at trial, the husband and the wife entered into a business asset stipulation (BAS), eliminating the valuation of the husband's business assets as an issue. The BAS provided that (1) the husband's business interests were valued at $ 7.2 million, (2) the wife was entitled to one-half ($ 3.6 million), (3) the husband would pay the wife her share within seven and one-half years of the judgment of divorce nisi, and (4) the wife's share would not be affected by the husband's liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After the trial, the special master issued an eighty-nine page report containing findings of facts, conclusions of law, rationale, and a proposed judgment of divorce nisi, which was largely adopted by the judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The judgment of divorce nisi incorporated the BAS, albeit with modifications determined by the special master (and adopted by the judge) to be necessary in order for it to be fair and reasonable; required the husband to pay alimony to the wife in the annual amount of $ 200,000, until October 31, 2032 (after imputing an annual income of $ 66,860 -- $ 18,200 in salary and $ 48,660 in investments -- to the wife); and ordered the wife to refinance the \"existing mortgages\" on the property owned by the parties in Woods Hole (which she was awarded). However, the judgment did not order the wife to refinance the mortgages on the marital residence in Dover, which was also awarded to the wife. The Woods Hole property was not encumbered by any mortgages, but the Dover property was so encumbered, and \"both parties [were] obligors on the loan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    The BAS\n   </em>\n   .

Although the husband plainly had greater knowledge of his business interests than the wife, each party was represented by independent, experienced counsel. Both parties also consulted business valuation experts. See\n   <em>\n    Dominick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3983320\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/18/85/#p92\">\n    18 Mass.

Moreover, if the husband incurred any liabilities -- personal or business -- the BAS protected the wife from those losses.

The husband contends that the judge erred in calculating the duration and amount of the husband's support obligations to the wife. The judge found that \"for purposes of maximum duration alimony the length of marriage is 19 years, 11 months, and 8 days or 239.26 months (September 11, 1993 date of marriage to August 19, 1993 [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] date of service of divorce complaint).\" The judge recognized the relevant dates (date of marriage to date of service of the divorce complaint), see G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 48, but made a typographical and a mathematical error. The parties were indeed married on September 11, 1993, but the divorce complaint was served on the wife on August 19, 2012. Therefore, the length of the marriage was eighteen years, eleven months. This length should have been used in calculating the presumptive duration of alimony under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49. Accordingly, the duration of alimony must be recalculated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The husband also contends that the judge made mathematical errors in determining the amount of alimony. Specifically, the husband correctly notes that the wife's financial statement dated November 7, 2014, reflected a weekly expense of $ 176.49 for \"cash withdrawals,\" but that the wife's actual weekly cash withdrawal need was $ 250. However, in adjusting the wife's needs, the findings adjusted the weekly cash withdrawal need upward by $ 296.59 (more than her total weekly cash withdrawal need).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This adjustment resulted in a mathematical error that affected the alimony award. Because the calculation is \"plainly wrong,\" despite the judge's \"considerable discretion\" in awarding alimony,\n   <em>\n    Hassey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hassey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229096\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/518/#p524\">\n    85 Mass.

First, she contends that the judge improperly inflated the income attributed to her in determining the alimony award. Next, the wife contends that the judge acted improperly in awarding alimony based on the wife's need, rather than based on the income differential, because the award \"deprived her of the marital station\" and gave the husband an \"inequitable windfall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    The wife's income\n   </em>\n   .

The wife further contends that the income attribution lacked necessary prerequisite findings: that she was underemployed and that employment was available. These arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The \"power to grant alimony\" is \"wholly statutory.\"\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308885\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/230/#p233\">\n    469 Mass. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233 (2014). \"A judge has broad discretion when awarding alimony under the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201\">\n    478 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5-6 (2017), quoting\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308885\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/230/#p233\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308885\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/230/#p233\">\n    at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Furthermore, because the judge has considerable discretion, determinations as to alimony and property division will not be reversed unless plainly wrong and excessive.\"\n   <em>\n    Hassey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229096\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/518/#p524\">\n    85 Mass.

The judgment \"strives to achieve reasonable continuity of lifestyle, without windfall.\" The judge awarded alimony based on the wife's need, pursuant to the statute, and measured that need in light of mandatory considerations, including the parties' marital station.\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308885\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/230/#p233\">\n    469 Mass. at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The wife refinanced the mortgage on the Dover property on June 6, 2016, pursuant to a court order, but both parties remained obligors on the loan, and the judgment of divorce nisi ordered the wife to \"timely pay all mortgage costs\" for \"so long as the [h]usband is a guarantor on a mortgage that encumbers the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In contrast, the wife was also awarded the Woods Hole property, on which there was no mortgage.

The provisions of the judgment related to the award of alimony are vacated, and the matter is remanded for recalculation of the amount of alimony and its duration based on the corrected length of the marriage and the wife's cash withdrawal needs.

It is reasonable to establish a payment schedule and a reasonable interest term.\" However, there was no evidence in the record before the special master regarding the nature of the husband's business assets. As but one example, illiquid assets, or assets with volatile market values, might warrant preserving (for the benefit of both parties) flexibility regarding the time when it would be advantageous to convert them to cash for purposes of paying the wife's share. Like the special master and the trial judge, we are without information about the nature of the business assets, and we do not presume to conclude that such considerations in fact apply.
