The plaintiff, Joseph M. Lazarek in his capacity as trustee of Cliff's Realty Trust (CRT), appeals, claiming that the site at issue lost protected zoning status through abandonment or discontinuance and that the board was not authorized to modify a 2011 special permit because the modifications differed markedly from the initial approved project. The defendant Cathleen E. Kavanaugh, trustee of Smith's Point Realty Trust (SPRT), counters that the site is a lawfully nonconforming structure, the site was not abandoned, the board had authority to modify the special permit, and CRT lacks standing. Standing is \"a 'jurisdictional' prerequisite to proceeding with the case in the sense that [the plaintiff's] status as an aggrieved person is an essential prerequisite to judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Talmo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536550\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/107/1188/#p629\">\n    93 Mass. App. Ct. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629 (2018), and cases cited. We agree with SPRT that CRT lacked standing to maintain this action and therefore reverse the judgments and remand the cases for entry of judgments that dismiss the plaintiff's complaints for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    The site\n   </em>\n   . The site at issue is a 100 foot tall World War II-era military tower (tower) located in Manchester-by-the-Sea (town). SPRT owns the tower, which was used during wartime as a lookout for spotting enemy vessels. Although the tower never functioned as a lighthouse, it was elongated from ten stories to twelve and its exterior was renovated to make it look like a lighthouse in 1987. More recently, the entirety of the tower's interior was renovated to comprise living space and the tower was connected to an existing dwelling via a corridor. The most recent renovations are at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In 1943, the United States government exercised its eminent domain powers to take a portion of a parcel of land in order to construct the tower. The following year, the town enacted its first zoning bylaw under which the tower was far higher than acceptable in its surrounding residential neighborhood.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bylaw, however, included a \"grandfathering\" provision that exempted the tower from the requirements set forth in the bylaw because the tower preexisted its enactment. Thus, the tower was a lawfully nonconforming structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The government stopped using the tower in 1945 and sold it in 1951. It was then resold a number of times between 1951 and 1984.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1984, the then-owners, John and Mary Jo Donovan, added two levels to the tower, without obtaining a permit, creating the resemblance of a lighthouse. They also received a building permit in 1987 to enlarge windows and the lower deck in the tower.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2009 the Donovans sold the property to Donald Besser. Besser made minor improvements to the tower, including replacing windows, painting the exterior and part of the interior, landscaping, infilling a pond, and renovating a preexisting tennis court. In 2011, Besser obtained a special permit for a project that allowed him to demolish the existing house and construct a new house that would be attached to the tower.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The board also granted Besser's request to change the status of the tower from accessory to residential. No appeal was taken from the special permit. Besser never commenced the demolition, however, and instead he sold the property in 2014 to the current owner, SPRT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July 2014, SPRT obtained a building permit to renovate the interior of the tower and convert it into living space. As a result, two bedrooms and two bathrooms were added to the tower, as well as a bar and entertainment areas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to the interior renovations, CRT sought zoning enforcement pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7. CRT wrote to the building inspector on two occasions requesting revocation of the special permits, a cease and desist order, and the removal of any improvements. CRT claimed that the tower would constitute a second residence on the property in violation of the town's bylaw. The building inspector refused to take any action and CRT appealed to the board, which affirmed the inspector's decision. CRT filed a complaint in the Land Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2016, SPRT filed for a modification of Besser's 2011 special permit seeking to construct a corridor connecting the tower to the existing corridor between the residence and a garage. After a public hearing, the board granted the modification in March of 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   SPRT then completed the renovations. CRT filed a second complaint in the Land Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n   . In order to proceed with an action under G.

As to the privacy claim, CRT argues that someone in the tower could look down onto its property, thus invading its privacy. Such a claim does not rise to an injury as our common law requires. See\n   <em>\n    Picard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Westminster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173690\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/570/#p573\">\n    474 Mass. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (2016) (more than minimal or slight appreciable harm is required);\n   <em>\n    Kenner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271189\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/115/#p121\">\n    459 Mass. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (not enough that plaintiff will be impacted by changes). In addition, a neighbor's ability to see onto CRT's property is not a harm that is protected by the town's zoning bylaws. Importantly, the tower existed at its present height -- 100 feet -- when CRT purchased the property in 2013. The claim here is that the internal renovations created the harm, however, \"[t]he injury must be personal to the plaintiff and supported by specific facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Valcourt\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Swansea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1152943\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/48/124/#p127\">\n    48 Mass. App. Ct. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (1999). Here, it is not. As other nearby properties can be seen from the tower, CRT's claim of injury is not special and distinct from the concerns of the rest of the community. See\n   <em>\n    Barvenik\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aldermen of Newton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011440\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/33/129/#p132\">\n    33 Mass.

Cf.\n   <em>\n    McGee\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Appeal of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1221201\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/62/930/#p931\">\n    62 Mass.

Not only is this speculation, but CRT's own expert opined that the sound coming from such a gathering is the same, or even less than the sound that would come from social events inside the property.\n   <em>\n    Denneny\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Seekonk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1508522\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/59/208/#p212\">\n    59 Mass.

Moreover, loud parties are already regulated by State and local law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is not an interest that the zoning bylaw protects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lastly, CRT claims that it may be injured by increased light from the tower. In addition to this naked allegation, notably, the tower renovations did not alter the exterior lighting. Indeed, CRT's own land survey expert failed to support the claimed injury as he plotted only from where on the CRT property the tower may be seen, during daylight. As such, this mere allegation of increased light was insufficient to render CRT a \"party aggrieved\" for purposes of establishing standing. See\n   <em>\n    Boothroyd\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817706\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/333/#p342\">\n    449 Mass. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342 (2007) (\"[U]nsubstantiated claims or speculative personal opinions do not constitute a sufficient predicate on which to confer standing\" [citation omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CRT's failure to establish that it is a person aggrieved can best be summed up by the deposition testimony of the beneficial owner of its property.

As is the case here, \"[o]nce the presumption [was] rebutted, the burden rest[ed] with [CRT] to prove standing [i.e., aggrievement], which requires that [CRT] 'establish -- by direct facts and not by speculative personal opinion -- that [their] injury is special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kenner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271189\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/115/#p121\">\n    459 Mass. at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Standerwick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731692\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/447/20/\">\n    447 Mass. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
