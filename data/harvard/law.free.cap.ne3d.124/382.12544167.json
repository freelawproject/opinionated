(\"IMS\") and IMS Holdings, Inc., alleging various claims in connection with the termination of Dr. Huber's employment. IMS and IMS Holdings counterclaimed, alleging a breach of loyalty and fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and negligent and intentional misrepresentation arising out of Dr. Huber's employment. Between March 22, 2016, and May 24, 2016, the Hubers filed a series of notices that purported to voluntarily dismiss their claims under Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a). Trial commenced on IMS and IMS Holdings' counterclaims only, resulting in a verdict in favor of the Hubers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Shortly before the trial began, the Hubers filed a second case that reasserted four of their original claims. The Hubers later filed an amended complaint that included three additional defendants and asserted additional claims for breach of fiduciary duties and constructive discharge. The named defendants-IMS, IMS Holdings, IMS Intermediate Holdings, Sverica International Investment Fund III, L.P., and Sverica Capital Management LLC (collectively, \"the IMS Defendants\")-moved to dismiss the complaint, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, alleging that the Hubers' previously filed claims were barred by res judicata and that the new claims were filed in the improper venue according to a forum selection clause. The trial court considered the motion as a motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of Dr. Huber's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Huber appealed, raising four assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of the State of Delaware, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court in Delaware. This provision may be filed with any court as written evidence of the knowing and voluntary irrevocable agreement among the parties to waive any objections to jurisdiction, to venue or to convenience of forum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The language of this clause unambiguously reflects the parties' intent that the Courts of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for disputes arising from the agreement: it addresses both choice of law and venue and provides that \"[a]ny proceeding\" related to or arising from the agreement \"shall be brought\" in Delaware. The trial court did not err by concluding that this forum selection clause is mandatory. Dr. Huber's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Dr. Huber has also argued that the IMS Defendants waived their ability to assert the forum selection clause by participating in the 2014 litigation. In light of this Court's conclusion that Dr. Huber's claims are still pending in that case, this portion of his assignment of error is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Dr. Huber's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE APPELLANT'S BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY CLAIMS FOR LACK OF VENUE IN VIOLATION OF THE PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED IN OHIO CIV.R. 3(D)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Dr. Huber's final assignment of error, combined with the previous section of his brief, argues that the trial court erred by dismissing the claims that were affected by the forum selection clause with prejudice instead of following the procedure contemplated by Civ.R. 3(E)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The IMS Defendants have conceded error in this respect, and this Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Civ.R. 3(E) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Venue; No proper forum in Ohio\n   </strong>\n   . When a court, upon motion of any party or upon its own motion, determines: (1) that the county in which the action is brought is not a proper forum; (2) that there is no other proper forum for trial within this state; and (3) that there exists a proper forum for trial in another jurisdiction outside this state, the court shall stay the action upon condition that all defendants consent to the jurisdiction, waive venue, and agree that the date of commencement of the action in Ohio shall be the date of commencement for the application of the statute of limitations to the action in that forum in another jurisdiction which the court deems to be the proper forum. If all defendants agree to the conditions, the court shall not dismiss the action, but the action shall be stayed until the court receives notice by affidavit that plaintiff has recommenced the action in the out-of-state forum within sixty days after the effective date of the order staying the original action. If the plaintiff fails to recommence the action in the out-of-state forum within the sixty day period, the court shall dismiss the action without prejudice. If all defendants do not agree to or comply with the conditions, the court shall hear the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   If the court determines that a proper forum does not exist in another jurisdiction, it shall hear the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This Court has observed that Civ.R. 3(E) applies in the enforcement of forum selection clauses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keehan Tennessee Invest., LLC v.
