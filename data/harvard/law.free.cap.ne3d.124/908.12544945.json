His convictions were upheld on direct appeal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20101247-U\">\n    2012 IL App (2d) 101247-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206967062\">\n    2012 WL 6967062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsequently, defendant filed a postconviction petition. The petition advanced to the second stage, at which time defendant filed a third-amended petition raising several claims, including a claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call an \"exculpatory witness\" to testify at trial. The circuit court dismissed the petition on the State's motion, finding that defendant failed to make a substantial showing that his trial counsel was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b6 2 On appeal, the appellate court affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of the postconviction petition in an unpublished order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20141013-U\">\n    2017 IL App (2d) 141013-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201401470\">\n    2017 WL 1401470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the circuit court, however, the appellate court did not consider the ineffective assistance claim on its merits but held that the postconviction petition was properly dismissed, as a matter of law, solely because defendant failed to attach to his petition an affidavit from the proposed witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 3 We granted defendant's petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Mar. 15, 2016). For the reasons that follow, we now hold that, under the facts of this case, defendant's failure to provide an affidavit was not, by itself, fatal to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Nonetheless, we affirm the circuit court's dismissal of defendant's postconviction petition because we, like the circuit court, find that defendant failed to make a substantial showing that his trial counsel was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 4 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 5 Defendant Torrence Dupree (also known as Teko) was charged with two counts of armed robbery ( 720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(2) (West 2010) ) and two counts of aggravated robbery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18-5 (now codified at 720 ILCS 5/18-1(b)(1) (West 2016) ) ), in connection with the robbery of Matthew Morrison and Kiernan Collins on February 16, 2010, in Grayslake, Illinois. At a jury trial, evidence established that on the evening of February 16, 2010, Steven Nowell called Matthew Morrison to arrange for the purchase of some marijuana. Morrison, accompanied by a friend, Kiernan Collins, drove to the Grayslake Apartments complex to meet with Nowell. When Nowell met Morrison in the parking lot of the apartment complex, a man armed with a gun and wearing a black, hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled up over his head pushed his way into the front passenger seat of Morrison's car, demanded money from Morrison and Collins, and removed a backpack from the backseat of Morrison's car before fleeing. Because the gunman wore a hooded sweatshirt, which covered much of his face, and because there was no physical evidence tying defendant to the robbery, the identification of defendant as the armed robber was the main issue at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 6 Steven Nowell was one of two identification witnesses presented by the State. He testified that on the afternoon of February 16, 2010, he had been with defendant and three other people-Cedric, \"Blue,\" and Kramer-at Kramer's apartment located in the Grayslake Apartments complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later, Nowell, Kramer, and Blue left the apartment, picked up Nowell's girlfriend, Kenyana Whiteside, and went to McDonald's to purchase some food. Nowell testified that, when they returned from McDonald's, he and Whiteside went to her apartment, which was also in the Grayslake Apartments complex. Nowell then made a phone call to Morrison to arrange for the purchase of some marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 7 According to Nowell, after he called Morrison, defendant came to Whiteside's apartment and asked to use her cell phone. Nowell claimed that, when defendant finished using Whiteside's phone, defendant asked him if he was going to get some marijuana from Morrison. Nowell testified that he told defendant \"no\" because he didn't want to share and because he \"knew what [defendant] was capable of.\" Nowell said defendant accompanied him when he left Whiteside's apartment but he saw defendant walking away from the complex as he continued toward the parking lot to meet with Morrison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 8 Nowell testified that, when he saw Morrison's car in the parking lot, he got in and noticed a man he did not know (later identified as Kiernan Collins) sitting in the rear passenger seat. Morrison then drove out of the parking lot. Shortly thereafter, Nowell stated, he got a call from Whiteside telling him he forgot his money, so he asked Morrison to go back. Morrison drove back to the parking lot, and Nowell got out. Nowell testified that, when he returned to Morrison's car, a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and brandishing a gun came up behind him. Nowell said the gunman pushed him into the passenger seat of Morrison's car and then leaned into the car and asked, \"Where's the stuff?\" The gunman then pointed the gun at him and ordered him to pat down Morrison and Collins and take their cell phones. Nowell admitted taking Morrison's cell phone but said that Morrison and Collins both surrendered their money to the gunman before he could pat them down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 9 Nowell testified that the gunman pushed him out of the car and a struggle then ensued between Morrison and the gunman as Morrison attempted to start the car. The gunman reached into the backseat, took Morrison's backpack, and then fled from the vehicle as Morrison started the car and drove off. Nowell claimed that, after the robbery, the gunman started to follow him back toward the apartment complex but then jumped into a van and took off. Nowell admitted that he kept Morrison's cell phone and said that he later threw the phone away rather than return it to Morrison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 10 Nowell further testified that the next day, February 17, 2010, after learning that the police were looking for him, he turned himself in at the Grayslake Police Department. There he was questioned, intermittently, for approximately 2 \u00bd hours before he was arrested on charges of aggravated robbery and robbery in relation to this incident. At the police station, Nowell maintained that he was not involved in the robbery, had not set up Morrison to be robbed, and did not know who the gunman was. Later, however, when he learned that he was under arrest for his part in the robbery, he admitted to the police that defendant was the gunman. Nowell also told the jury that he later had accepted a plea deal whereby he pled guilty to reduced charges in exchange for his agreement to testify against defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 11 On cross-examination, Nowell reiterated that he initially told the police he could not identify the gunman and even said that defendant could not have been the gunman because he was too short. However, when he learned that he was being charged, he told the police-as he testified at trial-that, while he never saw\n   the gunman's face, he knew it was defendant because of his voice and the clothes he was wearing. Nowell also testified that between the evening of February 16, when the robbery took place, and February 17, when he turned himself in, defendant called him several times, threatening him not to reveal defendant's identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 12 The other identification witness was Kiernan Collins, who had been sitting in the backseat of Morrison's car at the time of the robbery. Collins's rendition of the robbery was similar to Nowell's, except that he cast Nowell more as a willing participant. Collins testified that, when Nowell first entered Morrison's car and they drove out of the parking lot, Nowell claimed he got a call from his girlfriend but Collins never heard the phone ring. Collins testified that they returned to the parking lot and Nowell got out but, almost immediately, Nowell came back to the car, followed closely by the gunman in the hooded sweatshirt. Also, Collins testified that, for much of the time during the robbery, Nowell simply stood outside Morrison's car. The gunman pushed Nowell out of the way, kneeled on the passenger seat, took money from him and Morrison, and then took Morrison's backpack before fleeing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 13 Collins admitted that he did not get a good look at the gunman because the robbery took place in the evening and it was dark. In addition, the gunman had a hooded sweatshirt pulled tightly around his head, which covered most of his face. Collins also testified that during the robbery, which only lasted a short time, he was mainly focused on the gun and was fearful of looking at the gunman directly. Nonetheless, Collins gave a description of the gunman to police and selected defendant's photo out of a six-man photo array. Collins admitted on cross-examination that he described the gunman as being six feet to six feet, two inches tall and that defendant apparently is only about five feet, eight inches or five feet, nine inches tall. Also, Collins admitted that, when he selected defendant's photo from the array, he told the police that, of the pictures in the array, defendant's picture \"most resembled the gunman.\" Collins estimated that he was 70% sure that defendant was the gunman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 14 Lastly, Collins testified that on July 23, 2010, which was three days before trial was scheduled to begin, he received a collect phone call from the Lake County jail, where defendant was being held. When Collins learned the call was from \"Torrence,\" he did not accept the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 15 No physical evidence was presented at trial. Although latent fingerprints were lifted from the exterior of Morrison's vehicle, they were found either to be unsuitable for comparison or of such poor quality that comparison to defendant's prints was inconclusive. However, the State offered into evidence two recordings of phone calls defendant made from jail to his cousin, Leon Hudson. In one call, defendant told Hudson to \"put the word out on the street\" that Nowell had been released on probation and that defendant wanted his \"head on a platter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 16 The State also called as a witness Nowell's girlfriend, Kenyana Whiteside. She testified that on the evening of February 16, 2010, she received a phone call from Nowell, who told her that \"Teko,\" whom she knew and identified at trial as defendant, had just robbed somebody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 17 The only defense witness was defendant's cousin, Leon Hudson, who testified that defendant was between five feet, seven inches and five feet, eight inches tall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 18 After deliberations, the jury found defendant guilty of the armed robbery and aggravated robbery of Morrison and Collins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Those convictions were upheld on direct appeal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20101247-U\">\n    2012 IL App (2d) 101247-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206967062\">\n    2012 WL 6967062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 19 Defendant subsequently filed a postconviction petition in which he raised a number of claims alleging constitutional deprivations. In support of these claims, defendant attached to the petition more than 160 pages of the record. In one of the claims, defendant alleged he received ineffective assistance because trial counsel failed to call Morrison to testify at trial. Defendant did not attach an affidavit from Morrison to his petition. However, in lieu of an affidavit, he submitted three signed, handwritten statements that Morrison had given to the police in the course of their investigation of the robbery, as well as the police summary reports of their questioning of Morrison. These documents showed that Morrison reported the robbery to police shortly after it occurred and, in the course of the investigation, gave the police three different versions of how the robbery occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 20 In the first statement, Morrison said he was robbed by two black men as he was leaving a friend's apartment in the Grayslake Apartments complex. In the second statement, Morrison admitted knowing Nowell and said he went to the Grayslake Apartments to \"help him out\" but, when Nowell came to his car, he was with a gunman who robbed him. In the third statement, Morrison admitted going to the apartment complex with Kiernan Collins to sell marijuana to Nowell. The rest of this statement was very similar to Collins's testimony about the robbery, except that Morrison stated that he saw Nowell and the gunman walk back to the apartments together, talking and laughing and giving each other \"high fives.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 21 Morrison consistently described the gunman to police as \"tall,\" anywhere from six feet up to six feet, three inches in height. Further, Morrison did not identify defendant as the gunman when shown photos in a photo array on at least two occasions. In fact, the police reports show that Morrison selected the photo of someone other than defendant and indicated that he was sure that this other person was the gunman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 22 Defendant contended that, given the foregoing, it was unreasonable for counsel not to call Morrison. According to defendant, Morrison's statements to police were exculpatory, and by calling Morrison to testify, defendant would have been able to get them before the jury. In addition, defendant maintained he would have been able to question the police about Morrison's statements, something defendant had been prevented from doing at trial because, without Morrison testifying, the statements were inadmissible hearsay. Thus, defendant believed that the documents he attached to his petition constituted substantial evidence that his counsel had been ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 23 The circuit court dismissed defendant's petition at the second stage of postconviction proceedings, upon the State's motion. Although the circuit court agreed that Morrison's testimony would have been helpful to the defense, the circuit court found that defendant had not made a substantial showing of prejudice resulting from the failure to call Morrison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 24 On appeal, the appellate court affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of the petition. However, as to the claim of ineffective assistance based on counsel's failure to call Morrison as a witness, the appellate court held that no review on the merits was necessary because defendant failed to attach Morrison's affidavit to his petition. The appellate court held that, without Morrison's affidavit, the petition did not comply with section 122-2 of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) (\n   725 ILCS 5/122-2 (West 2014) ) and was properly dismissed for that reason alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 25 We granted defendant's petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Mar. 15, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 26 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 27 The issue in this case is whether defendant's postconviction petition was properly dismissed at the second stage without an evidentiary hearing. Although the petition defendant filed in the circuit court alleged several constitutional deprivations, before this court he has abandoned all claims except his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel's failure to call Morrison as a witness at trial. Defendant asks this court to reverse the dismissal of his petition and to remand for third-stage postconviction proceedings on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 28 The Act ( 725 ILCS 5/121-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2014) ) provides a remedy to a criminal defendant whose federal or state constitutional rights were substantially violated at trial or sentencing.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The provision unambiguously provides that an allegation of a constitutional violation in a postconviction petition must be supported by \"affidavits, records, or other evidence.\" The conjunction \"or\" signifies that the things that it connects are alternatives or choices. See Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/or (last visited Sept. 7, 2018). Nowhere does the language of the statute limit a postconviction petitioner to the use of affidavits to advance a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or, for that matter, any alleged constitutional deprivation raised in a postconviction petition. The only requirement is that the supporting evidence sufficiently demonstrate the alleged constitutional deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 33 The real problem here is that the appellate court misconstrued defendant's ineffectiveness claim.

We find, however, that reliance on these cases is misplaced. Not only are these cases factually distinguishable from the case at bar, they do not stand for the proposition that the State espouses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 34 In none of the cases cited by the State did this court create a bright-line rule or refuse to consider whether a postconviction petitioner had made a substantial showing of ineffective assistance of counsel simply because no affidavit from the proposed witness was attached to the petition. Rather, this court has always held\n   that dismissal is proper when the record or other evidence attached to the petition does not support the petitioner's claim. In cases where a postconviction petitioner raises a claim of ineffective assistance based on counsel's failure to call a witness, an affidavit from the proposed witness will be required if it is essential for the postconviction petitioner to make the necessary \"substantial showing\" to support a claim of ineffective assistance. It may be true that in most cases where this type of claim is raised, without an affidavit, there can be no way to assess whether the proposed witness could have provided evidence that would have been helpful to the defense. However, to interpret our case law as requiring an affidavit in all instances where this type of claim is raised is simply incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 35 For example, in\n   <em>\n    Thompkins\n   </em>\n   , when considering the defendant's appeal from the second-stage dismissal of his postconviction petition, we addressed his claim that his defense counsel had been ineffective for failing to interview or call as a witness a codefendant, Pamela. An affidavit from Pamela was not attached to the petition. However, the defendant stated in his own affidavit that Pamela had recanted a statement she had given to police in which she had implicated him.

Again, no affidavits from these women were attached to the petition, but the defendant claimed in his own affidavit that he had been with these women on the day of the murder and they could have provided helpful alibi testimony to counter a portion of the prosecution's case.

However, what precluded our review was the fact that there was nothing in the record to support the defendant's assertion that counsel had not spoken to these women or that the women, if called at trial, would have testified that they were with Thompkins at the pertinent time. Moreover, the defendant's assertion that he was with these women could not be taken as true because it ran counter to evidence that was presented at trial. Thus, without affidavits from these two women, it was impossible to determine whether the failure to call these proposed witnesses was evidence of ineffective assistance or simply trial strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 37 The same was true in\n   <em>\n    Guest\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Guest\n   </em>\n   also involved a second-stage dismissal of a postconviction petition.

The defendant did not provide affidavits from three of the proposed witnesses but averred in his own affidavit that, before trial, he gave counsel the names of these alibi witnesses yet counsel never interviewed them or called them to testify.

Even though we stated that, without an affidavit, further review of the claim was unnecessary, we still considered, as to each proposed witness, whether the record or any evidence presented in lieu of an affidavit sufficiently demonstrated that counsel had been ineffective. Finding none, we rejected the claim on its merits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=641%20N.E.2d%20371\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 40 In all of the cases cited above, the claims of ineffective assistance\n   were based on counsel's failure to discover and introduce new witness testimony,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   , which the defendants believed would have altered the outcome of their trials. Because the proposed witnesses that trial counsel allegedly failed to investigate or call to testify were generally the only source of this new evidence, without their affidavits, there was no proof that such evidence actually existed or that it would have been helpful to the defense. Where proof other than an affidavit was offered to show what the proposed witness would have testified, we considered that evidence and determined it was insufficient to make a substantial showing of ineffective assistance. Thus, our case law demonstrates that, when a defendant raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a postconviction petition based on counsel's failure to investigate or call a witness to testify, the petition may properly be dismissed at the second stage-whether an affidavit is attached or not-if the evidence presented in support of the claim does not make a substantial showing that counsel was ineffective. As such, our case law is in accord with the plain language of section 122-2 of the Act, which provides that allegations in a postconviction petition may be supported by \"affidavits, records, or other evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 41 Critically, under the facts of the case now before us, an affidavit from the proposed witness is not necessary to advance defendant's claim of ineffectiveness. In this case, defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective because the failure to call Morrison denied him the opportunity to bring exculpatory evidence to the attention of the jury. In support of this allegation, defendant attached three signed statements from Morrison. This documentation showed that Morrison had not identified defendant as the gunman and, instead, had identified someone else. Defendant alleged that, by not calling Morrison to the stand, he was prevented from getting this evidence to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 42 Thus, in this case, unlike the typical case, defendant did not hope to introduce new evidence that could only be verified by an affidavit from the proposed witness. Instead, defendant wanted to introduce evidence that already existed: Morrison's statements to the police, Morrison's failure to identify defendant from photo lineups, and Morrison's identification of someone other than defendant as the gunman. All of this evidence was inadmissible hearsay unless Morrison testified. Under these circumstances, anything that Morrison might say if called to testify at an evidentiary hearing is irrelevant to defendant's claim. Consequently, under the facts of this case, an affidavit from Morrison was not necessary, and it was appropriate for defendant to support the allegation of ineffectiveness with portions of the record and exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 43 Given our finding that the absence of an affidavit from Morrison was not, by itself, a sufficient basis for dismissing defendant's postconviction petition, we find that the appellate court erred in so holding.

He argues that the State's case against him was weak because no physical evidence linked him to the offense, he never made any statements incriminating himself, and the identification testimony provided by the State's main witnesses, Collins and Nowell, was not convincing. In light of the above, defendant concludes that trial counsel was deficient for not calling Morrison and, thereby, introducing Morrison's exculpatory statements to the police. Defendant further asserts that, if Morrison had been called as a witness, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different. He concludes, therefore, that he made a substantial showing that he was prejudiced by the failure to call Morrison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 46 We believe that defendant overstates the value of Morrison's statements to the police. While it is true that the materials defendant attached to his petition establish that Morrison did not identify defendant as the gunman and selected someone other than defendant from a photo array, believing him to be the gunman, the materials also show that Morrison's description of the gunman was substantially similar to Collins's description. The jury was well aware of the fact Collins's identification of defendant was uncertain because of the conditions that existed at the time of the robbery-the robbery was at night, the gunman was wearing a hooded sweatshirt tightly pulled over his head, and his focus was on the gun, which was pointed at them during the brief time that the robbery took place. In addition to these factors, Morrison was also concentrating on starting the car and escaping from the situation. These are all reasons why Morrison's identification of someone other than defendant could be called into question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 47 We also disagree that the identification evidence, as a whole, was weak. Although Collins was only 70% sure of his identification of defendant, Nowell unequivocally identified defendant as the gunman. The jury could have relied heavily on his testimony because the evidence strongly suggested that Nowell and defendant had planned the robbery together. In addition, other evidence tended to corroborate Nowell's identification of defendant. For example, Whiteside testified that Nowell called her shortly after the robbery and told her that \"Teko robbed somebody.\" This testimony also dispelled the notion that Nowell's identification of defendant was fabricated later at the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 48 Even if we were to agree with defendant that counsel's failure to call Morrison was some evidence of deficient performance, we do not believe that defendant can overcome the presumption that counsel's decision was the product of sound trial strategy. As noted above, to satisfy the deficient performance prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , a defendant must show that his counsel's performance was so inadequate \"that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed by the sixth amendment\" and, also, must overcome the strong presumption that any challenged action or inaction may have been the product of sound trial strategy.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"243850\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/186/83/#p93\">\n    186 Ill. 2d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=237%20Ill.%20Dec.%20118\">\n    237 Ill.Dec. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=708%20N.E.2d%201158\">\n    708 N.E.2d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 49 As the State points out in its brief, there are a number of reasons why defense counsel might have chosen not to call Morrison. Morrison gave the police three different statements about the manner in which the robbery occurred. These statements, as well as other materials defendant attached to his postconviction petition, showed that Morrison believed that Nowell was an active participant in the robbery. Morrison told the police that, after the robbery as he drove away from the parking lot, he saw the gunman and Nowell walking back to Nowell's apartment, laughing and giving each other \"high fives.\" Morrison's statements to the police, if presented to the jury, could have solidified Nowell's role in the robbery and given his identification of defendant even more credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 50 Also, Morrison told police that during the robbery Nowell told him to cooperate because the gunman \"had just gotten out of jail.\" Apparently, prior to the robbery, defendant had, in fact, been recently released from jail. Defense counsel might not have wanted to call Morrison and risk this information getting to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 51 Defendant argues that it was important to get Morrison's statements to the police introduced at trial because, in those statements, he consistently described the armed robber as being between six feet, one inch and six feet, three inches tall, while defendant is apparently only five feet, eight inches or five feet, nine inches in height. However, both Collins and Nowell described the gunman as being over six feet tall, and the record shows that defense counsel was able to press this point with the jury by questioning them and other witnesses at length about this discrepancy in height. In fact, defense counsel was able to bring out Morrison's description of the gunman's height during his cross-examination of Officer Joe Manges of the Grayslake Police Department. Thus, even if Morrison's statements to the police had been introduced at trial, this evidence would have simply corroborated the other witnesses on this point. Accordingly, this evidence would have been cumulative. Trial counsel's performance cannot be considered deficient because of a failure to present cumulative evidence.\n   <em>\n    People v.

In fact, that is\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   what this court has done.

The court would have simply considered the material that the defendant provided. Instead, the court rejected the claims based on the lack of an affidavit and then said what the result would be \"even if\" it considered the material that the defendant attached. This point, more so than any other, conclusively establishes the error of the majority's analysis. The majority cannot (and therefore does not) explain this court's use of the \"even if\" analysis in these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 64 In\n   <em>\n    People v.

The defendant argued that\n   <em>\n    Enis\n   </em>\n   \" 'was willing to consider the claim on its merits without affidavits to support it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The appellate court correctly rejected this argument. The court noted that this court \"did not equivocate about the necessity for affidavits from proposed witnesses\" and viewed the lack of an affidavit as an independent reason for rejecting the defendant's ineffective assistance claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the appellate court correctly observed that \"in the absence of the requisite affidavit, [Enis's] claim would not have survived even if meritorious.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 65 The Seventh Circuit has similarly read Illinois case law as imposing an affidavit requirement. In\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Calloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n    842 F.3d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2016), the defendant argued in a\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   proceeding that his attorney had been ineffective for failing to call his codefendant as a witness. The Seventh Circuit noted that the defendant had raised this same claim in an Illinois postconviction proceeding. The trial court had dismissed the petition, and the appellate court affirmed on the basis that the defendant had failed to attach an affidavit from his codefendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n    at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appellate court held that the defendant was required to attach an affidavit from his codefendant stating both that he was willing to testify and what the subject of the testimony would have been.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n    at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appellate\n   court stated that the failure to attach the affidavit was alone sufficient to justify the dismissal but went on to explain that defendant could not satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test in any event.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n    at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first question that the federal court had to answer was whether the state court had found the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim to be procedurally defaulted. The court held that it had been, as the Illinois appellate court held that the lack of an affidavit alone justified the dismissal. The Seventh Circuit explained that \"Illinois courts regularly enforce the affidavit rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128730\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/454/\">\n    at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it appears that the Illinois Supreme Court is the only court that does not believe that the Illinois Supreme Court's cases mean what they say.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 66 The majority tries to argue that this case is somehow different from other ones in which this court has required an affidavit. The majority claims that defendant simply wanted to introduce evidence that already existed (Morrison's statements to the police, his failure to identify defendant in a photo lineup, and his identification of someone else as the gunman) and that Morrison's testimony is\n   <em>\n    irrelevant\n   </em>\n   to defendant's claim. That is certainly interesting, given that defendant pleaded in his postconviction petition that, \"[i]n the case at bar, there was no reasonable strategic purpose in failing to call Matt Morrison as a witness.\n   <em>\n    Without the exculpatory testimony of Morrison\n   </em>\n   , the jury was left only with the State's version of events.\" (Emphasis added.) And, again, we do not have an affidavit from Morrison, so we do not know if he was willing to testify and what his testimony would have been. The majority claims that the \"real problem here is that the appellate court misconstrued defendant's ineffectiveness claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Defendant's petition proves that it is actually the majority that has misconstrued defendant's ineffectiveness claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 67 There is in fact nothing remarkable about the claim before us, and it is strikingly similar to a claim for which we required an affidavit in\n   <em>\n    Enis\n   </em>\n   . With respect to prospective witness Roy Norvell, the defendant argued that, if called, Norvell would testify that he saw a man wearing white sunglasses in the victim's parking lot and that he had identified someone other than the defendant as the man wearing the white sunglasses.\n   <em>\n    Enis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1096315\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/194/361/\">\n    194 Ill. 2d at 386-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=252%20Ill.%20Dec.%20427\">\n    252 Ill.Dec. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20N.E.2d%201\">\n    743 N.E.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant did not provide an affidavit from Norvell but instead relied on police reports and interviews with Norvell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=252%20Ill.%20Dec.%20427\">\n    252 Ill.Dec. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20N.E.2d%201\">\n    743 N.E.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These documents were sufficient for this court to review the substance of the defendant's claim, but the court\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   rejected the claim on the basis that the defendant had \"failed to support this claim with the necessary affidavit from Norvell.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20N.E.2d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the present case is on all fours with\n   <em>\n    Enis\n   </em>\n   , and if an affidavit was necessary in\n   <em>\n    Enis\n   </em>\n   , it is also necessary here. Given the similarity between the present case and\n   <em>\n    Enis\n   </em>\n   , it will be impossible for the appellate court to discern when an affidavit is required and when it is not, and this problem is a direct result of the majority's refusal to acknowledge what our cases actually say.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 68 The majority claims that its holding that an affidavit is not always required to support this type of claim is in accord with the plain language of the statute, which merely requires that a petition have attached to it \" 'affidavits, records, or other evidence' \" supporting its allegations.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. The majority claims that there is \"no statutory support for the appellate court's holding.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The problem with this statement is that\n   <em>\n    this court\n   </em>\n   has interpreted the statute as meaning that, when the claim raised in a postconviction petition is ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to call a particular\n   witness, the supporting document\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be an affidavit. The appellate court is not free to ignore this court's holdings. The statute generically lists what kinds of supporting documents may be used in support of postconviction claims, but this court has clarified which type must be used in support of a particular postconviction claim and has explained why this is so. When this court has interpreted a statute, that interpretation\n   <em>\n    becomes part of the statute itself\n   </em>\n   unless and until the legislature amends it to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    People v. Woodard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"295830\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/175/435/#p444\">\n    175 Ill. 2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=222%20Ill.%20Dec.%20401\">\n    222 Ill.Dec. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20N.E.2d%20935\">\n    677 N.E.2d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). Thus, this court's clear unequivocal statement in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Guest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Enis\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   that the type of supporting documentation in cases such as this must be an affidavit is now considered part of the statute itself. This court has consistently expressed that rule for decades, and the legislature has not amended the statute in response. The majority clearly errs in ignoring what our cases actually say and treating the issue before us as one of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 69 If the majority believes this court's cases are in error, it needs to overrule them. If it believes that the court made a mistake, then it should own the mistake rather than claiming that our cases say something other than what they clearly say. However, this would require a discussion of why departure from\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   is appropriate, which may be difficult.\n   <em>\n    Stare decisis\n   </em>\n   considerations are at their apex in matters of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    People v. Espinoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20118218\">\n    2015 IL 118218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=398%20Ill.%20Dec.%2083\">\n    398 Ill.Dec. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20N.E.3d%20993\">\n    43 N.E.3d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court has construed the statute as requiring an affidavit when the claim is ineffective assistance for failure to call a particular witness. This interpretation has been clearly stated and consistently applied by this court and the appellate court for decades. Likely realizing the difficulty it faces here, the majority instead tries to argue that our cases say something other than what they actually do and criticizes the appellate court for failing to discern the hidden meaning in those cases. I cannot go along with such an analysis. The appellate court's holding has a sound basis in this court's case law, and I would affirm its decision for the reasons stated in its opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 70 JUSTICE KILBRIDE joins in this special concurrence.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
