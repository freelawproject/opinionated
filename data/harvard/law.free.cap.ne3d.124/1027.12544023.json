Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 At the arbitration hearing on September 28, 2015, the parties stipulated that the claimant had sustained a workplace accident on May 24, 2011, arising out of and in the course of his employment with Euclid Beverage (Euclid) and that he had provided timely notice. The issue before the arbitrator was whether a causal relationship existed between the accident and the claimant's current condition of ill-being. The parties also disputed the claimant's entitlement to benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 As a condition of his employment with Euclid, the claimant testified that he underwent a physical examination and functional screening test to demonstrate his ability to lift 50 pounds. He was subsequently hired by Euclid in 1999 as a sales supervisor and held that position until November 2011. In his capacity as sales supervisor, the claimant called various retailers, such as Jewel-Osco, and took orders for beer sales on a handheld device, filled shelves, and built displays to hold anywhere from 10 to 1000 cases of beer. The claimant testified that he performed repetitive\n   lifting of up to 50 pounds, as well as bending, twisting, and reaching throughout the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 The claimant next testified regarding his previous employment. Prior to Euclid, the claimant worked for Courtesy Distributors for approximately 18 years, first as a delivery driver and then as a delivery manager for four months. As delivery manager, he supervised multiple delivery drivers and ensured proper display and rotation of merchandise. According to the claimant, he was not required to operate a computer; manage inventory or sales; or hire, evaluate, or terminate employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 The claimant testified that on May 24, 2011, he experienced a sharp pain in his back that radiated down his right leg and \"knocked [him] down\" while stocking a cooler at a Jewel-Osco location. Following this incident, the claimant contacted Sonia Madalinski, Euclid's human resources director, before a coworker transported him to Tyler Medical Services (TMS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Shortly thereafter, the claimant presented to TMS and was examined by Dr. George Pappas. After Dr. Pappas documented the claimant's symptoms as \"pain radiating into the right leg with tingling,\" he diagnosed the claimant with a \"lumbar sprain with spasms.\" Dr. Pappas recommended chiropractic treatment and light-duty work restrictions, which included bending, as tolerated, and lifting no more than 10 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 The claimant testified that he received medical attention for a low back injury prior to the May 24, 2011, accident, although it was asymptomatic prior to the 2011 accident. The claimant's June 2011 MRI of the lumbar region showed a degenerative change in the lumbar spine with disc disease at L2-L3 to L5-S1 and associated lower lumbar ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy, which further contributed to central canal and foramina narrowing at L4-L5 and L5-S1. The claimant was referred to a neurosurgeon, Dr. Matthew Ross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 On September 14, 2011, Dr. Ross diagnosed the claimant with lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to disc disease at L5-S1. Dr. Ross recommended nonsurgical treatment with lumbar epidural and transforaminal cortisone injections. Dr. Ross also recommended the claimant avoid lifting over 20 pounds and begin a gradual decrease in work activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 On September 30, 2011, the claimant presented to Dr. Christopher J. Bergin, an orthopedic surgeon, for a medical evaluation pursuant to section 12 of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act (Act) ( 820 ILCS 305/12 (West 2010) ) at Euclid's request. Because the claimant's earlier low back injury had been asymptomatic prior to the May 24, 2011, accident, and the mechanism of injury was consistent with aggravation of an underlying degenerative condition, Dr. Bergin concluded that the claimant's condition of ill-being was causally related to the May 24, 2011, accident. Dr. Bergin recommended physical therapy, lumbar epidural injections, and light-duty work restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 On November 22, 2011, Madalinski and Emmett McEnery, Euclid's president, terminated the claimant after informing him that his light-duty work restrictions would no longer be accommodated. The claimant did not seek or gain employment following termination. As such, from November 23, 2011, through April 24, 2012, the claimant received temporary total disability (TTD) benefits. According to the claimant, although he requested, Euclid refused to provide vocational rehabilitation services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 On February 6, 2012, Larry McGrail, Euclid's vice president of operations, invited the claimant to interview for\n   a warehouse manager position. McGrail's letter stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"As you know, the position does not rely on physical ability but rather on the ability to manage people and processes. This Warehouse Manager is responsible for the staff, protecting the integrity of inventory, equipment and the facility and ensuring the trucks get loaded.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although the claimant received McGrail's letter, he did not interview because he did not feel qualified for the position, given his highest level of education was a high school diploma. Specifically, the claimant believed he lacked the appropriate training and education in warehouse management, inventory control and management, employee scheduling, product shipment, equipment and property management, as well as bills of lading. The claimant used a computer for e-mail and Internet usage, although he described his keyboarding skills as \"hunting and pecking,\" and he lacked training in database programs or Excel spreadsheets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 On February 7, 2012, the claimant presented to Dr. Bergin for a second section 12 evaluation. According to Dr. Bergin's report, the claimant refused epidural injections and declined a surgical procedure. Dr. Bergin diagnosed the claimant with degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with a right synovial cyst at L4-L5 and right L5 radiculopathy. Dr. Bergin opined that the claimant's May 24, 2011, accident had aggravated a preexisting degenerative condition and that he was at maximum medical improvement (MMI) and should undergo a functional capacity evaluation (FCE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 On April 12, 2012, the claimant presented to Dr. James Kelly. Dr. Kelly administered two injections, which, according to the claimant, offered several years of pain relief. Dr. Kelly noted that the claimant had a 50% to 60% improvement in pain but still experienced numbness that was unaffected in his right leg. Specifically, the claimant's pain had improved to a 3 on a 10 scale. Dr. Kelly recommended repeat lumbar epidural cortisone injections, pending authorization, and to follow up with Dr. Ross to increase his work activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 On April 24, 2012, Dr. Ross released the claimant to work with restrictions to \"lift up to 15 lbs. Alternate sit/stand as needed.\" Following his release to work, Euclid terminated the claimant's TTD benefits on April 24, 2012, after informing him that future employment was unavailable with the above restrictions. The claimant testified that he did not look for work after this date, but he received social security disability (SSD) benefits starting in May 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 On January 10, 2014, 20 months after his last medical visit, the claimant presented to Dr. Ross. Dr. Ross noted that the injections administrated by Dr. Kelly provided the claimant with a \"lengthy duration of relief,\" and that Dr. Kelly was in agreement with the claimant's request to complete a FCE. The claimant testified, however, that Euclid never authorized the recommended cortisone injections and the FCE was never scheduled because the insurance company refused to reimburse payment. The claimant testified that his last medical appointment before the arbitration hearing was on January 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 On April 27, 2015, the claimant presented to Lisa Helma, certified rehabilitation counselor at Vocamotive Vocational Rehabilitation Services. In preparing an evaluation report, labor market survey, and rehabilitation plan, Helma interviewed the claimant and reviewed his medical and personnel records, McGrail's invitation to interview for warehouse manager, and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Helma noted that the warehouse manager position\n   was skilled at the sedentary level of physical demand and that the claimant \"does not have previous experience in this capacity. Based upon the results of the Labor Market Survey, [he] would not be a qualified candidate.\" Helma opined that, although the claimant lost access to his usual and customary line of occupation, he was employable in prior-held positions with the potential to earn $ 9 and $ 12 per hour. In forming her opinion, Helma was unaware that the claimant had placed orders with a handheld device while employed with Euclid and that he had previously worked for Courtesy Distributors as a delivery manager where he supervised multiple employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 McEnery testified to the following. Euclid hired the claimant, a good employee with numerous positive performance appraisals, in 1999. The claimant was required to have a thorough knowledge of essential trade practices because he was responsible for increasing beer sales and distribution, thus, his compensation was tied to his performance. The software used in the claimant's handheld device did not require advanced training, but the claimant had completed mandatory training prior to starting his position as a sales supervisor. According to McEnery, the claimant was a good fit for the warehouse manager position because he had acquired a variety of special skills over 30 years in the industry. In fact, although there were over 150 capable employees, McEnery had recommended the claimant interview for the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19 McGrail testified to the following. McGrail was very familiar with the claimant and his skill set, which included use of Euclid's software system. McGrail invited the claimant to interview because he believed the claimant was capable of managing and supervising employees, McGrail acknowledged that the claimant did not have experience as an assistant warehouse manager. McGrail also explained that Euclid had terminated the claimant due to his permanent light-duty work restrictions and that he did not offer the claimant a permanent job with work restrictions because the claimant did not interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20 The arbitrator's decision, issued on April 6, 2016, determined that (1) there was a causal connection between the May 24, 2011, work accident and the claimant's current condition of ill-being; (2) the claimant was entitled to TTD benefits of $ 713.91 per week for 22 weeks from November 23, 2011, through April 24, 2012, with Euclid receiving a credit of $ 13,360.71 for previously paid TTD benefits; (3) the claimant was entitled to maintenance benefits of $ 713.91 per week for 162\n   <sup>\n    6\n   </sup>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    7\n   </sub>\n   weeks from April 25, 2012, through June 8, 2015; and (4) the claimant was entitled to permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits, specifically wage differential benefits, for $ 433.91 per week from June 9, 2015, through the duration of his disability, pursuant to section 8(d)(1) of the Act ( 820 ILCS 305/8(d)(1) (West 2010) ), because his injuries caused an impairment of earnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21 On April 20, 2016, Euclid filed a petition for review before the Commission. On June 27, 2017, the Commission adopted in part and modified in part the arbitrator's decision. The Commission affirmed the arbitrators' award of maintenance and TTD benefits, however, it modified the PPD award from wage differential to a percentage of the person as a whole award, pursuant to section 8(d)(2) of the Act, for $ 642.52 per week for a period of 200 weeks for 40% loss of man as a whole. The Commission determined that the claimant's \"election not to work after being medically cleared to work again prevented him from establishing what he is capable of earning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22 On August 7, 2017, Euclid filed for review in the circuit court of Du Page County. On January 9, 2018, the circuit court, without hearing, confirmed in part and set aside in part the Commission's decision. The court confirmed the Commission's decision to award PPD benefits based on a percentage of the person as a whole under section 8(d)(2) of the Act but set aside the Commission's decision to award maintenance benefits, finding that the record did not demonstrate that the claimant participated in a vocational rehabilitation program or self-directed job search between April 25, 2012, and June 8, 2015. On January 31, 2018, the claimant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 23 II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 24 This appeal is limited to the propriety of the various types of compensation awarded. In particular, the claimant contends that the Commission's decision to award maintenance benefits was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because Euclid denied the claimant's request for vocational rehabilitation services in violation of section 8(a) of the Act and Illinois Commission Rule 7110.10(a) ( 50 Ill. Adm. Code 7110.10(a), amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Ill.%20Reg.%2011743\">\n    30 Ill. Reg. 11743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (eff. June 22, 2006) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he experienced a reduction in earning capacity after Euclid terminated his employment. The claimant also argues that the Commission's percentage of the person as a whole PPD award was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 25 In response, Euclid argues that the claimant was not entitled to maintenance benefits because he was not enrolled in a vocational rehabilitation program or engaged in a self-directed job search after April 24, 2012, and he failed to present credible evidence demonstrating a reduction in earning capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 26 A. Maintenance Benefits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 27 The claimant argues that Euclid violated section 8(a) of the Act and Commission Rule 7110.10 ( 50 Ill. Adm. Code 7110.10 ), amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Ill.%20Reg.%2011743\">\n    30 Ill. Reg. 11743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (eff.

First, the claimant never sought or gained employment following termination from Euclid on November 22, 2011. As such, rehabilitation would be neither mandatory nor appropriate because the claimant did not show an intention to return to work, although he was capable, as evidenced by Dr. Ross's notes releasing the claimant to work with work restrictions on April 24, 2012, to \"lift up to 15 lbs. Alternate sit/stand as needed.\" Moreover, it is undisputed that the claimant did not enroll in a vocational rehabilitation program or engage in a self-directed job search after Euclid terminated his TTD benefits on April 24, 2012. In fact, the Commission concluded that the claimant abandoned the job market on that date. On that basis, contrary to the Commission's\n   decision, Euclid's obligation to provide maintenance was never triggered, and the claimant failed to cite authority to support that notion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 33 Even assuming the claimant was entitled to rehabilitative services, he could have requested an expedited hearing under section 19(b) of the Act ( 820 ILCS 305/19(b) (West 2010) (\"the employee may at any time petition for an expedited hearing by an Arbitrator on the issue of whether or not he or she is entitled to receive payment of the services or compensation\") ). The claimant failed to request such a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 34 Furthermore, we cannot find that the claimant proved a reduction in his earning capacity after he was terminated from Euclid. First, the Commission found that he had failed to prove his earning capacity because his reliance on Helma's labor survey was \"unacceptable speculation.\" In rejecting Helma's opinions, the Commission concluded that Helma's report was completed in anticipation of litigation, just four months prior to the arbitration hearing, and that Helma lacked knowledge regarding the claimant's previous employment managing employees as a delivery manager, which would have likely broadened the scope of possible employment opportunities. Thus, the Commission concluded that the claimant was prevented from establishing \"what he is capable of earning.\" In light of the foregoing, we find that the Commission's decision, awarding the claimant maintenance benefits from April 25, 2012, to September 28, 2015, was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, the circuit court's decision setting aside the Commission decision to award maintenance benefits is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 35 B.

A percentage of the person as a whole award is appropriate in three circumstances: (1) when a claimant's injuries do not prevent him from pursuing the duties of his employment but he is disabled from pursuing other occupations or is otherwise physically impaired, (2) when a claimant's injuries partially incapacitate him from pursuing the duties of his usual and customary line\n   of employment but do not result in an impairment of earning capacity, or (3) when a claimant, having suffered an impairment of earning capacity, elects to waive his right to recover. 820 ILCS 305/8(d)(2) (West 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 39 Our supreme court has expressed a preference for wage differential benefits over a scheduled award, noting \"the basis of the workers' compensation system should be earnings loss.\"\n   <em>\n    General Electric Co. v.
