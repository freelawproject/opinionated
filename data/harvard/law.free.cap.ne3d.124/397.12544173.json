Two issues are raised in this appeal. The first is whether the police department's inventory search policy is so expansive that it makes all inventory searches evidentiary searches. The second issue is whether the Ohio Supreme Court's recent holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks-Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552469\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/96/262/\">\n    152 Ohio St.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552469\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/96/262/\">\n    2018-Ohio-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552469\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/96/262/\">\n    96 N.E.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   overruled its prior decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The inventory search policy complied with the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hathman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Banks-Harvey\n   </em>\n   did not overrule\n   <em>\n    Hathman\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, the arguments made during the suppression hearing did not include the argument that the inventory search policy was so expansive to be considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Thus, in addition to being meritless, the argument was waived. The trial court's decision is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Statement of the Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} On January 14, 2017 Appellant was driving eastbound on State Route 224 when Sergeant Paul Grimes of the Boardman Police Department stopped Appellant for speeding. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 6, 8. Upon questioning Appellant, Sergeant Grimes observed an odor of marijuana coming from the car and noticed Appellant's red, blood shot eyes. Appellant advised the sergeant that he had smoked marijuana 20 minutes prior to the stop. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 9, 11. At that point the sergeant called for another officer to come to the scene; the sergeant had probable cause to search the vehicle. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b64} While the vehicle was searched, Appellant's name was run through the computer system. It was discovered that he had several license suspensions in Ohio, and there were warrants for his arrest from Austintown and Struthers. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b65} The probable cause search of the vehicle did not result in discovery of anything illegal. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 31. However, Appellant was arrested for the warrant out of Struthers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b66} Sergeant Grimes decided to have the vehicle towed and started an inventory search. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 12-13. In response to the sergeant's lights, Appellant stopped the vehicle at the Shell Station at the corner of State Route 224 and South Avenue; he parked the vehicle at a gas pump. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 9, 12-13. The location of the vehicle was part of the reason Sergeant Grimes decided to have the vehicle towed. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 12-13. The sergeant admitted he could have allowed Appellant to call a relative or someone to come and get the vehicle. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 35. However, because Appellant lived in the Pittsburgh area, the sergeant determined it would take too long to have that done. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 36-37. Instead, the sergeant opted to have the vehicle towed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b67} Boardman Police Department has an inventory search policy; there is a vehicle tow sheet that lists the areas to search in the vehicle. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 12, 17. The tow sheet indicates the officer is to check the spare tire compartment and look for the jack. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 15, 17. The spare tire compartment was under a large speaker box and the officer had to use force to open the compartment. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 14-15, 44, 47, 51. In the compartment he found a knotted shopping bag. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 13-14. Pursuant to the Boardman Police Department policy, the sergeant opened the bag. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 15. In the bag were \"bindles\" of heroin. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 13-14, 49. At that point the sergeant stopped the inventory search and had the vehicle towed to the Boardman police station. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b68} Appellant was indicted for trafficking heroin in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2)(C)(6)(e), a second-degree felony and aggravated trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2)(C)(1)(a), a fourth-degree felony. 4/13/17 Indictment. The indictment contained a forfeiture specification. 4/13/17 Indictment. The trafficking heroin count of the indictment alleged Appellant trafficked more than 100 units but less than 500 units of heroin. The aggravated\n   trafficking count was for the drug Fentanyl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b69} Appellant entered a not guilty plea and filed a motion to suppress. In the motion to suppress, Appellant argued the inventory search did not conform to the standardized practices and procedures of the Boardman Police Department. 8/2/17 Motion to Suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b610} The state filed a motion in opposition to the motion to suppress arguing the sergeant followed the established procedures. 10/31/17 Motion in Opposition. Attached to the motion in opposition was Boardman Police Department's Vehicle Towing and Impound Procedural Manual. 10/31/17 Motion in Opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b611} The trial court overruled the motion to suppress. 11/6/17 J.E. It held the sergeant followed the inventory search policy of the Boardman Police Department. 11/6/17 J.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b612} Thereafter, Appellant entered a no contest plea to the indictment. The trial court accepted the plea, found Appellant guilty, and sentenced Appellant to an aggregate two and a half years in prison. 11/28/17 J.E. Appellant received two years for trafficking heroin and six months for aggravated trafficking of Fentanyl. The court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b613} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal asserting the suppression ruling was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b614} \"Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He claimed the search of the trunk area, underneath the speaker, exceeded the permissible scope of the inventory search because Sergeant Grimes could not plausibly believe Appellant kept valuables in that area of the vehicle. And as to the plastic bag, Appellant argued the sergeant could not plausibly believe it contained valuables. 8/2/2017 Motion to Suppress. In response, the state attached to its motion in opposition to the motion to suppress the Boardman Police Department's Vehicle Towing and Impoundment Policy and argued the policy was followed. 10/31/17 Motion in Opposition to Motion to Suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b619} Appellant argues on appeal the inventory search policy is so expansive that it serves no lawful inventory purpose and instead crosses over to allow for the police to conduct an evidentiary search of every vehicle impounded. When that policy is taken in conjunction with the discretionary, not mandatory, decision of Sergeant Grimes to impound the vehicle, Appellant contends the search was unconstitutionally evidentiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b620} Appellant is correct that the impoundment of the vehicle was not required. The Boardman Police Department Inventory Search Policy sets forth when impoundment is mandatory and when it is discretionary. Section 125.20 of the Policy states officers \"may\" order impoundment when the operator of the vehicle is physically arrested and removed from control of the vehicle. Section 125.22 states the officer should consider impoundment of the vehicle when the vehicle is on private property not owned by the driver, the vehicle cannot be released in a timely manner, which is defined generally as 60 minutes, or the vehicle owner or operator is impaired to the extent that he cannot make a valid decision regarding disposition of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b621} Here, the vehicle was stopped at the Shell Gas Station, which is a business and private property. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 9, 12-13. Furthermore, the officer testified the vehicle was in front of a gas pump. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 12-13. Patrons would not be able to utilize that pump to purchase gas if the vehicle was left in that position. The officer also testified Appellant was a Pennsylvania resident and his home address was located somewhere in Pittsburgh roughly 60 minutes away. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 36-37. The officer did not ask Appellant if he could call someone to pick up the vehicle. The officer admitted it was not mandatory to impound\n   the vehicle under the Boardman Police Department Policy, but decided to impound the vehicle because of the amount of time it would take to have a relative or friend pick it up and the placement of the vehicle. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b622} The Impoundment Policy also states that all impounded vehicles must be inventoried. Section 125.51. An inventory is necessary for the protection of the department and towing company from unfounded claims of loss or damage, for the protection of the owner from actual loss or damage, and for the protection of the police, the towing company and the public due to hazardous contents of the vehicle, including but not limited to firearms. Section 125.50. The trunk is required to be inventoried and closed containers are to be opened and inventoried unless the containers cannot be opened without damaging them. Section 125.52(5). Locked items can be opened and inventoried if the officer can readily obtain a key or combination to the lock. Section 125.52(5). The policy indicates an inventory search cannot be a pretext to carrying out an investigative search. Section 125.53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b623} The testimony in this case was contradictory as to whether the spare tire well could be accessed without physically unbolting the speaker sitting on the lid to the spare tire well. The officer testified the speaker was sitting on the spare tire compartment and he could lift up the lid 8-10 inches. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 14, 51. Appellant testified the speaker was bolted down and the lid could not be lifted. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b624} Sergeant Grimes testified that part of the inventory search and the Boardman Police Department's Inventory Search Policy check list required the officer to look for the spare tire and jack. 11/1/17 Suppression Tr. 15, 17. It was in the spare tire compartment a knotted plastic grocery bag was found. The officer opened this bag pursuant to the department policy which permitted the opening of closed containers. Inside bindles of heroin were found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b625} Appellant attempts to liken this case to an Eighth Appellate District case where the opening of an aerosol can with a false bottom found in the trunk of a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizures.\n   <em>\n    State v.
