However, they are customers of the Town's municipal water utility (\"the Water Utility\"). They filed, pro se, a lawsuit against the Town in which they sought declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the legality of a water rate ordinance the Town enacted in 2018. Graham/Disser now appeal the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the Town. They raise multiple issues on appeal, but we decide only the dispositive issue of whether\n   the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Town on the grounds that Graham/Disser failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [2] We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Adoption of Challenged Ordinance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [3] The Town operates the Water Utility, which supplies water to customers in the Town and in some areas outside of the Town limits. The Water Utility also supplies unmetered water to public fire hydrants used by firefighters for fire suppression. Thus, the Water Utility incurs certain costs in providing water service for public fire protection both within and without of Town limits. The Indiana Code allows municipal water utilities to recover such costs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-1.5-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1 to -15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [4] Prior to 2002, the Water Utility was subject to the jurisdiction of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (\"IURC\") and was required to seek IURC approval to establish or change any rates and charges to recover costs of providing water service for public fire protection. However, in 2002 the Water Utility withdrew from the jurisdiction of the IURC, as allowed by law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 8-1.5-3-9.1 (2002). Thereafter, the Water Utility's rates and charges were established by the Town Council passing rate ordinances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 8-1.5-3-8.1 (allowing a municipal legislative body to adopt and change utility rates and charges by adopting rate ordinances).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [5] Until 2010, the Water Utility allocated its costs for water service for public fire protection to the Town itself and levied an annual hydrant fee on the Town. In 2010, the Town decided the Water Utility should instead recover such costs through customer rates, as permitted by law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 8-1-2-103(d) (2010) (providing that a municipality may fund public fire protection services through charges \"in the basic rates of all customers of the utility within the municipality,\" rather than charges directly to the municipality). Therefore, the Town adopted Ordinance 2010-09 (\"2010 Ordinance\") under which Section 54.22 enacted a new charge for water service for fire protection, named \"Public Fire Protection Charge\" (\"the Fee\"), on all water customers. App. Vol. IV at 191-92. The ordinance also included a schedule under which the amount billed to a customer was related to the size of the customer's water meter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the ordinance did not exempt customers outside the Town limits, the Water Utility charged the new rate only to customers within the Town limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [6] In 2018, the Town decided to start charging the Fee to certain water customers outside of the Town limits. Therefore, the Town proposed Ordinance 2018-14 (\"2018 Ordinance\")-an amendment to Section 54.22-which reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (A)\n   <em>\n    Fire protection service fees\n   </em>\n   . Pursuant to Indiana Code section 8-1-2-103(d), each user shall pay the fire protection service fees, which consist of (i) private and/or (ii) public. This fee applies to all Town residents on town water and any non-resident on Town water who is within 1,000 ft of a town hydrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   App. Vol. III at 125.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [7] The 2018 Ordinance was introduced and first read during the regular public meeting of the Town Council on May 10, 2018. The Town scheduled a public hearing for June 28, 2018, to allow users of the water works, owners of property served or to be serviced by the water works, and other interested persons to be heard concerning the proposed rates and charges. The Town published a formal Notice of the public hearing and mailed it to users of the water works whose property is located outside the Town limits. The Notice informed ratepayers that, following adoption of the ordinance, they may challenge the ordinance\n   under Indiana Code Sections 8-1.5-3-8.2 or 8-1.5-3-8.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Town Council adopted the 2018 Ordinance on July 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Relevant Municipally Owned Utility Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [8] Indiana Code Sections 8-1.5-3-1 to -15 govern the operation of municipally owned utilities, including water services, and Indiana Code Sections 8-1.5-3-8 to 8.3 govern utility rates and charges.

Before adopting an ordinance related to rates and charges, the municipality must hold a public hearing and give notice of the same. I.C. \u00a7 8-1.5-3-8.1.

They attended the June 28, 2018, public hearing on the 2018 Ordinance and voiced their concerns. However, they did not file an administrative appeal of the 2018 Ordinance. Instead, on July 30, 2018, Graham/Disser filed, pro se, a \"Verified Petition for Declaratory Relief and Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" in the Hendricks Circuit Court. The Petition sought a declaration that the 2018 Ordinance is \"void and invalid\" because it: (1) violates Indiana Code Section 8-1-2-103(d) ; (2) charges for a service for which Graham/Disser were already paying; (3) violates their \"rights\" by charging the Fee to water customers outside of Town limits but within 1,000 feet of a fire hydrant but not charging similarly-situated non-water customers; and (4) was implemented for the purpose of harassing those who remonstrated against an on-going annexation action. App. Vol. II at 17-21. The Petition also sought a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the 2018 Ordinance. The Town filed its Answer on August 20, 2018, and raised the affirmative defenses that: (1) the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; and (2) the action is barred by the plaintiffs' \"failure to exhaust their remedies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n    Ind.

On September 14, Graham/Disser filed their third discovery request which included five requests for admissions. The Town served its response to the requests for admissions on October 16, which was seven days past the due date for the admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [11] On October 4, 2018, Graham/Disser filed an amended complaint under which they added claims that: (1) the 2018 Ordinance violates Article 1, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution ; (2) the \"fee is not a fee but rather an additional tax; a tax that is being unfairly assessed onto only certain persons. This fee is a constitutional violation,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n    at 38-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted); (3) the \"fee/tax ... creates unequal assessment,\" App. Vol. III at 39; (4) to the extent Indiana Code Section 8-1-2-103(d) allows the Fee to be unequally \"assessed\" to water customers outside of Town limits who are within and without of 1,000 feet of a fire hydrant, it violates \"the constitution,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n    at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (5) the original water service fee enacted under the 2010 Ordinance \"was not properly adopted,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-1.5-3\">\n    at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [12] Because the Town did not file an answer to the amended complaint by the October 31 due date, Graham/Disser moved for default judgment. In doing so, they noted that the admissions they had requested of the Town in their third discovery request were deemed admitted under Trial Rule 36 because the Town did not timely answer the request. On November 14, the Town filed its answer to the amended complaint in which it raised the same affirmative defenses. The trial court denied Graham/Disser's motion for default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [13] On November 27, the Town filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on all of Graham/Disser's claims and also on the Town's exhaustion of administrative remedies affirmative defense. Graham/Disser filed their response, including their affidavits,\n   on December 27. On January 9, 2019, the Town filed its reply regarding summary judgment, and it moved to strike portions of Graham/Disser's affidavits and to withdraw its admissions pursuant to Trial Rule 36(B). The trial court granted the Town's motion to strike and its motion to withdraw its admissions. Graham/Disser then filed a motion to reconsider the order allowing the Town to withdraw its admissions and moved to strike certain portions of the Town's summary judgment reply. On January 13, 2019, the trial court denied Graham/Disser's motions to reconsider and to strike, and issued an order granting the Town's motion for summary judgment \"on all Plaintiff's claims.\" Appealed Order at 1. Graham/Disser now appeal the order permitting the Town to withdraw its admissions, the order striking portions of their affidavits, and the order granting the Town summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [14] The Town moved for summary judgment on the grounds that there are no disputed questions of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all issues, including Graham/Disser's failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.

It could decide on administrative review that, for example, the ordinance must be changed or repealed because it erroneously charges customers twice for the same service, as Graham/Disser allege; such a decision would resolve the case and make the constitutionality of Indiana Code Section 8-1-2-103(d), as applied, moot. Or the Town could decide that the ordinance should be repealed because it was enacted solely for the purpose of harassing annexation remonstrators like Graham/Disser, as they also claim. Graham/Disser may believe it is unlikely that the Town will grant them such relief on agency review, but \"the mere fact that an administrative agency might refuse to provide the relief requested does not amount to futility.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948169\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/829/979/#p982\">\n    829 N.E.2d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
