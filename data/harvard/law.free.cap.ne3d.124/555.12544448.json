Johnson,\n     <em>\n      in absentia\n     </em>\n     . In August 2017, following his arrest on unrelated charges, defendant filed a \"Motion for Resentencing Consideration.\" The trial court dismissed the motion as an untimely motion to reconsider sentence. See 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-50(d) (West 2016).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     \u00b6 2 On appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion without first conducting an evidentiary hearing pursuant to section 115-4.1(e) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code) ( 725 ILCS 5/115-4.1(e) (West 2016) ). We agree.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     \u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     \u00b6 4 In June 2015, the State charged defendant by information with burglary (count I) ( 720 ILCS 5/19-1(a) (West 2014) ) and theft with a prior residential burglary conviction (count II) (\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     \u00a7 16-1(a)(1)(A) ). In July 2015, defendant pleaded guilty to count II in exchange for a sentence of 24 months' probation.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     \u00b6 5 In February 2016, the State filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation. At an August 2016 hearing, defendant stipulated to the allegations in the petition in exchange for the State's agreement to cap its sentencing recommendation at three years' imprisonment. The trial court set a sentencing hearing for October 5, 2016. Defendant failed to appear at the sentencing hearing, and the trial court (Judge Thomas J. Difanis) resentenced defendant\n     <em>\n      in absentia\n     </em>\n     to an extended term of six years' imprisonment. The court issued a warrant for defendant's arrest.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     \u00b6 6 On May 3, 2017, defendant appeared in custody on unrelated charges. The judge presiding (Judge Brett N. Olmstead) advised defendant that, following his October 5, 2016, failure to appear for resentencing on his probation violation, the trial court sentenced defendant,\n     <em>\n      in absentia\n     </em>\n     , to six years' imprisonment.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     \u00b6 7 On August 2, 2017, defendant filed a\n     <em>\n      pro se\n     </em>\n     motion titled \"Motion for Resentencing Consideration.\" In the motion, defendant stated he was not present for sentencing on October 5, 2016, because he had been admitted to the hospital \"awaiting * * * oxygen.\" Defendant sought \"resentencing consideration.\" The trial court found the motion untimely and declined to consider defendant's motion.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     \u00b6 8 This appeal followed.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     \u00b6 9 II. ANALYSIS\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     \u00b6 10 On appeal, defendant argues that, upon reviewing his motion, the trial court was required by section 115-4.1(e) of the Code ( 725 ILCS 5/115-4.1(e) (West 2016) ) to conduct a hearing to determine whether good cause existed for defendant's failure to appear for his October 5, 2016, sentencing hearing. The State contends the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider what it characterized as an untimely filed motion to reconsider sentence. We address each argument in turn.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     \u00b6 11 Questions of jurisdiction are legal matters we review\n     <em>\n      de novo\n     </em>\n     .\n     <em>\n      People v.

Here, defendant filed a \"Motion for Resentencing Consideration.\" The content of defendant's motion clearly indicated it was a section 115-4.1(e) motion and not an untimely motion to reconsider sentence. In defendant's motion, he stated he \"was not present for sentencing due to the fact [he] was admitted to the hospital\" at the time of his October 2016 sentencing hearing. Defendant sought \"resentencing consideration\" by establishing \"his failure to appear in court was both without his fault and due to circumstances beyond his control.\" 725 ILCS 5/115-4.1(e) (West 2016). Thus, defendant's motion invoked section 115-4.1(e).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     \u00b6 13 We find support for this conclusion in\n     <em>\n      People v.
