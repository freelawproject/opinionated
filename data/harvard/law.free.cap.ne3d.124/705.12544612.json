Relevant to this appeal are three parcels of land in Groton: (1) a thirty-two acre parcel on Worthen Drive (parcel 1); (2) a parcel on Old Ayer Road (parcel 2); and (3) a 5.9 acre parcel with frontage on Worthen Drive and Dale Lane (parcel 3). In July, 2000, Sullivan and Gilson entered into a written agreement whereby Gilson agreed to sell parcel 1 to Sullivan for $ 700,000 paid over four years and, once she obtained \"free and clear title,\" to tender the deed to Sullivan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the subsequent five months, Sullivan paid Gilson $ 300,000, which Gilson used to pay off the mortgage on parcel 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that Gilson obtained \"free and clear title\" to parcel 1 and recorded the release of the mortgage on December 15, 2000. She did not then or ever transfer the deed for parcel 1 to Sullivan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Gilson purchased parcel 2 on September 12, 2008, and purchased parcel 3 on October 28, 2010. Sullivan avers that he provided Gilson with the funds to purchase parcels 2 and 3 in the amounts of $ 160,000 and $ 110,000, respectively, and that Gilson orally promised to convey the deeds to him. The record is silent as to whether Sullivan and Gilson agreed on a date on which Gilson would transfer deeds for parcels 2 and 3 and, if so, what that date was. Gilson did not dispute that Sullivan provided her with money that she used toward purchasing parcels 2 and 3. Instead, Gilson asserted that she did not agree to purchase the land on Sullivan's behalf (and that the funds were a loan). In total, Sullivan avers that he has paid Gilson $ 799,012.22 for the three parcels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Unbeknownst to Sullivan, Gilson sold portions of parcels 1 and 3 to third parties in 2012 and 2016, and conveyed an easement over the remaining portion of parcel 1 in 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sullivan states that he only became aware of these sales shortly after September 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 6, 2017, Sullivan filed an eleven-count complaint, alleging: (counts I to III) breach of contract for each of the three parcels; (count IV) unjust enrichment for each of the three parcels; (counts V-VII) specific performance of contract to convey title to each of the three parcels; (count VIII) constructive trust for a portion of parcel 1, and all of parcels 2 and 3;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (count IX) violation of G. L. c. 93A; (count X) lis pendens relief; and (count XI) injunctive relief against Gilson. Gilson filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that Sullivan's claims were barred by the statute of limitations and the Statute of Frauds. The judge allowed Gilson's motion for summary judgment, finding that all counts were time barred. Sullivan timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review the grant of summary judgment de novo.

Sullivan's claims for breach of contract, specific performance, and resulting trust all sound in contract. An action for breach of contract must be commenced within six years after the cause of action accrues. See G.

It is undisputed that the contractually-agreed upon time for Gilson to transfer title to parcel 1 to Sullivan was December 15, 2000. Therefore, Sullivan's breach of contract cause of action for parcel 1 began to accrue on December 15, 2000, and the statute of limitations expired on December 15, 2006, unless some exception applies. See\n   <em>\n    International Mobiles Corp\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Corroon &amp; Black/Fairfield &amp; Ellis, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002276\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/29/215/#p221\">\n    29 Mass.

Sullivan asserts that the accrual date of his action should be tolled by the discovery rule. Where a cause of action for breach of contract is \"inherently unknowable,\" the discovery rule \"tolls the accrual date of the statutory period until the injured party knows or should know the facts giving rise to the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    International Mobiles Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002276\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/29/215/#p221\">\n    29 Mass.

Some sixteen years had passed between the time Gilson failed to perform and the date on which Sullivan brought suit. Had Sullivan conducted a title search at any point after December 15, 2000, he would have discovered that Gilson had obtained free and clear title on that date. We conclude that Sullivan failed to show, as a matter of law, that he should not have known about Gilson's breach; thus, the statute of limitations was not tolled by the discovery rule.

Sullivan also asserts that Gilson is equitably estopped from relying on the statute of limitations. When asserting equitable estoppel, the plaintiff has the burden to show that the \"statements of the defendant lulled the plaintiff into the false belief that it was not necessary ... to commence action within the statutory period of limitations ... that the plaintiff was induced by these statements to refrain from bringing suit, as otherwise [the plaintiff] would have done, and was thereby harmed, and that the defendant 'knew or had reasonable cause to know that such consequence might follow.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pagliarini\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Iannaco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346345\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/1032/#p1032\">\n    440 Mass. 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1032 (2003), quoting\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rogovin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492635\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/289/549/#p552\">\n    289 Mass. 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552 (1935).

Specifically, Sullivan asserts: \"Prior to September 21, 2016 Sullivan had asked Gilson on various occasions about deeding him [parcel 1]. Each time Gilson promised Sullivan that she would do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sullivan's vague assertions are simply insufficient as a matter of law for this doctrine to apply. As an initial matter, Sullivan failed to allege that he even asked Gilson to convey parcel 1 within the six-year statute of limitations. Moreover, Sullivan has failed to allege why it would have been reasonable for him to rely on such promises, where the failure to perform lasted for sixteen years. Summary judgment properly entered as to all claims related to parcel 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Parcels 2 and 3\n   </em>\n   . Sullivan alleges the existence of oral contracts for the conveyances of parcels 2 and 3. We conclude that these contract claims are barred by the Statute of Frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Statute of Frauds\n   </em>\n   . The Statute of Frauds generally requires that all contracts for the sale of land be in writing. G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 1. See\n   <em>\n    Bibi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Courville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"296169,295931\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/357/782/\">\n    357 Mass. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970). However, \"[a] plaintiff's detrimental reliance on, or part performance of, an oral agreement to convey property may estop the defendant from pleading the Statute of Frauds as a defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Nessralla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Peck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880133\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/403/757/#p761\">\n    403 Mass. 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (1989).

Part performance may be demonstrated by evidence that the party physically occupied and made improvements to the property in reliance upon the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Snell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3965892\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/12/323/#p325\">\n    12 Mass. App. Ct. 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325 (1981). Sullivan did not allege that he attempted to improve these parcels, nor does Sullivan assert on appeal that he occupied either parcel. Accordingly, there was no part performance and the claims are barred by the Statute of Frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Resulting trust\n   </em>\n   . Next, Sullivan argues that he is entitled to resulting trusts with regard to parcels 2 and 3.

Even if we were to assume that Gilson was obliged to perform immediately upon her receipt of the deeds to parcels 2 and 3, there is nothing in the record that rises to the level of an \"open and notorious\" repudiation, see\n   <em>\n    Stuck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"494046\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/290/159/#p163\">\n    290 Mass. at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as a matter of law, particularly where Sullivan asserts that Gilson repeatedly assured him that she would transfer the land. On the summary judgment record, Gilson clearly repudiated any resulting trust for parcel 3 when she first sold it in 2012 and Sullivan alleges that he was not aware of any sale until 2016.

The judgment is reversed as to so much of count VIII as pleads a claim of resulting trust with respect to parcels 2 and 3. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   reversed in part; affirmed in part\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Pursuant to this same agreement, Gilson gave Sullivan a first option on a 2.55-acre parcel of land located near Worthen Drive for $ 200,000.

On September 27, 2016, Gilson conveyed the easement to Edward and Karen Juskalian for $ 1.00.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    In his opposition to Gilson's motion for summary judgment, Sullivan asserted a claim for a resulting trust. Because Sullivan raised this issue in the trial court, albeit not until summary judgment, we do not consider it waived, and treat count VIII of the complaint as pleading in the alternative a resulting trust in the three parcels. Contrast\n    <em>\n     Carey\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New England Organ Bank\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784012\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/270/#p285\">\n     446 Mass. 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 285 (2006) (where \"plaintiffs never put the judge on notice that they opposed summary judgment on [that] theory,\" issue was waived).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    On appeal, Sullivan raises no argument regarding his claims for constructive trust for parcel 1, unjust enrichment, lis pendens relief, or injunctive relief; thus, we deem those issues waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (9) (A), as appearing in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=481%20Mass.%201628\">\n     481 Mass. 1628\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2019). In addition, in his opposition to Gilson's motion for summary judgment, Sullivan argued a new claim under the theory of promissory estoppel. Sullivan does not raise an adequate argument under a theory of promissory estoppel on appeal; thus, we consider the argument waived. Finally, Sullivan's lone statement on appeal regarding his claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 11, is unsupported by authority or factual analysis and does not rise to the level of reasoned appellate argument; thus, it is also waived. See rule 16 (a) (9) (A) (\"The argument shall contain ... citations to the authorities and parts of the record [relied on]\");\n    <em>\n     K.A\n    </em>\n    . v.\n    <em>\n     T.R\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239340\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/554/#p567\">\n     86 Mass. App. Ct. 554\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 567 (2014) (court will not consider claims that do not \"rise to the level of reasoned appellate argument as contemplated by [the rule]\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The written contract for parcel 1 provided that Sullivan was to pay the balance owed by 2004. Notwithstanding that fact, Sullivan asserts that he continued to make payments on all three parcels until March 31, 2015. While Gilson disputes this fact, we accept it as true for the purposes of summary judgment. To the extent that Sullivan alleges that he made a payment toward the purchase price of parcel 1 in 2015, he has not made sufficient appellate argument to support a claim for the return of those moneys on a theory of unjust enrichment.
