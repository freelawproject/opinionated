Cramer and Carrie A. Chaplin (\"appellants\"), appeal from the March 22, 2018 judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, approving attorney fees for the work of plaintiff-appellee, Thomas Taneff (\"appellee\"), as successor ancillary administrator in a R.C. Chapter 2129 land sale action and imposing attorney fees and costs as sanctions for Ms. Cramer's willful violations of Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Selena Cramer (\"decedent\") died on September 28, 2007. She had four adult children: Marilyn Cramer, Carrie Chaplin, Myron Cramer, and Callie Lipka. The full estate of the decedent is being administered by Ms. Lipka in Limestone County, Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 30, 2014, an ancillary administration for the estate (Franklin P.C. No. 567794) was opened in Ohio pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2129 for the sole purpose of disposing of a single piece of Franklin County real property (\"the property\"), a residence owned by the decedent, for the benefit of the estate. Ms. Cramer, an attorney licensed to practice in Ohio, was named administrator of the ancillary estate in November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Infighting among the siblings caused a number of motions to be generated thereafter, including a motion filed by Ms. Lipka and Mr. Cramer to remove Ms. Cramer as the ancillary administrator. On July 17, 2015, a magistrate's decision removed Ms. Cramer as ancillary administrator. The magistrate's decision found that at a June 2015 hearing on the motions, all the siblings agreed to sell the property rather than transfer it to an heir and jointly moved the court to allow the property to be sold. Despite the agreement to sell the property, the magistrate noted the lack of any progress on administration of the ancillary estate and determined the estate had an interest in having an independent successor administrator who would not be distracted by \"rehashing issues of the underlying estate, which are not before this court.\" (July 17, 2015 Mag.'s Decision at 6.) Appellants filed objections to the magistrate's decision. The probate court judge overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate's decision to remove Ms. Cramer on December 23, 2015. Appellants did not appeal the December 23, 2015 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellee was appointed as an independent successor ancillary administrator on January 14, 2016 and commenced the statutory process to sell the property. On January 19, 2016, appellee filed a complaint to sell real estate pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2127 and served the appropriate parties. The land sale action was assigned Franklin P.C. No. 567794A. Ms. Lipka and Mr. Cramer both filed entries of appearance and their consent to the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellants filed nearly identical answers; Ms. Cramer's answer was untimely. The answers contended \"[t]hough the heirs would like to sell the property, it\n   is not true that a sale is 'necessary to pay debts' \" and asked the court to dismiss the land sale complaint entirely, deny any sale, \"[d]eny [appellee]'s request for permission to breach the existing contract\" Ms. Cramer negotiated with another broker, reinstate Ms. Cramer as administrator, or, in the alternative, replace him with a \"more knowledgeable and qualified administrator.\" (Feb. 23, 2016 Appellants' Answers at 2, 4.) After appellee filed a motion to strike Ms. Cramer's answer and for default judgment, Ms. Cramer filed an opposition to the motion citing the probate court clerk's \"suspicious and troubling\" handling of her answer, which, \"whether deliberate or through incompetence,\" caused her answer to be untimely filed. (Mar. 14, 2016 Ms. Cramer's Memo. in Opp. at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On April 28, 2016, a magistrate order deemed Ms. Cramer's answer timely in the interest of justice and denied appellee's motion for default judgment. The magistrate's decision warned Ms. Cramer against \"repeated unsupported allegations of court misconduct,\" reminded Ms. Cramer appellee is now the ancillary administrator and no party may interfere with his duties and responsibilities, and \"continued interference with the orderly administration of [the land sale] action may result in sanctions.\" (Apr. 28, 2016 Mag.'s Order at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellee filed a motion to find sale necessary and order for new appraisement on May 13, 2016, and moved the court to approve an appraiser. On June 10, 2016, hours prior to a hearing on appellee's motion to move forward with the land sale process, appellants filed an emergency motion of heirs to remove ancillary administrator appellee for negligence and misconduct and to prevent further damage to the estate property by him. In addition to allegations of negligence and misconduct and calling for the court to revoke appellee's appointment, the motion alleged appellee hired a real estate agent without authority to do so and who was a \"hired thug\" and \"goon.\" (June 10, 2016 Mot. &amp; Memo. at 3, 6.) The motion states twice that Ms. Cramer secured the front door to the property with her own locks, and Ms. Cramer took issue with the broker removing the locks she installed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 13, 2016, the magistrate issued two orders which collectively denied appellants' emergency motion as being without merit, found the land sale necessary, and ordered a new appraisement on the property. The magistrate's order stated that while Ms. Cramer objected to finding the sale necessary at the hearing because she believed there may be other means of disposing of the property, appellants did not object to the property being sold and would not affirmatively state that the property should be transferred to an heir. That day, the probate court signed a journal entry finding the sale necessary and ordering new appraisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On June 29, 2016, appellants filed a document entitled objections by heirs to the magistrate's decision and motion to supplement after receipt and review of the transcript of the June 10, 2016 hearing. On August 31, 2016, the probate court entered a judgment entry construing the document as a motion to set aside the magistrate's order, deeming it timely in the interest of justice, and denying the motion. In doing so, the probate court noted appellants continued to make previous arguments that appellee should be removed as administrator without credible evidence to suggest he neglected his duty or engaged in any conduct warranting his removal, that \"[f]amily disharmony has delayed this ancillary administration,\" and that further actions delaying and complicating the sale by filing unnecessary motions and pleadings could result in sanctions. (Aug. 31, 2016 Jgmt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Entry at 5.) Appellants did not appeal the August 31, 2016 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In September 2016, appellee filed a return of order of appraiser for the amount of $ 30,000 and, later, an order of private sale and real estate purchase contract stating a price of $ 32,000 along with a motion to confirm sale and order deed and distribution. The hearing on the motion to confirm sale was conducted on November 9, 2016, and a magistrate's order confirming sale was filed with the court on November 23, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Ms. Cramer filed a motion on behalf of herself and Ms. Chaplin asking for a stay of the magistrate's decision pending resolution of possible future objections and appeals. Appellee filed a response contending further delay is not in the best interest of the estate and stating Ms. Cramer had defamed the property by filing a notice of lis pendens with the Franklin County Recorder and contacting the title company to inform them \"the heirs\" did not consent to the sale or to appointment of appellee as administrator and \"title to the property will be tied up in litigation for quite some time.\" (Ex. C, attached to Nov. 29, 2016 Appellee's Resp. to Mot. to Stay.) A judgment entry denying Ms. Cramer's motion to stay was filed on November 30, 2016, and appellants thereafter both filed objections to the magistrate's November 23, 2016 order confirming sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In December 2016, appellee filed a motion for supplemental cost reimbursement in order to cover an additional year of property insurance. At this time, he additionally filed a complaint to declare Ms. Cramer a vexatious litigator, for abuse of process, for tortious interference with contract, and for defamation of title against Ms. Cramer, which was assigned Franklin P.C. No. 567794B. Furthermore, on January 6, 2017, appellee filed a motion for sanctions against appellants and/or Ms. Chaplin's attorney pursuant to Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51. Appellants filed a memorandum contra appellee's motion for sanctions and cross-motion for sanctions against appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On February 10, 2017, the ancillary estate and land sale action (Franklin P.C. Nos. 56774 and 56774A) were transferred to the docket of a visiting judge. The attorney representing Ms. Chaplin filed a motion to withdraw as her attorney, which the probate court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On March 30, 2017, the probate court overruled the objections of appellants and adopted the November 23, 2017 magistrate's decision confirming the sale. The probate court additionally granted appellee's December motion for supplemental cost reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In early May 2017, appellee filed a status letter and emergency motion for a status conference stating the property had been broken into and damaged extensively, resulting in the buyer being no longer interested in purchasing the home at the agreed on price. After renewing information presented at the status conference, the magistrate ordered appellee to file a renewed motion to confirm sale and order deed and distribution and ordered any competing bids to purchase the property, specifically including the alleged \"$ 101,000+\" offer repeatedly referenced by Ms. Cramer, to be submitted to appellee by May 26, 2017 or those bids would be forfeited. (May 22, 2017 Mag.'s Order at 2.) The order stated that any objections must comply with Civ.R. 53(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On May 22, 2017, appellee filed a motion to vacate the entry confirming the first sale and separately moved to confirm a second sale secured in the amount of $ 39,000 and order deed and distribution. Appellants did not submit any competing\n   offers but, instead, filed a motion to strike appellee's motion to confirm sale due to appellee's alleged failure to follow the briefing schedule and violations of professional conduct and court rules and filed an opposition to appellee's motion, which opposed the \"suspicious\" pending sale of the property and allegedly excessive and unreasonable fees. (May 30, 2017 Appellants' Opp. to Mot. to Confirm Sale at 1.) Appellee filed a second motion for additional fees and costs on April 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On June 7, 2017, the magistrate granted appellee's motion to vacate, confirmed the new sale, and ordered deed and distribution of the proceeds of the sale. The magistrate noted a sale had been returned above the appraisal price, and no party submitted alternative bids by the deadline stated in the magistrate's prior order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On June 19, 2017, appellants filed a motion to stay the magistrate's order confirming sale pending possible future objections or appeal. The memorandum in support of the motion notes the stay would avoid an escalation in litigation, and without a stay, \"any potential buyer will be embroiled in litigation of the title.\" (June 19, 2017 Appellants' Memo. in Support of Mot. at 2-3.) After the time for filing objections had expired, on June 22, 2017, appellants then filed a 21-page document objecting to the June 7, 2017 magistrate's order confirming sale of the property. Attached to the objections, appellants provided the affidavit of a friend who stated he is interested in buying the property but was denied a fair opportunity to do so and an affidavit of the realtor Ms. Cramer had worked with when she was administrator who estimated the value of the house to be between $ 85,000 and $ 100,000 prior to improvements. In the interest of justice, the probate court considered the objection in its entirety and overruled it on July 24, 2017; in the same order, the probate court denied appellants' motion to stay the magistrate's June 7, 2017 order. Appellants did not appeal the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellee received a letter dated October 25, 2017 from Ms. Cramer, admitted into evidence, that provides \"[s]hould the [probate] court again ignore the law and issue a political and obviously retaliatory order, the [court of appeals] will certainly reverse it and the corruption will be exposed. * * * We are prepared to litigate wherever and however long it will take to accomplish our mother's wishes and rectify the wrongs and unlawful conduct perpetrated by [Mr.] Cramer, [Ms.] Lipka, and the dishonest attorneys they retained.\" (Ex. A at 1, attached to Jan. 6, 2017 Appellee's Mot. for Sanctions.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The hearing on the merits of the motion for sanctions was held on October 27, 2017. On December 19, 2017, the probate court visiting judge issued a decision finding Ms. Cramer willfully violated both Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51 and that sanctions in the form of reasonable attorney fees and costs, to be quantified at a later date, would be assessed against Ms. Cramer. The entry denied all other pleadings, motions, and cross-claims related to sanctions not specifically addressed in the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The decision noted Ms. Cramer's \"bad conduct and frivolous filings turned what should have been a simple land sale into a circus devoid of any respect to the court and its officers\" and that she \"failed to grasp the reality that when she was removed as ancillary administrator, she lost the ability to dictate the terms of sale.\" (Dec. 19, 2017 Jgmt. Entry at 21.) Specifically, regarding Civ.R. 11, the probate court found Ms. Cramer \"willfully violated Civ.R. 11 when she drafted, read, and signed numerous baseless pleadings and other documents, which lacked\n   grounds to support the allegations made, and which were filed for purpose of delay.\" (Dec. 19, 2017 Jgmt. Entry at 31.) The decision discusses five such filings in detail and cites generally the delay she caused by her repetitive pleadings which had no basis under the law, her continued reference to the \"unsubstantiated mystery offer\" that she insisted would occur following a future remodel of the property, and her raising irrelevant issues surrounding sibling infighting in the underlying full estate in Alabama. (Dec. 19, 2017 Jgmt. Entry at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Regarding R.C. 2323.51, the probate court found Ms. Cramer \"willfully violated R.C. 2323.51 when she conducted herself in a manner meant to harass and intimidate [appellee].\" (Dec. 19, 2017 Jgmt. Entry at 31.) The court found her actions were \"not warranted under existing law, and could not be supported by good faith arguments\" but consisted instead of \"supposition and innuendo that have no evidentiary support.\" (Dec. 19, 2017 Jgmt. Entry at 31.) Such actions, according to the probate court, were improper, caused unnecessary delay, and needlessly increased the cost of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Specifically, the decision first found Ms. Cramer's actions when she was still administrator contributed to delay in administering the ancillary matter. Ms. Cramer failed to open a land sale but instead filed a number of motions which did nothing to move the administration of the ancillary estate forward and instead were related to infighting over the full estate. Furthermore, after she was removed as administrator, Ms. Cramer admitted under oath to hiring a person to physically remove appellee's locks on the property with a crow bar and then acted without authority in placing her own locks on the doors. The judgment notes Ms. Cramer continued to keep appointments related to the property as if she were still administrator. The judgment cites two letters in which Ms. Cramer threatens use of the legal process to indefinitely stall the sale of the property. In the letter to the title agency, the probate court found Ms. Cramer also fabricated her representation of all the heirs and misrepresented appellee as a fraud when he was properly appointed. The probate court additionally discusses an instance in which Ms. Cramer arrived 45 minutes late to a hearing without advance notice or explanation and significantly disrupted the meeting and was disrespectful and cites to Ms. Cramer's filings and testimony during the October 27, 2017 hearing on sanctions. There, according to the probate court, Ms. Cramer reiterated issues already disposed of and continued to make unprofessional and baseless allegations against the probate court judge formerly on the case, appellee, and appellee's personal relationship with his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} On February 15, 2018, one day before the scheduled hearing on fees and costs, Ms. Cramer filed a motion to postpone hearing and proceedings pending ruling on jurisdiction. The motion referred to an affidavit of disqualification Ms. Cramer attempted to file with the Supreme Court of Ohio to disqualify Judges Montgomery and Spicer from the case. At the February 16, 2018 hearing to consider fees and costs, the probate court denied Ms. Cramer's motion to stay because the Supreme Court rejected her affidavit due to noncompliance with timing requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On March 22, 2018, the probate court filed a judgment entry addressing appellee's motions for supplemental fees and cost and his brief for supplemental fees and costs attributable to Ms. Cramer's violations of Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51. The probate court noted \"[i]n this case, the sale was approved and confirmed,\" and, therefore, under R.C 2127.38, the court must determine what fees and costs are due to appellee as ancillary administrator. (Mar. 22, 2018 Jgmt. Entry at 6.) The probate court found the work conducted by appellee and his staff completed \"was largely reasonable and necessary to complete the land sale.\" (Mar. 22, 2018 Jgmt. Entry at 9.) After the probate court removed instances of \"double billing\" totaling $ 6,211.88 from the submitted fees, the probate court approved $ 61,221.18 in fees and $ 7,237.92 in costs, for a total of $ 68,459.10. (Mar. 22, 2018 Jgmt. Entry at 9.) The probate court then found $ 21,631.70 in fees and $ 624.95 for costs, for a total of $ 22,256.65 to be directly attributable to Ms. Cramer's sanctioned conduct. The probate court ordered, per the previous agreement of the parties, any remaining net proceeds of the land sale to be forwarded to the underlying estate in Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellants filed a timely appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1.) The probate court erred by removing Attorney Marilyn Cramer, an Ohio heir and attorney, as ancillary administrator of her mother's estate, (a house in Columbus, Ohio, when there were no legal or factual grounds to replace her. Rather the judge acted after ex parte meetings and did so to appoint Thomas Taneff, with whom the judge is connected financially and politically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2.) The probate court, acting through its magistrate Kelly Green, erred by denying the heirs an evidentiary hearing and the right to cross-examine their adversary's witnesses, before arbitrarily depriving Attorney Cramer of her statutory priority for appointment, under O.R.C. \u00a7 2113.06(A)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (3.) The probate court erred by appointing Thomas Taneff as successor Ancillary Administrator, all the while concealing the financial and political connections between Taneff and the probate judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (4.) The probate court erred by denying the heirs' motion to remove Taneff for negligence and misconduct resulting in damage to the estate property and multiple violation notices emanating from the City of Columbus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (5.) The probate court erred by permitting Taneff to delay the administration by interfering with and breaching the contract the heirs had with their Columbus realtor and their sale of the house to an interested purchaser for $ 101,000, as well as Taneff's and the Court's preventing the heirs from selling the house to a second buyer or purchasing it themselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (6.) The probate court erred by confirming the sale of the real property to Taneff's straw purchaser for $ 32,000, (roughly one third of the $ 101,000 price the heirs had negotiated with their buyer and realtor.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (7.) The probate court erred by finding that the unsupported, excessive and unreasonable\n   fees and expenses Taneff requested, in excess of $ 76,421, (200% of Taneff's sales price for the property,) were \"appropriate and necessary.\" The Court erred by blindly accepting Taneff's bills, despite his failure to present any expert testimony, affidavits, or any other evidence in support of his invoices, under the lodestar or any other standard, to prove the reasonableness of his hourly rates, the reasonableness of the hours claimed, the necessity of the work performed, and the other burdens he bears under Loc.R. 71.7 and all of the case law. (Taneff double and triple billed for work, billed for motions he lost, billed all hours as attorney time, rather than at the lesser rate of a fiduciary, billed for multiple persons when one was sufficient, and billed his secretary at $ 135 an hour, without justifying this exorbitant rate for a secretary when even certified paralegals in the Columbus, Ohio area average $ 17.56 an hour, and even though he failed to register his secretary as the Local Rules require, among other improprieties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (8.) The probate court erred by approving Taneffs fees charging the estate for multiple, substantive ex parte contacts with the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (9.) The probate court erred by alleging that the heirs, by and through their attorneys, Marilyn Cramer and Gregg Garfinkel, willfully filed \"numerous motions\" with intent to harass and maliciously injure Taneff and delay the administration of the estate, when the record refutes the finding, in that neither Attorney Garfinkel nor Attorney Cramer filed \"numerous motions and filings.\" December 19, 2017 Entry. The Court erred by imposing sanctions of $ 22,265.665 on Attorney Cramer, when, other than two scheduling requests and responses to Taneff's motions, she filed only one motion and two objections during the more than two and a half years of Taneff's appointment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (10.) The probate court erred by disregarding the nature and substance of the Heirs' filings, as well as the limited number of their filings, and by ignoring the fact that the heirs were represented by two experienced attorneys: Gregg Garfinkel and Marilyn Cramer, (Attorney Cramer with 40 years' experience, including almost 30 years with the U.S. Department of Justice as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and a Senior Trial Attorney with the Antitrust Division, and prior years as an Ohio Assistant Attorney General,) and Attorney Garfinkel, with approximately fourteen years' experience as a trial attorney, including years as a Special Counsel to the Attorney General,) when the court criticized Attorney Garfinkel and imposed excessive monetary sanctions against Attorney Cramer. They each testified that, not only did they have valid and strong legal and factual grounds for each and every one of their filings, they also would have prevailed, if before a fair and neutral adjudicator, rather than in a forum tainted with financial and political bias.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (11.) The probate court erred by holding in abeyance and failing to dismiss, with prejudice, Taneff's frivolous spin-off Case No. 567794B, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and lack of personal jurisdiction over heir and attorney for the heirs Marilyn A. Cramer. The Complaint relies upon O.R.C. \u00a7 2323.51, which expressly does not apply to Attorney Cramer, who represents her client, Heir Ms. Carrie Chaplin, and Taneff failed to file the Complaint in the proper court of common pleas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (12.) The probate court erred by approving nearly all of Taneff's alleged\n   fees and costs of over $ 24,235.95, just in connection with his frivolous lawsuit against the heirs' attorney, contrary to the best interests of the estate, (when added to fees Taneff sought for the underlying probate, he requested fees and costs of over $ 76,421.48,) unlawfully rewarding his misconduct and breaches of his fiduciary duties to the estate, by filing a deliberately frivolous and harassing lawsuit against an heir and attorney for the heirs, in the probate court where he benefits from financial and political connections, all in a retaliatory attempt to prevent the heirs from asserting the heirs' constitutional and statutory rights to estate property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Emphasis omitted.) (Sic passim.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} As a preliminary issue, although appellants set forth 12 assignments of error for us to review, they have not separately argued each of those assignments of error in the body of the brief.

Assignments of Error One, Two, Three, and Four\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Assignments of error one through four concern the ancillary administrator. Specifically, appellants' first and second assignments of error contend the probate court erred by removing Ms. Cramer as ancillary administrator of her mother's estate and by doing so after \"denying [appellants] an evidentiary hearing and the right to cross-examine their adversary's witnesses.\" (Appellants' Brief at xi.)

Appellants contend the relationship of the court with appellee resulted in \"biased rulings,\" whereby the probate court ignored appellee's negligence and misconduct, and the probate court insulted appellants and made \"veiled threats to discourage and intimidate them from asserting their rights concerning their mother's estate.\" (Appellants' Brief at 27.) Appellants further allege appellee and the probate court judge and magistrate engaged in improper ex parte communications. Appellants believe their federal and state constitutional rights to due process were violated, and they were deprived of a \"[n]eutral and [u]nbiased [a]djudicator.\" (Appellants' Brief at 21.)

App.R. 3(D) and 4(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Here, appellants' first four assignments of error are based on asserted errors in Ms. Cramer's removal, appellee's appointment, and the subsequent failure of the probate court to remove appellee. The order removing Ms. Cramer as ancillary administrator of her mother's estate was filed December 23, 2015, and the decision denying appellee's removal as the administrator was filed August 31, 2016. Appellants never filed an appeal from either of those orders. Rather, the instant notice of appeal designates the March 22, 2018 judgment entry regarding sanctions and attorney fees as the judgment appealed. Therefore, to the extent appellants attempt to appeal the merits of the probate court's determination on these issues, we lack jurisdiction to determine these matters in the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 36} We additionally find appellants' reference to the judgment entry appealed from in the present case being \"[v]oid [a]b [i]nitio\" does not demonstrate error to support reversal.

Furthermore, to the extent appellants' brief on the first four assignments of error addresses the final, appealable order on which the present appeal is based, appellants have not met their burden of demonstrating error on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Accordingly, we overrule appellants' first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fifth and Sixth Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellants' fifth and sixth assignments of error essentially challenge the trial court's confirmation of sale. In their fifth assignment of error, appellants assert the probate court erred by \"permitting [appellee] to delay the administration by interfering with and breaching the contract the heirs had with their Columbus realtor and their sale of the house to an interested purchaser for $ 101,000, as well as [appellee's] and the Court's preventing the heirs from selling the house to a second buyer or purchasing it themselves.\" (Appellants' Brief at xii.) In their sixth assignment of error, appellants assert the probate court erred by confirming the sale of the real property to \"[appellee's] straw purchaser for $ 32,000, (roughly one third of the $ 101,000 price the heirs had negotiated with their buyer and realtor.).\" (Appellants' Brief at xii.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Specifically,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   appellants argue Ohio law affords priority to the heirs of an estate to purchase the estate's real property, and appellee and the probate court obstructed appellants from either purchasing the home themselves or from selling the house to two buyers they located who were willing to pay more than triple the price of appellee's selling price. Appellants believe appellee should not have used the realtor he picked to sell the property and that doing so breached their agreement with another realtor. According to appellants, appellee should have used the county appraisal valuation used by Ms. Cramer when she was administrator instead of obtaining an appraisal, which she believes diminished the estate. Appellants challenge the appraiser's value and further asserts appellee's realtor lacked local experience, failed to effectively market the\n   property, and admitted that his \"first proposed sale\" was to a \"straw purchaser,\" which is contrary to Ohio law. (Appellants' Brief at 34.) Appellants take issue with appellee prohibiting appellants, their realtor, and their buyers from entering and inspecting the house, particularly to assess damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Appellee counters, prior to appellee being appointed, appellants clearly agreed they wanted the property to be sold, and, therefore, their current claim of being deprived of the right to their property is frivolous. Furthermore, appellee points out that after he was appointed, Ms. Cramer never requested permission from the probate court to list the property for sale and lacked authority to enter into a contract with a real estate broker; therefore, according to appellee, the estate could not be bound by the alleged contract referenced by appellants. Appellee notes the appraiser's testimony, particularly in regard to the high crime neighborhood and repairs needed to the property, supported his valuation. Appellee additionally noted Ms. Cramer admitted, given the current state of the property, a value of $ 30,000 was fair, and appellants did not present another appraisal showing the value should be higher. Appellee contends the estate had no funds to pay for repairs and taking the time to repair the property would delay administration of the estate. Appellee points out he requested information from Ms. Cramer regarding the potential $ 101,000 buyer, the probate court instructed Ms. Cramer \"many times\" to present all information regarding potential buyers to appellee, and appellants never presented the alleged offers. (Appellee's Brief at 36.) Appellee further argues the initial sale, which appellants contend was to a \"straw purchaser,\" is no longer relevant as that sale was not completed, and, regardless, the sale complied with all laws.

We further note the errors alleged by appellants run contrary to the record of the case: appellants admitted they wanted to sell the property, appellants did not appeal the probate court's denial of their motion to remove appellee, and appellants did not provide the probate court with information regarding the alleged offers they secured to buy the property for more money.
