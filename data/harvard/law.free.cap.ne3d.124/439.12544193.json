Jones had been observed shoplifting men's clothing from a Burlington Coat Factory store. He was apprehended minutes after leaving the store with merchandise that he had not paid for. Because the trial court's error in permitting the state to exercise a peremptory challenge out of sequence was not a structural error, mandating automatic reversal, Jones was required to demonstrate prejudice flowing from that error. We conclude that he was not prejudiced, and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Shoplifting Men's Clothing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 29, 2016, Steve Seiter, a loss prevention associate with over 16 years of experience, observed Jones enter a Burlington Coat Factory store with another person. Seiter followed Jones and his companion, later identified as Ricardo Scott, on the store's numerous surveillance cameras for 15 to 20 minutes. Jones and Scott went to the men's clothing department. While Jones perused the merchandise, Seiter noticed that he \"continued to watch the people around him to see if they\n   were possibly paying attention to what he was doing.\" Based upon his experience, Seiter concluded that Jones was preparing to steal store merchandise. Jones then selected a number of items of clothing, including a pair of black shorts and a red shirt. As Scott left the store, Seiter observed Jones enter the fitting rooms with the clothing. Jones remained in the fitting room for five minutes. When he left the fitting rooms, Jones put some items back on a rack and then headed for the store's exit at a fast pace. He did not stop to pay for any merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Seiter then checked to see if Jones had replaced all the items of clothing, but he could not locate the black shorts and red shirt. Seiter alerted the Springdale Police Department of the suspected theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Based on Seiter's description of the vehicle that Jones and Scott departed in, Springdale Police Officer Joseph Robers stopped their vehicle within minutes at a gas station located a quarter of a mile from the store. Officer Robers ordered Jones and Scott from the vehicle. Officer Robers found that both Jones and Scott had merchandise from the Burlington Coat Factory stuffed inside their pants. Additional store merchandise was found in the vehicle, including the black shorts and red shirt that Jones had taken into the fitting room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Seiter arrived at the gas station and identified Jones and Scott as the two persons that he had watched at the store. He identified the merchandise as belonging to Burlington Coat Factory, including the black shorts and red shirt, each of which still had sales tags attached. Neither item had been paid for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Jones was charged by complaint with the theft of \"various clothing items and a watch\" from Burlington Coat Factory, in violation of R.C. 2913.02. Jones exercised his right to a jury trial. During the selection of the jury, and over Jones' objection, the trial court permitted the state to exercise its third and final peremptory challenge \"out of sequence,\" after the state had waived that challenge, and after the selection of alternate jurors was already under way. Jones also filed a motion for a mistrial on the basis of the flawed jury selection. After offering an explanation for its actions, the trial court denied the motion and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At trial, Seiter and Officer Robers testified on behalf of the state. Jones testified in his own defense and stated that he had paid Scott to drive him to a mall but that Scott had insisted that the two stop at the Burlington Coat Factory first. He claimed to have accompanied Scott into the store, looked at clothing for about five minutes, and then left the store to wait for Scott. Jones stated that Scott had pulled stolen clothing items out of his pants once he returned to the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Jones testified that when the two were stopped by Officer Robers, there \"[w]asn't anything found on me. Everything was found in the car. I'm not even denying that it was stolen items in the car. Yes, because my dude did go in there and steal. * * * [T]here was items found in the car. * * * I'm not going to deny that fact at all.\" Jones also admitted into evidence a video recording of some of the events that Seiter had captured on the day of the theft. Seiter had admitted at trial that he had failed to record most of the events that he described at trial. The admitted video recording showed Jones and Scott's long stay in the men's clothing department but did not show Jones taking any merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At the conclusion of the trial, the state requested a complicity instruction, under R.C. 2923.03, alleging that Jones had acted not only as a principal but also\n   as an aider and abettor in the theft offense charged in the complaint. The trial court gave the instruction over Jones' objection. The jury returned a not-guilty verdict on the theft offense, but it found Jones guilty of complicity to theft. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict and imposed a jail sentence of 180 days, with 177 days suspended. It also imposed a $200 fine, court costs, and a six-month period of community control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Jones appealed raising three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Peremptory-Challenge Issue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} For clarity, we will address Jones' assignments of error in temporal order. In his third assignment of error, Jones asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the state to use its third peremptory challenge \"out of sequence,\" after it had previously waived the challenge. He further argues that he was not required to demonstrate actual prejudice flowing from that error to overturn his conviction. He urges us to follow the automatic-reversal rule enunciated by the Tenth Appellate District in 1998, when it held that \"as a matter of law, [a] defendant [is] not required to make a showing of actual prejudice where the state is granted an 'extra' peremptory challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state argues that we apply our own precedent holding that when a trial court errs in extending additional peremptory challenges to the state, \"such error should not be deemed of such prejudicial character as to require a reversal of the judgment,\" absent a showing of prejudice flowing from that error.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bohannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1363949\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app/64/431/#p439\">\n    64 Ohio App. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20N.E.2d%201010\">\n    28 N.E.2d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Dist.1940).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} While permitting the state to exercise a peremptory challenge out of sequence was error, it was not one of the very limited class of trial errors which are not reviewable for harmless error under Crim.R. 52(A), and which mandate automatic reversal. Thus, to prevail, Jones must demonstrate actual prejudice flowing from that error. But he cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Two-step review for error and prejudice under Crim.R. 52(A)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Crim.R. 52(A) governs this criminal appeal of a nonforfeited error, and provides that \"[a]ny error * * * which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\" A reviewing court must first determine whether there was an error-a deviation from a legal rule. Second, the reviewing court must analyze the trial court record to determine whether the error \"affect[ed] substantial rights\" of the defendant, that is, whether the error was prejudicial and affected the outcome of the trial court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But there is \"a very limited class\" of errors which are not reviewable for harmless error under Crim.R. 52(A). These errors, now described as \"structural errors,\" mandate a finding of per se prejudice, and automatic reversal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Exercising peremptory challenges\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The first step in our analysis requires us to identify the legal rules governing the use of peremptory challenges in the trial court. In a criminal proceeding, the use of peremptory challenges allows both the prosecution and the defense to secure a more fair and impartial jury by enabling them to remove jurors whom they perceive as biased, even if the jurors are not subject to a challenge for cause. \"The right of peremptory challenge is not, of itself, a right to select, but a right to reject, jurors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In this misdemeanor trial, Jones and the state were each entitled to three peremptory challenges, plus one additional challenge to be used only against an alternate juror.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 24(D) and (G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Generally, after the number of jurors required at trial has been seated, the parties begin exercising their peremptory challenges. Under Crim.R. 24(E), the state begins the peremptory-challenge process, and then the parties alternate exercising their remaining challenges.

Prospective juror Charron was examined by the parties. The trial court then addressed the state.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: [W]ould you like to exercise the county's third and final peremptory challenge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ASSISTANT PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: No, I would not, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: So you're satisfied?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ASSISTANT PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: [Defense counsel], would you like to exercise the defense's third and final peremptory?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: We would, Judge. At this time we would like to thank and excuse * * * Mr. Charron.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Thus the state waived its final challenge and Jones exercised his final challenge on prospective juror Charron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Next, prospective juror White was questioned at length by the state and by the trial court. White had initially expressed concerns regarding police-involved shootings in other parts of the nation. Under questioning, he ultimately stated that he could set those issues aside, would listen to the evidence introduced in this case, would keep an open mind until a verdict was reached, and would remain fair and impartial to the defendant and to the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The assistant prosecuting attorney then stated that he had no further questions for White, and passed the prospective juror for cause. He made no other comment and did not attempt to exercise a peremptory challenge. The trial court addressed Jones' trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: Do you want to inquire of Mr. White?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, after hearing the prosecution's questions and the Judge's follow-up questions, I have no further questions.

Come on up, sir, please.\" The state questioned prospective alternate juror Roland. At the conclusion of the questioning, the court addressed the state.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: All right.

An off-the-record, sidebar conference was held. The trial court then went on the record, but out of hearing of the jury, explaining that the state now wished to exercise a peremptory challenge against prospective juror White. The court noted that it had reviewed some\n   unidentified portion of the trial transcript, and that it would \"correct the record.\" Over Jones' objection, the court then informed the jury that \"I did not give the prosecution their third and final peremptory challenge as to [prospective juror] White,\" and excused the prospective juror. We note that juror Roland replaced White, remained on the jury, and signed the verdict forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Both in ruling on the state's request and in ruling on Jones' subsequent motion for mistrial, it is clear from the transcript of the proceedings that trial court and the parties had focused their inquiry entirely on whether the state could use \"its third and final\" peremptory challenge against prospective juror White. No mention was made of the state's waiver of its challenge as to prospective juror Charron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 34} When the court denied Jones' motion for mistrial, the trial court explained that it had permitted the state to exercise its peremptory challenge of White \"out of sequence\" in an attempt to correct its perceived failure to \"offer\" the state its \"final\" challenge. Jones argued to the court that the state had waived its final challenge to regular members of the jury when it remained silent and permitted \"Mr. White\" to be seated. The court responded, \"How did [the state] implicitly fail to exercise [its challenge]? I didn't offer it to them.\" This statement was true enough but ignored that fact that the court had previously made that precise invitation as to prospective juror Charron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 35} But Crim.R. 24 makes no provision that a party's exercise of a peremptory challenge must be predicated on the trial court's invitation to do so. The right to exercise a challenge lies with a party and not the court. Here, the state did not use its third and final challenge on prospective juror White at the conclusion of his voir dire examination. Crim.R. 24(E) provides that the state's failure to exercise its peremptory challenge then constituted a waiver of that challenge. The trial court's action in permitting the challenge \"out of sequence\" was a clear violation of Crim.R. 24(D) and (E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60998\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/129/790/#p798\">\n    129 Ohio App.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20N.E.2d%2070\">\n    719 N.E.2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 36} It is beyond cavil that the trial court erred in permitting the state to exercise its third peremptory challenge after the state had waived that challenge, after the selection of the alternate jurors was already under way, and after the court had expressly asked the parties if they were satisfied with the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     e.

On the state of this record, we conclude that he cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 38} In anticipation of our adoption of the automatic-reversal rule, on appeal Jones has not advanced an argument demonstrating how he was prejudiced by the trial court's error. From our examination of the trial record, however, we note that Jones argued there that permitting the state to remove prospective juror White deprived him of \"a potentially friendly juror.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 39} But the right to ensure that a particular juror remain on the panel is not one secured by Crim.R. 24. The function of a peremptory challenge is to reject potential jurors viewed as biased toward the party exercising the challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1363949\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app/64/431/#p439\">\n    64 Ohio App. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20N.E.2d%201010\">\n    28 N.E.2d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the state's improper challenge to prospective juror White resulted in prospective alternate juror Roland's taking White's place on the panel. Jones listened to the state's and the trial\n   court's examination of Roland, asked no questions of him, passed him for cause, and did not exercise his remaining Crim.R. 24(G) alternate peremptory challenge to exclude him from the panel. Jones could hardly have viewed Roland as an unfriendly juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Where Jones had ample opportunity to examine the prospective juror on voir dire, found no showing of any bias or lack of impartiality on his part challengeable for cause, and elected not to use his peremptory challenge to remove the prospective juror, we cannot say that he has demonstrated prejudice flowing from the trial court's error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Jones' third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. Jury Charge on Complicity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In his first assignment of error, Jones argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on complicity over his objection. At trial, Jones maintained solely that because the state had tried the case on the theory that he was the principal offender of a single theft offense, the complicity instruction was not warranted. The evidence of complicity was \"so remote\" that its inclusion would confuse the jury, and would not support an instruction on complicity. On appeal, however, he now argues that since the complaint did not charge him \"with respect to the theft offense committed by [Scott],\" the trial court erred in charging the jury that Jones could be found to be an aider and abettor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 43} A person who violates R.C. 2923.03(A) by aiding and abetting another in committing an offense \"is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this section, or in terms of the principal offense.\" R.C. 2923.03(F). Thus, if the evidence permits, a defendant is deemed to be on notice that he can be convicted as a principal offender or as an accomplice under R.C. 2923.03(F).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The complaint initiating the prosecution alleged that Jones had taken \"various clothing items and a watch\" from Burlington Coat Factory. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that Jones had acted in concert, as an aider and abettor, with Scott in committing the theft of clothing items. Jones was observed entering the store with Scott. Both went to the men's clothing department and selected clothing. Jones watched nearby persons to see if they were being observed. The loss prevention associate observed the two and concluded that both Scott and Jones had concealed store property on their persons. Jones exited from the store quickly and joined Scott in a vehicle. They drove away together, and were apprehended together. Jones admitted that Scott had removed stolen merchandise from his pants once in the vehicle. Under these circumstances, the jury could reasonably have concluded that Scott had been the principal offender and that\n   Jones had aided and abetted his efforts. On these facts, the instruction was warranted and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving the instruction on complicity. Jones' first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Jones also argues on appeal that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it was required to acquit Jones of complicity if it found that the state failed to prove the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jones did not bring this matter to the trial court's attention at a time when the alleged error could have been corrected or avoided. Thus he had forfeited all but plain error in regards to this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 30(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury was entitled to reject Jones' theory that he had merely accompanied Scott to the store, and had not acted in concert with Scott to commit a theft of men's clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The state presented ample evidence, including the testimony of Seiter that Jones had entered the store with Scott, had watched to see if they were being observed, and had taken clothing without paying for it, and the testimony of Officer Robers that Jones and Scott were apprehended together shortly after leaving the store and that stolen clothing items were found with them. Jones' own testimony that Scott had removed stolen merchandise from his pants after leaving the store also supported the state's case. As the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses were primarily for the trier of fact to determine, the jury, in resolving conflicts in the testimony, particularly between Seiter's and Jones' descriptions of what Jones had done inside\n   the store, could properly have found Jones guilty of complicity, and thus did not lose its way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
