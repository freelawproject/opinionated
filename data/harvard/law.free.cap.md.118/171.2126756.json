She testified \u201cwe called the taxicab and he came'to the hoxise. * * * Papa carried me out and pxxt me in the taxicab and it was going right from the hoxxse towards Caroline and Goxxgh streets when the car struck the taxicab and I fell oxxt of Papa\u2019s arms.\u201d This was the only reference she made to the taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The next witness was Dr. Chideckel, Dispensary physician at the Hebrew Hospital to which the plaintiff was going at the time of the accident, and where she was treated by the interne. Dr. Chideckel did not see her until after she had left the hospital, and returned to her home. He was her regular physician before and after this accident, and his testimony related exclusively to the condition of her health after as compared with her health before the accident. He was not asked anything about the taxicab, and presumably never saw it as he did not see the plaintiff while at the hospital. But however this may be he did not mention any taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The next witness was H. Mangelstein who saw the collision. He said he saw \u201cthe car strike the taxicab on the back wheel, and both of them stopped, and he went and looked inside the taxicab and saw the plaintiff and her father and immediately went away into his house and that was all he saw. He made no other mention of the taxicab and none of the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Harris Getz, plaintiff\u2019s father, was the next and the last witness. He said: \u201cMy daughter-in-law telephoned up to the Taxicab Company and he come down in a little while and I took her in the taxicab, and as soon as we passed from Spring-street into Gough the car comes in and butts into the taxicab and she fell out of my arms. I had her .in my arms and she fell on the floor and I fell on top of her, and mashed my head, and I did not know what had happened. * * * The . taxicab was going- pretty fast. I asked him not to take any time. I only heard the car when it struck the taxicab, and she fell out of my arms. That was all I saw because I was excited and did not go outside.\u201d The rest of his testimony related exclusively to his daughter\u2019s condition, and he made no other mention of the taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">It thus appears that there is a total absence of any evidence whatever showing that the taxicab in question was owned or controlled by the defendant, or operated by any employee or agent of the defendant. For aught we know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>there may be a dozen taxicab companies in public service in Baltimore, and hundreds of individuals owning and operating taxicabs for public use, to any one of which this particular taxicab may have belonged, or by whom it was operated at the time, and upon the state of proof disclosed by the record, the finding by the jury that it was owned or controlled by the defendant was absolutely unsupported. If (here had been evidence tending in any manner to identify the taxicab as the property of the defendant, the inference might have been justified that the defendant was in its possession and control by the driver as it servant, in the absence of proof to the contrary, as was held in <em>Vonderhorst Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Amrhine, </em>98 Md. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The Courts have been properly liberal in the admission of evidence tending to establish the ownership of vehicles in cases of this character, and in sustaining the inference of possession and control from any admissible evidence of ownership, hut it is only where there is some such evidence, however slight, that such a case should be submitted to the jury. Upon the evidence in this case the verdict might as well have been rendered against any other taxicab company in the City of Baltimore, or any individual who might have been named as defendant, as against the Stewart Taxicab Company. The evidence established absolutely nothing, either by direct testimony, or inference of any kind, as to the vital fact of ownership or control, and the verdict and judgment therefore ought not to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The appellee\u2019s counsel printed in his brief an extract from the testimony of John O\u2019Brien, given as the brief alleges \u201cin a subsequent case between the same parties arising out of the same accident, namely, the loss of services, before the \u2022 same judge, as to the ownership of the cab in question and O\u2019Brien\u2019s employment as cnauffox of defendant, on that occasion,\u201d and relies upon this to supply the defect of proof. From the language of the brief which we have quoted, it would not appear that the parties were the same in the two suits, one being by the father in his own right for the loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of the daughter\u2019s services, and the other by the daughter in her own right through her father, as nominal plaintiff, for the injuries she claimed to have sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">.But apart from that, the testimony in the father\u2019s case constitutes no part of the record in this case and cannot be considered by us for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">This defect of proof goes equally to the defendant\u2019s first and third prayers, and all three of its prayers should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">It may be that this defect of proof was due to mere inadvertence and if this were the only ground of error we should feel disposed, while reversing the judgment for the reasons above stated, to remand the case for a new trial, as authorized by section 22 of Article 5 of the Code; but we cannot discover in this record any legally sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the owner or driver of the taxicab. Dr. Ohideckel did not witness the collision and knew nothing about it. The father, the daughter, and the only remaining witness, Mangelstein, all agree that <em>the street car ran into the taxicab, </em>and no one of them testifies to any fact tending to prove any negligence of the chauffer. The daughter\u2019s testimony on this point is confined to the bare statement that the car struck the taxicab. The father in describing the occurrence confines himself to the statement that \u201cthe car comes in and butts into the taxicab.\u201d He said he believed he saw the car, but was so nervous that he only heard it when it struck the cab, that the taxicab was going pretty fast, and he asked him not to take any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">All that Mangelstein said was that both the car and the taxicab were running fast, \u201cand the car came straight into the wheel of the taxicab, and both stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Hpon such evidence a verdict for the plaintiff could only be founded upon mere conjecture, which is never allowed, and this judgment must therefore be reversed without a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\"><em>\u25a0Judgment reversed </em>without. <em>awarding a new </em>trial, <em>the appellee to pay the costs above and below.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
