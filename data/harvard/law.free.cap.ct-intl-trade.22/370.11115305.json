DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company (\u201cDuPont\u201d), motion for judgment upon the agency record pursuant to USCIT R. 56.2. The Plaintiff challenges the Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) determination that polyvinyl alcohol (\u201cPVA\u201d) produced in Taiwan from DuPont\u2019s own U.S.-origin materials is foreign merchandise within the scope of the antidumping duty order, entitled <em>Polyvinyl Alcohol From Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Taiwan, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 24,286 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996 (antidumping duty ord.)(\u201cOrder\u201d). This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(vi)(1994) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c)(1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">In March 1995, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (\u201cAir Products\u201d), a domestic producer of PVA, filed apetition requestingthat Commerce initiate an antidumping investigation of certain PVA from Taiwan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In April 1995, Commerce initiated the requested investigation to determine whether imports of PVA from Taiwan, were being, or were likely to be sold in the United States at less than fair value. <em>Polyvinyl Alcohol From Japan, the Republic of Korea, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Taiwan, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 17,053 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1995)(init. antidumping duty investigation). The period of investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d) was April 4,1994, through March 31,1995. <em>Polyvinyl Alcohol From Taiwan, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 14,064, 14,065 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996)(final det.).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>As aresult ofits investigation, Commerce determined that the subject merchandise was being sold in the United States at less than fair value. Chang Chun Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (\u201cChang Chun\u201d), the sole Taiwan producer of the subject merchandise was assigned an <em>ad valorem </em>weighted-average dumping margin of 19.21%. <em>Id. </em>at 14,073.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">On May 14,1996, Commerce published the Order covering PVA imported from Taiwan. The scope of the Order was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">The merchandise covered by these orders is polyvinyl alcohol. Polyvinyl alcohol is a dry, white to cream-colored, water-soluble synthetic polymer. This product consists of polyvinyl alcohols hydrolyzed in excess of 85 percent, whether or not mixed or diluted with de-foamer or boric acid. Excluded from this investigation are polyvinyl alcohols covalently bonded with acetoacetylate, carboxylic acid, or sulfonic acid uniformly present on all polymer chains in a concentration equal to or greater than two mole percent, and polyvinyl alcohols covalently bonded with silane uniformly present on all polymer chains in a concentration equal to or greater than one-tenth of one mole percent. Polyvinyl alcohol in fiber form is not included in the scope of these orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">61 Fed. Reg. at 24,287.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">On October 1,1996, DuPont requested a scope rulingfrom Commerce pursuant to 19 C.ER. \u00a7 353.29. <em>See </em>C.R. Doc. No. 1 (Application for Scope Determination: Polyvinvyl Alcohol From Taiwan, No. A-583-824, Oct. 1, 1996) (\u201cApplication\u201d). Through this process, Commerce determines whether certain products fall within the scope of an order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.29; <em>Ericsson GE Mobile Communications, Inc. v. United States, </em>60 F.3d 778, 783 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Plaintiffs Application sought a ruling from Commerce excluding \u201cPVA produced by\u201d Chang Chun from DuPont\u2019s U.S.-origin vinyl acetate monomer (\u201cVAM\u201d) pursuant to a contractual relationship with DuPont, from coverage under the Order. Application at 2-3. DuPont described its relationship with Chang Chun as \u201catollingrelationship, in which one party (the toll producer or toller) performs a manufacturing process on the goods of another party (the owner).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">According to the Application, DuPont produces VAM in the United States and ships it to Chang Chun. Chang Chun performs a chemical process in which the VAM is polymerized into polyvinyl acetate. <em>Id. </em>at 2. The polyvinyl acetate is then converted to PVA in a second chemical process. A solvent aids the process, and certain other chemicals are used as processing aids. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOn completion of the conversion process, [most] of the PVA produced by Chang Chun is shipped by DuPont back to the United States. Sales of PVA are made by DuPont to customers in the United States and elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3</p>\n<p id=\"b390-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>While DuPont recognizes that its PVA was imported from Taiwan, the company claims that \u201cPVA toll-produced in Taiwan from DuPont\u2019s U.S.-origin raw materials and re-exported to the United States\u201d is not within the scope of the Order because the imported PVA \u201cis a [U.S.] product for antidumping purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 2, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\">DuPont concedes that its PVA is Taiwanese for Customs\u2019 country-of-origin purposes; nonetheless, DuPont argues, it controls the entire production process; it manufactures PVA from U.S.-origin materials, and it controls the selling price of the final product. Pl.\u2019s Brief at 22-23. Therefore, DuPont claims, Chang Chun is merely a \u201cfinal processor\u201d and Chang Chun\u2019s processing does not give the merchandise its national character. <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">After determining that no formal scope inquiry was warranted, 19 C.F.R \u00a7 353.29(b), Commerce decided that \u201cthe product imported by DuPont falls within the antidumping order on PVA from Taiwan, unless [Commerce] conclude[s] that the U.S.-origin input provided by DuPont, VAM[,] is not substantially transformed in Taiwan <em>(i.e., </em>the processing of VAM into PVA does not constitute substantial transformation).\u201d E R. Doc. No. 5 at 3 (Final Scope Ruling on AntidumpingDuty Order on Polyvinyl Alcohol from Taiwan, Dec. 19,1996)(\u201cScope Determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Substantial transformation generally refers to a degree of processing or manufacturingresuiting in a new and different article. <em>See e.g., Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products From Argentina, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37,062, 37,066 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1993)(final det.)(finding that galvanizing is a bonding process which changes the character and use of the sheet, therefore, a cold-rolled sheet that is galvanized in a subject country is substantially transformed into a product of that country); <em>Limousines From Canada, </em>55 Fed. Reg. 11,036, 11,040 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1990)(final det.)(\u201cThe Department considers limousine conversion to be a sophisticated process which transforms the base vehicle into a new and different article of merchandise.\u201d). Using this standard, Commerce \u201cexamined whether the degree of processing or manufacturing\u201d necessary to convert VAM into PVA \u201cresulted in a new and different article,\u201d and determined that the processing by Chang Chun constituted substantial transformation. Scope Determination at 3. Commerce, therefore, concluded that \u201cthe imported PVA must be considered Taiwanese PVA that is subject to the order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The Court of International Trade reviews Commerce\u2019s scope determination to decide whether it is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>Section 516a(b)(l)(B)(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i)(1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">In determining whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation and application of the antidumping statute is in accordance with law, this court applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the two-step analysis articulated in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984), as applied and refined by the Federal Circuit. The first task is \u201cto determine whether Congress has \u2018directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the statute unambiguously deals with the subject matter in issue, the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the intent of Congress. <em>Id.; see, e.g., Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States, </em>13 F.3d 398, 402-403 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <em>cert denied, </em>513 U.S. 813 (1994); <em>Zenith Elec. Corp. v. United States, </em>988 F.2d 1573, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u201cIf the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843. Considerable weight is accorded Commerce\u2019s construction of the antidum-ping laws, whether that construction manifests itself in the application of the statute, <em>see, e.g., Daewoo Elec. Co. v. Int\u2019l Union of Elec., Technical, Salaried and Mach. Workers, </em>6 F.3d 1511, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <em>cert denied, </em>512 U.S. 1204 (1994); <em>Fujitsu Gen. Ltd. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1034, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1996), or in the promulgation of a regulation, <em>see, e.g., Smith-Corona Group v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1568, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1022 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">When examining Commerce\u2019s factual determinations to decide whether they are supported by substantial evidence, the court must determine whether the record contains \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support [Commerce\u2019s] conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951)(quoted in <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). Substantial evidence \u201cis something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-20 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Antidumping orders are issued for \u201ca class or kind of foreign merchandise.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C \u00a7 1673(1)(1994). The statute does not define \u201cforeign\u201d; nor does it contain a standard for Commerce to apply in determining whether the merchandise at issue is a domestic product or a product of a foreign nation. When a statute is silent or ambiguous, the Court must defer to Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation. <em>Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1565, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In this case Commerce\u2019s decision to use the \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d test to determine the nationality of the subject merchandise is a permissible application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d rule provides a yardstick for determining whether the processes performed on merchandise in a country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>are of such significance as to require that the resulting merchandise be considered the product of the country in which the transformation occurred. <em>See Smith Corona Corp. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 47, 50, 811 F. Supp. 692, 695 (1993) (noting that in determining if merchandise exported from an intermediate country is covered by an antidumping order, Commerce identified the country of origin by considering whether the essential component is substantially transformed in the country of exportation); <em>Ferrostaal Metals Corp. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 470, 473, 664 F. Supp. 535, 537 (1987)(statingthatindeterminingifaproductori-ginated in the country of exportation, Commerce considered whether operations performed on products in the country of exportation are of such a substantial nature to justify the conclusion that the resulting product is a manufacture of that country). Further, the standard provides a means by which this court can understand the basis of the agency\u2019s action and so may review Commerce\u2019s exercise of its statutory responsibilities. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade, </em>412 U.S. 800, 807 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\">In its scope determination here, Commerce relied on its \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d rule to determine whether DuPont\u2019s PVA was a product of Taiwan. Scope Determination at 3. Commerce\u2019s interpretation \u2014 that merchandise produced overseas from U.S.-origin materials will be U.S. merchandise only if the foreign production process does not constitute \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d \u2014 is a reasonable application of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673(1) because it comports with the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">DuPont argues Commerce\u2019s determination is inconsistent with the general scheme and purpose of the antidumping statute. Pl.\u2019s Brief at 22. Under the statutory scheme, Commerce compares United States price to the normal value of the subject merchandise to determine whether there is dumping. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b. DuPont maintains that the clear intent of the statute is to exclude the merchandise at issue because there is no foreign \u201cnormal\u201d value to compare to the United States price. DuPont claims that the U.S. market is DuPont\u2019s home market. DuPont argues there is no sale of PVA outside the United States before importation, and therefore, the Department\u2019s antidumping investigation will compare DuPont\u2019s prices in the same market to each other, demonstrating that in the absence of a foreign \u201cnormal\u201d value an antidumping investigation cannot reasonably proceed. Pl.\u2019s Brief at 20. The Court does not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Plaintiffs argument is flawed because in calculating normal value pursuant to section 1677b, the \u201chome market\u201d is the \u201cexporting country.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B). The tolled PVA is exported from Taiwan to the United States. Therefore, for purposes of calculating normal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>value under the statute, the home market is Taiwan, not the United States. Def.\u2019s Mem. Opp\u2019n to Pl.\u2019s Mot. J. Agency R. at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The antidumping statute reflects Congress\u2019 recognition that country of origin determinations are vital to preserve the integrity of existing antidumping orders from potential circumvention through third country assembly, U.S. assembly, and transhipment of subject merchandise throughintermediatecountries. <em>See </em>19U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677j, 1677b(a)(3). Because antidumping orders apply to merchandise from particular countries, not individual producers, determining the country where the unfairly traded merchandise is produced or manufactured is fundamental to the proper administration and enforcement of the antidumping statute. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673; <em>see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1677j, 1677b(a)(3). The \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d rule provides a means for Commerce to carry out its country of origin examination and properly guards against circumvention of existing antidumping orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">DuPont also argues that Commerce\u2019s substantial transformation rule is inconsistent with the Department\u2019s own regulations on \u201ctolling\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">[Commerce] will not consider a toller or sub-contractor to be a manufacturer or producer where the toller or subcontractor does not acquire ownership, and does not control the relevant sale, of the subject merchandise or foreign like product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,411 (May 19, 1997)(final rule), codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(h)(1997). This regulation, however, addresses the relationship of the parties in the manufacturingprocess, not the nationality of the merchandise itself. The substantial transformation test determi-. nes whether the \u201ctoller\u2019Vprocessor performs functions of such significance as to change the national character of the merchandise. This test is not one that bears on the relationship of the parties in the manufacturing process. Upon its face, the regulation does not preclude a U.S. producer from becoming a respondent in an antidumping proceeding when merchandise it owns is produced or further processed in a foreign country. DuPont\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is too broad as it would allow an owner of merchandise, e.g., raw materials, to circumvent the antidumping statute simply by categorizing its foreign processor as a \u201ctoller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">DuPont also argues that Commerce\u2019s determination is inconsistent with <em>Brass Sheet and Strip From Canada, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 33,610 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1993)(final det.). Pl.\u2019s Brief at 34. The Court does not agree. In <em>Brass Sheet, </em>the merchandise toll-produced in Canada was included in the scope of the antidumping duty order. For the toll-produced merchandise, Commerce treated metal value as a separate item. Commerce calculated a margin that did not include the value of the U.S.-origin metal from which the brass sheet and strip was produced. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 611-612. Here, DuPont withdrew its request that Commerce calculate a rate that did not include the value of the U.S.-origin materials. <em>See </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 14,070. Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>Brass Sheet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Accordingly, the Court upholds Commerce\u2019s use of the \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d rule to define \u201cforeign\u201d merchandise as in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Commerce\u2019s determination, however, also must be supported by substantial evidence in the record. Applying the \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d standard, Commerce \u201cexamined whether the degree of processing or manufacturingresulted in a new and different article\u201d and concluded that \u201cVAM must undergo a substantial transformation\u201d in Taiwan to be converted into PVA. Scope Determination at 3. However, it is not clear to the Court what evidence formed the basis of Commerce\u2019s determination. \u201c[T]he orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 94 (1943). Therefore, the Court is remanding this issue for reconsideration. Commerce appears to have relied upon a confidential document describing Chang Chun\u2019s production process. <em>See </em>PR. Doc. No. 8 (Chang Chun\u2019s Consent to Placement of Certain Proprietary Information from Antidumping Investigation on Record of Instant Proceeding, March 19, 1997). Upon remand, Commerce at minimum<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> should explain to the Court the evidence it is relying on to make its substantial transformation determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In accordance with the foregoing, it is hereby ordered that Commerce\u2019s determination regarding the scope of the Order is remanded. Commerce shall complete its remand determination by Monday, June 15, 1998. Any comments or responses are due by Monday, July 13, 1998.
