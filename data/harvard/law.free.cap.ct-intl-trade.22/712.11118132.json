International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW Local 1283, and Employees and Former Employees of Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) challenge the Department of Labor\u2019s (\u201cDOB\u2019) determination that the former employees of the Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. (\u201cJohnson Controls\u201d) plant in Louisville, Kentucky (\u201cLouisville plant\u201d) are not eligible for certification because increased imports did not contribute importantly to the workers\u2019 separation from employment, as required by Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974, <em>amended by </em>the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-418), 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(3) (\u201cTrade Act\u201d). <em>See Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. Louisville, Kentucky; Notice of Negative Determination of Reconsideration On Remand, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 31,626 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1997) <em>(\u201cNotice of Negative Determination of Reconsideration On Remand\u201d). </em>DOL\u2019s denial of certification is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the trade adjustment assistance provisions of the Trade Act. Therefore, DOL\u2019s final determination is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">The purpose of the trade adjustment assistance program is \u201cto offer unemployment compensation, training, job search and relocation allow-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>anees, and other employment services to workers who lose their jobs because of import competition.\u201d <em>Former Employees of Parallel Petroleum Corp. v. United States Secretary of Labor, </em>14 CIT 114, 118, 731 F. Supp. 524, 527 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In order to certify a group of workers as eligible to apply for trade adjustment assistance under Section 222 of the Trade Act, the Secretary of Labor (\u201cSecretary\u201d) must determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in such workers\u2019 firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">(2) that sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such workers\u2019 firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof contributed importantly to such total or partial separation, or threat thereof, and to such decline in sales or production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">In order to receive trade adjustment assistance benefits, Plaintiffs must satisfy all three requirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act. <em>See, e.g., Former Employees of Bass Enterprises Production Co. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 68, 70, 706 F. Supp. 897, 900 (1989) (\u201c[Fjailure to satisfy any one of the three criteria for certification of workers for assistance will result in denial of adjustment assistance.\u201d); <em>Abbott v. Donovan, </em>8 CIT 237, 239, 596 F. Supp. 472, 474 (1984) (\u201cIf any of these three statutory conditions does not exist, the Secretary must deny certification.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">OnAugust22,1995, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2271, a petition for certification of eligibility for trade adjustment assistance was filed on behalf of the former employees of the Louisville plant. Petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance filed by Puckett on Aug. 22, 1995, Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) 2 (\u201cPetition for Trade Adjustment Assistance\u201d). On October 13, 1995, DOL denied certification because increased imports did not contribute importantly to the separation of Louisville employees. <em>See </em>Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. Louisville, Kentucky; Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance, AR 15 (\u201cNegative Determination\u201d); <em>Notice of Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 55,063 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1995). DOL\u2019s investigation revealed that production had been transferred domestically and the firm\u2019s sales, production and employment had not declined prior to the implementation of the transfer. Negative Determination, AR 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">On November 13,1995, the employees petitioned for reconsideration of the negative determination. Letter from Puckett to Tranzo dated Nov. 13,1995, AR 18-19. The application noted that workers from three other Johnson Controls\u2019 production facilities that had closed in the pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>cedingl8 months had been certified after an initial denial. Id. It alleged that production from those facilities has been shipped to a new facility in Torreon, Mexico which produced new and aftermarket batteries. <em>Id. </em>at 18. It also asserted that batteries from the Louisville plant were being shipped to Mexico and returned to the United States in new cars. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">On November 30,1995, DOL granted the request for reconsideration because \u201c[t]he petitioner [had presented] evidence that the subject firm shifted production to a foreign owned facility.\u201d <em>Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. Louisville, Kentucky; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 63,733 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">On February 6, 1996, the Secretary affirmed the denial of certification. <em>Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. Louisville, KY; Notice of Negative Determination on Reconsideration, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 6658, 6659 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1996). DOL concluded it was irrelevant whether batteries from Mexico were entering the United States in new automobiles, as Plaintiffs alleged, because DOL was statutorily required to examine whether imports of articles like or directly competitive with the automobile batteries produced at the Louisville plant contributed importantly to Plaintiffs\u2019 separation. <em>See id. </em>at 6658.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In accord with its general practice, DOL surveyed the Louisville plant\u2019s customers to determine whether the \u201ccontributed importantly\u201d test was satisfied. <em>See id. </em>DOL found that the Louisville plant\u2019s customers did not increase their purchases of imports while decreasing their purchases from the Louisville plant. <em>Id. </em>at 6658-59. DOL also found there was no evidence that the Louisville plant imported automobile batteries. <em>Id. </em>at 6659. In addition, it determined that the value ofUnited States imports of automobile batteries declined from 1993 to 1994 and from October 1993 to September 1994 to the same twelve-month period in 1994-95. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">As for the workers at the other three plants that were certified, DOL stated that \u201c [e]ach worker group petition is determined for certification on its own merits. The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition but only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like or directly competitive products which \u2018contributed importantly\u2019 to declines in sales or production and employment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">On April 24, 1996, Plaintiffs challenged DOL\u2019s negative determination in this Court. On December 12,1996, DOL requested a voluntary remand to more fully investigate whether the workers met the eligibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ity criteria. Defendant\u2019s Memorandum In Opposition at 7-8. On February 4, 1997, this Court remanded this action to DOL to conduct an additional investigation of Plaintiffs\u2019 application for certification and ordered Plaintiffs to submit to DOL any additional information warranting consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">On remand, DOL submitted a supplemental questionnaire to Johnson Controls. Letter from Poole to Bagley dated Apr. 29,1997 with attachment, Supplemental Confidential Administrative Record (\u201cSCAR\u201d) 2-3. DOL asked whether Johnson Controls had shifted any battery production from Louisville to Mexico, and whether it had imported automobile batteries from Mexico or any other foreign source like or directly competitive with batteries made at the Louisville plant. <em>Id. </em>at 3. DOL also requested information on the percentage of sales from the Louisville plant to each of its customers from January to September 1995. <em>Id. </em>Johnson Controls responded that no production had been shifted from the Louisville plant to Mexico, noted that production of automotive batteries sold to Gonher de Mexico from Louisville were transferred to its St. Joseph, Missouri facility, provided the percentage of battery sales to each plant customer, and explained why imported batteries from Johnson Controls\u2019 Mexican facility were different from batteries produced at the Louisville plant. Johnson Controls Completed Supplemental Questionnaire dated May 5, 1997, SCAR 5 (\u201cJohnson Controls Completed Supplemental Questionnaire\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">On May 16,1997, DOL affirmed its original denial of certification. <em>Notice of Negative Determination of Reconsideration On Remand, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 31,626. DOL explained that it granted certification petitions for former workers at Johnson Controls\u2019 Garland, Texas; Bennington, Vermont; and Owosso, Michigan plants because their customers reported increased imports of aftermarket batteries, the product those plants produced, during the relevant time period. <em>Id. </em>at 31626. As a result, \u201cit was determined that imports \u2018contributed importantly\u2019 to worker separations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the Louisville plant customers were new car producers purchasing original equipment, automotive batteries, rather than aftermarket batteries. <em>Id. </em>Finally, DOL found that the remand investigation confirmed that battery production at the Louisville plant was shifted to another Johnson Controls facility in the United States. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">On August 7,1997, Plaintiffs submitted a Reply In Opposition To Defendant\u2019s Negative Determination on Remand (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Reply\u201d). Plaintiffs challenge DOL\u2019s determination that the former employees of the Louisville plant are not eligible for certification because increased imports did not contribute importantly to the workers\u2019 separation from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Plaintiffs assert that DOL\u2019s determination that the workers are ineligible for certification is not supported by substantial evidence on the record and is not otherwise in accordance with law. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that DOL failed to consider the closing of the Louisville plant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>relation to, and as part of, the closing of Johnson Controls battery plants in Garland, Bennington, and Owosso in 1994 and 1995. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 2 and 6. In addition, Plaintiffs allege that DOL failed to adequately investigate their claims, improperly grouped distinct battery categories in its import analysis and placed unwarranted reliance on the responses of Johnson Controls. <em>Id. </em>Finally, Plaintiffs claim that \u201c[w]hile [DOL\u2019s] decision to take a \u2018fresh look\u2019 at the case was laudable, its most recent Negative Determination wholly fails to answer the legal and factual issues raised by plaintiffs.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 1.

Marshall, </em>584 F.2d 390, 397 (D.C. Cir. 1978). However, \u201cwhen a petitioner under a government benefits program puts forward an interpretation of a legislative provision that is arguably consonant with the statutory language, he is at least entitled toa reasoned statement why the administrator will not adopt that interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396. \u201cThe mechanical adoption of the plant as the appropriate subdivision without reasoned analysis is improper.\u201d <em>Lloyd v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>637 F.2d 1267, 1275 (9th Cir. 1980). DOL must analyze the underlying facts and explain why, reasonably based upon those facts, it would not include another facility within what the agency determines to be the \u201cappropriate subdivision\u201d. If it does so, under the required standard of deference to the Secretary\u2019s finding, the Court must uphold DOL\u2019s decision as supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>(citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322(b) (Secretary\u2019s findings shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence)).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In its remand decision, DOL did provide an explanation for treating the workers from the Louisville plant differently than the workers from the Garland, Bennington and Owosso plants. <em>See Notice of Negative Determination of Reconsideration On Remand, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 31,626. According to DOL, the plants had different customer bases because the Louisville plant produced original equipment automotive batteries while the other plants produced aftermarket batteries. <em>Id. </em>DOL\u2019s explanation constitutes the reasoned analysis required under <em>Lloyd.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>There was substantial evidence in the record to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The Technique Used By DOL To Determine Whether Increased Imports Contributed Importantly To The Separation Of Workers Was Not So Marred That DOL\u2019s Findings Were Arbitrary Or Of Such A Nature That It Could Not Be Based On Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Plaintiffs argue that DOL\u2019s industry analysis is incomplete and conducted in an arbitrary manner. Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 11. Plaintiffs claim that DOL\u2019s reliance on its Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance market segment analysis to measure the value of imports from 1991 to 1995 is flawed for two reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 9. First, they say the analysis does not provide any data or the requisite comparison with domestic automobile battery production for the same time period. <em>See Id. </em>at 9-10. Plaintiffs concede that the absolute values for both imports and domestic production may have declined during that time period; however, they contend that the relative market share of imports may have increased. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Second, according to Plaintiffs, DOL gave a \u201cpatently misleading\u201d ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>pearance of declining imports by adding together, without explanation, the increase in the value of small battery<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> imports and the substantial decrease in the value of large battery<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> imports. <em>See id. </em>at 10-11 and Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibits 4 and 4A. Plaintiffs argue that instead of combining the value of all United States imports of automotive batteries to determine the value of imports during the relevant time period DOL should have examined imports of small batteries separately from imports of large batteries. Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 10. Plaintiffs contend that DOL should have analyzed the impact of the increase in small battery imports on the sales of batteries from the Louisville plant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 10-11 and Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">In addition, Plaintiffs question the factual basis for DOL\u2019s conclusion that import competition did not play a part in the closure of the Louisville plant because two customers\u2019 plants, one allegedly Louisville\u2019s second largest customer, did not submit responses to DOL\u2019s customer survey. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 12 and Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 1. Plaintiffs claim they are entitled to an explanation \u201cwhy the [customer] responses are missing or why they allegedly can\u2019t be used.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Under DOL\u2019s regulations, \u201cincreased imports\u201d means that \u201cimports have increased either absolutely or relative to domestic production compared to a representative base period.\u201d 29 C.F.R. 90.2 (1995). \u201cIn determining whether increased imports contributed importantly to the separation of the workers, [DOL] often employs a \u2018dual test\u2019 which looks to whether the subject company\u2019s customers reduced purchases from that company and at the same time increased purchases of competitive imports.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers v. United States Secretary of Labor, </em>17 CIT 1188, 1190 (1993). While this test \u201cis not * * * very sophisticated,\u201d this court has found it \u201ca reasonable means of ascertaining a causal link between imports and separations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United Glass and Ceramic Workers v. Marshall, </em>584 F.2d 398, 405-06 (D.C. Cir. 1978)). The casual link needed is \u201ca direct and substantial relationship between increased imports and a decline in sales and production.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Estate <em>of Finkel v. Donovan, </em>9 CIT 374, 382, 614 F. Supp. 1245, 1251 (1985) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Here, DOL mailed survey questionnaires to the companies Johnson Controls identified as its major declining customers. <em>See </em>Page of Johnson Controls Completed DOL Business Confidential Data Request Listing Major Declining Customers, CAR 12 and Fax Transmittal Sheets and Cover Letters from Poole to Johnson Controls Major Declining Cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>tomers and Fax Transmission Report, CAR 109-120.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These companies were Customer 1, Customer 2, Customer 3, Customer 4, and Customer 5. <em>See </em>Page of Johnson Controls Completed DOL Business Confidential Data Request Listing Major Declining Customers, CAR 12. DOL only received response from three companies: Customers 1, 2 and 5. <em>See </em>Completed Surveys, CAR 123-31. Johnson Controls rather than Customer 4 responded to that company\u2019s questionnaire. <em>See </em>Johnson Controls Response, CAR 121-22. As a result, DOL excluded Customer 4\u2019s information from its analysis. <em>See </em>Handwritten Notes, CAR 132. The record does not contain a response from Customer 3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, DOL only considered data on three of the five Louisville plant customers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Based on the definition of \u201cincreased imports\u201d, the key information to establish the causal link necessary is the increase or decrease in customer purchases of imports in comparison to purchases from the Louisville plant. The other general statistical information on automotive battery imports that DOL cites would not prove that imports were the direct and substantial cause of the closure of the plant. Therefore, the missing information on domestic automobile battery production and lack of differentiation between small and large battery imports in the general statistical information is irrelevant. However, deficiencies in gathering information from the customer surveys are relevant and critical to determining if a causal link existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Here, DOL failed to gather information from two of the five customers that were sent surveys, including Customer 4, the plant\u2019s second largest customer from January through September 1995.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>See Completed Survey, CAR 121-22; Handwritten Notes, CAR 132; Johnson Controls Completed Supplemental Questionnaire, SCAR 5. This deficiency, however, is not sufficient to find the customer survey technique was arbitrary or not based upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Although DOL has not articulated its use of the \u201cdual test\u201d to determine if imports contributed importantly to the separation of Louisville workers, the technique DOL applied of mailing questionnaires to Louisville customers to determine if their purchases of imports increased relative to purchases of Louisville batteries clearly is the \u201cdual test.\u201d <em>See United Steelworkers v. United States Secretary of Labor, </em>17 CIT at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Whether the results of the dual test constitute sufficient evidence for the denial of eligibility for trade adjustment assistance depends on the level of sales or sales decline accounted for in the record. <em>See Local 167 v. Marshall, </em>643 F.2d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 1981) (survey accounted for 49% and 68% of sales during relevant period); <em>United Glass and Ceramic Workers of North America v.

United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>9 CIT 543, 544 (1985) (survey accounted for 94.9% and 82.4% of sales decline during relevant period); <em>Estate of Finkel v. Donovan, </em>9 CIT 374, 381, 614 F. Supp. 1245, 1250-51 (1985) (customers responding to survey accounted for \u201csubstantial percentage\u201d of lost sales during relevant period); <em>Retail Clerks Int\u2019l Union v. Donovan, </em>10 CIT 308, 312 (1986) (surveyed customer accounted for nearly all sales decline).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Although this court has not established a specific level of sales, or sales decline, for which an account must be made in the record, it has found particular samplings insufficient. <em>See Kelley v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>10 CIT 250, 252, 633 F. Supp. 1374, 1376 (1986), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>812 F.2d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (samplings accounting for only 3% of company\u2019s net sales decline were insufficient support for denial of trade adjustment assistance); <em>Smith v. Brock, </em>12 CIT 1009, 1013, 698 F. Supp. 938, 941 (1988) (customers responding represented only 30% of total loss in sales and record lacked information from two firms with greatest decline in purchases).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Here, the percentage of customers that responded to the survey was sufficient for the 1995 period. Based upon percentages provided by Johnson Controls, the customers that responded to the survey represented 54.6% of the plant\u2019s customer base during January through September 1995. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Response To The Court\u2019s Order of June 25,1998.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This percentage is well within the percentages this court has found sufficient on other occasions. Therefore, the customer surveys considered by DOL were sufficient for the most recent period, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">As for the other relevant time periods, 1993 and 1994, the record does not contain information of what percentage of sales the customer responses represented. This deficiency is not fatal, however, because gathering data from Customers 3 and 4 would not have made a difference. Even if the data from those customers would have shown they increased their imports and decreased their purchases from Johnson Controls, such a decrease in the plant\u2019s sales had no effect because the plant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>sales, production and employment increased from fiscal year 1993 to 1994. <em>See </em>Johnson Controls Completed DOL Business Confidential Data Request, CAR 8. Therefore, even if Customers 3 and 4 had increased their imports, those lost sales must have been compensated for by increased sales to other plant customers. As a result, the survey responses were sufficient. The technique used here was not so marred that DOL\u2019s findings were arbitrary or of such a nature that it could not be based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">DOL Adequately Investigated Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Plaintiffs contend that DOL placed unwarranted reliance on responses from Johnson Controls about its plans for battery production in this country and Mexico. Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 11 and 14. Plaintiffs argue that DOL failed to properly investigate the sourcing of Johnson Controls\u2019 battery production and the significance of its Mexican operations. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Although Plaintiffs do not dispute that some of Louisville\u2019s production was transferred to the Toledo plant, they contend that DOL made no independent effort to verify the scale of this transfer or whether it approached the size of the Louisville operation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Plaintiffs also assert that DOL allegedly failed to investigate the veracity of statements of Johnson Controls\u2019 officials that no production was transferred from Louisville to Mexico. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief 14. Plaintiffs \u201cimpeachment\u201d evidence consisted of documents showing that (1) battery production at Johnson Controls\u2019 Mexican facility had increased for original equipment and aftermarket customers; (2) volunteers from the Louisville plant were sought to train workers in Mexico; (3) equipment from other Johnson Control plants had been transferred to Mexico; and (4) Johnson Controls had planned to open a distribution center in San Antonio to distribute batteries produced in Mexico.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief 12-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">In addition, Plaintiffs assert that Johnson Controls officials had allegedly been less than forthcoming about their Mexican operations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>that accordingly DOL should have presumed that they were not truthful with respect to this transfer of production.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Here, Johnson Controls\u2019 statement that \u201c[n]o production was shifted to Mexico\u201d from Louisville is not contradicted by Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that battery production at the Johnson Controls\u2019 Mexican facility had increased for original equipment customers. <em>See </em>Johnson Controls Completed Supplemental Questionnaire, SCAR 5; Two Paragraphs from <em>After Market Business </em>dated Oct. 1, 1994, AR 33. The original equipment production might have been shifted to Mexico from a facility other than Louisville or resulted from new customer orders or increased efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Contrary to the allegations above discussed, the remaining evidence does not contradict statements made by Johnson Controls\u2019 officials. First, Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that aftermarket production had increased at the Mexican plant, management requested volunteers to train Mexican workers, and equipment was transferred to Mexico, is in accord with, rather than in contradiction to, the statement by a company official that the Mexican facility was producing aftermarket batteries.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Johnson Controls Completed Supplemental Questionnaire, SCAR 5. In addition, such evidence only suggests that Johnson Controls had transferred some of its automotive battery production to Mexico. It does not establish that the transfer of production was from Louisville as opposed to the three other plants that were previously producing aftermarket batteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Second, Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that the company planned to open a distribution center in San Antonio is also in accord with, rather than in contradiction to, company statements that such a facility existed and was in use. <em>See </em>Johnson Controls Completed Supplemental Questionnaire, SCAR 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Finally, although Plaintiffs\u2019 contend Johnson Controls\u2019 officials have a propensity to lie, there is no evidence in the record to suggest such a general propensity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cAs a general matter, evidence of a person\u2019s character or character trait is not admissible in a civil * * * case to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the person acted in conformity with that character or character trait.\u201d 2 JackB. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 404.10 (2d ed. 1998). Therefore, the evidence in the record does not contradict or cast doubt upon the unverified statements of the Johnson Controls\u2019 officials, and DOL did not abuse its discretion by relying on the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">For the reasons set forth above, DOL\u2019s denial of certification is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the trade adjustment assistance provisions of the Trade Act. Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record is denied and DOL\u2019s <em>Negative Determination of Reconsideration On Remand </em>is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\"> The petitioner submitted the following information with the application for reconsideration: a letter from Rep.
