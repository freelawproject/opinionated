(\u201cGoss\u201d), pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>titioner in the underlying investigation, filed separate motions challenging various aspects of the final determination of the International Trade Administration of the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d or \u201cITA\u201d) regarding imports of large newspaper printing presses (\u201cLNPPs\u201d) from Japan. <em>Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof, Whether Assembled or Unassembled, from Japan, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 38,139 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996) (final det.)(\u201cJa-pan Final\u201d), as amended by <em>Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof, Whether Assembled or Unassembled, from Japan, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996) (antidumping duty ord.- and amendment to final det.). The motions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The antidumping investigation of LNPPs from Japan was conducted simultaneously with Commerce\u2019s investigation of sales of LNPPs from Germany. Issues common to both investigations were discussed in <em>Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof Whether Assembled or Unassembled, from Germany, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 38,166 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996) (final det.) (\u201cGermany Final\u201d). The Court affirmed Commerce\u2019s determinations with respect to common issues of scope and standing. <em>Mitsubishi Heavy Indus. Ltd. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1227, 986 F. Supp. 1428 (1997). Familiarity with the Court\u2019s opinion on scope and standing issues is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">I Constructed Export Price</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In calculating a dumping margin, Commerce compares United States price to the normal value of the subject merchandise. United States price is calculated using either an export price (\u201cEP\u201d) methodology or a constructed export price (\u201cCEP\u201d) methodology.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Typically, Commerce relies on EP when the foreign exporter sells directly to an unrelated U.S. purchaser. CEP is used when the foreign exporter makes sales through a related party in the United States. <em>See Sharp Corp. v. United States, </em>63 F.3d 1092, 1093-94 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (\u201cThe statute defines [U.S. price], * * * as either the United States purchase price [now EP] or the exporter\u2019s sales price [now CEP], whichever is appropriate * * *. Commerce uses the [CEP] if the foreign manufacturer imports through a related company in the United States.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">For each of the relevant LNPP sales by MHI and TKS to the United States, Commerce calculated U.S. price based on a CEP methodology. TKS had reported its sales as CEP sales and therefore does not object to Commerce\u2019s methodology. However, MHI reported its sales as EP sales. MHI objects to Commerce\u2019s decision to reclassify all of its sales as CEP sales. MHI also objects to Commerce\u2019s decision to treat its installation costs as further manufacturing, Commerce\u2019s methodology for allocat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ing general and administrative (\u201cG&amp;A\u201d) expenses for MHI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, and Commerce\u2019s decision to deduct from U.S. price, indirect selling expenses incurred in Japan. Both TKS and MHI object to Commerce\u2019s refusal to grantalevel-of-trade (\u201cLOT\u201d) adjustment or CEP offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">1. <em>Commerce\u2019s Decision to Base MHI\u2019s U.S. Price on CEP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The antidumping statute defines EP as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) before the date of importation by the producer or exporter of the subject merchandise outside of the United States to an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States or to an unaffiliated purchaser for exportation to the United States * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a) (1994). Constructed export price is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) in the United States before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">When U.S. price is based on CEI&gt; Commerce bases its calculations on the price charged to the first unaffiliated purchaser. This is the starting price. Commerce then makes certain adjustments including several that are not required for EP sales. The CEP adjustments \u201care made for certain amounts associated with the sale of merchandise in the United States, typically, commissions for sellingthe merchandise * * * and sales expenses generally incurred in selling the same type of merchandise in the United States.\u201d <em>PQ Corp. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 53, 59, 652 F. Supp. 724, 730 (1987). The purpose of these adjustments is to prevent foreign producers from competing unfairly in the United States market \u201cby spending amounts on marketing and selling their products that are in excess of what they spend in their home markets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the Statement of Administrative Action to the URAA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cconstructed export price is * * * calculated to be, as closely as possible, a price corresponding to an export price between non-affiliated exporters and importers.\u201d H.R. Doc. No, 103-316 at 823 (1994) (\u201cSAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">The statute does not specify the circumstances under which Commerce is to choose EP or CEE However, according to the SAA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">[i]f the first sale to an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States, or to an unaffiliated purchaser for export to the United States, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>made by the producer or exporter in the home market prior to the date of importation, then Commerce will base its calculation on export price. If, before or after the time of importation, the first sale to an unaffiliated person is made by (or for the account of) the producer or exporter or by a seller in the United States who is affiliated with the producer or exporter, then Commerce will base its calculation on constructed export price * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><em>Id. </em>at 822-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Thus, a sale to an unaffiliated party made prior to importation and involving an importer affiliated with the producer or exporter could be either an EP or a CEP sale. In such a situation, \u201cthe determination of whether [EP] or [CEP] applies must be based upon additional circumstances.\u201d <em>PQ Corp. </em>at 60, 652 F. Supp. at 731. In <em>Certain Stainless Steel Wire Rods from France, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 68,865 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1993) (final det.), Commerce described the additional criteria it examines in deciding whether to use an EP or CEP methodology as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">The first criterion is that the merchandise in question is shipped directly from the manufacturer to the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory of the related selling agent. The second criterion is that this arrangement is the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandise between the parties involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">The third criterion is that the related selling agent located in the United States acts only as a processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link with the unrelated U.S. buyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 68,868-69. Commerce will apply the EP methodology only if all three criteria apply to the sales at issue. <em>Id. </em>This test has been approved by this court. <em>See Independent Radionic Workers v. United States, </em>19 CIT 375, 375 (1995)(describing Commerce\u2019s three criteria as \u201cthe judicially approved test\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">At oral argument, counsel for MHI argued that Commerce\u2019s three-part test is incomplete because it does not focus on the key statutory distinction between EP and CEE</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The statute describes EP as \u201cthe price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) before the date of importation by the producer or exporter of the subject merchandise <em>outside of the United States </em>to an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States * * *.\u201d19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a)(emphasis added). CEP is described as the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) <em>in the United States </em>* * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b)(emphasis added). The inside/ outside distinction between the two sections is critical, counsel argued, and therefore, Commerce\u2019s analysis must focus on the nature of the activities performed by MHI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary to determine whether the sales at issue occurred in the United States or in Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Commerce\u2019s three-part test was created before the enactment of the URAA. Under the pre-URAA version of the statute, purchase price (now EP) was described as follows: \u201cthe price at which merchandise is pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>chased, or agreed to be purchased, prior to the date of importation, from a reseller or the manufacturer or producer of the merchandise for exportation to the United States. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b) (1988). Exporter\u2019s sales price (now CEP) was described as, \u201cthe price at which merchandise is sold or agreed to be sold in the United States, before or after the time of importation, by or for the account of the exporter * * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c) (1988). In distinguishingbetween purchase price and exporter\u2019s sales price sales, courts focused on the relationship between the foreign exporter and the importer rather than the date of sale. <em>See Smith-Corona Group v. United States, </em>1 Fed. Cir. (T) 130, 132-33, 713 F. 2d 1568, 1572 (1983) (\u201cWhere the importer is an unrelated, independent party, purchase price is used * * *. Where the importer is related, an arm\u2019s length transaction does not occur until the goods are resold to a retailer or to the public. In that case, \u2018exporter\u2019s sales price\u2019 is used.\u201d). Commerce refined that distinction decidingthat in cases in which all the criteria in its three-part test were met, a sale through a related U.S. importer would be considered a purchase price transaction. <em>See E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 1266, 1281, 841 F. Supp. 1237, 1249 (1993) (\u201c[S]ales to a related importer in the United States are usually exporter\u2019s sales price transactions. However, * * * when a sale to a related importer meets the additional criteria * * * it will be treated as a purchase price transaction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The purchase price and exporter\u2019s sales price provisions were changed by the URAA. The change most relevant to this issue, was the addition of the phrase, \u201coutside of the United States,\u201d to the definition of EP (purchase price). However, that phrase follows the words, \u201cby the producer or exporter of the subject merchandise.\u201d Therefore, it is not clear whether the phrase is meant to describe the location of the sale, or the location of the producer or exporter. Thus, the Court finds that the meaning of the phrase \u201coutside of the United States,\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In the face of this ambiguity, the Court will defer to Commerce\u2019s interpretation if that interpretation is reasonable. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984) (\u201c[I] f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d); <em>Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>36 F. 3d 1565, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (\u201c [A] court must defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute even if the court might have preferred another.\u201d). In determining whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, the Court considers, among other factors, the express terms of the provisions at issue, the objectives of those provisions and the objectives of the antidumping scheme as a whole. In this case, the change in the language is also a significant factor. However, the implications of that change are not clear enough to convince the Court that Commerce\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">While the change in language may weigh against Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the U.S. price provisions other factors support Commerce\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>interpretation. The test Commerce relied on is longstanding and has been approved by this court. <em>Independent Radionic Workers, </em>19 CIT at 375. Furthermore, the test reflects the courts\u2019 understanding that the key distinction between EP and CEP is the relationship between the exporter and the importer. Specifically, the three-part test eliminates from the CEP category those sales in which the role of the related U.S. importer is so minor, that the sales are, in reality, transactions between the foreign exporter and the unrelated U.S. purchaser. Finally, Commerce\u2019s decision to continue to rely on the three-part test is supported by the SAA, which states that \u201cno change is intended in the circumstances under which export price (formerly \u2018purchase price\u2019) versus constructed export price (formerly \u2018exporters sales price\u2019) are used.\u201d SAA at 822-23. Here Commerce relied on a longstanding, judicially approved test that is consistent with the express terms of the statute. Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the statute was also supported by the SAA. Thus, Commerce\u2019s actions were in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Commerce applied its three-part test, relying on the third criterion in its decision to base U.S. price on CEE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">[W]e reclassified all MHI sales as CEP/FM sales because MHI\u2019s affiliated U.S. sales agent acted as more than a processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link with the unaffiliated U.S. customers. The U.S. affiliate engaged in a broad range of activities including purchasing parts, warranty, technical services, and the coordination of installation, which we have classified as further manufacturing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Japan Final, 61 Fed. Reg. at 38,141.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">MHI argues that the activities undertaken by its U.S. affiliate could not justify Commerce\u2019s decision to rely on CEP rather than EE \u201c[The statute] contemplates using CEP not where U.S. selling activities are extensive but where an affiliate\u2019s selling activities <em>exceed </em>or <em>displace </em>those \u2018routine selling functions\u2019 an exporter would employ to make a direct sale.\u201d Brief PI. MHI Reply Def s and Goss Graphic Systems, Inc.\u2019s Response Briefs Comp, and Country-Specific Issues at 1 (\u201cMHI Reply Brief\u201d) (citing <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 1266, 1282, 841 F. Supp. 1237, 1250 (1993)) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">However, as Commerce explained, where all the criteria in the three-part test are met,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">the Department has regarded the routine selling functions of the exporter as \u201cmerely having been relocated geographically from the country of exportation to the United States,\u201d * * *. [W]here the functions are performed \u201cdoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Germany Final at 38,175 (citing <em>Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan, </em>53 Fed. Reg. 12,552 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1988) (final det.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">In this case, Commerce stated, \u201cwe believe that the various activities of MHI\u2019s subsidiary MLP were substantially more than \u2018routine selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>functions.\u201d\u2019 Germany Final at 38,176. Specifically, Commerce said, MLP was involved in the following areas: selling agency, after-sales servicing, sourcing of non-subject parts, and supervision of installation. \u201cAs MHI\u2019s principal sales agent in the United States, MLP was directly responsible for identification of Piedmont as a buyer, and cooperated with Sumitomo in the delegation of oversight for the Guard sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>MLP also incurred warranty expenses for at least one sale and supervised installation through the work of its engineers for both sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Commerce has provided substantial evidence demonstrating that MLP did in fact carry out the activities listed. MHI\u2019s response to Commerce\u2019s supplemental questionnaire of Dec. 8,1995 describes MLP\u2019s activities as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\"><em>Piedmont: </em>MLP identified the customer and served as a communications link between the customer and MHI. MLP was importer of record for this sale. MLP provided two engineers during installation of the press who assisted the MHI installation supervisors. MLP arranged for the purchase of the U.S. auxiliary parts required by the contract under the instruction and supervision of MHI. MLP personnel provided some of the technical services required by the Piedmont contract * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\"><em>Guard: </em>* * *. MLP was responsible for arranging for the installation of the press, and supplied two engineers to assist the MHI installation supervisors in the installation of the press. MLP arranged for the purchase of the U.S. auxiliary parts required by the contract under the instruction and supervision of MHI. MLP personnel provided warranty assistance * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Response of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. to Dec. 8, 1995 Anti-dumping Supp. QR., Jan. 18,1996 (N-P Doc. 115) at A-36. These activities went beyond the provision of \u201csales-related documentation\u201d and communications with U.S. customers. They are, therefore, in excess of the routine selling functions an exporter would employ to make a direct sale. Thus, the Court finds Commerce appropriately treated MHI\u2019s sales as CEP sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">2. <em>Further Manufacturing by MHI</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUf\">In calculatingMHI\u2019s U.S. price, Commerce treated MHI\u2019s installation of the subject merchandise as part of further manufacturing \u201cbecause the U.S. installation process involves extensive technical activities on the part of engineers and installation supervisors and the integration of subject and integral, non-subject merchandise necessary for the operation ofLNPPs.\u201d Germany Final at 38,177.Accordingto the statute, CEP is to be reduced by, \u201cthe cost of any further manufacture or assembly (including additional material and labor) * * *\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">MHI maintains that installation expenses should have been treated as movement-related expenses, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A), which requires Commerce to reduce EP and CEP by \u201cthe amount, if any, included in such price, attributable to any additional costs, charges, or expenses * * * which are incident to bringing the subject merchandise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>from the original place of shipment in the exporting country to the place of delivery in the United States * *</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The distinction is significant because Commerce calculates movement-related expenses without imputed profit. Further manufacturing costs, on the other hand, include an imputed profit attributable to the value added by the further manufacturing activities. <em>See </em>Mem. PI. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. Support Mot. J. Agency R. Comp.-Specific Issues at 13 (\u201cMHI brief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">MHI argues that prior to the URAA, the statute only permitted Commerce to deduct \u201cany increased value, including additional material and labor, resulting from a process of manufacture or assembly performed on the imported merchandise <em>after the importation of the merchandise and before its sale </em>* * <em>Id. </em>(citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(e)(3) (1988)). The current statute does not specify a time period within which the further manufacture or assembly must take place. However, MHI argues, \u201cCongress made it clear, * * * that the new provision \u2018is not intended to effect any substantive change in the deduction made under the current statute for value added from processing or assembly in the United States\u2019 * * *.\u201dMHIBriefat 13-14(quotingtheSAAat824).Becausetheassem-bly activities at issue here took place after the sale, MHI argues, they cannot be deducted as further manufacturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The Court does not agree. As MHI recognizes, the statute governing the instant investigation does not include any temporal restriction in the definition of further manufacturing. Furthermore, even before the URAA took effect, Commerce treated activities occurring after the relevant sales as further manufacturing in certain cases. For example, in <em>Certain Small Business Telephone Systems and Subassemblies Thereof from Korea, </em>54 Fed. Reg. 53,141, 53,151 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1989)(final <em>det,)(\u201cSBTS\u201d) </em>the respondent argued specifically that installation occurred after the sale and therefore, could not be considered as value added. Commerce disagreed, explaining, \u201c[wjhether this value is added before or after the sale is irrelevant because, for this product, [respondent\u2019s] customers expect the installed system to have the characteristics added by the non-subject merchandise.\u201d <em>SBTS </em>at 53,151. The physical further manufacturing may have occurred after the sale, but the value added by that further manufacturing was reflected in the sale price of the merchandise. For this reason, SBTS was in accordance with the prior statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Commerce relied on the same reasoning in this case. \u201c\u2018Whether * * * value is added before or after the sale is irrelevant because, * * * customers expect the installed system to have the characteristics added by the non-subject merchandise.\u2019\u201d Germany final at 38,178 <em>(quotingSBTS </em>at 53,151.) Commerce\u2019s explanation is reasonable. LNPPs are custom made to order. Therefore, MHI\u2019s installation activities, including the addition of non-subject merchandise would all be included in the sales price of the LNPP agreed upon prior to importation. Furthermore, Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the statute has not changed from its pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>URAA interpretation. Therefore, Commerce\u2019s actions were consistent with the interpretation of the statute articulated in the SAA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">MHI also argues that Commerce\u2019s decision was inconsistent with well-established agency practice. \u201c[Commerce] has consistently acknowledged in the past that installation expenses incurred due to the need to move large industrial equipment from a manufacturing facility to the customer\u2019s site are movement-related expenses and should be treated as such in the dumping calculation.\u201d MHI brief at 14-15. Here, MHI asserts, \u201cMHI\u2019s undisputed evidence showed that it manufactured LNPP components in Japan, assembled them there, tested them, then disassembled them for shipment to the United States * * <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In support of its argument that Commerce typically treats the costs of installing large industrial equipment as movement-related, MHI cites <em>Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan, </em>55 Fed. Reg. 335 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1990)(final det.). In that case, Commerce treated installation expenses as movement charges, explaining,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">we have determined that these expenses should be treated as movement charges. Due to their large size, it is necessary to disassemble MTPs [mechanical transfer presses] for shipment and delivery to the customer\u2019s facilities. Upon delivery to the customer\u2019s premises, the presses must be reassembled (installed) in order to function. Because disassembly and reassembly are necessary to deliver the merchandise, we have determined that installation and related supervision expenses are movement charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">However, in other cases, particularly those in which assembly included the addition of non-subject merchandise, Commerce has treated assembly costs as further manufacturing. In <em>Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan, </em>Commerce concluded that operations performed in the United States, including: \u201c(1) Securing of certain options * * * to the units for shipment to customers, (2) attachment of lights, alarms, and hydraulic valves, and (3) swapping of [parts]\u201d constituted further manufacture. 53 Fed. Reg. 12,552, 12,565 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1988) (final det.). Similarly, in <em>SBTS, </em>Commerce treated the costs of integrating non-subject subassemblies with subject subassemblies and installation as further manufacturing. <em>See Id. </em>at 53,150. Based on the determinations cited above, the Court finds that Commerce has not established a consistent practice of treating installa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tion costs as movement-related expenses. In the case now before the Court, Commerce stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">the Department has not applied a blanket rule on the treatment of installation expenses, sometimes treatingthem as assembly costs, a circumstance of sale adjustment or shipment expenses, depending on the particular circumstances involved. Where those circumstances include the incorporation of integral, non-subject components during installation or complex installation operations that are more than mere reassembly, the precedent clearly supports treatment of installation expenses as further manufacturing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Germany Final at 38,177. Commerce distinguished the instant case from that in <em>MTPs, </em>explaining that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">[i]n the investigation of <em>MTPs from Japan </em>* * * the Department treated installation expenses as a portion of shipment expenses, because installation consisted primarily of the reassembly of parts originally disassembled at the manufacturers domestic plant. The items added in the United States were accessories which were not integral to the functioning of the press.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Preliminary Concurrence Mem. at 14 (N-P Doc. 152). In the case of LNPPs, on the other hand, Commerce found that \u201cthe respondents\u2019 U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 roles in the sale, installation and servicing of LNPPs, and their supervision of the incorporation of integral, non-subject components during installation, constitute a process that is more than mere reassembly.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Germany Final at 38,177.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Commerce\u2019s decision was consistent with the statute and did not violate any longstanding agency policy. Therefore, the Court finds Commerce\u2019s action to be in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">3. <em>Allocation of General and Administrative Expenses for MHI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In calculating the cost of MHI\u2019s further manufacture or assembly in the United States, Commerce allocated a portion of MLP\u2019s total general and administrative costs (\u201cG&amp;A\u201d) to the cost of installing the LNPPs. Commerce allocated the G&amp;A expenses by calculating MLP\u2019s total cost of goods sold (\u201cCGS\u201d) for both LNPP and commercial press operations and then allocating the G&amp;A costs to MLP\u2019s LNPP installation costs based on the percentage of CGS attributable to MLP\u2019s LNPP operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Although MHI acknowledges that Commerce usually allocates G&amp;A expenses based on CGS, in this case, MHI argues, Commerce\u2019s methodology overstated the amount of MLP\u2019s G&amp;A expenses attributable to its LNPP installation. Specifically, MHI argues, it submitted substantial evidence to demonstrate that \u201c[w]hile the resources devoted to the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of LNPPs are small compared to commercial presses, the relative cost of LNPPs is large, thus distorting any methodology based on CGS.\u201d MHI Brief at 20. For these reasons, MHI maintains, Commerce should have used a headcount methodology to allocate MLP\u2019s G&amp;A costs. In other words, MHI is arguing that Commerce should have based its G&amp;A allocation on the relative number of personnel involved in MLP\u2019s LNPP operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">MHI is not arguingthat, as a general rule, Commerce\u2019s CGS methodology is inconsistent with the statute. The issue here is whether, as a factual matter, Commerce\u2019s methodology distorted its calculation ofMLP\u2019s LNPP installation costs. In addressing factual issues, \u201c [the court\u2019s] role is limited to deciding whether the Commission\u2019s decision is \u2018unsupported by substantial evidence on the record * * *.\u2019\u201d <em>Matusushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. United States, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) 44, 54, 750 F.2d 927, 936 (1984). In other words, the court must determine whether the record contains \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support [Commerce\u2019s] conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951)(quoted in <em>Matsushita, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) at 51, 750 F.2d at 933).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Here, Commerce explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">[o]ur methodology recognizes the fact that the G&amp;A expense category consists of a wide range of different types of costs which are so unrelated or indirectly related to the immediate production process that any allocation based on a single factor (e.g., headcount) is purely speculative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Japan Final, 61 Fed. Reg. at 38,149.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In verifying the information submitted by MHI, including information regarding the range of activities undertaken by MLR Commerce found substantial evidence demonstrating that for LNPPs, as well as commercial presses, MLP \u201csells, installs and services\u201d the presses, purchases certain components in the United States and installs the press at the customer\u2019s plant. Verification of Constructed Value Data at 36. That MHI \u201ccan point to evidence of record which detracts from * * * [Commerce\u2019s] decision and can hypothesize a reasonable basis for a contrary determination is neither surprising nor persuasive. \u201d <em>Matsushita, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) at 54, 750 F. 2d at 936. Commerce provided evidence demonstrating that a wide range of functions are performed for both commercial presses and LNPR and that these functions require a wide range of costs, beyond personnel. Therefore, Commerce\u2019s decision to allocate G&amp;A expenses based on a CGS rather than a headcount methodology was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">4. <em>Indirect Selling Expenses Incurred in Japan for MHI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The CEP provision requires that Commerce reduce the price of the first sale to an unaffiliated customer in the United States by the amount of selling expenses \u201cincurred by or for the account of the producer or ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>porter, or the affiliated seller in the United States, in selling the subject merchandise * * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(l). Indirect selling expenses are a component of selling expenses. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(l)(D) (requiring that Commerce deduct from CEP any selling expenses not deducted as commissions or direct selling expenses). As part of indirect selling expenses, Commerce included expenses incurred in Japan to support U.S. sales. MHI argues that Commerce should have deducted only those indirect selling expenses incurred by MLP in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The CEP methodology is intended to determine a U.S. price \u201ccalculated to be, as closely as possible, a price corresponding to an export price between non-affiliated exporters and importers.\u201d MHIbriefat21 (quoting SAA at 823). \u201cAccordingly, when ITA makes its CEP adjustments to U.S. price, its objective is to identify indirect selling expenses that would not exist in an EP sale and deduct those expenses * * <em>Id. </em>at 22. MHI contends that Commerce should not have deducted expenses incurred by MHI in Japan \u201cfor * * * activities that were fully consistent with an EP transaction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">However, once Commerce has decided to rely on CER the statute does not require that Commerce examine every potential CEP deduction to determine whether the activity generating the expense would be inconsistent with an EP transaction. The statute contains a list of mandatory deductions, which includes selling expenses incurred in selling the subject merchandise. The statute does not specify as to the location of the activities generatingthese expenses. Here, Commerce deducted all indirect selling expenses related to respondents\u2019 United States sales. This decisi\u00f3n was consistent with the statutory CEP provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">MHI makes a second argument, that the SAA specifically limits CEP deductions to \u201cexpenses (and profit) associated with economic activities occurring in the United States.\u201d SAA at 823. MHI interprets this provision to require that the activities generatingthe deducted costs must occur in the United States. However, MHI\u2019s reading is too narrow. Expenses incurred outside of the United States could still be \u201cassociated with\u201d economic activities occurring in the United States. Commerce\u2019s approach limited the deductions to those indirect selling expenses \u201cdirectly associated\u201d with U.S. economic activity. Germany Final at 38,174. Thus, Commerce\u2019s application of the statute was limited enough to be consistent with the interpretation of the statute articulated in the SAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The petitioner, Goss, objects to Commerce\u2019s allocation of respondents\u2019 indirect selling expenses incurred in Japan and Germany, arguing that \u201cCommerce undervalued these expenses by deducting only that portion of the indirect selling expenses attributable to U.S. sales when calculating the CEE\u201d Brief Support Goss Graphic Systems, Inc.

However, the court added, \u201cfailure to reopen a determination which is known to be based on erroneous factual information that would clearly mandate a change in result would itselfbe arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Id. at 683, 746 F.

Commerce erred by deducting certain expenses that were not so associated. Therefore, the Court will remand this issue, pursuant to Commerce\u2019s request, in order that Commerce may correct its error. Upon remand, Commerce will evaluate whether its allocation methodology either understates or overstates respondent\u2019s indirect selling costs. Commerce must also respond to TKS\u2019s argument that Commerce overstated its indirect selling expenses in the same way it overstated MHI\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\n<em>5. The CEP Offset for MHI and TKS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">MHI and TKS both contend that they were entitled to a CEP offset, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">When normal value is established at a level of trade which constitutes a more advanced stage of distribution than the level of trade of the constructed export price, but the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine * * * a level of trade adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Commerce declined to grant the adjustment because, \u201c[i]n this instant investigation, the respondents failed to provide the Department with the necessary data for the Department to consider an LOT [level-of-trade] adjustment * * *. Absent this information, the Department cannot determine whether an LOT adjustment is warranted, nor whether the level of trade in the home market is injact further removed than the level of trade in the United States.\u201d Japan Final at 38,143.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">As the SAA makes clear, \u201cif a respondent claims an adjustment to decrease normal value, as with all adjustments which benefit a responding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>firm, the respondent must demonstrate the appropriateness of such adjustment.\u201d SAA at 829. In this case, Commerce concluded that neither TKS nor MHI had provided sufficient information to demonstrate the appropriateness of the CEP offset. Specifically, Commerce said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">[respondents now contend that there is one home market level of trade to which CEP is being compared, but this claim is not well substantiated. The information we have on the record for sales in the home market does not support this conclusion. * * *. For neither TKS nor MHI can we ascertain which selling functions are performed by them and which are provided by leasing companies, trading companies or other entities for each type of home market sale. Thus the minimal amount of information provided does not support the conclusions reached by respondents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Japan Final, 61 Fed. Reg. at 38,143.</p>\n<p id=\"AL7\">Commerce\u2019s conclusion was based upon substantial evidence. <em>See </em>MHIQRResponseatA-17toA-22 (describing only in general terms the functions of MHI and its affiliated and non-affiliated trading companies inMHI\u2019s home-market sales). For TKS see TKS QR Response (N-P Doc. 39) at A-30 (failing to explain role of leasing company discovered at verification to have been involved in at least one TKS home-market sale). <em>See also </em>TKS Verification Report (N-P Doc. 191) at 18) (\u201cFor this sale * * * the original customer * * * requested that its purchase be transferred to a leasing company, * * * which resulted in the issuing of a new purchase order * * *.\u201d). In the absence of sufficient information, Commerce\u2019s refusal to grant either an adjustment or a CEP offset was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">MHI also complains that \u201c[n]ot once in the investigation did ITA advise MHI that it believed MHI\u2019s filings to be deficient\u201d in establishing MHI\u2019s right to a CEP offset. MHI Brief at 26-27. However, Commerce had no obligation to give MHI such a warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In its Section A questionnaire, Commerce explicitly requested all information relevant to a LOT analysis. Specifically, Commerce explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">[t]he description you provide of your channels of distribution and sales process * * * is intended to provide the Department with the information necessary to make appropriate comparisons of sales at the same level of trade or to adjust normal value, if appropriate, when sales are compared at different levels of trade.

Thus, Commerce gave MHI ample opportunity to present such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">TKS argues that it did not claim a level of trade adjustment until the final stage of the investigation because Commerce did not decide to deduct Japan-based indirect selling expenses until after it issued its pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>liminary determination. Mem. PI. Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd. Support Mot. J. Agency R.

As with MHI, however, TKS had ample opportunity to provide Commerce with level of trade information. In the absence of such information, Commerce was justified in refusing to grant either a level of trade adjustment or CEP offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">II. Imputed Credit Expense</p>\n<p id=\"AbC\">1. <em>Imputed Credit Prior to Shipment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In calculating both normal value and U.S. price, Commerce made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for credit expenses incurred during production of the subject merchandise, prior to shipment, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Commerce\u2019s usual imputed credit calculation is based only on the cost of financing receivables between shipment date and payment date. Germany Final at 38,187.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">MHI concurs in the argument presented by MAN Roland,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a respondent in Commerce\u2019s Germany investigation, that Commerce\u2019s adjustment for pre-shipment credit expense is \u201cflatly inconsistent with the Department\u2019s past decisions regardingthe types of items for which a circumstance-of-sale adjustment can be made,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n past cases, the Department has specifically held that a circumstance-of-sale adjustment cannot be made for production costs.\u201d MAN Roland Brief at 11-12.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Furthermore, Man Roland argues, \u201cit is fundamentally illogical to treat the imputed cost of financing production as a selling expense, or as part of the adjustment for credit expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. The credit expense, MAN Roland argues \u201cis simply a tool for measuring the effect of * * * payment terms on the real economic price paid by the customer * * * if MAN Roland allows its customers to pay later, the economic value of the payment it receives is less.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The imputed cost of financing production, MAN Roland argues, \u201chas no effect on the price paid by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>customer. Rather, it depends on MAN Roland\u2019s internal production scheduling decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The statute requires that constructed value be \u201cincreased or decreased by the amount of any difference * * * between the [U.S. price] and [constructed value] * * * that is established to the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or partly due to * * * differences in circumstances of sale.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b. The statute does not define the term circumstance of sale. Thus, Commerce has broad discretion in determining what constitutes a circumstance of sale. <em>See Sawhill Tubular Div. Cyclops Corp. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 491, 497, 666 F. Supp. 1550, 1555 (1987) (\u201cIt is * * * clear that Congress has deferred to the expertise of the agency and vested broad discretion in it to make adjustments for the differences in the circumstances of sale ***.\u201d). That discretion, however, is limited. \u201cOne recognized limitation upon this power is that adjustment be made for those factors and conditions which have a direct bearing on or relationship to the sales under consideration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In the final determination, Commerce explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">We believe that it is appropriate in this instance to recognize the comprehensive financing arrangement for each sale as a circumstance of sale adjustment. LNPPs require substantial capital expenditures over an extended time period because of their size and lengthy production process * * *. Moreover, the projects generally call for the purchaser to provide scheduled progress payments before completion of a project. Our normal imputed credit calculation * * * does not measure the effect of progress payments made relative to production costs incurred. To adjust sales prices for the effect of the respondent incurring significant capital outlays at the beginning of a project* * * or receiving large sums of money up front* * * we calculated imputed credit for each home market and U.S. sale</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">61 Fed. Reg. at 38,187. Commerce calculated imputed interest by subtracting progress payments from capital outlays made during the construction period and then multiplying the balance by the applicable interest rate. See Mem. Re: Constructed Value, Further Manufacturing and Constructed Export Price Adjustments for Final Det., N-P Doc. 107 at 4. Commerce\u2019s treatment of the imputed interest as a circumstance of sale allowed it to fully recognize the complexity of the financing arrangements at issue here. Given that construction on a single sale in this case may take several years to complete, as well as the fact that financing arrangements may vary widely from sale to sale, the Court finds Commerce\u2019s decision to treat the imputed interest expenses as a circumstance of sale was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">MAN Roland argues that Commerce\u2019s actions here were inconsistent with its actions in <em>Zenith Elec. Corp. v. United </em>States, 18 CIT 870 (1994). In <em>Zenith, </em>Commerce made a circumstance of sale adjustment for respondent\u2019s imputed credit expense. However, Commerce refused to off<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>set the imputed credit expense \u2014 based on \u201cthe average duration of accounts receivable,\u201d \u2014 by \u201cthe average duration of accounts payable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 875. Commerce explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">by allowing the customer a period of time to pay, the seller effectively reduces the sales price of the merchandise because of the time value of money * * *. To the extent that a manufacturer can delay payingits suppliers, the cost of materials is reduced by the time value of money, resulting in a saving in the cost of production. Since accounts payable are, thus, production costs, they cannot result in a circumstance-of-sale adjustment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 875, n.8. Commerce explained further, that it could not treat accounts payable as a circumstance of sale adjustment because doing so \u201cwould require us to adjust for factors relating to cost of production, which are unrelated to the <em>sales </em>at issue. \u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, unlike <em>Zenith, </em>Commerce made the imputed interest adjustment to compensate for different payment schedules by customers to respondent. Thus, the adjustment was directly related to the sales at issue and appropriately treated as a circumstance of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">2. <em>The currency of the imputed credit expense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Even if the Court finds Commerce\u2019s pre-shipment imputed credit adjustment to be appropriate, MHI argues, Commerce erred in using a dollar-denominated interest rate for financing production of presses for U.S. customers and a yen-denominated rate for home market presses.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">According to MHI,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">[a]ny production financing costs incurred by MHI, however, did not vary based on the nationality of the customer or the currency in which a particular contract was denominated. Indeed there is <em>no </em>evidence on the record that MHI borrowed more expensive dollars to finance production of presses just because those presses were destined to U.S. customers, nor would such an assumption make commercial sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">MHI Brief at 31. For this reason, MHI argues, Commerce\u2019s action violated \u201cthe clear instruction of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit that credit expenses must be \u2018imputed on the basis of usual and reasonable commercial behavior.\u2019\u201d MHI Brief at 31 n.107 <em>(citing LMI-LaMetalli Industriale, S.p.A. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 157, 163, 912 F. 2d 455, 461 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">MHI makes a similar argument with regard to Commerce\u2019s use of a U.S. dollar interest rate to calculate MHI\u2019s imputed credit expense incurred after shipment but before payment. MHI relies on <em>LMI </em>for the proposition that \u201cwhere a foreign seller has access to financing at a low interest rate, and there is evidence that the seller can take advantage of that less expensive financing, it is unreasonable to base imputed credit expense on some other higher interest rate.\u201d MHI Brief at 32. Here, MHI argues, the U.S. interest rate was significantly higher than the corresponding yen-denominated interest rate. \u201cAccordingly, it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>made no commercial sense for MHI to finance its receivables in more expensive dollars, and the record shows that MHI did not engage in such conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">MHI\u2019s reliance upon <em>LMI </em>is misplaced. In <em>LMI, </em>as in cases decided prior to <em>LMI, </em>Commerce based imputed credit on the respondent\u2019s actual cost of borrowing, or in the absence of actual borrowing, respondent\u2019s theoretical cost of borrowing. The <em>LMI </em>court held that the theoretical cost of borrowingmust be based on commercial reality. Commerce\u2019s current practice, however does not focus on the cost of borrowing, but on the currency in which the sale is denominated. As Commerce explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">A company selling in a given currency * * * is effectively lending to its purchasers in the currency in which its receivables are denominated * * *. Thus, when sales are made in, and future payments are expected in, a given currency, the measure of the company\u2019s extension of credit should be based on an interest rate tied to the currency in which its receivables are denominated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Japan Final at 38,160 (citing <em>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Austria, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 33,551, 33,555 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1995) (final det.).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The circumstance of sale provision does not specify the currency in which imputed credit expenses are to be calculated. Thus, the Court will defer to Commerce\u2019s permissible interpretation of the statute. Here, the Court finds, Commerce\u2019s interpretation was reasonable. \u201cThe imputation of credit cost is based on the principle of the time value of money.\u201d <em>LMI </em>at 460. Commerce\u2019s decision that imputed credit should reflect the time value of the currency in which the transaction is actually carried out was reasonable, as it reflects the actual benefit to the buyer and the loss to the seller that results from delaying payment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">3. <em>Deduction of Imputed Credit Expenses from Normal Value</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">In addition to deducting imputed credit expense from United States price, Commerce adjusted normal value by deducting an amount for imputed credit. Petitioner objects to this deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">In the underlying investigation, Commerce based normal value on constructed value (\u201cCV\u201d)pursuant to its authority under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(4)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>. Goss argued that Commerce should have added an amount for imputed credit expense to respondents\u2019 CV Only then, Goss argued, would the imputed credit deduction have been appropriate. Japan Final at 38,147. However, Commerce explained, the statute requires that Commerce \u201cinclude in CV the actual amount of SG&amp;A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>expenses * * * incurred by the exporter or producer. Imputed credit is, by its nature, not an actual expense. Therefore, we did not include imputed credit in the CV calculation for the final determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38,147.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Goss now argues, \u201c [t]he constructed value is based on the actual costs of production that, by their nature, cannot include an imputed credit expense. Therefore, adjusting [normal value] for an imputed credit expense defies common sense \u2014 there is no credit expense to deduct. \u201d Goss Brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In the final determination, Commerce did not specifically address the issue raised by Goss, whether normal value may be adjusted for an imputed credit expense when normal value is based on constructed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">According to the statute, a normal value that is based on constructed value is subject to the same adjustments as normal value based on home-market or third-country sales. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(8). One of these adjustments is the circumstance-of-sale adjustment. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(C). Commerce describes the imputed credit adjustment as a circumstance-of-sale adjustment. Germany Final at 38,187.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In its final calculation memorandum, Commerce explains that it adjusted both United States price and normal value for imputed credit. In its brief to this Court, Commerce explains that it subtracted imputed credit from both sides of the margin calculation in order that the two might be calculated on an equal, i.e. net-imputed-credit, basis. Def\u2019s Mem. Opp. Pis.\u2019 Mot. J. Admin. Rec. at 57 (\u201cCommerce brief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">However, Goss contends that normal value was on a net-imputed-credit basis prior to Commerce\u2019s adjustment. \u201cThe imputed credit cost in this case reflects differences in timing between receipt of payments and expenditures for production. Therefore, the constructed value cannot include imputed credit expenses \u2014 it is only the sum of actual costs and has no payment schedule associated with it.\u201d Goss Brief at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In its brief, Commerce explains that under the current statute, profit for constructed value is calculated based on respondents\u2019 actual profit amounts on home-market sales. \u201cBy using the actual profit, the CV reflects a foreign value unadjusted for imputed credit. \u201d Commerce brief at 57. In other words, Commerce is saying that when an actual profit is used, imputed credit is reflected in the profit amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">However, the Court cannot sustain Commerce\u2019s actions based on post hoc rationalizations by agency counsel. <em>See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State </em>Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983) (\u201c[T]he courts may not accept appellate counsel\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations for agency action. * * * It is well-established that an agency\u2019s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.\u201d) (citations omitted). Therefore, the Court is remanding so that Commerce may explain its decision on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>III. Constructed Value Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">Commerce based normal value on constructed value, reasoning that while home market sales of the foreign like product were \u201cviable\u201d (i.e., sufficient in volume), pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(C)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, the market situation was characterized by \u201c(1) a unique demand pattern prevalent in each national market; (2) unique technical specifications required for each highly customized LNPP sold; and (3) very low volume of individual LNPP sales in the normal business cycle. \u201d Commerce Brief at 14. Commerce\u2019s decision to rely on constructed value is not challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">1. <em>Computation ofSG&amp;A and Profit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In constructing the value of the subject merchandise, Commerce requested information from respondents regarding their selling, general and administrative costs (\u201cSG&amp;A\u201d) and profit for home market sales. Rather thanusingrespondents\u2019 reported profit margins, however, Commerce asked respondents to report contract price and production cost data for their home market sales of LNPPs. ITA Concurrence Mem.: Prelim. Det. \u2014 Antidumping Duty Investigation of LNPPs from Japan (N-P Doc. 152) at 9-10 (\u201cPreliminary Det. Concurrence Mem.\u201d). Commerce used this information to calculate SG&amp;A and profit amounts to be used for constructed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">A. Treatment of Below-Cost Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">According to Commerce, the cost data submitted by respondents \u201cindicated that there were below-cost sales made in the home market * * *.\u201d Japan Final at 38,145. In calculating profit and SG&amp;A expenses from the reported data, Commerce excluded such below-cost sales. MHI and TKS object to Commerce\u2019s exclusion of below-cost sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">MHI argues that Commerce had no authority to collect detailed cost information solely for its calculation ofSG&amp;A and profit amounts. \u201cThe scheme established by Congress was to have [Commerce] rely on sales-specific data <em>if it had been collected for some otherpurpose, </em>but otherwise to use respondents\u2019 financial reports or other available information.\u201d MHI Brief at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Typically, Commerce collects sales-specific cost data for home-market sales in cases in which normal value is based on home-market sales. According to the statute, \u201c[wjhenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production * * *, the administering authority shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of production. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l). The statute specifies that \u201c[t]here are reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>grounds to believe or suspect\u201d below-cost sales, if \u201can interested party * * * provides information, based upon observed prices or constructed prices or costs, that sales of the foreign like product * * * have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of the product * * *.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(2)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Although Commerce received a below-cost allegation from petitioners in this case, it did not formally initiate a cost investigation because it had decided to base normal value on constructed value rather than home-market sales. Japan Final at 38,144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">MHI argues that in the absence of a formal below-cost investigation, Commerce was obligated to use profit data provided by MHI from its financial statements. \u201cWhen Congress enacted the new profit-related provisions in 1994, it did not give ITA new authority to conduct cost investigations.\u201d MHI Brief at 34. In support of its position, MHI cites 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2) which provides that in calculating constructed value, Commerce shall use \u201cthe actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation * * * for selling, general and administrative expenses, and for profits, * * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(A), but that if such data \u201care not available,\u201d then Commerce is to rely on one of three alternatives. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B). Commerce relied on section 1677b(e)(2)(A) for calculating SG&amp;A using \u201cthe actual amounts incurred and realized.\u201d MHI argues that Commerce should have relied on one of the three alternatives. In essence, MHI is arguing that if cost data has not been collected for some other purpose, then it cannot be considered to be \u201cavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The Court finds MHI\u2019s interpretation of the statute to be overly narrow. The statute does not define the term \u201cavailable.\u201d Thus, the Court will defer to Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the term if it is reasonable. Here, Commerce reviewed MHI\u2019s questionnaire response and determined that a sufficient number of home-market transactions had occurred, that the company had cost information about those transactions in its records and that the company could provide such information to Commerce. Commerce decided that these facts in combination were sufficient to render the requisite information available.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Commerce\u2019s decision represents a reasonable application of the statute. The SAA states that the alternative methodologies established by section 1677b(e)(2) are to be used \u201cin those instances where the method described in section [1677b(e)(2)(A)] cannot be used, either because there are no home-market sales of the foreign like product or because <em>all </em>such sales are at below-cost prices.\u201d SAA at 840 (emphasis added). Commerce determined that neither of these circumstances existed here, and therefore, the information was available.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>TKS argues that Commerce\u2019s decision to conduct a \u201cdefacto\u201d cost test rather than initiating a formal below-cost investigation was inconsistent with the statutory requirement that Commerce have \u201creasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product * * * have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production * * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Rather than responding to Goss\u2019s below-cost allegation, TKS complains, Commerce elected to conduct a \u201cde facto\u201d cost test on home market sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\u201c[Commerce] has justified its <em>de facto </em>cost test by claiming that the home market price and cost data submitted by TKS showed below-cost sales, <em>viz., </em>provided reasonable grounds to suspect below-cost sales.\u201d TKS Brief at 11. Commerce\u2019s actions were unlawful, TKS argues, because Commerce\u2019s below-cost test was not based on reasonable suspicion as defined by the statute. Therefore, TKS argues, Commerce should not have excluded below-cost sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Like MHI, TKS reads the statute\u2019s requirements too narrowly. Commerce is to calculate SG&amp;A and profit for constructed value using only those sales of the foreign like product that were made <em>in the ordinary course of trade. </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(A). The statute defines sales and transactions considered outside the ordinary course of trade to include \u201camong others,\u201d sales disregarded under section 1677b(b)(l). 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Based on the sales data gathered by Commerce to calculate SG&amp;A and profit, Commerce determined that certain sales would have been ex-cludable under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l) had Commerce decided to base normal value on home-market sales and carry out a below-cost investigation. Commerce\u2019s decision to treat such sales as outside the ordinary course of trade, relying on the \u201camong others\u201d language of section 1677(15) was a reasonable application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Although the sales were not discovered in the type of investigation prescribed by section 1677b(b)(l), Commerce found that the sales did have the characteristics of a sale that would be excludable under 1677b(b)(l). Congress mandated that sales with those characteristics be treated as \u201coutside the ordinary course of trade\u201d for purposes of calculating normal value. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, it was reasonable for Commerce to treat such sales as outside the ordinary course of trade for purposes of calculating SG&amp;A and profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">MHI also argues that Commerce did not have the authority to disregard below-cost sales without formally initiating a cost investigation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">Formal cost investigations exist so that respondents have notice that information in a respondent\u2019s defense should be submitted to [Commerce] for consideration. In this case, because a cost investigation was never initiated, MHI was never on notice that it should provide data showing that it could recover its costs over time. By conducting an \u2018informal\u2019 cost investigation, ITA usurped a procedural protection afforded respondents under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>MHI Brief at 35. According to the statute, \u201c[i]f prices which are below the per unit cost of production at the time of sale are above the weighted average per unit cost of production for the period of investigation * * * such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(b)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">As explained above, Commerce was not required to initiate a formal below-cost sales investigation in order to exclude below-cost sales from its profit and SG&amp;A calculations. Commerce\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive MHI of any procedural protection. Commerce requested and received complete cost information for all home-market sales that took place during the investigation. Based on this information, Commerce determined that certain sales had been made at below-cost prices. Because Commerce treated each individual sale as a separate model,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Commerce knew that for any specific model, cost-recovery over time would not be possible. By definition, there was only one sale for each model. Therefore, Commerce reasonably determined that MHI would not be able to recover its costs on below-cost sales during the period of investigation, as the statute requires. No information provided by MHI could have altered this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">2. <em>The Model-Specific Cost Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l), below-cost sales maybe excluded only if they \u201chave been made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities,\u201d and \u201cwere not at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time * * *.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l)(A), (B). The statute also states that \u201c [s]ales made at prices below the cost of production have been made in substantial quantities if \u2014 (i) the volume of such sales represents 20 percent or more of the volume of sales under consideration for the determination of normal value * * *.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b (b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Commerce typically conducts the substantial quantities test on a model-specific basis. In other words, if below-cost sales represent 20 percent or more of the volume of sales of a specific model of subject merchandise, then those sales may be excluded. <em>See </em>SAA at 832 (\u201cAs under current practice, the cost test generally will be performed on no wider than a model-specific basis.\u201d). In accordance with its usual practice, Commerce carried out its below-cost test here on a model-specific basis. However, due to the \u201cunique nature of the products under investigation, [Commerce concluded] that each home market sale of an LNPP addition, or component constitutes a distinct model for purposes of performing the cost test,\u201d and calculated an individual normal value for each sale. Preliminary Det. Concurrence Mem. at 10. \u201cTherefore, where that single sale was made at less than the cost of production, the \u2018substantial quantities\u2019 requirement [was] necessarily met because that single be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>low-cost sale represented] 100 percent of the volume of sales considered in the determination of normal value.\u201d Commerce Brief at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">MHI and TKS contend that Commerce\u2019s actions were inconsistent with the statute. \u201cITA disregarded the \u2018substantial quantities\u2019 requirement of the Act by treating each sale as its own model, then applyingthe \u2018substantial quantities\u2019 test on a model-specific basis.\u201d MHI Brief at 36-37. Commerce\u2019s approach was \u201ccontrary to the Act because it resulted in the <em>automatic </em>exclusion of below-cost sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">TKS argues that Commerce\u2019s actions were inconsistent with the statutory requirement that \u201c [i]f prices which are below the per unit cost of production at the time of sale are above the weighted average unit cost of production for the period of investigation * * * such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.\u201d 19U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(2)(D).TKSarguesthatCommerce\u2019smethod presumed that for any below-cost LNPP sale, cost recovery would not occur, presumably because, by definition, there could never be more than one sale of the same model. TKS Brief at 15. In effect, TKS argues, ITA\u2019s model-specific methodology for the cost test resulted in the automatic exclusion of below-cost sales in every instance. \u201cThus, the methodology, in effect, nullified the substantial quantities and cost recovery criteria of section [1677b(b)(l)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The Court agrees with Commerce that the model-specific cost test represents a permissible application of the statute. Use of the model-specific cost test is part of Commerce\u2019s usual practice. Furthermore, it was sanctioned in the SAA. <em>See supra, </em>pg. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The use of the model-specific cost test in this case is consistent with both the statute and Congressional intent as expressed in the legislative history of the below-cost sales provision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">These standards would not require the disregarding of below-cost sales in every instance, for under normal business practice * * * it is frequently necessary to sell obsolete or end-of-model year merchandise at less than cost. Similarly, certain products, such as commercial aircraft, typically require large research and development costs which could not reasonably be recovered in the first year or two of sales. Thus, infrequent sales at less than cost, or sales at prices which will permit recovery of all costs based upon anticipated sales volume over a reasonable period of time would not be disregarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">S. Rep. No. 1298, 93d Cong., 2d Sess, 173 (1974) <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.C.C.A.N. 1974 at 7310-7311.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">LNPPs are custom-made to order. For that reason, obsolete or end-of-model year merchandise sales would be unlikely to occur. Furthermore, the merchandise at issue here is not similar to other large-ticket items such as commercial aircraft. Unlike commercial aircraft, for example, LNPPs are sold in limited numbers and built individually to the buyer\u2019s specifications. For these reasons, Commerce\u2019s determination that a producer would be unable to recover costs based upon future sales volume, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Case law also supports Commerce\u2019s actions here. In previous cases, this court has endorsed Commerce\u2019s discretion to tailor the provisions of 1677b(b)(l) to particular circumstances and classes of merchandise. For example, in <em>INA Walzlager Schaeffler KG v. United States, </em>915 F. Supp. 420 (CIT 1996), <em>aff'd </em>No. 96-1256, 96-1266 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 24, 1997), the court upheld Commerce\u2019s decision to make an exception to its usual \u201cextended period of time\u201d definition. The statute governing that case said that below-cost sales should be excluded if they had been made over an extended period of time. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l)(1988).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Commerce\u2019s usual practice had been to define an extended period of time as consisting of three months. <em>Ina Walzlager, </em>915 F. Supp. at 423. However in <em>Ina Walzlager, </em>Commerce had made an exception because certain models were sold in less than three months during the period of review. <em>Id. </em>Commerce explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">Occasionally, sales occur in less than three months of an investigation or review. This is not an expected normal pattern, but an exception from the pattern of sales for which the three month guideline was developed. If three months were defined as the extended period of time when such a pattern occurred, sales below cost would never be disregarded. This result does not reflect Congressional intent, unless the goods were obsolete or end of model year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 424 n.2. The court agreed with Commerce, that \u201cCommerce\u2019s interpretation of \u2018extended period of time,\u2019 in this particular proceeding, constituted a reasonable exercise of discretion in determining when to disregard below-cost sales * * <em>Id. </em>at 424. Similarly, the Court finds that model-specific cost test used in this case was a permissible application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Court also finds that Commerce\u2019s determination that each sale represented a separate model was supported by substantial evidence on the agency record. <em>See </em>Memo Re: Determining the Appropriate Basis for Normal Value, Nov. 9,1995 (N-P Doc. 73) at 3. (\u201cMany factors underlie the particular market situation in this investigation. Most important among these are: (1) the unique demand pattern prevalent in each national market; (2) the unique technical specifications required <em>for each highly customized product sold; </em>and (3) the very low volume of individual LNPP sales in the normal business cycle.\u201d) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Therefore, the Court sustains Commerce\u2019s decision with regard to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">3. <em>Foreign Like Product</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">As a further challenge to Commerce\u2019s constructed value calculation, MHI and TKS object to different aspects of Commerce\u2019s \u201cforeign like product\u201d determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>In calculating profit margins for constructed value, Commerce relied on 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(A), which states that CV profit is to be based upon \u201cthe actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer * * * in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product * * *.\u201d Foreign like product is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">(A) The subject merchandise and other merchandise which is identical in physical characteristics with, and was produced in the same country by the same person as, that merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">(B) Merchandise\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">(i) produced in the same country and by the same person as the subject merchandise,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">(ii) like that merchandise in component material or materials and in the purposes for which used, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">(iii) approximately equal in commercial value to that merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">(C) Merchandise\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">(i)produced in the same country and by the same person and of the same general class or kind as the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">(ii) like that merchandise in the purposes for which used, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">(iii) which the administering authority determines may reasonably be compared with that merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16). TKS contends that the findings thatled Commerce to rely on CV rather than home-market sales in calculating normal value constitute evidence that no foreign like product exists in the home market. Specifically, TKS cites Commerce\u2019s findings that the LNPP market is characterized by \u201c(1) [a] unique demand pattern * * * in each national market; (2) * * * unique technical specifications required for each highly customized product sold; and (3) * * * very low volume of individual LNPP sales in the normal business cycle. \u201d Mem. re: Determining the Appropriate Basis for Normal Value, Dep\u2019t Commerce, November 9,1995, Prop. Doc. 73 at 3. In the absence of an appropriate foreign like product, TKS argues Commerce should not have relied on 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(A) for calculating profit and SG&amp;A.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">In the Final Determination, Commerce argued that \u201cTKS is incorrect to suppose that because we did not find home market sales which provided practicable price-to-price matches, no foreign like product existed.

However, Commerce does not explain which of the three foreign like product definitions it relied upon in classifying LNPPs sold in the home market as foreign like product. Therefore, the Court is unable to evaluate whether or not Commerce\u2019s decision is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence, and must remand this issue so that Commerce may reconsider its determination. \u201c[T]he orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained.\u201d <em>SEC v.

However, MHI argues that it sold only LNPP systems in the United States and therefore, Commerce erred in basing CV profit and SG&amp;A on combined home-market sales of LNPP systems and LNPP components and additions. Accordingto MHI, the statute requires that constructed value shall include profit and SG&amp;A derived from information regarding \u201cthe production and sale of <em>a </em>foreign like product.\u201d Id.

There is nothing in the statute to require Commerce to calculate profit based on subsets of merchandise within the foreign like product. Therefore, Commerce\u2019s definition of foreign like product upon remand is not restricted to MHI\u2019s reading of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">4. <em>Sales with \u201cAbnormally High </em>Profits\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">MHI also argues that in calculating profit and SG&amp;A expenses, Commerce should have excluded certain sales, characterized by MHI as having \u201cabnormally high profits.\u201d In its final determination, Commerce explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">[w]e disagree with respondents that simply because certain home market sales had profits higher than those of numerous other sales, the profits are automatically abnormally high and outside the ordinary course of trade for purposes of computing CV profit. In order to determine that profits are abnormally high, there must be certain unique or unusual characteristics related to the sales in question. However, the respondents have provided no credible information other than the numerical profit amounts to support their contention that certain home market sales had abnormally high profits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Germany Final at 38,178.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">MHI argues that the SAA \u201cmade it clear, * * * that \u2018sales with abnormally high profits\u2019 should be considered outside the ordinary course of trade for purposes of the calculation of SG&amp;A and profit.\u201d MHI Brief at 37 (citing SAA at 839-40). In fact, the SAA says that Commerce should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>base SG&amp;A and profit on sales made in the ordinary course of trade, and that\"* * * examples of sales that Commerce <em>could </em>consider to be outside the ordinary course of trade include sales of off-quality merchandise, sales to related parties at non-arm\u2019s length prices, and sales with abnormally high profits.\u201d SAA at 839 (emphasis added). Thus, Congress granted Commerce discretion to decide under what circumstances highly profitable sales would be considered to be outside of the ordinary course of trade. Commerce\u2019s decision to require additional evidence before excluding such sales was a reasonable exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\">In order for Commerce to exclude sales found to have been made <em>below </em>the cost of production, the statute requires that Commerce provide additional evidence demonstrating that such sales were actually outside the ordinary course of trade. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l). Similarly, Commerce\u2019s decision to require additional evidence demonstratingthat sales with higher profits were outside of the ordinary course of trade was consistent with the statutory scheme and a reasonable construction of the provision at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">5. <em>Major Inputs from Affiliated Suppliers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In calculating constructed value, Commerce required MHI to identify all suppliers that provided inputs accounting for at least two percent of the total cost of materials, labor and overhead of any press component, or five percent or more of the total cost of materials, labor and overhead of a complete press system. Commerce also required information about MHI\u2019s commercial relationships with the suppliers identified and detailed cost of production data for the inputs received from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Based on the submitted data, Commerce concluded that certain of the suppliers were \u201caffiliated persons\u201d with MHI as defined at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33) and that these \u201caffiliated persons\u201d had supplied \u201cmajor inputs\u201d to MHI, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(3). Section 1677b(f)(3) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">If, in the case of a transaction between affiliated persons involving the production * * * of a major input to the merchandise, the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an amount represented as the value of such input is less than the cost of production of such input, then the administering authority may determine the value of the major input on the basis of .the information available regarding such cost of production, * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">MHI argues that Commerce\u2019s threshold for identifying a \u201cmajor input\u201d here \u2014 an input havingthe value of at least two percent of the value of one of the five press components or five percent or more of the value of a total press system \u2014 was inconsistent with the statute and with Commerce\u2019s past practice. In previous \u201cpost-URAA proceedings,\u201d MHI argues, Commerce \u201chas consistently defined \u2018major input\u2019 as an input which represents a \u2018significant percentage\u2019 of the <em>total cost </em>of manufacture for the subject merchandise.\u201d MHI Brief at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Commerce disputes MHI\u2019s contention that it failed to apply its normal \u201csignificance\u201d test. 61 Fed. Reg. at 38,162. Commerce stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">[i]n a typical case in which the subject merchandise only requires a few inputs, we agree that a threshold of two percent for defining a major input appears low. However, in this case, LNPPs require thousands ofinputs, withno single inputrepresentingalarge share of the total LNPP cost * * *. Accordingly, since the inputs we tested represent the most significant inputs used to produce the subject LNPPs, we consider it appropriate in this instance to categorize inputs meeting the two percent threshold as major inputs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The statute does not contain a definition of a \u201cmajor input.\u201d Therefore, the Court will defer to Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the term, if the interpretation is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The special rule for major inputs was added to the antidumpinglaw in 1988 \u201cto address diversionary input dumpingby authorizing Commerce to inquire whether the transfer between \u2018related\u2019 persons (i.e., \u2018affiliated\u2019 persons under section [1677b(f)(3)]) of such an input is at a price below the input\u2019s production cost.\u201d SAAat838 (citingH. Rep. 576,100th Cong., 2d Sess. 595 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Commerce found that MHI \u201cobtained from affiliated suppliers numerous inputs representing over two percent of the total cost of a component (none of which represent more than five percent of the LNPP total production cost), the sum of which represents a significant portion of the total LNPP cost of production.\u201d Japan Final at 38,162. If Commerce had defined \u201cmajor inputs\u201d as MHI suggested, to mean inputs worth between ten and twenty percent of the subject merchandise, it would have been unable to examine any inputs suppli\u00e9d to MHI by related parties, <em>see </em>Commerce Brief at 76 (citing Japan Final, 61 Fed. Reg. at 38,162), thus frustratingthe Congressional intent that certain inputs supplied by related parties be scrutinized to prevent \u201cdiversionary dumping.\u201d Therefore, in this case, it was reasonable for Commerce to set the threshold for defining a major input lower than it has in past determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Having appropriately decided to set the threshold at a lower level than would be typical, Commerce was obliged to choose a specific number for purposes of administration. The nature of this choice made a certain degree of randomness unavoidable. It is difficult, for example, to distinguish between two percent and three percent, or between five percent and six percent. This difficulty was exacerbated by the complexity of the subject merchandise as well as the large number of parts and suppliers involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">In order to make its choice, Commerce was required to, \u201creason its way to a decision without pretending that that decision reflected some degree of rational perfection * * <em>Fishermen\u2019s Dock Co-op. Inc. v. Brown, </em>75 F.3d 164, 173 (4th Cir. 1996). \u201cWhere the agency\u2019s line-drawing does not appear irrational and the [plaintiff] has not shown that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>consequences of the line-drawing are in any respect dire * * * we will leave that line-drawing to the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Leather Indus. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>40 F.3d 392, 409 (D.C. Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Here, Commerce quoted a letter from MHI stating that for one of the two POI sales, \u2018\u201cif a major input were defined as any input accounting for one percent of total purchase price* * *90 percent of the* * * suppliers could be ignored because their sales fall below this figure.\u2019\u201d Japan Final, 61 Fed. Reg. at 38,162 (quoting MHI August 24,1995 Submission, N-P doc. 8 at 3). Furthermore, the record demonstrates that of MHI\u2019s many suppliers, few were required to provide cost data. <em>See </em>Response of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. to Antidumping Section A Qr: Questions Relating to Affiliated Parties, Costs and Documentation, N-P doc. 105, Exs. 7 and 8. Based on the evidence before it, Commerce\u2019s decision to set the threshold at two percent of an LNPP component or five percent of an LNPP system was a permissible exercise of its discretion. The thresholds set by Commerce represent a reasonable attempt to comply with the requirement that the inputs at issue be \u201cmajor inputs\u201d \u2014 and to ensure that respondent is not excessively burdened \u2014 while at the same time addressing the potential for price manipulation presented by affiliated party transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">MHI also argues that Commerce \u201cfailed to articulate a basis for its finding that certain companies were affiliated with MHI. \u201d MHI Brief at 42. The statute defines \u201caffiliated persons\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">(A) Members of a family, including brothers and sisters * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">(B) Any officer or director of an organization and such organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">(C) Partners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">(D) Employer and employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">(E) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock or shares of any organization and such organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">(F) Two or more persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">(G) Any person who controls any other person and such other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">Commerce argues that \u201cdetermination of affiliation may be based on a close supplier relationship,\u201d Japan Final at 38,163, citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(G), which defines affiliated persons to include \u201cany person who controls any other person and such other person.\u201d Commerce\u2019s interpretation is supported by the SAA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-15\">The traditional focus on control through stock ownership fails to address adequately modern business arrangements, which often find one firm \u201coperationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction\u201d over another even in the absence of an equity relationship. A company may be in a position to exercise restraint or direction, for example, through corporate or family groupings, franchises or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>joint venture agreements, debt financing, or close supplier relationships in which the supplier or buyer becomes reliant upon the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">SAA at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">However, it is not clear to the Court on what basis Commerce determined that the suppliers at issue here were affiliated with MHI. Commerce requested that MHI list inputs obtained from suppliers that furnished more than 50 percent of their total annual sales to MHI, but stated that \u201cwe never indicated that this constitutes affiliation.\u201d Japan Final at 38,163. At oral argument, Commerce agreed with MHI that it had failed to explain why it treated certain parties as affiliated and requested that the Court remand this issue so that it might provide an explanation of its standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cThe agency must articulate a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285 (1974)(quoting <em>Burlington Truck Lines v.

Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947). Here, as it acknowledged, Commerce failed to state the basis upon which it determined that the suppliers identified by MHI were affiliated. Therefore the Court remands this issue so that Commerce may reevaluate its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Goss objects to Commerce\u2019s failure to treat a trading company (\u201cTrading Company\u201d)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> involved in MHI\u2019s sale to Piedmont Publishing Company as an affiliated party with MHI. Goss Brief at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The statute defines \u201caffiliated persons\u201d to include \u201c [t]wo or more persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, any person.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(F). MLP is a joint venture between MHI and Trading Company. Goss argues that MHI and Trading Company control a third person, MLI) and that therefore, MHI and Trading Company must be treated as affiliated persons. Goss Brief at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">In response, Commerce states that \u201c[t]he MLP joint venture between MHI and the trading company does not in and of itself constitute control between MHI and the trading company.\u201d Japan Final at 38,157. Furthermore, Commerce argues, information provided by MHI did not support \u201cthe pre-condition for affiliation [for purposes of subsections (F) and (G) of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)]: that MHI was \u2018legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over\u2019 Trading Company.\u201d Commerce Brief at 83 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Commerce\u2019s actions here were not consistent with the statute. The statutory definition of affiliated parties at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(F) does not require that MHI and Trading Company exercise control over each other. The statute requires only that \u201ctwo or more persons,\u201d control a third person. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Commerce\u2019s determination is based on a misreading of the statute.

United States, </em>13 CIT 402, 408, 714 F. Supp. 1211, 1217 (1989) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>965 F.2d 1056 (Fed.

United States, </em>16 CIT 41, 42, 783 F. Supp. 1421, 1423 (1992) (emphasis supplied). The reason for this is that accordingto the statute, the normal value of the subject merchandise is the price \u201cat which the foreign like product is first sold* * * in the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade * * *.\u201d The definition of export price, however, does not include an \u201cordinary course of trade\u201d provision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See IPSCO, Inc. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 384, 394, 687 F. Supp. 633, 640-41 (1988) (\u201cCongress has provided for numerous adjustments, allowances and exclusions on each side of the fair value equation in order to insure the fairest possible comparison between markets * * *. In light of this detailed framework, the court may assume that if Congress intended to require the administering authority to exclude all sales made outside the \u2018ordinary course of trade\u2019 from its determination of United States price it could have provided for such an exclusion* * *. It has not done so.\u201d) At the same time, theAmer-<em>ican Permac </em>court explained, \u201c[i]t does not follow inexorably, however, that every U.S. sale <em>of </em>the merchandise under investigation must be included in every case* * *. The distinction is that while U.S. sales outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the ordinary course of trade ordinarily should be included (this may be the very cause of injury), a methodology is to be applied which accounts for sales which are unrepresentative and which do not lead to a fair price comparison.\u201d 16 CIT at 42, 783 F. Supp. at 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Commerce distinguished the sale at issue here from sales it chose to exclude in other cases. Commerce explained that although in the past it has excluded some U.S. sales, specifically, sample sales, trial sales, and sales of damaged merchandise, \u201c[i]n those cases, the transactions involved stood by themselves; that is, they were of commodity products which were not directly related to other sales. For example, * * * a printer would never be bound to a paper supplier just because it tried a free roll of normal quality paper * * *.\u201d Japan Final at 38,151.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">On the other hand, Commerce noted, \u201c [s]ales ofLNPR * * * are of expensive, customized capital equipment which actually change the nature of the printer\u2019s operations. * * * [I]n light of the duration of relations between TKS and the DMN, one can reasonably interpret this sale as part of an over-arching marketing strategy vis-a-vis a long-term business relationship with the DMN, i.e., as a loss leader sale.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Moreover, Commerce explained, \u201c[t]he Department\u2019s discretion to exclude sales must take into account the fact that there is such a small pool of sales which are available for analysis. Because the Department is not convinced that the DMN sale in question was so unusual that it should be disregarded, we are including this sale in our final analysis, * * * \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Commerce\u2019s decision to include the DMN sale was consistent with the statute and case law, as well as Commerce\u2019s own practice in past investigations. It was also reasonable, in light, of the small pool of sales available for analysis. Therefore, the Court will sustain Commerce\u2019s determination on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">For the reasons stated above, Commerce\u2019s final determination in <em>Large Newspaper Printing Presses from Japan, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 38,139 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996)(final det.) is remanded for Commerce to correct its error in allocating respondents\u2019 indirect selling costs incurred in Japan, explain its decision to adjust normal value for imputed credit expenses, reconsider its decision to treat LNPPs sold in the home market as foreign like product, reevaluate its decision to treat certain of MHI\u2019s suppliers as affiliated parties and reconsider its decision not to treat Trading Company and MHI as affiliated parties.
