Plaintiffs Koenig <em>&amp; </em>Bauer-Albert AG and KBA-Motter Corp. (\u201cKBA\u201d), MAN Roland Druckmaschinen AG and MAN Roland Inc. (\u201cMAN Roland\u201d), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (\u201cMHI\u201d) and Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd. (\u201cTKS\u201d), respondents in the underlying investigation, seek review of the final determination of the U.S. International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), in <em>Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof, Whether Assembled or Unassembled, From Germany and Japan, </em>Inv. Nos. 731-TA-736 &amp; 737, USITC Pub. No. 2988 (Aug. 1996) (\u201cFinal Determination\u201d). Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge the ITC\u2019s determination that the industry in the United States producing large newspaper printing presses (\u201cLNPPs\u201d) is threatened with material injury by reason of imports from Germany and Japan that are sold at less than fair value (\u201cLTFV\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The German Plaintiffs also challenge the Commission\u2019s decision to cumulate imports of LNPPs from Germany and Japan for purposes of its material injury and threat of material injury analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">LNPPs are presses that are designed to print major daily papers for large metropolitan newspapers. LNPPs are capable of producingtens of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>thousands of newspapers per hour. They have a long life-expectancy and must be extremely reliable. LNPPs are individually designed to meet each newspaper\u2019s requirements and require sophisticated engineering, programming and manufacturing capabilities. Their design, construction and installation generally require long-term contracts covering all aspects of sale, delivery and construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">In its determination, the ITC found that there was a single domestic industry, consisting of all LNPP producers of the domestic like product. Included in the domestic industry were Goss, the petitioner in the underlying investigation, as well as three LNPP producers that are owned or controlled by foreign LNPP manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">In reviewing the Commission\u2019s determination, the Court must sustain a final determination unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law. \u201d19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AqLP\">I. Cumulation</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">In making its injury determination, the ITC may \u201ccumulate\u201d \u2014 i.e., consider the impact of imports from more than one country on the domestic industry \u2014 only if those imports \u201ccompete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.\u201d Section 771 of the Tariff Act of 1930, <em>as amended, </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(G)(i),(H)(1994). In order to satisfy this provision, the ITC must determine that \u201ca reasonable overlap of competition\u201d exists between imports from different countries. <em>Wieland Werke, AG v. United States, </em>13 CIT 561, 563, 718 F. Supp. 50, 52 (1989). \u201cCompletely overlapping markets are not required.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">German Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s cumulation decision was premised on the finding that during the investigation period, \u201c\u2018the German producers submitted <em>final bids </em>in direct competition with one or both of the Japanese producers on sales of LNPP press lines * * * accounting for [a significant percentage] of the total final contract value of all LNPP press line contracts awarded ***.\u201d\u2019 Mem. MAN Roland and Koenig &amp; Bauer-Albert Support Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cCumulation Brief\u201d) at 8 (emphasis in the originalXquoting Views of the Commission, List 2, Doc. 429M (\u201cViews\u201d) at 36). Therefore, Plaintiffs argue, the decision to cumulate was inappropriate, because \u201c[t]here was no competition between German and Japanese producers at the final bidding stage during the entire period of investigation.\u201d Cumulation Brief at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">However, the ITC\u2019s decision to cumulate German and Japanese imports was based on a variety of considerations. Specifically, in evaluating whether imports from different countries compete with each other and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>with the domestic like product, the ITC relies on a four-factor test. The four factors are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\">(1) the degree of fungibility between the imports from different countries and between imports and the domestic like product, including consideration of specific customer requirements and other quality related questions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-5\">(2) the presence of sales or offers to sell in the same geographical markets of imports from different countries and the domestic like product;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-6\">(3) the existence of common or similar channels of distribution for imports from different countries and the domestic like product; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-7\">(4) whether the imports are simultaneously present in the market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Views at 32. <em>See Wieland Werke, </em>13 CIT at 563, 718 F. Supp. at 52; <em>Fundicao Tupy S.A. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 6, 10-11, 678 F. Supp. 898, 902 (1988), <em>aff'd, </em>859 F. 2d 915 (Fed. Cir. 1988). \u201cWhile no single factor is determinative, and the list of factors is not exclusive, these factors are intended to provide the Commission with a framework for determining whether the imports compete * * *. \u201d Views at 32 (citing <em>Wieland Werke, </em>13 CIT at 563, 718 F. Supp. at 52). Plaintiffs do not directly challenge the ITC\u2019s four-factor test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Evaluating the four factors, the Commission observed that, \u201cduring the period of investigation, subject imports from Germany and Japan * * * were generally sold in similar channels of trade since the large majority of German and Japanese subject imports* * * was sold directly by the manufacturer of the merchandise to the customer.\u201d Views at 33-34. As evidence for this assertion, the ITC cites the Staff Report in <em>Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof, Whether Assembled or Unassembled, From Germany and Japan, </em>Inv. Nos. 731-TA-736 &amp; 737 (Final), List 2, Doc. 311M (Aug. 7,1996) (\u201cStaff Report\u201d) at 1-15 (\u201cLNPPs and additions are sold directly to the end user * -1! * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">With respect to the simultaneous presence of the imports in the market, the ITC stated, \u201cwe examined the extent of simultaneous presence of subject imports from Germany and Japan in terms of both sales and offers to sell * * * as well as actual imports entering the United States, because the bidding process is the point at which head-to-head competition occurs. \u201d Views at 34. The ITC found that subject importers were actively bidding for sales of press lines and additions in every year of the period examined. <em>Id. </em>As evidence, the ITC cites the Staff Report at V-ll to V-16 and V-28 to V-62. The cited pages contain tables and text describing domestic LNPP sales during the period of investigation. These descriptions demonstrate that even if German and Japanese manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>turers were not competing against each other at the final bid stage for specific sales, as Plaintiffs claim, producers from both countries were actively bidding for sales of press lines and additions during the period examined. Furthermore, \u201csubject merchandise entered the United States from both Germany and Japan in 1991, 1994 and 1995.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This statement is supported by a table in the staff report listing U.S. imports of LNPPs for 1991-95. <em>See </em>Staff Report at IV-4, Table IV-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\">With regard to the \u201cpresence of sales or offers to sell in the same geographical markets,\u201d the ITC found that \u201cthe record evidence indicates that German, Japanese and domestic producers are not limited by geographic boundaries with respect to their submission of bids and are therefore able to \u2014 and do \u2014 submit bids on LNPP projects throughout the nation. Views at 34-35. This statement also is borne out by the staff report. <em>See </em>Staff Report at V-28 to V-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Finally, considering the remaining factor, the degree of fungibility of imports from different countries, the Commission said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-5\">in a number of cases, * * * RFQs [requests for quotations] were sent to domestic and German and Japanese LNPP producers, and initial bids, which are themselves detailed descriptions of the products being offered, were often submitted by these producers. The fact that purchasers solicited detailed initial bids from both German and Japanese producers * * * indicates to us that purchasers perceived a reasonable degree of fungibility among various producers\u2019 presses * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Views at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">In response, the Plaintiffs argue that the German and Japanese manufacturers did not compete at the final bid stage, and therefore, cannot be considered to have been in competition at all. Implicit in Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is the view that only \u201cdirect competition\u201d may be considered by the ITC in making a cumulation determination. <em>See </em>Cu-mulation Brief at 12 (arguing that certain sales did not involve \u201cdirect competition\u201d between German and Japanese producers and therefore should not be included in the ITC\u2019s cumulation analysis). Plaintiffs imply that the Commission\u2019s four-factor analysis was largely irrelevant because the presses can only be considered to be in competition at the final bid stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Plaintiffs explain their reasoning as follows: \u201cnewspapers explore their options very carefully [prior to purchasing a new press] * * *. Purchasers often request initial bids from various producers as part of an \u2018education or information-gathering\u2019 process in order to determine the options available in the marketplace.\u201d Cumulation Brief at 7. After reviewing the initial bids, the purchaser will exclude certain producers \u2018\u201cdue to their perceived inability to satisfy technological or other customer requirements.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 (quoting Views at 21). Once the purchaser has chosen the producer or producers it believes are capable of meeting its requirements, the newspaper \u201cseeks final bids and engages in detailed negotiations with the producer or producers <em>***.\u201d Id. </em>It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>only at the final bidding stage, Plaintiffs argue, \u201cthat presses offered are comparable and can be reasonably considered in competition with one other.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">However, the ITC maintains that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-5\">we do not interpret the differences in technology offered by different producers to be, in and of themselves, sufficient to warrant a conclusion that no reasonable overlap of competition exists * * * a particular purchaser\u2019s ultimate preference for one producer\u2019s press over another\u2019s due to technology or quality differences does not mean that those presses do not compete with each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Views at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The Court agrees with the Commission. \u201c[Cumulation does not require two products to be highly fungible. Bather, to support a decision to cumulate, the Commission need only find a \u2018reasonable overlap\u2019 of competition * * <em>BIC Corp. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 448, 456, 964 F. Supp. 391, 400 (1997). Furthermore, the Court finds that this cas\u00e9is similar to <em>Granges Metallverken AB v. United States, </em>13 CIT 471, 716 F. Supp. 17 (1989). In that case, the ITC stated that \u201calthough a custom product delivered to the customer maybe unique, there is competition in [the] industry because other producers also sought to sell that same merchandise to the same customer * * 13 CIT at 475, 716 F. Supp. at 21. The court agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">[although quality appeared to be a major factor in purchaser\u2019s decisions, price was also a major factor. It is not unreasonable for the Commission to find that domestic purchasers prefer to purchase higher quality goods that are available at a cheaper price than domestic goods or other imports perceived to be inferior. \u201cCompetition\u201d consists of rivalry in the marketplace, where goods will be bought from those who, in view of buyers, provide \u201cthe most for the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 476-77, 716 F. Supp. at 22 (citing J.E Friedman, Dictionary of Business Terms 109 (1987)). In this case, the ITC found that \u201c[a]ll producers produce and offer offset LNPPs and have developed (or are in the process of developing) keyless inking technologies * * *.\u201d Views at 37. Thus, the Commission\u2019s determination that producers could be considered to be in competition with each other based on competition at the initial stages of bidding, even if they did not compete at the final bid stage, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">In addition to its four-factor analysis, the Commission also argued that \u201cthere was a significant degree of head-to-head competition between subject imports from Germany and Japan at [the final bid] stage as well, * * *.\u201d Views at 36. Specifically, the Commission found that German and Japanese producers competed at the final bid stage for a small number of LNPP press line sales with a total final contract value in excess of $125 million. <em>Id. </em>n.181. As support for this finding, the Commission cites Table V-l in the staff report, captioned, \u201c[f]inal-bid price information by bidding firm and purchaser * * *.\u201d Staff Report at V-l 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>to V-13. However, the term \u201cfinal-bid price\u201d in the caption to the table is ambiguous. It could mean, as the government argues, bids submitted at the final bid stage, or it could simply mean the final bid submitted by the producer in question. Based on other evidence contained in the record, the latter definition seems more likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">For example, for the sale by MHI to the <em>Washington Post, </em>one of the sales relied on by the Commission, the table lists final bids submitted by Goss, TKS, and KBA. <em>Id. </em>at V-12. However, in its description of the bid process, the purchaser states that one of the three competitors \u201cfell out of the running early. \u201d Staff Report, App. G at 18. The staff report states that one of the three \u201c [was] not included in the final bidding. \u201d Staff Report at V-54 n.80. Similarly, the table lists a final bid for one German producer. However, according to the staff report, the German producer also was not included in the final bidding. <em>Id. </em>Thus, although the Court agrees that the German producer was in competition for the sale, the evidence indicates that the producer was eliminated before the final bid stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Another of the sales relied on by the ITC was the sale by MAN Roland to the <em>Wilkes-Barre Leader. </em>As with the <em>Washington Post </em>sale, Table V-l lists final bids from both Japanese and German manufacturers for that sale. Staff Report at V-12. However, the staff report indicates that prior to the final bid stage, the newspaper narrowed its consideration to two of the competitors. Staff Report at V-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">The remaining sales relied on by the ITC for its findings regarding competition at the final bid stage comprise less than five percent of total contract value during the period of investigation. Staff Report at V-ll - V-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">At oral argument, government\u2019s counsel explained that table VI-1 includes not \u201cfinal bids\u201d but bids submitted at the \u201cfinal stage\u201d defined as all bidding after the initial bids were submitted. Regardless of the correct definition of \u201cfinal-bid price,\u201d the Court finds that the Commission\u2019s findings regarding competition at the final bid stage constituted a relatively insignificant part of the Commission\u2019s findings overall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The Commission\u2019s cumulation decision was premised on the four factors set out above. Based on the Commission\u2019s evaluation of those factors, the Court finds that the Commission had substantial evidence supporting its determination that a reasonable overlap of competition existed between the German and Japanese manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">II. The ITC\u2019s Threat Determination</p>\n<p id=\"As-\">A. The ITC\u2019s Consideration of Economic Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports, (or sales for importa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>tion) of the subject merchandise, the ITC is required to consider, \u201camong other relevant economic factors,\u201d the following nine factors: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-4\">(I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, takinginto account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-6\">(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-7\">(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-8\">(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-9\">(VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-10\">(VII) in any investigation under this title which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product * * * and any product processed from such raw agricultural product * * * ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-11\">(VIII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-12\">(IX) any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7) (F)(i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">Furthermore, the ITC is to \u201cconsider the factors set forth [above] as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped * * * imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued * * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">According to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \u201c[a]n affirmative injury determination requires both (1) present material injury and (2) a findingthat the material injury is \u2018by reason of the subject imports.\u201d Gerald <em>Metals, Inc. v. United States, </em>132 F. 3d 716, 719 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The section of the antidumping statute that discusses the threat factors also includes the \u201cby reason of\u201d language. Thus, a positive threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>determination also requires a showing of a causal connection between the LTFV goods and the threatened material injury. <em>Id. </em>at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\">Therefore, after considering all relevant economic factors in makinga determination of whether further dumped imports are imminent, the Commission must take an analytically distinct step to comply with the \u201cby reason of\u201d standard: the Commission must determine whether these factors as a whole indicate that the LTFV imports made a material contribution to the threat of the material injury. \u201c [E] vidence of <em>de mini-mis </em>(e.g., minimal or tangential) causation of injury does not reach the causation level required under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Both German and Japanese Plaintiffs oppose the ITC\u2019s finding that the domestic industry is threatened with material injury by reason of subject imports. Respondents\u2019 Joint Mem. Support Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cRespondents\u2019 Brief\u201d) at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Plaintiffs complain that although the ITC \u201cclaimed that it had \u2018considered, * * * all statutory factors that are relevant to these investigations,\u201d\u2019 it never found that further imports were imminent, and never explained \u201cwhy it was likely, or even possible, that material injury by reason of imports would occur <em>unless </em>an order was issued. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18 (emphasis in the original). The ITC responds that \u201cthe Commission was not required to incorporate in its determination language that simply tracked the statutory language, * * Def. USITC Opp\u2019n to Mot. J. Agency R.

Capacity</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">Threat factors II and VI both pertain to production capacity In the underlying administrative proceeding, Plaintiffs argued that they were operating at nearly full capacity and therefore, \u201cthey could not make substantial additional sales to the United States.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 25 (citing Staff Report at VII-4 to VII-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">The Commission rejected this argument, explaining, \u201calthough producers may be operating at high capacity utilization rates, they have demonstrated the ability to shift significant future production to the United States from other export markets in the future.\u201d Views at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">Plaintiffs challenge the Commission\u2019s decision, arguing, \u201c[t]he ITC has not provided any cogent rationale why the plaintiffs would expand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>capacity and divert exports to the United States, * * Respondents\u2019 Brief at 26. However, Plaintiffs mischaracterize the Commission\u2019s position. It is true that the Commission did not find that Plaintiffs <em>planned </em>to expand productive capacity or divert exports to the United States. However, it did not claim to have made such a finding. The Commission simply found that Plaintiffs have the ability to compete for and fill U.S. sales orders. <em>See </em>Views at 51 (\u201c[AJlthough producers may be operating at high capacity utilization rates, they have demonstrated the ability to shift significant future production to the United States from other export markets in the future.\u201d). Therefore, the Commission concluded, Plaintiffs\u2019 high capacity utilization figures did not preclude a threat determination. <em>See id. </em>at 51-52 (\u201c[T]he existence of high capacity utilization rates does not necessarily indicate an inability to increase shipments to the U.S. market * * *.\u201d). The Commission never argued that Plaintiffs\u2019 capacity data constituted positive evidence that levels of subject imports would increase. The Commission treated Plaintiffs\u2019 capacity data as a neutral factor and appropriately attributed less weight to this data than to its other findings. <em>See </em>Views at 51 (\u201cWe place somewhat less reliance on capacity figures in these investigations * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">Plaintiffs also argue, \u201cthe ITC took capacity and capacity utilization \u2018off the table\u2019 and presumed that plaintiffs could fill additional orders in the U.S. market despite their reported capacity limitations.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 26-27 n.70. However, the Commission did not merely presume that Plaintiffs could fill additional orders, the Commission provided substantial evidence demonstrating that \u201cproducers are capable of quickly increasing capacity to satisfy new sales, \u201d Views at 51, and that \u201cthe capacity of the German and Japanese producers appears to vary in correlation with their production figures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n.239. These statements are supported by capacity data in the staff report showing that capacity for both German and Japanese Plaintiffs fluctuated widely during the period of investigation. <em>See </em>Staff Report at VII-4 to VII-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Based on these data, the Commission reasonably concluded that subject producers\u2019 reported capacity figures did not impose strict limits on their ability to increase production and sales. Thus, the ITC\u2019s determination that Plaintiffs\u2019 high capacity utilization rates did not preclude further imports was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">2. Home-Country and Third-Country Sales Opportunities</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">In considering the statutory factor of \u201cexistingunused production capacity or imminent increase in production capacity, \u201d the ITC is required to take into account, \u201cthe availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports * * 19U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Plaintiffs argue that, \u201cthe ITC never made any finding that the [Plaintiffs] lack sales opportunities outside the United States or that adverse market conditions outside the U.S. market will cause them to step upefforts in theUnited States.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 30. Furthermore, Plaintiffs claim to have \u201cintroduced unrebutted evidence that demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>for LNPPs was increasing in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. The ITC is subject to reversal if it ignores affirmative evidence that its predictions of increased imports are improbable or impossible. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31 (citing <em>Suramerica de Aleaciones Laminadas, C.A. v. United States, </em>44 F.3d 978, 985 (Fed. Cir. 1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\">In support of their claim Plaintiffs cite MHI\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, and TKS\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 31. However, as the Commission noted, the evidence in the MHI brief pertains to printing presses in general rather than to sales of LNPPs. Views at 52. The evidence in TKS\u2019 brief does show that the percentage of Japanese manufacturers\u2019 LNPP shipments going to the home market increased between 1994 and 1995 and were projected to increase further in 1996 and 1997. However, the 1995 increase did not increase the percentage of shipments going to the home market to the levels seen in the years 1991 through 1993. <em>See </em>TKS Pre-Hearing Brief, List 2, Doc. 50 at 49-50 (citing Staff Report at VII-5, Table VII-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Because the data provided by Plaintiffs concerning third-country markets was not specific to LNPPs, the Commission\u2019s decision to attribute less weight to that data was reasonable. Furthermore, the table relied on by TKS, showing that home market shipments had increased in 1995, and were expected to increase further in 1996 and 1997, also shows that the percentage of shipments going to the United States will be higher in 1997 than in any year duringthe period of investigation and that the percentage of shipments going to third-country markets in 1997 will be lower than in any year during the period of investigation. <em>See </em>Staff Report at VII-6, Table VII-3. Thus, the Commission had substantial evidence to support its determination that the third-country and home-market data did not preclude a finding that exports to the United States could increase in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">3. Increased Imports and Market Penetration</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Regarding Factor III, Plaintiffs argue, \u201c[t]he Act requires that the ITC shall consider, in makingthreat determinations, whether there has been a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise <em>indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports.\u2019\u201d </em>Respondents\u2019 Brief at 21 (emphasis in the original). \u201cAlthough the ITC claimed to have found \u2018a significant increase\u2019 in the value of import sales in 1994 and 1995,\u201d Plaintiffs argue, \u201cit could not have found that this increase was indicative of any similar increase in 1996, since its staff projected that the German and Japanese producers would make no sales in that year, * * *. \u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs rely on the table appearing on page IV-14, \u201cU.S. sales of domestic product, sales of imports by sources, and apparent U.S. consumption * * *\u201d to support this contention. <em>Id. </em>at 22 n.56 (citing Staff Report at IV-14, Table IV-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Plaintiffs are correct. The table does show no sales by German or Japanese producers in 1996.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, this by itself is not conclusive. There is other evidence on the record that tends to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion. The record shows that the volume and market penetration of subject imports increased significantly in 1994 and 1995.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Staff Report at IV-14, Table IV-6. Furthermore, the Commission found that German and Japanese producers were competing with Goss on more than seventy-five percent of the sales that would be made in the twelve months following the final determination. Views at 50 n.232. The evidence also demonstrates that in 1996, German producers submitted bids on approximately two thirds of the bids pending in the market as of August 1, 1996. <em>See </em>Staff Report at VII-7, Table VII-4. Similarly, the Japanese producers had submitted bids on approximately half of the sales pending as of August 1, 1996. <em>Id. </em>Thus here, the Commission\u2019s finding of a high number of pending contracts for which German and/or Japanese producers had submitted bids was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">As the Commission explained, \u201c[b]ecause the number and value of sales fluctuate considerably from year to year, changes in industry performance on a year-to-year basis may be of limited utility * * Views at 20. Thus, the Commission\u2019s decision to attribute less weight to the 1996 data was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that because the <em>Washington Post </em>sale was the only sale of subject merchandise in 1995, the Commission\u2019s determination that subject imports are increasing was unjustified. \u201cOne sale does not make a \u2018trend,\u2019 and it was unreasonable for the ITC to make any predictions regarding future sales levels based on that one sale.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that one sale \u201cdoes not make a \u2018trend,\u2019\u201d and that it would have been unreasonable for the ITC to base predictions of future import levels on one sale, even one as large as the <em>Washington Post </em>sale. However, the Commission\u2019s determination regarding the likelihood of increased future imports was not based solely on the 1995 sales data. In fact, as noted above, the Commission acknowledged that \u201cchanges in industry performance on a year-to-year basis may be of limited utility.\u201d Views at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">\u201cThe Commissioners have the discretion to determine the weight to be given factors they consider.\u201d <em>Metallverken Nederland, </em>13 CIT at 1018, 728 F. Supp. at 735. The high number of pending contracts for which German and/or Japanese producers had submitted bids, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>with the Commission\u2019s findings regardingthe subject imports\u2019 increasing value and market share in 1994 and 1995, constitute substantial evidence that imports are likely to increase in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Commission should not have included MHI\u2019s 1995 sale to the <em>Washington Post </em>in its analysis at all, because the Department of Commerce did not calculate a dumpingmargin for that sale. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">\u201c [I]t would be legally impermissible for the ITC to consider the <em>Washington Post </em>sale to be a \u2018dumped import.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he Act requires the ITC to determine whether the domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury \u2018by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of <em>the merchandise </em>with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination ***.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(l)(B))(emphasis in the original). \u201c[I]n the absence of a finding by [Commerce] that the merchandise sold to the <em>Washington Post </em>was sold at LTFV the ITC was barred from considering the sale in its threat analysis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">The relevant case law does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 argument here. In <em>Algoma Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>for example, plaintiff a foreign producer, argued that the ITC had erred in assessing the volume of subject imports and their impact on injury, \u201cby failing to take account of the fact that some sales * * * were at fair value.\u201d 12 CIT 518, 518, 688 F. Supp. 639, 641 (1988), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>865 F.2d 240 (1989).

Supp. at 645. \u201cThus,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cthe real question addressed to [the] ITC by the statute is what effect imports in a class of merchandise sold at LTFV have on the domestic industry producing the \u2018like\u2019 product.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Plaintiffs argue that this case is unlike <em>Algoma Steel, </em>in that this case involves made-to-order items rather than \u2018\u201coff-the-shelf merchandise. \u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 25 n.65. Plaintiffs cite <em>United Eng\u2019g &amp; Forging v. United States, </em>15 CIT 561, 577, 779 F. Supp. 1375, 1389 (1991), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>996 F.2d 1236 (Fed.

However, <em>United Eng\u2019g </em>does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>position. In <em>United Eng\u2019g, </em>the plaintiff argued that \u201cgiven the \u2018unusual market factors\u2019 in the * * * industry,\u201d i.e. that the subject merchandise was made-to-order, the ITC should not have included in its analysis sales that were excluded from the ITA\u2019s investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 577-79, 779 F. Supp. at 1390-91. The court disagreed, stating, \u201c[dissimilar facts in Al-goma, * * * do not render its legal analysis inapposite. The ITC \u2018does not look behind ITA\u2019s determination, but accepts ITA\u2019s determination as to which merchandise is in the class of merchandise sold at LTFV\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579, 779 F. Supp. at 1391 (citing <em>Algoma Steel, 12 </em>CIT at 522, 688 F. Supp. at 644).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">Similarly, in this case, although the ITA declined to calculate a dumping margin for the <em>Washington Post </em>sale, it did include the presses sold to the <em>Post </em>in the class of merchandise sold at less than fair value. <em>See Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof, Whether Assembled or Unassembled, From Japan </em>61 Fed. Reg. 8029, 8031-32 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996) (prel. det.)(explainingthatthe <em>Washington Post </em>sale was excluded from the margin analysis because it was \u201cunbuilt, un-shipped, and uninstalled,\u201d at the time of the investigation, and because there were two other sales available for analysis). Thus, the ITC appropriately considered the <em>Post </em>sale in its injury analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">4. Price Effects of the Subject Merchandise</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">With respect to the price effects of future imports, Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe proposition that imports had suppressed or depressed prices was contrary to the findings of the ITC\u2019s staff.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 36. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">[t]he Staff Report indicates that \u201cgiven a particular specification and level of quality, the final installed price to the customer will be a significant deciding factor.\u201d * * *. However, the Staff recognizes that non-price factors such as technology, quality, service and compatibility with existing presses are more important than price* * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 35 n.97 (citing Staff Report at V-6). Thus, Plaintiffs contend, \u201c[t]he ITC Staff concluded only that price is determinative for a <em>hypothetical </em>sale, where technology, quality and other significant non-price factors are assumed to be the same for foreign and domestic bidders. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34-35 (citing Staff Report at V-6) (emphasis in the original). However, Plaintiffs read the ITC staff report too narrowly. In fact, the ITC Staff found that during the bid process, \u201cthe bids are expected to converge,\u201d so that by the time of the final bid, \u201cthe presses offered by the different makers generally are reasonably similar and meet specifications. \u201d Staff Report at V-7. This finding supports the Commission\u2019s determination that competition during the bid process plays a significant role in determining the sales price of the subject merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Plaintiffs also argue that a large fraction of the bids were non-competitive and in a significant number of the competitive bids, the bid was not awarded to the lowest bidder. Plaintiffs maintain \u201c[b]oth of these phe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>nomena are inconsistent with a finding that price is the predominant factor driving procurement decisions.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\">Again, Plaintiffs mischaracterize the Commission\u2019s findings. The Commission did not find that price was the <em>predominant </em>factor driving procurement decisions. In fact, the Commission stated, \u201c[a]\u00a1though price appears <em>not </em>to be the dominant factor in many bid situations, it is nevertheless often an important factor in the purchaser\u2019s decision at the final stage of the bid process.\u201d Views at 41 (emphasis added)(footnotes omitt\u00e9d). Furthermore, the Commission reasonably determined that the fact that bids were not awarded to the lowest bidder in all cases did not necessarily preclude a finding of price suppression or depression by subject imports. As the Commission explained, \u201cpurchasers may seek to negotiate more expensive equipment or additional services at the same price level, thereby exacting a higher value product for what appears to be a price similar to that quoted by a different supplier.\u201d Views at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">In addition, the Court finds, the Commission\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence. According to the Commission, the \u201cconventional approach to pricing analysis [was] not particularly useful in these investigations,\u201d due to, \u201cthe nature of the sales process and the relatively unique characteristics of each LNPP or addition sold, \u201d as well as, \u201cthe fact that price competition occurs primarily during the extensive and highly competitive bid/negotiation process for LNPP sales * * *. \u2019\u2019Views at 40. The Court agrees th\u00e1t because each LNPP is made to customer specifications, a more conventional approach, based, for example, on price trends over time,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would not have been useful. Thus, the Commission\u2019s decision to rely on anecdotal evidence in evaluating price effects of the subject merchandise was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The ITC maintains that price is \u201c often an important factor in the purchaser\u2019s decision at the final stage of the bid process.\u201d Views at 41. In support of this statement, the Commission notes that in almost half of the bids involving competition between domestic and subject merchandise, the bid was awarded to the lowest bidder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n.202. The Court does not find this evidence, by itself, convincing. The majority of the presses sold were not sold to the lowest bidder. Furthermore, even in cases in which the lowest bid was chosen, purchasers appear to have based their final decisions on factors other than price. For example, one purchaser stated that it purchased a press from a foreign producer not because that producer offered the lowest price, but \u201cbecause of its technology, configuration, and operating results.\u201d Staff Report at V-48 (citing Questionnaire submitted by the purchaser) (stating \u201cif the price of both had been the same our production manager and press foreman would still have recommended the [imported] press.\u2019\u201d) <em>Id. </em>(quoting Questionnaire submitted by the purchaser, at 15). The newspaper did not indicate what it would have done if the imported press had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>more expensive than the domestically produced press. Similarly, another purchaser stated that \u201cafter adjustingfor rebates for used equipment and extra costs to be incurred by the newspaper in implementing the [press ultimately purchased],\u201d the two final bids were \u201cessentially equivalent.\u201d Staff Report at V-55. Thus, the purchaser explained, \u201c[ijntangible factors \u2014 particularly the perceived difference in the two bidders\u2019 enthusiasm for and commitment to the press project \u2014 ultimately persuaded it to purchase the presses from the [foreign producer].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Purchaser\u2019s Questionnaire response, July 20,1995, att. at 2). Again, however, the purchaser did not say what it would have done if the foreign press had been significantly more expensive. Thus, the Court finds, this evidence is inconclusive regarding the importance of price in purchasers\u2019 choice of a vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">However, the staff report also includes two tables compiled from purchasers\u2019 questionnaire responses. One of these tables shows that eighteen of fifty purchasers surveyed said that price was among the top three most important factors in choosing which vendor to use. Staff Report at 11-13. The second table shows that forty-four of forty-eight purchasers considered price to be either critical, very important, or moderately important. <em>See </em>Staff Report at 11-14. These tables, in combination with the anecdotal evidence cited above, could reasonably lead to the conclusion that price is an important factor in purchasers\u2019 choice of a vendor for an LNPE <em>See National Ass\u2019n of Mirror Mfrs. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 771, 774, 696 F.

Therefore, the Commission explained, \u201cprice competition from the subject imports can have significant adverse effects on domestic producers\u2019 prices, even when the domestic producers actually win the sale. \u201d <em>Id. </em>The ITC lists two sales as examples of contracts won by Goss, on which Goss claims to have lost revenues due to competition from subject imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">In the first of the two sales, the ITC states that, \u201c [the purchaser] indicates that prices fell during [the] bid process because of, among other things, degree of competition among producers * * *.\u201d Views at 42 n.204. For the second sale, the purchaser acknowledged using \u201cterms and conditions from [German and Japanese producers] to get the best deal from [Goss].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The ITC staff also found that, \u201c [i]t is not uncommon for bidding firms to submit initial bids that are somewhat high. This leaves them room to negotiate, depending on the degree of competition in the bid process. It also assures that where competition is not keen the supplier does not \u2018leave money on the table. \u2019 \u201d Staff Report at V-7. Thus, the evidence supports the ITC\u2019s contention that for some sales, the purchaser used competing bids to negotiate lower prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>Finally, the ITC staff found that profit margins on sales of domestically produced LNPPs decreased in 1995, at the same time that the value and penetration of subject imports were increasing. <em>See </em>Staff Report at VI-9, Table VI-3; <em>see also </em>Staff Report at IV-14, Table IV-6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Commission also had evidence suggesting that the impact of the subject imports on price would tend to intensify in the imminent future.

Moreover, this intensified competition for a smaller pool of sales opportunities increases the incentive for suppliers of LTFV imports to compete on the basis of price.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Views at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue, the ITC\u2019s findings as to the price effects of future imports failed to consider the impact of competition among U.S. producers. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 35. \u201cTo the extent that this competition would have caused the same price effects in the absence of subject imports, it was improper for the ITC to claim that the price suppression or depression it allegedly observed had been caused by subject imports. \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\"><em>\u201c </em>[AJbsent some showing to the contrary, the Commission is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>National Ass\u2019n of Mirror Mfrs., </em>12 CIT at 779, 696 F. Supp. at 648. Furthermore, based on the evidence, the Commission could reasonably have concluded that competition among domestic producers alone could not have caused the price effects attributed by the ITC to the subject imports. Both the Plaintiffs and the Commission agree that price effects of competition, to the extent they exist, occur during the period of negotiation after producers have submitted their bids to the purchaser. According to Tables V-l and V-2, in a significant number of the competitive contracts awarded during the period of investigation, Goss faced competition only from foreign producers because no other domestic producers submitted bids. Staff Report at V-11 to V-14. Thus, any price effects caused by competition in these sales could not be the result of other domestic producers. Thus, the Commission could reasonably conclude that at least part of the price effect caused by competition would not have occurred in the absence of the subject merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>There is competing evidence on the record that would tend to support Plaintiffs\u2019 view that subject imports did not cause depression or suppression of LNPP prices. For example, the evidence indicates that for many purchasers price is \u201ca threshold factor that competing producers must meet for their initial bids to be competitive.\u201d Views at 41. The threshold is set, not by the bids offered by competitors, but by the purchaser\u2019s budgetary constraints. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cOnce the initial bids are submitted and meet the purchaser\u2019s budgetary constraints, and the bidding process continues, then the difference in prices tend to become a less important factor as compared to other factors such as technology and quality.\u201d). Thus, even in the absence of subject merchandise, domestic manufacturers would not be able to charge higher prices at this stage, because prices are limited by the purchaser\u2019s budget. <em>See Floral Trade </em>Council, 20 CIT 595, slip op. 96-78, at 18 (upholdingfindingthat subject imports did not suppress domestic prices where the Commission found that domestic producers could not have raised prices even in the absence of LTFV imports),</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">Moreover, for many of the sales won by Goss in which Goss claims to have lost revenue, the purchasers do not support Goss\u2019s claims. <em>See, e.g. </em>Staff Report at V-33 to V-34 (stating that the customer reports that it asked producers to lower their bids because their initial bids were not within its budget. Goss changed the specifications of the press it was offering in order to provide a press within the customer\u2019s budget.); <em>Id. </em>at v-35 to V-36 (noting that another customer reports that there was no competition on this sale); <em>Id. </em>at V-39 (stating that a third customer reports that there was no competition for this purchase. Only Goss was invited to bid because the paper was already using Goss printers and did not want to mix brands. The customer stated that Goss lowered its bid price duringnegotiations. Contrary to Goss\u2019s assertion, neither the purchaser nor the alleged foreign importer reported that the competitor had bid on this sale.); <em>Id. </em>at V-40 (\u201cAlthough [Goss] claims lost revenue in this sale because of alleged competition from the alleged competitors, the customer did not support this assertion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Nevertheless, the totality of the evidence does not require a single conclusion. \u201cIt is not the Court\u2019s function to reweigh the evidence, but to decide whether the Commission\u2019s determinations are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Granges Metallverken, </em>13 CIT at 474, 716 F.

Plaintiffs maintain that the ITC\u2019s finding, as well as the conclusions the Commission draws from this finding, are not supported by substantial evidence. Respondent\u2019s Brief at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">The Commission found \u201cthe record shows that German and Japanese producers are now in direct competition with domestic producers for bids that are now pending in the LNPP market. While there is evidence of* * * [fewer than twenty] currently pending sales ofLNPPs and additions, there is a varying degree of likelihood that contracts will be awarded on these pending sales in the [then near] future.\u201d Views at 49.

Respondents\u2019 Brief at 28. Plaintiffs argue that the Commission based its finding on incomplete and unreliable data. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Plaintiffs also claim that the Commission did not pursue purchaser information on the status of a small number of pending additions sales on which petitioner was the sole bidder. <em>Id. </em>at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">To the extent that Plaintiffs\u2019 argument rests on the theory that the ITC could have obtained more data, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is irrelevant. The question is not whether the Commission might have obtained additional information, but whether the determination is supported by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>stantial evidence on the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Hannibal Indus., Inc. v.

As long as the methodology and procedures are a \u201creasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d <em>Makita Corp. v.

The Commission issued several questionnaires requesting data relating to sales pending in the market place.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, the Commission asked the domestic producers and the German and Japanese importers to report all LNPP bid solicitations that were then pending in the market place and requested them to submit detailed information describing the status of the bidding process for these bids.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, in its purchaser questionnaire, the Commission asked purchasers to report detailed bid information for sales that had been finalized during the period and for bids that were then pending.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Subsequently, the Commission staff conducted an investigation to determine how many of the bids pending in the market were to be awarded imminently. As the basis for this investigation, the staff obtained information for the sales that the various producers had identified as being pending in the market. In the case of almost two-thirds of these bids, information was obtained directly from the purchasers as to the status and the imminence of the sale.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For almost half of these sales, the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>chaser stated that the sale would be awarded before July 1997; for the other sales, the purchaser indicated that the sale was not imminent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Furthermore, for ten of the sales, the staff obtained a detailed description of the status of the bid process and the nature of the bids offered from the purchaser.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For the remaining sales, the Commission staff did not obtain information on the status of the sale directly from the purchaser but was able to obtain and report detailed information on the status of the sales and competition on the sale from producer and importer questionnaires. Staff Report at VII-7, Table VII-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Based on this information, the Commission concluded that one-third of these pending sales were more likely to occur in the near future than other pending sales. Views at 49 n.231.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the Commission\u2019s finding is contradicted by marketing data presented by them and the petitioner, showing a large number of orders, with a total value of more than $500 million to be awarded in the near future. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 28. Plaintiffs misunderstand the nature of the Commission\u2019s threat analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The Commission is required to assess whether imports are imminent and material injury would occur in the absence of an order. Because it takes years to complete the bid process, the Commission appropriately concluded that only pending bids, particularly those in which an award was imminent, were relevant to its threat analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s decision to include among imminent sales only the pending sales that purchasers confirmed were imminent was reasonable. The Commission has the discretion to assess the probative nature of the evidence obtained in its investigation and to determine whether to discount the evidence or to rely on it. <em>General Motors Corp. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 697, 703, 827 F. Supp. 774, 781 (1993). Here, the Commission declined to rely on producer estimates of sales dates when it could not obtain confirmations from the purchasers. <em>See e.g., U.S. Steel Group, </em>18 CIT at 1217-18, 873 F. Supp. at 698-99 (affirming Commission\u2019s reliance on lost sales data for which only complete data was obtained).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">The Court finds that the Commission\u2019s findings regarding the small number of imminent sales, in combination with the Commission\u2019s price analysis evidence cited above, could reasonably lead to the conclusion that the presence of the LTFV imports in the bidding process will likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>result in price suppression and depression. <em>See National Ass \u2019n of Mirror Mfrs., </em>12 CIT at 774, 696 F. Supp. at 644 (\u201cIt is within the Commission\u2019s discretion to make reasonable interpretations of the evidence ***.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">Plaintiffs are correct that the Commission staff did not pursue purchaser information on the status of the small number of pending additions sales on which petitioner was the sole bidder. However, this by itself is not conclusive. There is other evidence on the record that supports the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the subject producers would aggressively compete on other pending sales in the market. The Commission found that, of the imminent bids, the Japanese producers are directly competing with the domestic producers on more than seventy-five percent, which have an aggregate minimum Japanese bid value of more than $75 million. Views at 50 n.232 (citing Staff Report at VII-7). The German producers have submitted bids in competition with the domestic producers on more than seventy-five percent of the imminent sales, with an aggregate minimum German bid value of more than $80 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Thus, the Court finds the Commission\u2019s investigation was adequate to support its finding that the number of imminent sales was small, and that there is substantial evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s determination that, as a result, unfair imports would compete for those sales and may tend to suppress prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">6. Research and Development</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the Commission\u2019s findings with respect to the impact of subject imports on domestic producers\u2019 research and development (R&amp;D) activities were not supported by the evidence. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 38. Specifically, Plaintiffs assert \u201c [biased on the ITC\u2019s own findings, subject imports were present at what the ITC described as \u2018a significant level\u2019 throughout the POI * * *. Yet, that did not prevent Goss from spending a relatively constant amount annually on research and development, or from increasing its R&amp;D spending in years that imports increased * * <em>Id. </em>at 37. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s tables show that Goss\u2019s sales increased significantly from 1994 to 1995, while its R&amp;D expenditures decreased during the same period. <em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">The Commission found, \u201cthere is a relatively direct correlation between a producer\u2019s research and development expenditures and its sales revenues.\u201d Views at 51. The Commission concluded, \u201cthe continued significant presence of the subject imports in the market will significantly hamper the industry\u2019s ability to develop the advanced technologies necessary to stay competitive in this market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">The Commission based its finding in part on the testimony of witnesses for the petitioner noting that the petitioner\u2019s ability to commit capital to R&amp;D was directly linked to sales revenues. List 1, Doc. 285 at 62-65 (Transcript of Hearing, July 7,1996). Consistent with this testimony, the other evidence before the Commission shows that annual ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>penditures on R&amp;D fluctuated in the same direction as annual sales revenues for 1991-95 each year during the period of investigation. <em>See </em>Staff Report at VI-4 to VI-5 &amp; VI-23; <em>Cf. </em>Table VI-12 with Table VI-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments appear to ignore the data regarding the industry\u2019s R&amp;D expenditures in 1991, which were more than double those in any other year of the period under investigation. <em>Id. </em>In light of the industry\u2019s R&amp;D expenditures for 1991, it was reasonable for the Commission to conclude that there was a relatively direct correlation between a producer\u2019s R&amp;D expenses and its sales revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Furthermore, the Commission did not neglect the short-term data relied upon by the Plaintiffs. The Commission simply found that \u201cchanges in industry performance on a year-to-year basis\u201d is of limited utility. Views at 20. The Commission relied on the correlation between long-term declines in revenue and research spending, and the inverse relationship of these trends with the long-term increase in import penetration. The Commission has the discretion to make reasonable interpretations of the evidence and to determine the overall significance of any particular factor in its analysis. <em>Maine Potato Council v. United States, </em>9 CIT 293, 300, 613 F. Supp. 1237, 1244 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s determination on this issue is based entirely on the assumption that subject imports will continue to enter the U.S. market and take sales from the U.S. industry. Plaintiffs maintain that there is no evidence to support this assumption. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">However, as noted earlier, the Commission made specific findings regarding the value of the subject imports present in the domestic market during the period of investigation and the participation of subject producers in the bidding process for future sales indicating a likelihood of increased imports in the imminent future. <em>See supra </em>pp. 19-20. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s analysis appropriately focused on an assessment of the future impact of the subject imports on the industry\u2019s R&amp;D expenditures. Because the sales lost to subject imports began to affect the financials of the industry in 1996 and 1997, the Commission reasonably concluded that the industry\u2019s ability to commit money to R&amp;D efforts would be adversely impacted. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">7. The Commission\u2019s Vulnerability Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Plaintiffs argue that the Commission substituted a finding that the domestic industry was vulnerable for an analysis of the appropriate threat criteria. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 39, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">While the ITC did state that, \u201c[i]n these investigations, the vulnerability of the domestic industry is an important factor in our consideration of the threat of material injury from subject imports, \u201d Views at 48, the Commission did not substitute its finding of vulnerability for consideration of the statutory criteria. As summarized above, the ITC considered each of the statutory criteria relevant to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Furthermore, the ITC\u2019s consideration of the current state of the domestic industry was appropriate and relevant to this proceeding. <em>Calabrian Corp. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 342, 353, 794 F. Supp. 377, 387 (1992) (\u201cAlthough the statute specifies certain factors that the Commission must consider in its threat analysis, the Commission may consider \u2018other relevant economic factors.\u2019 * * *. The present relative health of an industry is an important indicator as to the imminence of material injury.\u201d); <em>see also Bando Chem., </em>17 CIT at 804 (1993) (affirming ITC finding of threat of material injury where the Commission first considered the vulnerability of the domestic industry).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">Plaintiffs also argue that \u201c[t]he ITC\u2019s \u2018[flinding\u2019 that Goss\u2019s [installed [b]ase in the United States [m]akes it <em>[m]ore </em>[vulnerable to [m] at erial [i]njury [d]efies [cjommon [s]ense * * Respondents\u2019 Brief at 32 (emphasis in the original). However, Plaintiffs misrepresent the Commission\u2019s findings. The Commission found that subject producers would have an incentive to compete aggressively on price with domestic producers, and particularly with Goss, due to Goss\u2019s \u201csignificant competitive advantage because of its large installed base of LNPPs, * * Views at 50. The Commission did not find, as Plaintiffs maintain, that \u201cGoss\u2019s competitive advantage from its installed base is a source of weakness that makes it <em>more </em>vulnerable rather than <em>less </em>vulnerabl\u00e9 to injury * * Respondents\u2019 Brief at 32 (emphasis in the original). The Commission stated only that Goss\u2019s advantage would lead subject importers to compete more aggressively in order to reduce that advantage. Thus, Goss\u2019s installed base was considered to be a factor in the Commission\u2019s analysis of price suppression, not in the Commission\u2019s vulnerability finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue, \u201cthe ITC cited absolutely no evidence for its conclusion that the industry\u2019s financial condition was likely to deteriorate quickly.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 39. Moreover, Plaintiffs argue, \u201cneither the ITC\u2019s decision nor its staff report contain any <em>financial </em>analysis showing that imports from the countries under investigation would be the cause of the projected financial harm to the petitioner or the other U.S. producers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">However, the Commission based its finding in part, on the fact that the value of contracts awarded to the domestic industry and its share of the market in terms of sales awarded declined significantly during 1994 and 1995, primarily due to the competition from the subject imports.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This court has previously upheld a Commission\u2019s finding of loss of market as proof that subject imports contributed to rendering the domestic industry vulnerable. <em>See Mitsubishi Materials Corp. v. United States, </em>20 CIT 328, 332, 918 F. Supp. 422, 426 (1996)(upholding Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>finding that \u201cdomestic producers were vulnerable to future imports because they had been deprived of the opportunity to expand capacity due to loss of market share in the Southern California market\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\">Plaintiffs concede that the financial consequences of any LNPP sale are spread out over the life of the contract delivery period. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 7 (citing Views at 23). Consequently, the full revenue impact of sales (or lost sales) will not show up in a producer\u2019s financial results for up to two or more years. Therefore, the Commission reasonably concluded that the adverse effects of the lost sales had not been fully reflected in the current financial condition of the industry, but that such effects would appear in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Furthermore, the Commission also noted that the domestic producers had projected a significant decline in order backlogs duringthe latter part of 1996. Views at 49. In addition, the petitioner had reported a gap in the production schedule for late 1996 and 1997, partly as a result of the decline in sales in 1996 and 1997. <em>Id. </em>Based on the whole record, the Court finds that the Commission\u2019s vulnerability analysis was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">8. The Impact of Possible Changes in the ITA\u2019s Dumping Margins</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that the magnitude of the dumping margins calculated by the ITA heavily influenced the ITC\u2019s determination. Plaintiffs have appealed the ITA\u2019s determinations in separate cases before this Court. Therefore, Plaintiffs maintain if the ITA changes the dumping margins announced for Plaintiffs as a result of appeal, \u201cthe Court should order the ITC to reconsider its determination to account for those changes, and to correct the other errors in its evaluation of the dumping margins.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 54. To the extent that Plaintiffs\u2019 argument rests on the theory that a subsequent change in margins in and of itself provides an adequate basis for remand to the Commission, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">The antidumping statute directs the Commission to consider the \u201cmagnitude of the margin of dumping\u201d in its injury analysis in any anti-dumping proceeding. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii)(V). Specifically, the statute defines the \u201cmagnitude of the margin of dumping\u201d in a final injury determination as the margin \u201cmost recently published by [the ITA] prior to the closing of the Commission\u2019s official record.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">The statute does not contemplate that a change in margins provides an automatic basis for remand to the Commission. In fact, the Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act recognizes that \u201c [t]he finality of injury determinations would be seriously compromised if the Commission was required to amend or revisit its determination each time the administering author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>ity modifiedits dumpingmargin.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>H.R. Doc. No. 103-316, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994) reprinted in Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Legislative History, Vol. VI, at 850 (\u201cSAA\u201d). Therefore, a subsequent change in margins does not automatically mandate a remand to the Commission by this Court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">B. Threat of Material Injury by Reason of LTFV Imports</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Due to the predictive nature of a threat of material injury determination, the ITC must use special care in making such a determination to avoid speculation or conjecture. <em>See </em>id. at 811. The ITC must make specific findings in support of its determination. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) 44, 51, 750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984)(citations omitted); <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(F)(ii) (\u201ca determination [of a threat of material injury] may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.\u201d). The Commission\u2019s findings must establish that the threat is imminent and caused by the subject imports. 19 U. S. C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(ii). \u201cEvidence of <em>de minimis </em>(e.g., minimal or tangential) causation of injury does not reach the causation level required under the statute.\u201d <em>Gerald Metals, </em>132 F.3d at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Plaintiffs argue the Commissions finding of a threat of material injury was unlawful. \u201cAt most the ITC\u2019s decision identified a possibility of future harm that would have existed whether or not an antidumping duty order was issued, simply as a result of past sales that would not have been affected by the issuance of antidumping orders.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief at 18. Therefore, Plaintiffs claim that the ITC failed to make the determinations required by the antidumping statue in order to find a threat of material injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">At oral argument, Plaintiffs maintained that the two-year delay in the financial effect of increased subject imports on the domestic industry, necessarily prevents the Commission from finding that a threat of material injury is imminent. In addition, counsel argued that the effects of past LTFV imports cannot legally form the basis for the determination that a threat of injury exists because such a finding requires a determination that the threat is from imports which will occur unless an order is issued. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Government\u2019s counsel however, noted that the statute specifically provides for a determination of material injury by reason of \u201csales for importation.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C.1677(7)(F)(i). It is precisely the lost sales experienced in 1994 and 1995, the Government argued, that subsequently rendered the domestic industry vulnerable. The vulnerability of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>dustry in combination with the adverse trends of increased subject imports and the small number of pending sales created the threat of material injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">The Court cannot accept Plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the statute. Here, after assessing all the relevant economic factors, the ITC completed a thorough analysis of the whole record. On this basis, the Commission reasonably concluded that the industry in the United States producing LNPP\u2019s is threatened with material injury by reason of imports from Germany and Japan that are sold at less than fair value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The Commission evaluated all the relevant statutory threat factors as well as some non-statutory economic factors. With respect to capacity, the Commission determined that although the subject producers\u2019 capacity utilization was high throughout the investigation period, that finding did not preclude a conclusion that further subject imports were imminent. The Commission also made specific findings regarding the value of subject imports present in the market during the period of investigation and the participation of subject producers in the bidding process for future sales, indicating a likelihood of increased imports in the imminent future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">With respect to the price effects of the subject merchandise, the Commission provided substantial evidence to support its conclusion that the participation of subject producers in the bidding process would tend to suppress or depress LNPP prices in the imminent future. The Commission also provided substantial evidence to support its conclusion that continued import competition will significantly hamper the industry\u2019s ability to develop the advanced technologies necessary to stay competitive in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">With respect to the vulnerability of the domestic industry, the Commission made specific findings regarding the decline in the industry\u2019s market share in 1994-95 that might not show up in the producer\u2019s financial results for two or more years<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>, the decline in domestic producer\u2019s projected order backlogs during the latter part of 1996, and the petitioner\u2019s reported gap in the 1996-97 production schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">The Commission also rendered an analytically distinct determination that LTFV imports themselves are causing a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. The Commission found that past LTFV imports had rendered the domestic industry vulnerable to future subject imports. An increase in these imports was imminent, which in turn, threatened material injury to the domestic industry because of their price-suppressing effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Although Plaintiffs are correct that some of the record evidence could lead to different conclusions, the ITC has the discretion to make reasonable interpretations of the evidence and to determine the overall significance of any particular factor in its analysis. <em>Maine Potato Council, </em>9 CIT at 300, 613 F.

Factor <em>V, </em>existing inventories of subject merchandise, is also relatively insignificant because LNPPs are sold on a made-to-order basis. Finally, Factor VII is not significant because this case does not involve any agricultural product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1011-8\"> In its brief to this Court, the Commission also argues that Plaintiffs have mischaracterized the table\u2019s 1996 data. \u201cThese numbers are not projections made by the Commission \u2018staff nor did the Commission characterize them as such * * *. [T]he table in question simply aggregates and reports interim 1996 sales data supplied by the domestic industry and the foreign producers * * Defendant\u2019s Brief at 43. However, whether the table represents projections or actual data, the fact is, the table indicates no sales of subject merchandise for at least part of 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1011-10\"> The record evidence shows that the value of contracts awarded to the subject imports increased from less than $5 million in 1993 to more than $85 million in 1994 and in 1995. Similarly, the market share held by subject imports increased from less than two percent in 1993 to more than thirty percent in 1994 and more than forty percent in 1995. Staff Report at IV-14, Table IV-6. However, the value and market share of imports also fluctuated in 1991-92. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1012-8\"> The current dispute is governed by the 1994 version of the antidumping statute. However, the relevant language has not changed. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b) (1994) (\u201cThe Commission shall make a final determination of whether \u2014 (A) an industry in the United States \u2014 (i) is materially injured, or (ii) is threatened with material injury, * * * by reason of imports, or sales* * * of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1014-6\"> <em>See e.g., Floral Trade Council v.

Table VI-3 does indicate that profit margins peaked in 1994, and then declined in 1995, when subject imports were increasing. <em>Id. </em>at VI-9, Table VI-3. At oral argument, government\u2019s counsel explained that Table VI-3 has greater reliability because it reflects sales in that year, while Tables VI-1 <em>&amp; </em>VI-2 are based on the companies unadjusted books and records. Thus, Tables VI-1 &amp; VT-2 do not reflect the lag time between sales and profits of LNPPs. In addition, the tables shouldbereadinlightof the fact thatinl994anumberofnon-competitivebidswereawardedtothe domestic industry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1016-7\"> Plaintiffs dispute this finding, arguing that the Commission\u2019s method for determining the number of sales pending in the marketplace was inadequate. For a discussion of the Commission\u2019s methodology see <em>infra </em>text pp. 34-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1016-8\"> The Commission also notes that Goss \"enjoys a significant competitive advantage because of its large installed base of LNPPs * <em>* </em>*. Given this factor,\u201d the Commission argued, \u201cit can be expected that the subject producers will have an incentive to aggressively compete on price with the petitioner and other domestic producers in order to cut into that installed base.\u201d Views at 50-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1019-7\"> Plaintiffs maintain that the Commission failed to conduct an adequate investigation of both quantity and future demand. Respondents\u2019 Brief at 41. Specifically, in challenging the Commission\u2019s investigation of pending bids, Plaintiffs rely on <em>Chung Ling Co. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 843, 805 P. Supp. 56, (1992), <em>and Mitsubishi Elec. Corp. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 1025, 700 P. Supp. 538 (1988), <em>aff'd, </em>898 F.2d 1577 (1990). Respondents\u2019 Brief at 47. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on these cases is misplaced as they are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">In <em>Chung Ling, </em>the court found that the information gathered was \u201cinadequate to furnish the Commission with any semblance of representative data in critical financial indicators of injury and causation.\u201d 16 CIT at 846, 805 P. Supp. at 61. Similarly, <em>in Mitsubishi Elec., </em>the court decided that the Commission erred in not seeking datarelevant to its inquiry. 12 CIT at 1059, 700 F. Supp. at 564. Here, the ITC followed its traditional practice of using data from producers and importers to measure quantity and future demand. <em>See e.g., U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>18 CIT 1190, 1218-19, 873 P. Supp. 673, 699 (1994), <em>aff'd, </em>96 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 1196).
