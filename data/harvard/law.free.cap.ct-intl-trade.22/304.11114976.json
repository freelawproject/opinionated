(collectively \u201cSanyo\u201d), bringthis action pursuant to Rule 56.2 of the Rules of this Court for judgment on the agency record contesting certain aspects of the Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration\u2019s (\u201cDOC\u201d or \u201cCommerce\u201d) final results of the administrative review entitled <em>Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, From Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>52 Fed.

Reg. 48825 (Nov. 27, 1985). On November 7,1986, Commerce published the preliminary results for the Third and Fourth Review Periods. <em>Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, from Japan; Preliminary Results of Antidump-ing Duty Administrative Review, </em>51 Fed. Reg. 40474. Commerce published the <em>Final Results </em>of the Third and Fourth Review Periods on March 20,1987, and for the Fourth Period, calculated a weighted average margin of dumping of <em>2.86% </em>for Sanyo. <em>Final Results </em>at 8947.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Sanyo argues that Commerce erred in its decision because Commerce\u2019s calculation of Sanyo\u2019s Foreign Market Value (\u201cFMV\u201d) and United States Price (\u201cUSP\u201d) during the relevant period was unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise not in accordance with law. Specifically, Sanyo maintains that Commerce erred in its: 1) determination to base statutory FMV on the price paid by Sanyo\u2019s dealers to its distributors, rather than on the price paid by Sanyo\u2019s distributors to Sanyo; 2) decision to reject Sanyo\u2019s level of trade adjustment after basing FMV on the price paid by Sanyo\u2019s dealers to its distributors; 3) calculation of Sanyo\u2019s home market advertising expenses; 4) refusal to adjust FMV to reflect home market warranty labor costs, and 5) decision to deduct the commodity tax from FM\\j rather than adding the tax to USE</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">For the reasons that follow, the Court holds valid plaintiffs\u2019 objections and remands to Commerce for reconsideration: 1) Commerce\u2019s determination of statutory FMV; 2) Sanyo\u2019s level of trade adjustment; 3) the calculation of home market advertising expenses; and 4) the treatment of the commodity tax. Commerce\u2019s refusal to deduct Sanyo\u2019s home market warranty labor costs as a direct expense from FMV is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The Standard of Review for ITA Determinations Requires Affirmation Unless A Determination Is Unsupported by Substantial Record Evidence Or Otherwise Not In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u201cThe Court shall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found * * * to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(1988). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217 (1938). \u201cThis restricted standard of review is reflective of the legislative intent that courts afford considerable deference to Commerce\u2019s expertise in administering the antidumping law. * * * [T]he deference granted to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutes it administers ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>tends to the methodology it applies to fulfill its statutory mandate.\u201d <em>GMN Georg Muller Nurnberg AG v. U.S., </em>15 CIT 174, 178, 763 F.Supp. 607, 611 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u201cThe proper role of this court, then, is \u2018to determine whether the methodology used by the ITA is in accordance with law,\u2019 and as \u2018long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v. U.S., </em>10 CIT 399, 404-05, 636 F.Supp. 961, 965-66 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Commerce\u2019s Decision To Base Statutory FMV On The Price Paid By Sanyo\u2019s Dealers To Its Distributors Is Remanded To Commerce Because Commerce Failed To Articulate A Rationale For Diverging From Its Methodology Used In The Prior Three Administrative Reviews</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673 (1988), Commerce is required to impose antidumping duties \u201cin an amount equal to the amount by which the foreign market value [\u201cFMV\u201d] exceeds the United States price for the merchandise.\u201d FMV is ordinarily the price at which the exporter sells the subject merchandise in its home market or to third countries other than the United States. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">However, when such sales in the home market are made to related parties, the statute does not require that those sales be used in determining FMV. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(3)(1988). <em>See Connors Steel Co. v. United States, </em>2 CIT 242, 245, 527 F. Supp. 350, 354 (1981) (\u201cCommon sense, of course, would indicate that strictly by themselves sales to a related purchaser would be a questionable guarantee of a fair home market price.\u201d). \u201cAs the statute does not specify the circumstances under which related party sales are to be used to calculate FMN Commerce must necessarily be accorded deference.\u201d <em>SSAB Svenskt Stal AB, v. United States, </em>976 F. Supp. 1027 (CIT 1997); <em>see Usinor Sacilor, Sollac, and GTS v. United States, </em>18 CIT 1155, 1158, 872 F. Supp. 1000, 1004 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The implementing regulation in effect during the Fourth Review Period provided that the ITA would not use the home-market, related party sale in computing FMV unless it was \u201cdemonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary to be at prices comparable to those at which such or similar merchandise is sold to a person unrelated to the seller.\u201d 19 C.F.R. 353.22(b) (1988). The burden is placed on the manufacturer to demonstrate that its prices to the related parties are at arm\u2019s length. <em>Mitsubishi Heavy Indus., Ltd. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 1024, 1029, 833 F. Supp. 919, 924 (1993); <em>NTN Bearing Corp. of America v. United States, </em>905 F. Supp. 1083, 1100 (CIT 1995). When the manufacturer is able to demonstrate that the sales to its related party were made at arm\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>length, Commerce will use these sales to calculate FMV <em>See Sugiyama Chain Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 423, 435, 852 F. Supp. 1103, 1113 (1994). When the importer is unable to bear this burden, Commerce will calculate FMV based on sales of such or similar merchandise at the most comparable commercial level of trade. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.19 (1988). For example, Commerce may calculate FMV based upon the sales by the related party to the first unrelated party. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.22(a)(1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">To make its arm\u2019s length determination, Commerce normally compares information obtained on the manufacturer\u2019s sales to related parties and to unrelated parties, net of discounts, rebates, and commissions. <em>Galvanized Carbon Steel Sheet From Australia; Final Determination Of Sales At Less Than Fair Value, </em>49 Fed. Reg. 49134 (Dec. 18, 1984). If the prices are comparable, Commerce will use the related party sales price as a basis for FMV <em>See Usinor Sacilor, Sollac, and GTS, </em>18 CIT at 1157, 872 F.Supp. at 1002 (Commerce compares the weighted average price of total sales to the related customer with the same to the unrelated customer).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In the <em>Final Results, </em>Commerce based FMV on the sales price paid by Sanyo\u2019s related distributors to its unrelated dealers. Commerce\u2019s explanation for its decision to base FMV on Sanyo\u2019s distributors\u2019 resale prices to Sanyo\u2019s dealers is found in Comment 31 in the <em>Final Results-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">Comment 31: Sanyo argues that for the fourth period the Department erred in basing FMV on prices from Sanyo\u2019s related and unrelated distributors, and should base FMV instead on prices from Sanyo to its distributors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">Department\u2019s Position: We disagree. Of all sales to distributors in the fourth period, Sanyo had only one sale of one unit to an unrelated distributor at a price equal to its prices to related distributors. That sale was less than one percent of all such sales. We do not consider this sufficient to determine that sales to related distributors were made at arm\u2019s length and, accordingly, we base FMV on sales made by the related distributors to unrelated dealers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\"><em>Final Results </em>at 8943. Commerce added without further explanation in Comment 33 that its decision did not constitute an improper retroactive decision, and that it was consistent with 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.22(b) which had been in effect since 1980. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Sanyo contends that Commerce erred by rejecting an FMV calculation based on Sanyo\u2019s sales prices to its related distributors. Sanyo asserts that it sufficiently demonstrated that its sales price to its related distributor represented an arm\u2019s length transaction since the record indicates that Sanyo sold one television at an identical price to its unrelated distributor during the Fourth Review. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs Memo. In Support of Mot. For Judgment On The Agency Record (\u201cPlaintiffs Memo\u201d) at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">In all three prior administrative reviews, Commerce used Sanyo\u2019s prices to distributors in the home market to calculate FMV even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the number of sales to unrelated parties was similarly insubstantial. <em>See e.g., </em>Plaintiffs Memo at 10 (during Second Period of Review, Sanyo sold 1 unit to an unrelated party and 99 units to related parties). The \u201cprocess of validation [of related party sales prices] is not dependent on any fixed relative volume of sales.\u201d <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>9 CIT 110, 114, 606 F. Supp. 695, 700 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In its brief, the government argues that the rejection of Sanyo\u2019s prices to related distributors is in conformity with Commerce\u2019s general practice. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the government concedes that a remand to Commerce is required since the record of the Fourth Review Period fails to articulate a clear rationale for distinguishing Commerce\u2019s decision in the Fourth Review from Commerce\u2019s use of Sanyo\u2019s prices to related distributors in prior reviews. The government acknowledges that in prior reviews, \u201cinsubstantial\u201d sales to unrelated parties were used for testing the arm\u2019s length nature of Sanyo\u2019s related party prices. Defendant\u2019s Memo in Partial Opp. To Mot. for Jdmt. UponAgency Record at 12 (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Response\u201d). The government has agreed to a remand to reconsider and explain further the rationale used for its decision or, if found necessary, provide an alternative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Under the applicable statutes and regulations, Commerce has considerable discretion in deciding whether to include related party sales for the calculation of foreign market value. <em>NTN Bearing Corp. of America v. United States, </em>905 F. Supp. 1083, 1100 (CIT 1995). On the other hand, an administrative agency, generally, must cite the reasons for its decision so that the reviewing court may ascertain whether the agency has acted arbitrarily. <em>NTN Bearing Corp. of America v. United States, </em>903 F. Supp. 62, 67 (CIT 1995); <em>Sugiyama Chain Co., Ltd v. United States, </em>880 F. Supp. 869, 873 (CIT 1995) (\u201cObviously, Commerce cannot be permitted to act arbitrarily or capriciously in its choice of methodology.\u201d). Thus, while Commerce has the flexibility to change its position, it must provide a basis for its change. The rule assures that an administrative agency will be \u201cfaithful and not indifferent to the rule of law\u201d and \u201cprohibits] the agency from adopting significantly inconsistent policies that result in the creation of \u2018conflicting lines of precedent governing the identical situation.\u2019\u201d <em>Cultivos Miramonte S.A. and Flores Mocari S.A. v. United States, </em>980 F. Supp. 1268 at n.6 (CIT 1997)(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In the <em>Final Results, </em>Commerce neglected to adequately explain the reasoning behind its departure from the methodology originally used in the first three reviews where it based FMV on the price paid by Sanyo to its\u2019 distributors. The only explanation given by Commerce was that Sa-nyo\u2019s sale to its unrelated distributor in the Fourth Review Period represented less than one percent of total sales. However, as the government acknowledges, this reasoning ignores the fact that for the prior three re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>views, Commerce used \u201cinsubstantial\u201d sales to unrelated parties to test the arm\u2019s length nature of the related party transactions. Therefore, this issue is remanded to Commerce to explain the reason for its departure from its previously used methodology in the calculation of FMY or to implement the methodology used in the first three review periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Level of Trade Adjustment Issue Is Remanded To Commerce For Consideration In Conjunction With The Related Party Price Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Congress does not address level of trade adjustments, however, Commerce, by regulation has provided adjustments to account for the difference between wholesale and retail markets. The regulation in effect at the time of the pertinent review requires that \u201c[t]he comparison of the United States price with the applicable price in the market of the country of exportation * * * generally will be made at the same commercial level of trade.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.19 (1988). However, if sales of the merchandise are at different levels of trade, then in the United States or in the applicable market \u201cthe comparison will be made at the nearest comparable commercial level of trade and appropriate adjustments will be made for differences affecting price comparability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In the <em>Final Results, </em>Commerce refused Sanyo a \u201clevel of trade\u201d adjustment because Sanyo did not demonstrate \u201cwhat portion of the distributors\u2019 selling expenses were solely related to their sales of comparison models\u201d. <em>Final Results </em>at 8943 (Comment 32). However, for the Fourth Review, a level of trade adjustment would only be applicable if FMV continues to be determined on the basis of the sales price from Sanyo\u2019s related distributor to its unrelated dealer. Therefore, as the parties have requested, this issue is remanded to Commerce for reconsideration with the FMV price issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The Court Remands The Issue Of Advertising Expenses To Commerce to Recalculate These Expenses Pursuant To The Product-Line Methodology</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The Tariff Act of 1930, \u00a7 773(a)(4)(B), as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(4)(B)(1988) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]n determining foreign market value, if it is established * * * that the amount of any difference between the United States price and the foreign market value * * * is wholly or partly due to* * * other differences in circumstances of sales * * * then due allowance shall be made therefor.\u201d Under the ITA regulations, circumstances of sales adjustments are \u201climited, in general, to those circumstances which bear a direct relationship to the sales which are under consideration.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.15(a) (1988) (currently codified as 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.56(a)(2) (1997)). Section 353.1505) provides for adjustments to FMV for advertising and other selling expenses assumed by the seller that are attributable toa later sale by the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The DOC currently uses the product-line methodology<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to calculate advertising expenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both parties concur that Sanyo\u2019s advertising expenses should be calculated using a product-line allocation methodology rather than the model-specific methodology.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memo at 28; Defendant\u2019s Response at 31 and cases cited therein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sanyo, however, contends that Commerce should accept its originally submitted advertising expenses which were calculated under the product-line methodology.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The government while acknowledging that the product-line methodology should be used, maintains that advertising and sales promotion expenses should be treated as costs and examined at the time at which they are incurred. Thus, any advertising expenses falling outside the period of review are excluded. Defendant\u2019s Response at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Generally, cases which addressed the proper advertising expense methodology simply ordered a remand for purposes of recalculation pursuant to the product-line methodology without specifying allocation methodology. <em>See, e.g., Zenith Electronics Corp. v. United States, </em>14 CIT 831, 848, 755 F. Supp. 397, 414 <em>(1990); AOC Int\u2019l, Inc. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 716, 725, 721 F.

Cir. 1996); <em>see, generally, NEC Home Electronics Ltd., supra. </em>There are a few cases, however, that provide guidance and parallel analogies.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In <em>Color Televisions Receivers From Korea; Final Results Of Anti-dumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>51 Fed. Reg. 41365 (Nov. 14, 1986) (Comment 14), the petitioners claimed that Samsung overstated its home market advertising expense claim by including expenses incurred outside the review period. In response, the DOC stated that \u201c [w]e believe an allocation of advertising expenses, which includes expenses outside the review period over sales made during that same period, still presents an accurate estimation of the expense for the review period as a whole. Because an advertising claim is by nature not sales-specific, a reasonable estimate is acceptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41367.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In a challenge to that final determination, the petitioners again argued that Commerce\u2019s methodology was unlawful because Commerce \u201cused expenses in its calculation that occurred outside of the review pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>riod,\u201d and reasoned that this methodology may allow Samsung to \u201cmanipulate the determination by artificially decreasing its dumping margins, \u201d since the outside advertising expenses were \u201cuncharacteristically high.\u201d <em>Independent Radionic Workers of America v. United States, </em>18 CIT 851, 862 F. Supp. 422, 429 (1994) (Where the review period covered 4/25/84-3/31/85 and the DOC prorated the month of April advertising expense because Samsung could not provide a daily breakdown of advertising expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The court held that since advertising expenses \u201care of a nature that prevents a sales-specific calculation * <em>? </em>* some allocation must be made in order to follow the regulation. \u201d Moreover, \u201cthis allocation methodology is not contrary to Commerce\u2019s standard practice. In fact, Commerce has used a pro rata allocation method in other determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429 (citations omitted); <em>cf. AOC Int\u2019l. Inc. v. United States, </em>13 CIT at 721-22, 721 F.

Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">For supporting authority, the government cites to the <em>Study of Antidumping Adjustments Methodology and Recommendations for Statutory Change </em>(November 1985) <em>(\u201cthe Study\u201d) </em>and two Final Determinations. The court finds that government\u2019s reliance on those authorities is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\"><em>The Study </em>states only that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">We make adjustments for differences in * * * advertising.

Thus the petitioners argued that the DOC \u201cshould allow, as part of any advertising expense claim, only those actual expenses recorded in Samsung\u2019s advertising expense ledger in the months covered by our investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Samsung countered by claiming that \u201cunder generally accepted accounting principles, the accrual method is considered more accurate than the cash method.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response, the DOC found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">[w]ith regard to the method of recording advertising expenses, we consider the accrual method to be more accurate than the cash method because the former recognizes expenses actually incurred by the company for activities undertaken during the review period, while the latter recognizes expenses that relate to a company\u2019s activities during a previous period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 44190 (emphasis added). Thus, the DOC\u2019s position there actually supports Sanyo\u2019s argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Moreover, Sanyo argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">in its initial Questionnaire Response in the Fourth Review, dated July 8,1983, submitted in response to the DOC\u2019s April 25,1983 request for information, in which Sanyo reported its advertising and sales promotion expenses on a product line basis, Sanyo did not allocate third period costs over fourth period sales. Instead Sanyo divided total advertising costs incurred for television sets for the 58th term by the total yen value of television sets sold for the 58th term, to obtain total costs as a percentage of selling price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Plaintiffs Reply Memorandum at 5. The 58th term represents Sanyo\u2019s fiscal year from 12/1/81 through 11/30/82 thereby overlapping with both the third and fourth administrative reviews. Commerce\u2019s \u201cpractice is to adhere to an individual firms\u2019 recording of costs in accordance with GAAP of its home country if [Commerce is] satisfied that such principles reasonably reflect the costs of producingthe subject merchandise. \u201d <em>Cultivos Miramonte S.A. and Flores Mocari S.A., </em>980 F. Supp. 1268 (CIT 1997); <em>see also NTN Bearing Corp. of America v. United States, </em>905 F. Supp. at 1094 (\u201cCommerce points out that its long-established practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>has been to accept a respondent\u2019s accounting methodology so long as that methodology is reasonable and is used in the respondent\u2019s normal course of business\u201d); <em>Fag U.K. Ltd. v. United States, </em>945 F. Supp. 260, 271 (CIT 1996) (\u201creliance on an individual firm\u2019s home country GAAP provides an objective standard by which to measure costs, and allows a respondent a predictable basis on which to compute costs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Accordingly, the issue of advertising costs is remanded to Commerce to recalculate this circumstance of sale expense in accordance with the product-line methodology and pursuant to the accounting system and original numbers used and submitted by Sanyo.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The DOC\u2019S Refusal To Adjust FMV For Sanyo\u2019s Warranty Labor Costs Was Supported By Substantial Evidence And In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">As previously discussed, \u00a71677b(a)(4)(B) gives Commerce the authority to adjust FMV to account for differences in the circumstances of sale between the home market and the export market. <em>See Zenith Electronics Corp. v. United States, </em>988 F.2d 1573, 1583 (Fed. Cir. <em>1993)(\u201cZenith I\u201d). </em>Circumstances of sale are those which \u201cbear a direct relation to the sales which are under consideration\u201d, and thus are treated as direct expenses. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.15(a)(1988). Examples of differences in circumstances of sale for which reasonable allowance generally will be made include warranties. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.15(b)(1987); <em>see Zenith Electronics Corp. v. United States, </em>77 F.3d 426, 433 (Fed. Cir. <em>1996)(\u201cZenith II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The Department of Commerce \u201callows, \u2018as direct selling expenses, the costs of free parts supplied * * * in servicing\u2019 warranties, as well as other direct expenses such as * * * \u2018payments to unrelated firms for performing servicing.\u2019\u201d <em>Zenith II </em>at 433-34<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (quoting <em>The Study </em>at 45). Allowable warranty expenses must be variable costs associated with the merchandise used as the basis of FMV <em>The Study </em>at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">However, when the firms performing warranty services are related, \u201cCommerce has consistently treated payments to [them] as intracorpo-rate transfers of funds rather than as expenses directly related to sales. \u201d <em>Zenith I </em>at 1583 (citations omitted). In order to qualify for an adjustment of FMV Commerce requires an exporter to demonstrate that its payments to related companies are at competitive rates, or at arm\u2019s length. <em>Id. </em>at 1584.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In its <em>Final Results, </em>the DOC deducted the full amount of Sanyo\u2019s warranty costs from its selling price to calculate USP and deducted only Sanyo\u2019s warrantyparte costs from its selling price to calculate FMV The DOC treated Sanyo\u2019s warranty labor costs as an indirect selling expense because \u201cSanyo\u2019s service contractor is related to Sanyo\u201d. <em>Final Results </em>at 8943-44 (Comment 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Sanyo argues that the DOC erred by treating its home market warranty labor costs as an indirect selling expense. Sanyo asserts that these labor charges are variable expenses paid to a contractor. In addition, Sa-nyo asserts first that it \u201c satisfied the DOC that it dealt with related suppliers on an arm\u2019s length basis,\u201d pointing to the DOC\u2019s Verification Report for the Third and Fourth Review Period dated August 14,1986. Plaintiffs Reply at 8. Second, Sanyo claims that Commerce never requested specific documentation confirming the arm\u2019s length nature of its payments for warranty labor, and therefore Sanyo could not comply with supplying the required information. Plaintiffs Reply at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The Government concurs that Sanyo demonstrated that its warranty labor costs are variable, but contends that Sanyo failed to demonstrate that the warranty labor costs are at arms length. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Response at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The Court finds Sanyo\u2019s arguments unpersuasive. As to Sanyo\u2019s first contention, a review of the Verification Report reveals that the confirmation related only to warranty parts costs and not warranty labor costs. <em>See </em>Report of Verification dated Aug. 14,1986 attached to Defendant\u2019s Confidential Appendix at 21-15. The DOC deducted warranty parts costs as a direct selling expenses. Accordingly, Sanyo made no showing that its\u2019 service company, Sanyo Service Co., Ltd., performed warranty labor at arm\u2019s length.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">As to Sanyo\u2019s second contention, the Court reiterates that the applicable regulations presume that a related party price will not be used by Commerce unless the respondent demonstrates that the price is at arm\u2019s length price. The burden is properly placed on the respondent and not Commerce to come forth with the required information.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Therefore, the Court finds that Commerce\u2019s determination to reject Sanyo\u2019s home market warranty labor costs as a direct selling expense in its calculation was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The Court Remands To The DOC For Recalculation Of The Adjustments For The Rebated Japanese Commodity Tax</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(l)(C)(1988), Commerce is required to increase the USP by the \u201camount of any taxes imposed in the country of exportation directly upon the exported merchandise* * * which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the merchandise to the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In the <em>Final Results, </em>the DOC deducted the commodity tax paid by Sa-nyo from FMV As Sanyo has argued and the government has acknowledged, this methodology is not in accordance with law. Consequently, this issue is remanded to Commerce for recalculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs\u2019 motion is granted in part and denied in part. On remand, Commerce is instructed 1) to recalculate FMV based on the price paid by Sanyo to its unrelated distributor or to provide a rationale for calculating FMV based on the price paid by Sanyo\u2019s distributors to its dealers; 2) to reconsider the level of trade adjustment issue in conjunction with the foregoing; 3) to recalculate the amount of home market advertising expenses under the product-line methodology using the figures originally submitted by Sanyo; and 4) to increase the USP by the amount of any commodity tax paid by Sanyo. Commerce has ninety (90) days to conduct the remand proceeding. Commerce\u2019s determination in all other respects is sustained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> Sanyo points out, and the court concurs, that the government has cited no authority or administrative decisions to stand for the proposition that Commerce\u2019s normal practice is to disregard sales to unrelated parties if there is an insufficient number of sales. Indeed, at oral argument, the government conceded that there was no legal authority on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> The product line methodology allocates advertising expenses incurred over total home market sales. <em>See Monsanto Co. v. United </em>States, 12 CIT 937, 948-49, 698 F. Supp. 275, 284-85 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\"> \u201cThe decision to selecta particular methodology rests solely within Commerce\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Hercules, Inc. v. United States, </em>673 F. Supp. 454, 469 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> The model-specific methodology treats advertising expenses as direct expenses only if they were incurred as a result of promoting the home market comparison model. <em>See Television Receiving Sets, Monochrome and Color, From Japan; Final Results of Administrative Review of Antidumping Finding, </em>50 Fed. Reg. 24278, 24282 (June 10,1985) (Comment 11).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> The DOC rejected the previously used model-specific allocation because it: \u201c(1) [l]eads to inaccurate and erratic results in many instances since most companies do not keep advertising records on a model-specific basis; (2) is susceptible to manipulation by foreign companies in order to reduce dumping margins; and (3) is unnecessarily burdensome for both respondents and the Department.\u201d <em>NEC Home Electronic, Ltd. v. United </em>States, 18 CIT 336 (1994), <em>aff'd in part, vacated in part, on other grounds, </em>54 F.3d 736 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> In Sanyo\u2019s original submission to the DOC, it calculated advertising expenses using the product-line methodology by <em>multiplying </em>the percentage of total advertisingcosts over total sales for the 58th term (fiscal year 12/1/81-11/30/82), <em>see </em>Plaintiffs Reply at 5, against the net selling price for the models sold in the review period. For the Fourth Period, Sanyo obtained a cost of \u00a511,129 verified by the DOC on October 24-25, 1983. Plaintiffs Memo at 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\"> The government conceded at oral argujnent that <em>the Study </em>did not support its argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\"> The issue presented in <em>Zenith II </em>was \u201cwhether the court erred in concluding that the [respondents\u2019] in-house warranty labor costs were not \u2018fixed\u2019\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 433. The court held that in-house warranty labor costs are considered \u201cserviceman\u2019s wages\u201d which are treated as indirect warranty expenses since they would have been incurred regardless of the sales under consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 426. Thus, the lower court properly treated the in-house warranty labor expenses as indirect. In addition, the appellate court found that the warranty labor expenses were fixed indirect expenses because they did not vary from month to month in accordance with the quantity of the product sold. <em>Id. </em>at 434. The issue of relatedness never arose in <em>Zenith II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\"><em>Zenith I, </em>on the other hand, more closely resembles this case. There, Commerce refused to deduct warranty labor costs since Mitsbushi and NEC each employed a related warranty service company. <em>Id. </em>at 1579. Commerce refused the deduction because Mitsubishi failed to show that the service company made a profit on the services provided to the manufacturer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
