Reg. 49,727 (Sept. 23,1996) <em>(\u201cFinal Results\u201d), </em>as unsupported by substantial evidence and contrary to law. They claim that Commerce was required to revoke the Antidumping Duty Order as it applied to Wieland.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Commerce admits that it failed to provide the parties with an opportunity to comment on some of the information upon which it relied in making its determination not to revoke the Antidumping Duty Order. Consequently, Commerce asks for a remand in order to provide the parties with an opportunity to comment, and to enable Commerce to reconsider its determination in light of any comments received. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants Commerce\u2019s request. This Court has jurisdiction under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2) (1994) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The <em>Final Results </em>at issue are the eighth administrative review of the Antidumping Duty Order concerning brass sheet and strip from Germany. <em>See Antidumping Duty Order; Brass Sheet and Strip from the Federal Republic of Germany, </em>52Fed. Reg. 6997 (Mar. 6,1987) (\u201cOrder\u201d). That Order was the result of an antidumpinginvestigation initiated at the request of Defendant-Intervenors Hussey Copper, Ltd., The Miller Company, Outokumpu American Brass, Revere Copper Products, Inc., International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, International Union, Allied Industrial Workers of America (AFL-CIO), Mechanics Educational Society of America (Local 56), and United Steelworkers of America (AFL-CIO/CLC) (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d), among others not participating in this appeal. <em>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Brass Sheet and Strip From the Federal Republic of Germany, </em>52 Fed. Reg. 822 (Jan. 9, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">At Wieland\u2019s request, Commerce initiated this review for the purpose of determiningthe dumpingmargin and considering whether the Order should be revoked as it applied to Wieland. <em>See Initiation of Antidump-ing and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 19,017 (Apr. 14, 1995). Previously, Commerce had found that Wieland had a <em>de minimis </em>margin in both the sixth and seventh administrative reviews. <em>See Brass Sheet and Strip From Germany; Final Results of An-tidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 38,542, 38,546 (Jul. 27,1995) and Brass <em>Sheet and Strip From Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 38,031, 38,035 (Jul. 25, 1995), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">On May 6,1996, Commerce issued its preliminary results, finding a <em>de minimis </em>dumpingmargin and indicating that it intended to grant Wie-land\u2019s request to revoke the Order. <em>Brass Sheet and Strip From Germany; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review andNoticeofIntent To Revoke Order inPart, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 20,214 (May 6, 1996) <em>(\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). </em>After the <em>Preliminary Results </em>were issued, Petitioners expressed concern about the intent to revoke and submitted new factual information on the issue of whether it was likely that Wieland would resume dumping. Commerce rejected that information as untimely, but subsequently collected additional information on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>own. That data included the information untimely submitted by Petitioners and rejected by Commerce pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.31(a)(3) (1996). <em>See </em>Final Results Analysis Mem. at 3, Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d), Fiche 14, Fr. 1. Commerce had rejected two articles <em>(BoersonZeitung </em>from March 5, 1996 and <em>Handelsblatt </em>from March 7,1996) as well as statistical information regarding U.S. imports of brass, and then gathered the same information. <em>See </em>June 5,1996 Pet. Case Brief, at appendix 1 to Def.-Int. \u2019s Oppos. To Plaintiffs Mot. for Jdmt on the Agency Record and Final Results Analysis Mem., Appendix 2, AR, Fiche 14, Fr. 1. Commerce also obtained material that it had not previously rejected as untimely. Those articles were from the following publications: <em>Metal Bulletin, Purchasing, Metal Statistics, American Metal Market, </em>and <em>1985 U.S. Foreign Trade Highlights. Final Results, </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 49730-31; Final Results Analysis Mem., Appendix 2, AR, Fiche 14, Fr. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Although Commerce used this information in reaching its <em>Final Results, </em>it failed to provide the parties with an opportunity to comment upon it. Subsequently, even though the investigation resulted in a zero dumping margin for Wieland, Commerce did not revoke the Order with respect to Wieland. <em>Final Results, </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 49,732. Commerce was not satisfied that there was no likelihood that Wieland would resume dumping if the order were revoked. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">In reviewing a final ITA determination, this Court will \u201chold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found * * * to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B). \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018is something less than the weighing of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) 44, 51, 750 F.2d 927, 933 (1984) (quoting <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-20 (1966)). The Court is not to weigh the quality or quantity of the evidence or to reject finding on grounds of a \u201cdiffering interpretation\u201d of the record. <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 955, 962, 699 F. Supp. 300, 306 (1988), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>894 F.2d 385 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">In reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of the statute that the agency administers, the Court\u2019s initial inquiry is to determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). \u201cIf Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>provision of the statute by regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843-44. Consequently, \u201c[t]he court will defer to the agency\u2019s construction of the statute as a permissible construction if it \u2018reflects a plausible construction of the plain language of the statute[s] and does not otherwise conflict with Congress\u2019 express intent.\u2019\u201d <em>Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>82 F.3d 1039, 1044 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Commerce Applied The Correct Legal Standard Because The Phrase \u201cno likelihood of\u201d Has The Same Meaning As \u201cnot likely to\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Wieland\u2019s primary argument is that the phrase \u201cno likelihood\u201d sets a different and higher standard than the words \u201cnot likely to\u201d. As a matter of proof, Wieland has failed to carry its burden to establish that proposition, and as a matter of law, it fails under standard rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The statute provides that \u201c [t]he administering authority may revoke, in whole or in part, * * * an antidumping duty order or finding, * * * after [a periodic review of amount of duty]. * * *\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(d)(1) (1994). Commerce has implemented regulations in accordance with the broad discretion granted to it by the statute. Commerce\u2019s regulations provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The Secretary may revoke an order in part if the Secretary concludes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">(i) One or more producers or resellers covered by the order have sold the merchandise at not less than foreign market value for a period of at least three consecutive years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">(ii) It is not likely that those persons will in the future sell the merchandise at less than foreign market value; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">(iii) For producers or resellers that the Secretary previously has determined to have sold the merchandise at less than foreign market value, the producers or resellers agree in writingto their immediate reinstatement in the order, as long as any producer or reseller is subject to the order, if the Secretary concludes under \u00a7 353.22(f) that the producer or reseller, subsequent to the revocation, sold the merchandise at less than foreign market value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.25(a)(2)(i) (1996). Thus, in addition to three consecutive years of zero or <em>de minimis </em>dumpingmargins and certification that they will agree to the reinstatement of the order if necessary, Commerce must be satisfied that the respondents are not likely to dump in the future before it will revoke the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">The parties agree that Wieland satisfied the first and third requirements, but hotly contest whether Wieland is likely to dump again, i.e., the second requirement. Wieland claims that Commerce used the incorrect legal standard with regard to this issue. In refusing to revoke the Order, Commerce stated: \u201cthe Department must * * * be satisfied that there is no likelihood of resumption of dumping* * * before revoking an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>order* * * (19 C.F.R. <em>353.25(a)(2)(H))Final Results, </em>at 49730. Wieland claims that \u201c[t]his language requires the Department to be <em>absolutely certain </em>that no dumping will recur [in contravention to 19 C.F.R. 353.25(a)(2) (ii)].\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Mem. In Supp. of Mot. for Jdmt at 4 (emphasis in original). According to Wieland, this is a different standard than that set forth in the statute and regulation allowing Commerce the discretion to revoke a dumping order when it is \u201cnot likely that\u201d those persons will in the future engage in dumping. Wieland\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">In 1989, Commerce amended the regulations to change the language in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.25(a)(2)(ii) from \u201cno likelihood\u201d to \u201cnot likely\u201d to engage in future dumping. <em>Compare </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.54(a) (1988) (no likelihood), <em>with </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.25(a) (1996) (not likely). Commerce never offered an explanation for the change in wording. However, in discussing the comments it received in response to the proposed change, Commerce stated: \u201c[t]he statute gives the Secretary broad discretion in deciding when to revoke an order. The Secretary has determined that a pre-condition of revocation under this paragraph is that the Secretary be satisfied that there is no likelihood of future sales at less than foreign market value.\u201d <em>Antidumping Duties; Final Rule, </em>54 Fed. Reg. 12,742, 12,758 (Mar. 28,1989) (revising 19 C.F.R. Part 353). Subsequently, Commerce has \u201cused the phrases \u2018not likely\u2019 and \u2018no likelihood\u2019 interchangeably, and consistently failed to draw a legal distinction between the two. * * <em>*\u201d Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Determination Not To Revoke Order In Part; Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors of One Megabyte or Above From The Republic of Korea, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 39,809, 39,813 (July 24, 1997) <em>(\u201cDRAMS From Korea\u201d)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>-, see Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice From Brazil; Final Results and Termination in Part of Antidumping Administrative Review; Revocation in Part of the Antidumping Duty Order, </em>56 Fed. Reg. 52,510, 52,511 (Oct. 21, 1991) (Commerce stated \u201c[w]e conclude from the evidence in the record that there is no likelihood of future sales at less than foreign market value. * * *\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Commerce\u2019s use of the phrases \u201cno likelihood\u201d and \u201cnot likely\u201d is in accordance with the normal usages of the English language because these phrases mean the same thing. <em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>defines \u201clikelihood\u201d as \u201cthe quality or fact of being likely or probable\u201d <em>.Id. </em>at 948, vol. VIII (2d ed. 1989). \u201cLikely\u201d is defined as \u201c[h]aving an appearance of truth or fact; that looks as if it would happen, be realized, or prove to be what is alleged or suggested; probable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 949. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>defines \u201clikelihood\u201d as \u201cprobability\u201d and \u201clikely\u201d as \u201cof such a nature or so circumstanced as to make something probable\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1310 (1993). Thus, the phrases at issue have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the same meaning and can be used interchangeably. Commerce did not err in the legal standard it applied in the <em>Final Results.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">This Case Is Remanded To Commerce To Allow The Parties To Comment On Certain Information</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Wieland also argues that Commerce\u2019s use of information that was obtained after the preliminary results were issued is contrary to law and that such information should be stricken from the record. Wieland claims that the Court should order Commerce to revoke the Order as it applies to Wieland because there is support on the record for revocation. Commerce admits that it did rely on information on which the parties were not given an opportunity to comment. Commerce requests a remand to rectify this error. The Court rejects Wieland\u2019s argument and remands to allow the parties to comment on that information and for Commerce to reconsider its decision not to revoke the Order in view of the comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The statute provides that the record for review by this Court is, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201ca copy of all information presented to or obtained by the Secretary, the administering authority, or the Commission during the course of the administrative proceeding. * * *\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(2)(A)(i) (1994). In collecting information, Commerce \u201cmay request any person to submit factual information at any time during the proceeding.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.31(b)(1) (1996).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">[t]he administering authority * * * before making a final determination * * * shall cease collecting information and shall provide the parties with a final opportunity to comment on the information obtained by the administering authority * * * upon which the parties have not previously had an opportunity to comment. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g) (1994). Thus, Commerce has great discretion as to how and when it collects information so long as it gives the parties an opportunity to comment on that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Interested parties may also give information to Commerce. However, Commerce\u2019s regulations provide: \u201c[t]he Secretary will not consider in the final determination or the final results, or retain in the record of the proceeding, any factual information submitted after the applicable time limit. * * *\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.31(a)(3) (1996). Commerce must provide an opportunity for the parties to comment on information submitted to it before it makes a determination. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The Court must decide whether Commerce may strike untimely information submitted to it by a party, gather, <em>inter alia, </em>the identical information, and then rely upon the information in the final decision without giving the parties the opportunity to comment on the information. Here, petitioners attempted to add information to the record after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the deadline for submission of factual information. While Commerce did strike this information from the record, it then gathered the same information as well as other information and relied on it in the <em>Final Results </em>without giving the parties an opportunity to comment on it. Final Results Analysis Mem. at 3, AR, Fiche 14, Fr. 1; <em>see Final Results, </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 49730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u201cAntidumpingproceedings are investigatory, not adjudicatory.\u201d <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 86, 92, 630 F. Supp. 1327, 1333 (1986) (citations omitted); <em>see NEC Corp. v. United States, </em>978 F. Supp. 314, 329 (CIT 1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute clearly permits Commerce to obtain information on its own initiative rather than just relying on information submitted to it. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(2)(A) and \u00a7 1677m(g) (1994). As a result, Commerce has an obligation to investigate by gathering information either on its own initiative or through submissions to it. <em>See Freeport Minerals Co. v. United States, </em>4 Fed. Cir. (T) 16, 21, 776 F.2d 1029, 1034 (1985) (Commerce erred in refusingto require respondents to submit current information); <em>see also Rhone-Poulenc v. United States, </em>927 F. Supp. 451, 456 (CIT 1996) (\u201cCommerce\u2019s failure to perform an independent investigation of the facts related to this issue falls short of its statutory duty to investigate antidumping cases and assign fair anti-dumping margins\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">While at first blush it is troubling that Commerce gathered and relied upon the same information it was not allowed to consider when submitted by petitioner, in the absence of bad faith or clear governmental misconduct the statute\u2019s broad grant of discretion to Commerce in conducting investigations permits this action. Thus, although Commerce has promulgated regulations requiring it to strike untimely information submitted to it, this does not restrict Commerce\u2019s ability to gather the same information on its own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Nevertheless, it was improper for Commerce not to allow the parties to comment on this information. The Court remands to correct this oversight.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the Court cannot reach the issue of whether there is substantial evidence on the record to support the conclusion that the Order should not be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">For the foregoing reasons, this matter is remanded to Commerce with instructions that Commerce shall allow the parties to comment upon information relevant to the issue of the partial revocation. If necessary, Commerce shall adjust its determination. Commerce has sixty (60) days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to conduct the remand proceeding. Commerce\u2019s determination in all other respects is sustained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\"> Plaintiff points out that <em>DRAMS From Korea </em>was issued after the <em>Final Results. </em>Consequently, Plaintiff argues that Commerce\u2019s statements in <em>DRAMS From Korea </em>are simply a post-hoc rationalization of the <em>Final Results. </em>However, <em>DRAMS From Korea </em>does not set forth a new standard in revocation cases but simply summarizes Commerce\u2019s view that there is no legal difference between the phrases \u201cnot likely to resume dumping\u201d and \u201cno likelihood of resumption of dumping\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\"> At oral argument, held on January 15,1998, Wieland\\s counsel conceded that these phrases both mean the same thing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\"> Accordingly, the Court rejects Wieland\u2019s argument that Commerce could only request information from the parties.-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\"> <em>Cf.
