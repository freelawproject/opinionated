Plaintiff Union Camp Corporation (\u201cUnion Camp\u201d) and Defendant-intervenors Dastech International, Incorporated, ICC Industries, Incorporated, Guangdong Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation, Si-nochem International Chemicals Company, Limited, and Tianjin Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation (collectively \u201cDastech\u201d) challenge as unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law certain aspects of the Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d) decision in <em>Sebacic Acid from the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 10,530 (Mar. 7, 1997) <em>(\u201cFinal Results\u201d). </em>The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">Union Camp contests five aspects of Commerce\u2019s decision. Commerce agrees to, and Defendant-intervenors do not oppose, remand on three of Union Camp\u2019s challenges, and the fourth is moot in view of the Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The remaining issue is Commerce\u2019s decision to use the Indian value of octanol-1 as the surrogate value of crude octanol-2, a subsidiary product of the sebacic acid production process.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Defendant-Intervenors contest Commerce\u2019s treatment of two sales of sebacic acid that were made through Sinochem International Chemicals Company, Ltd. (\u201cSICC\u201d) on behalf of Sinochem Jiangsu Import and Export Corporation (\u201cJiangsu\u201d). Commerce used Jiangsu\u2019s 243.4 percent margin to (1) assess antidumping duties for these sales and (2) establish SICC\u2019s future cash deposit rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">For the reasons discussed below, the Court holds that Commerce\u2019s use of the Indian value of octanol-1 for octanol-2 was unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and not in accordance with law. The Court affirms Commerce\u2019s decision regarding the sales on behalf of Jiangsu.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">On July 19,1993 Union Camp filed a petition with Commerce and the United States International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) alleging that sebacic acid<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d) was being sold at prices below fair market value to the detriment of the domestic industry. <em>Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation; Sebacic Acid from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 43,339 (Aug. 16,1993). After the appropriate investigations by Commerce and the ITC, it was determined that Union Camp\u2019s allegations had merit, and Commerce issued <em>the Antidumping Duty Order: Sebacic Acid From the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), </em>59 Fed. Reg. 35,909 (July 14, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Union Camp and Dastech challenged the initial less than fair value determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 5,1996, this Court remanded to Commerce on the issue of the valuation of octanol-2 and upheld Commerce\u2019s actions in all other respects. <em>Union Camp Corp. v. United States, </em>941 F. Supp. 108 (CIT 1996) <em>(\u201cUnion Camp I\u201d). </em>This Court instructed Commerce \u201cto value octanol-2 based on an appropriate cost (which may be the U.S. cost) of crude octanol-2 rather than the Indian selling price for refined octanol-1 * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. Commerce complied with the Court\u2019s directions and used Union Camp\u2019s internal cost of octanol-2 found in the petition. The Court affirmed the remand results on April 11, 1997. <em>Union Camp Corp. v. United States, </em>963 F. Supp. 1212 (CIT 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Meanwhile, on August 16,1995, Commerce initiated an antidumping duty administrative review of sebacic acid from the PRC at issue in this case. <em>Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Requests for Revocation in Part, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 42,500. The administrative review covered shipments of sebacic acid from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>PRC to the United States during the period of July 13, 1994 through June 30,1995. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,530. As in the initial investigation, Commerce used India as the surrogate country and was unable to locate an Indian value for oetanol-2. Therefore, Commerce used the Indian value of octanol-1 for valuing octanol-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">At verification, Commerce discovered that two sales which were reported as SICC sales were sales made by SICC on behalf of Jiangsu. Jiangsu did not participate in the administrative review. Consequently, Commerce determined that Jiangsu would be subject to the countrywide rate of 243.4 percent. Commerce assessed this rate to those sales. Because \u201cSICC knowingly engaged in sales to the United States of [Jiangsu\u2019s] material, accordingto statements by SICC at verification, as an attempt to assist Jiangsu in avoidingposting of Jiangsu\u2019s higher anti-dumping duty cash deposits\u201d, <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,532, Commerce included those two sales at the 243.4 percent rate in calculating the dumping margin to be applied to SICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The Court \u201cshall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found * * * to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law * * 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B) (1994). \u2018\u201cSubstantial evidence is somethingmore than a \u201cmere scintilla,\u201d and must be enough reasonably to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Primary Steel, Inc. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 1080, 834 F. Supp. 1374, 1380 (1993) (citation omitted). \u201cAs long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d Cera<em>mica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 399, 404-5, 636 F. Supp. 961, 966 (1986), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>810 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">In reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of the statute that the agency administers, the Court\u2019s initial inquiry is to determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). \u201cIf Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843-44. Consequently, \u201c[t]he court will defer to the agency\u2019s construction of the statute as a permissible construction if it \u2018reflects a plausible construction of the plain language of the statute[s] and does not otherwise conflict with Congress\u2019 express intent.\u2019\u201d <em>Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>82 F.3d 1039, 1044 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).1</p>\n<p id=\"b288-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\">Commerce\u2019s Determination To Value Octanol-2 Using The Indian Value Of Octanol-1 Was Unsupported By Substantial Evidence On The Record And Not In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The PRC is a nonmarket economy (\u201cNME\u201d) country. For NME investigations, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">[Commerce] shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the valuation of the factors of production shall be based on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by [Commerce].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">19U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(l) (1994). Thus, \u201cCommerce\u2019s task in a nonmarket economy investigation is to calculate what a producer\u2019s costs or prices would be if such prices or costs were determined by market forces.\u201d <em>Tianjin Mach. Import &amp; Export Corp. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 931, 940, 806 F. Supp. 1008, 1018 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\"><em>\u201c </em>[T] o the extent possible\u201d, the surrogate is a country \u201cat a level of economic development comparable\u201d to the NME and which has \u201csignificant producers of comparable merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(4) (1994). Commerce\u2019s regulations provide for the following order of preference in selecting comparable economies: (1) a market economy country at a stage of economic development comparable to that of the home market country, other than the United States; (2) a market economy country not at a stage of economic development comparable to that of the home market country, other than the United States; and (3) the United States. <em>See </em>19 C.ER. \u00a7 353.52(b) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Here, Commerce chose India as the surrogate country. Commerce calculated normal value by multiplying the verified factors of production by the appropriate surrogate values for the different inputs. <em>See Sebacic Acid From the People\u2019s Republic of China; Preliminary Results of Anti-dumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 46,440, 46,442 (Sept. 3,1996) <em>(\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). </em>The production of sebacic acid results in the production of subsidiary chemical products. Commerce considers these products to be by-products or co-products. For purposes of calculating normal value, by-product sales revenues are subtracted from sebacic acid production costs while co-product costs (material, labor, energy and factory overhead) are allocated among sebacic acid and the subsidiary products. <em>See id. </em>at 46,443.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Commerce valued octanol-2, a subsidiary product of the sebacic acid production process, using the Indian value of octanol-1. This resulted in the determination that octanol-2 was a co-product of sebacic acid, not a by-product as claimed by Union Camp. According to Union Camp, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>determination resulted in the erroneous allocation of octanol-2 costs rather than the subtraction of them from sebacic acid production costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The Court Is Not Bound By <em>Res Judicata, </em>Collateral Estoppel Or <em>Stare Decisis </em>In Deciding This Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Union Camp claims that because this Court decided whether the Indian value of refined octanol-1 may be used to value octanol-2 in <em>Union Camp I, </em>Commerce may not argue a different course of action here. Union Camp bases its argument on the principals of <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel and <em>stare decisis. </em>For the reasons that follow, the Court rejects Union Camp\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"AKk\">The Restatement (Second) of Judgments provides the Court with guidance on issues of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel (or issue preclusion). <em>See, e.g., American Permac, Inc. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 672, 674-75, 800 F. Supp. 952, 954-55 (1992), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>996 F.2d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <em>PPG Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>14 CIT 522, 537, 746 F. Supp. 119, 133 (1990). It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">The principal concepts developed in this Chapter are: merger \u2014 the extinguishment of a claim in a judgment for plaintiff (\u00a7 18); bar \u2014 the extinguishment of a claim in a judgment for defendant (\u00a7 19) and issue preclusion \u2014 the effect of the determination of an issue in another action between the parties on the same claim (direct estoppel) or a different claim (collateral estoppel) (\u00a7 27). The term \u201cres judicata\u201d is here used in a broad sense as including all three of these concepts. When it is stated that \u201cthe rules of res judi-cata are applicable,\u201d it is meant that the rules as to the effect of a judgment as a merger or a bar or as a collateral or direct estoppel are applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-11\"><em>PPG Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 297, 300-301, 712 F. Supp. 195, 198 (1989) (quoting <em>Young Engineers, Inc. v. United States Intl\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>2 Fed. Cir. (T) 9, 19, 721 F.2d 1305, 1314 (1983), quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments (1982)), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>978 F.2d 1232 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">In order to effect issue preclusion the following criteria must be met: \u201c(i) the issue previously adjudicated is identical with that now presented, (ii) [ ] the issue was \u2018actually litigated\u2019 in the prior case, (iii) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the end-decision then made, and (iv) the party precluded was fully represented by counsel in the prior action.\u201d <em>PPG Indus., </em>13 CIT at 301, 712 F. Supp. at 199 (quoting <em>Thomas v. GSA, </em>794 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-14\">The burden on the party seeking issue preclusion is and should be exacting. This is especially so in trade cases, since Congress has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>made specific provision for periodic administrative reviews in countervailing duty anddumpingcases. (Seel9U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a) (1982&amp; Supp. V1987).) Since the agencies involved perform the function of expert finders of fact concerning different programs, different time frames, economic statistics and other factors in countervailing duty and dumping investigations as well as similar functions during periodic reviews, principles of issue preclusion should be carefully applied. To hold otherwise would have a chilling effect upon the administrative processes envisioned by the Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><em>PPG Indus., </em>13 CIT at 302, 712 F. Supp. at 199. The Court agrees with Union Camp that the valuation determination was actually litigated; the valuation determination was necessary to the end-decision made in <em>Union Camp I; </em>and that Commerce was fully represented by counsel in <em>Union Camp I. </em>The issue, however, is not identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Commerce must base its decision upon an administrative record. The record for review by this Court is \u201ca copy of all information presented to or obtained by\u201d Commerce \u201cduring the course of the administrative proceeding\u201d as well as a copy of the determination, all transcripts, and all notices published in the Federal Register. <em>See </em>19U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(2)(A) (1994). Here, the record on review for this issue contained different information than the initial investigation. Specifically, Commerce included an in-depth explanation of why its interpretation of the term \u201ccomparable merchandise\u201d was a reasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>Compare Final Determination, </em>59 Fed. Reg. at 28,058 <em>with Final Results </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,535. Although Commerce included an almost identical explanation in its <em>Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand, [Union Camp I], </em>Exhibit (\u201cExh.\u201d) 3 to Union Camp\u2019s Reply, in the Redetermination, it provided additional analysis in response to the Court\u2019s reasoning and instructions in <em>Union Camp I. </em>That additional analysis, taken in conjunction with the fact that the administrative record covers a different time period, takes this case outside the \u201cexacting\u201d burden for issue preclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, although the issues in <em>Union Camp I </em>and this case were very close, the differences in the records for review preclude the application of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\n<em>Stare Decisis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Union Camp claims that the doctrine of stare decisis compels the Court to reach an identical decision on the issue of the valuation of octanol-2 as it did in <em>Union Camp I. </em>The doctrine provides that \u201c\u2018a decision on an issue of law embodied in a final judgment is binding on the court that decided it and such other courts as owe obedience to its decision, in all future cases.\u2019\u201d <em>Cabot Corp. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 664, 670 n.5, 694 F. Supp. 949, 953 n.5 (1988) (quoting 1B J. Moore, J. Lucas &amp; T. Currier, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 0.401 (2d ed. 1988)). Consequently, \u201c\u2018like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>facts will receive like treatment in a court of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Flowers v. United States, </em>764 F.2d 759, 769 (11th Cir. 1985)). As discussed above, <em>Union Camp I </em>and the case before the Court now are not the same. As a result, the Court finds the doctrine inapplicable and will address the merits of Commerce\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Commerce\u2019s Interpretation Of The Phrase \u201cComparable Merchandise\u201d In This Case Is Not Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Congress has provided some guidance regarding the meaning of the term \u201ccomparable\u201d. In the conference report accompanyingH.R. 3, \u201cto be treated as the legislative history to accompany [the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988]\u201d, 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547, in reference to the factors of production of \u201ccomparable\u201d merchandise, the report states that \u201cCommerce should seek to use, if possible, data based on production of the same general class or kind of merchandise using similar levels of technology and at similar levels of volume as the producers subject to investigation.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 110-576, at 591 (1988), <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547,1624 (emphasis added). Thus, Congress\u2019s guidance regardingthe term \u201ccomparable merchandise\u201d is that it be the same general class or kind of merchandise. The question before the Court, then, is whether Commerce\u2019s decision that octanol-1 is comparable to octanol-2 based on their similar molecular formulae is a reasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In practice, Commerce has considered the price or use of a surrogate in determining whether it is a comparable product. <em>See, e.g., Nation Ford Chem. Co. v. U.S., </em>985 F. Supp. 133, 137 (CIT 1997), <em>appeal docketed </em>(Fed. Cir. Feb. 9,1998) (Court upheld Commerce\u2019s use of an Indian price for imported aniline instead of the Indian price for domestic aniline even though the PRC used aniline produced domestically stating: \u201cCommerce rejected the use of Indian domestic prices because it found that they were distorted by forces peculiar to India. * * * [I]t was reasonable to conclude that those [domestic] prices were not adequately representative of the situation in the PRC. \u201d); <em>Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corp. v. United States, </em>947 F. Supp. 525, 532 (CIT 1996) (Court found Commerce\u2019s method for adjusting raw material prices to account for differences in grade and quality to be within Commerce\u2019s discretion.); <em>Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>985 F. Supp. 1166, 1176 (CIT 1997) (Court affirmed Commerce\u2019s use of a value for manganese ore over four other possible surrogate values, stating that \u201cCommerce considered the pros and cons of both [the ore it used and the ore Plaintiff wanted it to use] and decided \u2018the manganese content of [the ore it used] is more comparable to the ore used by the Chinese producers than the ore with the higher manganese content * * * [and] it represents a domestic Indian price.\u2019\u201d); <em>Writing Instrument Mfrs. Assoc., Pencil Section v. United States, </em>984 F. Supp. 629, 636 (CIT 1997), <em>appeal docketed, </em>Nos. 981178, 981292 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 9, 1998, Jan. 21, 1998) <em>(\u201cWriting Instru-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>merit\u201d) </em>(Court upheld Commerce\u2019s use of U.S. basswood prices as a surrogate price for Chinese lindenwood which is indigenous to the PRC because Commerce\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on the opinion of industry experts that basswood is \u2018nearly indistinguishable\u2019 from Chinese linden-wood while [another proposed surrogate] is only \u2018quite similar.\u2019\u201d). Thus, the Court has found Commerce\u2019s consideration of value or use in determining the appropriate surrogates to be a reasonable interpretation of the term \u201ccomparable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">Here, in using the Indian price of octanol-1 to value octanol-2, Commerce simply stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">the Department used an Indian price for octanol-1 as a surrogate value for octanol-2 as the best available information after the Department concluded that, for purposes of factor valuation, octanol-1 was comparable to octanol-2. We find that octanol-1 and capryl alcohol (octanol-2) share very similar molecular formulae though they are not identical products. Since product-specific information is not available from our recommended surrogate countries, we must rely on the price of the closest product we could obtain to value capryl alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,534-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Commerce\u2019s only explanation as to how octanol-1 was comparable to octanol-2 is the similar molecular formulae. Commerce does not examine whether the products are comparable in value or use. Indeed, Commerce states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">The Department does not delve into intricacies of the production and use of every potential surrogate precisely because production and use are not necessarily relevant to valuation of factors of production * * *. Similarly, the Department is not required to consider interchangeableness in determining whether to use a particular surrogate to value a factor of production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,535. Commerce, however, is ignoring its prior legal standard. It must either provide an explanation for how octanol-1 is comparable to octanol-2 based on some acceptable standard or it must offer a reasonable explanation of why it is changing its legal standard for such determinations. In this case, Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccomparable\u201d to mean similar in molecular formu-lae, without more, is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The Use Op The Indian Value Of Octanol-1 Is Unsupported By Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Notwithstandingthe Court\u2019s findingthat Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201ccomparable merchandise\u201d is unreasonable, Commerce\u2019s decision is also unsupported by substantial evidence on the record. Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">the Department will consider rejecting a potential surrogate where it has evidence that a possible surrogate value does not reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>reflect the \u201cvalue\u201d of the factor. For example, if the Department had evidence that a surrogate price was significantly higher than other potential surrogate prices for a particular factor, the Department might find that it was not reasonable to use that particular price as a surrogate value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,535. Yet here, as discussed below, Commerce failed to consider all the values for octanol-2 that were placed on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Commerce found that there is no sebacic acid production in India, the surrogate country for valuing factors of production. <em>See Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,533. Because octanol-2 is only produced during the sebacic acid process, the parties have been unable to find an appropriate Indian value for octanol-2. <em>See id. </em>at 10,534. Consequently, the parties placed several surrogate values on the record for octanol-2. Dastech submitted the Indian value of octanol-1 found in the <em>Indian Chemical Weekly </em>which was ultimately chosen by Commerce. <em>See id. </em>at 10,535. Dastech also provided a U.S. value for octanol-2 found in the <em>Chemical Marketing Reporter. See Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,533. Union Camp provided its internal cost for octanol-2. <em>See id. </em>at 10,534. Union Camp also submitted calculations to adjust the U.S. value for octanol-2, which Union Camp claims to be the cost for refined octanol-2, to value crude octanol-2. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Commerce discussed its reason for selectingthe Indian value for octanol-2, <em>i.e., </em>the similar molecular formulae. It also discussed why it rejected Union Camp\u2019s internal cost of octanol-2 based on Commerce\u2019s preference for public, published information. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,535. Commerce failed to discuss, or apparently consider, however, the U.S. value of octanol-2 placed on the record by Dastech or Union Camp\u2019s submission regarding an adjustment of that U.S. value to reflect that Dastech\u2019s submission reflected the value of refined octanol-2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, Commerce\u2019s acknowledgment that \u201cit is not clear from the Indian Chemical Weekly whether [respondents\u2019] listed price for \u2018octanol\u2019 refers to octanol-1, octanol-2, or a combination of the two products\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 10,534, eliminates that source as evidence in support of Commerce\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Commerce admits that \u201cthe Department may use values from the United States or other countries not at a comparable level of development for individual factors * * * [when] it cannot find those values in a comparable economy that produce comparable merchandise. \u201d <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,533. This is in accordance with Commerce\u2019s regulations. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.52(b) (1997). Recently, the Court upheld Commerce\u2019s decision to use a U.S. value in a case where surrogate values from other market economy countries were submitted. <em>Writing Instrument, </em>984 F. Supp. at 636. In <em>Writing Instrument, </em>Commerce needed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>surrogate value for Chinese lindenwood. Commerce rejected an Indian value and instead used a U.S. value because the U.S. wood was \u201cnearly indistinguishable\u201d from the lindenwood even though the Indian wood was \u201cquite similar\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The Court rejected plaintiffs argument that \u201cthe use of any surrogate prices from the U.S. frustrates the statute since the U.S. market economy is not at a level of economic development comparable to that of the PRC\u2019s economy * * <em>Id. </em>The Court found that \u201cCommerce\u2019s use of U.S. [surrogate] is consistent with the primary objective of the statute [to determine the most accurate dumping margins]. * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637. Thus, Commerce\u2019s failure here to consider the other surrogate values placed on the record results in its valuation of oc-tanol-2 using the Indian value of octanol-1 being unsupported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Commerce\u2019s Treatment Of Jiangsu\u2019s Sales Was Reasonable And Supported By Substantial Evidence On The Record</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Dastech claims that Commerce erred when it assessed the countrywide rate to the sales SICC made on behalf of Jiangsu and when it included these sales in its calculation of SICC\u2019s dumping margin. According to Dastech, by applying the country-wide rate to these sales, Commerce meant to punish SICC and Dastech which violates the remedial purpose of the statute. Dastech also argues that Commerce\u2019s action contravenes Article 5 of the U.S. Constitution because there was no full due process hearing before an impartial administrative law judge. For the reasons that follow, the Court rejects Dastech\u2019s argument and upholds the dumping rate Commerce assigned to those sales and the inclusion of the Jiangsu sales in SICC\u2019s margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">There Is Substantial Evidence On The Record That The Sales Were Jiangsu Sales, Not SICC Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Dastech claims that the \u201ctransaction between Jiangsu and SICC was an internal transaction between two companies located in the NME country and, therefore, in light of past Department practice, should be disregarded.\u201d Dastech Reply at 4. For support, Dastech cites to <em>Fresh Garlic From the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results of Antidump-ing Duty Administrative Review and Partial Termination of Administrative Review, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 23,758 (1997). In <em>Fresh Garlic, </em>Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">we have interpreted the relevant prices in such a sales situation to be the price at which the first party in the chain of distribution who had knowledge of the U.S. destination sells the merchandise. However, we explained that this practice is restricted with regard to NME cases, since we will not base export price on internal transactions between two companies located in the NME country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">62 Fed. Reg. at 23,759.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Contrary to Dastech\u2019s assertions, there is substantial evidence on the record that the two sales in question were Jiangsu sales and not SICC sales. Even though SICC reported these sales as their own in the questionnaire responses, SICC considered these sales to be Jiangsu sales. <em>See </em>Aug, 27,1996 Mem. to Spetrini, Exh. 3 to Dastech\u2019s Brief In Support of Its Motion For Jdmt (\u201cDastech\u2019s Mot.\u201d), at 1-2; <em>see also </em>Feb. 24, 1997 Mem. to LaRussa, Exh. 4 to Dastech\u2019s Mot., at 1-2. At verification, SICC officials presented to Commerce a contract between Jiangsu and SICC. See Aug. 26,1996 Verif. of Sales Questionnaire Response ofSICCMem., Exh. 1 to Defendant\u2019s Oppos., at 6 (\u201cVerif. of SICC\u201d). The contract, as translated, says that [each party will perform certain services for the other party]. Ex. 2 to Defendant\u2019s Oppos., at 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An SICC official explained to Commerce that \u201cJiangsu asked SICC to act as its agent because Jiangsu had received a higher antidumping duty rate in the investigation than had SICC.\u201d Verif. of SICC, Exh. 1 to Defendant\u2019s Op-pos., at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><em>In the Preliminary Results, </em>Commerce stated: \u201c[f]or SICC, at verification we found that certain sales reported as SICC were in fact sales by another respondent company, Jiangsu.\u201d 61 Fed. Reg. at 46433. Because the contract shows that the Jiangsu asked SICC to sell a specific amount of sebacic acid at a specific price, Commerce\u2019s conclusion that the SICC sold the merchandise in the United States \u201cat prices and terms set by Jiangsu * * *\u201d, <em>jFinal Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 10,532, and that, therefore, these sales were actually Jiangsu sales is supported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Commerce Properly Applied The Country-Wide Rate To The Jiangsu\u2019s Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In NME administrative reviews, Commerce determines whether an exporter is entitled to a separate rate based on an absence of government control. If not, Commerce assigns the country-wide rate to that company. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 46,442. The country-wide rate is based on best information available (\u201cBIA\u201d). Commerce is allowed to use an adverse inference in calculating BIA. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Here, although Jiangsu participated in the initial investigation, it did not respond to the questionnaire issued by Commerce in this administrative review. As a result, the Court upholds Commerce\u2019s decision that Jiangsu was not entitled to a separate rate and its assessment of the country-wide rate to Jiangsu. Further, because there is substantial evidence on the record that the sales made by SICC on behalf of Jiangsu were in fact Jiangsu sales, as discussed above, the Court finds that Commerce appropriately valued them using the country-wide rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Commerce\u2019s Assessment Op The Jiangsu Rate To The Two Sales And Their Inclusion In SICC\u2019s The Margin Is Not A Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Administrative reviews establish the assessment rate for entries dur-ingthe period of review and the deposit rate for future entries. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(1) (1994). Commerce assesses antidumping duties on an importer-specific basis. <em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,302 (May 17, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In <em>C.J. Tower &amp; Sons v. United States, </em>21 C.C.P.A. 417, 71 F.2d 438 (1934), it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">we cannot escape the conviction that the expressed purpose of Congress, in the Anti-Dumping Act of 1921, was to impose not a penalty, but an amount of duty sufficient to equalize competitive conditions between the exporter and American industries affected * * It follows that the Anti-Dumping Act of 1921 is not repugnant to the provisions of said Amendment 5 [to the U.S. Constitution], as denying to the importer due process of law. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 427; 71 F.2d at 445-46. \u201cDumping duties are not penal in nature, but are \u2018additional duties\u2019 to equalize competitive conditions between the exporter and [affected U.S. industries].\u201d <em>Imbert Imports, Inc. v. United States, </em>67 Cust. Ct. 569, 576 n. 10, 331 F. Supp. 1400, 1406 n. 10 (1971), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>60 C.C.P.A. 123, 475 F.2d 1189 (1973). The purpose of the statute, then, is solely remedial. <em>Chaparral Steel Co. v. United States, </em>901 F.2d 1097, 1103-04 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Dastech argues that Commerce\u2019s calculation of SICC\u2019s margin is. a penalty. According to Dastech, Commerce\u2019s actions are contrary to the an-tidumping statute because the statute does not give Commerce the authority to impose a penalty. Dastech points to the amount of money it will have to pay as a result of Commerce\u2019s calculation in support of its argument that this is a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">In the <em>Final Results, </em>Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">[o]ur use of the rate of243 percent was not punitive. Because these are Jiangsu sales, we applied the rate that Jiangsu would have received on the sales to the United States. That the rate is 243 percent is reflective only of Jiangsu\u2019s failure to respond to the Department\u2019s questionnaire and the Department\u2019s application of the countrywide rate to Jiangsu is consistent with its normal practice * * *. SICC knowingly engaged in sales to the United States of another respondent\u2019s material, accordingto statements by SICC at verification, as an attempt to assist Jiangsu in avoidingposting of Jiangsu\u2019s higher antidumping duty cash deposits. Therefore, it is appropriate and consistent with the remedial nature of the statute, to apply the Jiangsu rate to these transactions in calculating SICC\u2019s rate. SICC\u2019s margin should reflect any dumping on sales in which it is the exporter of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">62 Fed. Reg. at 10,532.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The Court will not consider Commerce\u2019s calculation of a dumping margin to be a penalty simply because the margin is large. So long as Commerce\u2019s methodology is reasonable and its actions are supported by substantial evidence on the record, the Court will uphold Commerce\u2019s determination. <em>Cer\u00e1mica Regiomontana, S.A., </em>10 CIT at 404-5, 636 F. Supp. at 966.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, Commerce reasonably applied the country-wide rate to the Jiangsu sales because of the evidence on the record that the sales were Jiangsu sales and Jiangsu did not respond to the questionnaire. The inclusion of the Jiangsu sales in the dumping margin Commerce calculated for SICC was also reasonable because SICC was the exporter of record. That the result was a significant sum of money does not convert Commerce\u2019s action into a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Finally, the Court rejects Dastech\u2019s claim that the amount of the anti-dumping duties assessed by Commerce implicate the Due Process Clause of the United States\u2019 Constitution because they could force the U.S. importer into bankruptcy The U.S. importer claims that it has liberty and property interests in its right to stay in business. However, the U.S. importer has no rights other than to receive due process as provided for in the antidumping statute. The record reflects that the U. S. importer actively participated in the administrative review and was allowed to submit information to Commerce as well as present its arguments through case briefs and hearings. In addition, because Commerce\u2019s actions were supported by substantial evidence on the record and in accordance with law, the Court finds that the U.S. importer received all the procedural protections due to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">For the foregoing reasons, this matter is remanded to Commerce with instructions that Commerce value octanol-2 based on an appropriate cost of crude octanol-2, which may be the U.S. cost but which may not be based solely on similar molecular structure without any additional evidence, and then recalculate the by-product/co-product determination with the correct value. Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Motion For Judgment Upon Its Agency Record is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-15\"> The Court is remanding to Commerce to: (1) consider whether the surrogate values obtained from The Economic Times were inclusive or exclusive of taxes; (2) calculate the average castor oil prices using the figure 23.32/kg; and (3) allocate a by-product credit for glycerine to the cost of production for sebacic acid and octanol-2. The fourth issue, that Commerce needs to adjust the surrogate value for octanol-1 to a tax-exclusive basis, is moot because the Court is remanding to Commerce on the issue of the valuation of octanol-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\"> Sebacic acid is a chemical which has numerous industrial applications, for example, production of nylon 6/10 (a polymer used for paintbrush and toothbrush bristles and paper machine felts), plasticizers, esters, automotive coolants, inks and adhesives, and lubricants. <em>See Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the People's Republic of China, </em>59 Fed.
