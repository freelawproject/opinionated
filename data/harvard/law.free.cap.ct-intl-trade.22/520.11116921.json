The International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce (\u201cITA\u201d or. \u201cCommerce\u201d) found that they were being sold in the United States at less than fair value (\u201cLTFV\u201d). Jurisdiction is predicated upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581 (1994). For the reasons that follow, the Commission\u2019s final determination is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">On March 7, 1996, the Coalition filed an antidumping duty petition with the ITA and ITC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition alleged that certain brake drums and rotors from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d or \u201cChina\u201d) were being dumped in the United States at LTFV and were causing material injury and/or threat of material injury to a United States industry. The period of investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d) covers the years 1993 through 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">On February 28, 1997, Commerce announced its final antidumping duty determination. It found that certain brake drums and rotors were being sold in the United States at LTFV <em>Notice of Final Determinations of Sales at LTFV: Brake Drums and Brake Rotors from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 9160 (Feb. 28,1997). Commerce published its final amended affirmative determination on April 2,1997. <em>Notice of Amended Final Determination of Sales at LTFV: Brake Drums and Brake Rotors from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 15,655 (April 2,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">On April 16,1997, the Commission issued its final determination. In a unanimous decision concerning the brake drums, the Commission found that a United States industry was not being materially injured nor threatened with material injury by reason of imports of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>brake drums from China.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In contrast, the Commission made an affirmative injury determination concerning certain brake rotors. <em>Certain Brake Drums and Rotors from China, </em>Inv. No. 731-TA-744 (Final), USITC Pub. 3035 (\u201cFinal Determination\u201d); 62 Fed. Reg. 18,650 (ITC April 16, 1997). The determination concerning the brake rotors is not being challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In reviewing the Commission\u2019s determination, this Court must sustain a final negative injury determination unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(1994). Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (1988) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elect. Indus. Co. Ltd. v. United States, 3 </em>Fed. Cir. (T) 44, 51, 750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The reviewing court may not, \u201c even as to matters not requiring expertise * * * displace the [agency\u2019s] choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). In this regard \u201cthe court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the ITC. \u201d <em>Dastech Int\u2019l., Inc. v. USITC, </em>963 F. Supp. 1220, 1222 (CIT 1997); <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 955, 962, 699 F. Supp. 300, 306 (1988), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 36, 894 F.2d 385 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In order to make a final affirmative determination in its injury investigation, the ITC must find that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">(A) an industry in the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">(i) is materially injured, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of the merchandise * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671b(a)(l)(1994). With respect to LTFV imports, \u201cmaterial injury\u201d is defined as \u201charm which is not inconsequential, immaterial, or unimportant.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(A)(1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">The ITC\u2019s Determination That The Domestic Brake Drum Industry Was Not Being Materially Injured By Reason Of LTFV Imports Is Supported By Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">Plaintiff argues that the ITC determination is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record and contrary to law with regard to its finding of no material injury. Plaintiff contends that the ITC failed to consider evidence in the record on the volume of imports and their consequential and harmful impact on the U.S. industry. Accordingly, Plaintiff requests a reversal of the ITC\u2019s Final Determination or in the alternative, a remand to the ITC for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Defendant, United States, and Defendant-Intervenors, China National Automotive Indus., <em>et al. </em>(\u201cChina National\u201d), and California Brake Drum and Rotor respond that the Commission\u2019s conclusions have the requisite evidentiary support, that no factual issues are in dispute and that the Coalition is, in reality, asking the Court to impermissi-bly reweigh the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The guidelines established by Congress for analyzing the issue of material injury mandate consideration of the following factors: (1) the volume of imports, (2) the effect of imports of that merchandise on prices in the United States for like products, and (3) the impact of such merchandise on domestic producers of like products. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(B)(i)(1994); <em>Angus Chemical Co. v. United States, </em>140 F.3d 1478, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (three mandatory factors). Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(B)(ii), the Commission may also \u201cconsider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination.\u201d No single factor, however, is determinative and the Commission evaluates all relevant economic factors \u201cwithin the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii)(1994); <em>Companhia Paulista de Ferra-Ligas v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 96-63, 18 ITRD1542, -, 1996 WL 189515, *3 (CIT 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">In evaluating the evidence it collects during the investigation, the \u201ccommissioners are free to attach different weight to the various statutory tests which they are required to employ when evaluating the presence or threat of injury.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, 96 </em>F.3d 1352, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">A finding of an affirmative injury determination requires both \u201c(1) present material injury and (2) a finding that the material injury is \u2018by reason of the subject imports.\u201d <em>Gerald Metals, Inc. v. United States, </em>132 F.3d 716, 719 (Fed. Cir. 1997). \u201cEvidence of de minimis (e.g., minimal or tangential) causation of injury does not reach the causation level required under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Substantial Evidence Supports the Commission\u2019s Determination That The Volume of Imports Lacked Significance</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(i) directs the Commission, in evaluating the volume of imports, to \u201cconsider whether the volume of imports of the merchandise, or any increase in that volume, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, is significant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In the <em>Final </em>Determination, the ITC found that the quantity of LTFV brake drum imports rose from zero in 1993 to 333,000 units ($3.4 million) in 1994, then rose to 494,000 units ($4.8 million) in 1995. <em>Final Determination </em>at 20. For interim 1996,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the ITC found the quantity of subject drum imports fell to 339,000 units ($2.9 million) which amounted to fewer than the 456,000 units ($4.4 million) imported in interim 1995.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The ITC also found the subject drum market penetration grew from 0 in 1993 to 7.6% in 1994 and then to 9.2% in 1995. In interim 1996, a market penetration of 7.5% amounted to less than a market penetration of 10.9% calculated for interim 1995. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The Commission additionally found that the domestic market share, on the other hand, \u201cvaried little throughout most of the period of investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Plaintiff makes two arguments for its contention that the ITC erred in its analysis of subject import volume. First, it argues that the ITC erroneously concluded that the import volume of LTFV brake drums was not \u201csignificant.\u201d Plaintiffs Brief at 8. Second, Plaintiff maintains that the ITC failed to analyze the relationship between the import volume and conditions and trends in the marketplace. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">To support its claim that the ITC erroneously concluded the subject import volume was not significant, Plaintiff cites to other cases and Commission determinations where the ITC found a market penetration of less than 7.5% and made a material injury finding. Plaintiff asserts that \u201c[c]learly market penetration levels of 7.4% to 9.2% are not insignificant as a matter of law. \u201d <em>Id. </em>To the extent that Plaintiff s argument rests on the theory that the level of market penetration in this case amounts to a <em>per se </em>finding of significance, its argument is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Reviewing the record as a whole as is required, \u201c[flor one industry, an apparently small volume of imports may have a significant impact on the market; for another the same volume might not be significant.\u201d S. Rep. No. 96-249, at 88 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 381,474. Accordingly, \u201cit is the significance of a quantity of imports, and not absolute volume alone, that must guide ITC\u2019s analysis under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>1677(7).\u201d <em>USX v. United States, </em>11 CIT 82, 85, 655 F. Supp. 487, 490 (1987).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, a market penetration level of 7.5% does not mandate a conclusion that volume levels are significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">Plaintiff also argues that this case presents the same issue addressed in the <em>USX </em>Corp. <em>v. United States </em>line of cases<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> where the Court ordered a remand to the ITC because the determinations were found to be insufficient and lacking in explanation. In this regard, Plaintiff claims that the ITC \u201crelied heavily upon the volume of the subject imports, which increase in 1994 and 1995\u201d, only discussing \u201cbriefly\u201d the increase in the domestic industry\u2019s productivity factors and taking a \u201ccursory\u201d look at the domestic industry\u2019s market share. Plaintiffs Brief at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Here, the Commission, however, completed a thorough analysis, and on that basis, could not conclude that the subject import volume was \u201csignificant\u201d. <em>Final Determination </em>at 21. The ITC found that despite the increase in volume and market penetration of LTFV imports from 1993 to 1995, the U.S. domestic industry simultaneously increased its production, shipments, capacity and capacity utilization while the domestic industry\u2019s market share remained relatively stable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, the ITC reasoned that the \u201cU.S. producers maintained their predominant market presence\u201d during the period 1993 to 1995. <em>Final Determination </em>at 21. Similarly, for interim 1996, the Commission concluded that the decrease in production, shipments, capacity utilization, and market share of the U.S. industry did not correlate with subject import volumes since such imports actually decreased in volume and market share during the same time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Moreover, \u201c [b]ecause the increase in shipments was nearly as great as the increase in domestic consumption, U.S. producers\u2019 market share varied little throughout most of the period of investigation.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 14. Reflecting the increase in shipments, sales revenues also rose for the domestic industry from \u201c$43.7 million in 1993 to $49.5 million in 1994 and $52.1 million in 1995, an increase of 19.2 percent from 1993 to 1995.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">This case is plainly distinguishable from the holding in the <em>USX </em>cases where the ITC determinations were unsubstantiated. Substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>dence supports the Commissioners\u2019 findings that the subject import volume was insignificant. More importantly, based on the facts in the record, the Commission quite reasonably concluded that the volume of subject imports lacked significance since they did not prevent the domestic industry from maintaining its predominant market presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The Commission Reasonably Concluded That The LTFV Imports Did Not Affect Domestic Prices</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Commission must consider whether imports effect prices. It examines if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">(I) there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">(II) the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(ii)(1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">In its analysis of price effects, the Commission acknowledged that \u201c[producers\u2019 prices for domestically-produced aftermarket drums generally declined during the period of investigation\u201d and that \u201cthe subject imports undersold the domestic like product in every producer price comparison.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 21. Nevertheless, the Commission decided to give this evidence limited weight since it could not find the requisite nexus between the pricing of the subject imports and the domestic industry\u2019s operating performance. <em>Final Determination </em>at 22-23.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Plaintiff challenges this analysis arguing that the <em>\u201cconsistentpattern of underselling </em>* * * <em>should be the single most significant factor in an injury determination antidumping cases.\u201d </em>Plaintiffs Brief at 12 (emphasis in original). Plaintiff argues the ITC disregarded the consistent pattern of underselling and that therefore its determination is not in accordance with law. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">To the extent plaintiff argues that evidence of underselling is a <em>per se </em>indication of injury, its argument fails. \u201cEvidence of underselling alone is legally insufficient to support an affirmative injury determination.\u201d <em>BIC Corp. v. United States, </em>964 F. Supp. 391, 401 (CIT 1997), <em>aff\u2019d </em>App. No. 97-1443 (Fed. Cir. March 11,1998). \u201cRather, the Commission has a statutory mandate to consider not only whether the subject imports have significantly undersold the domestic like product, but also how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>subject imports effect the prices of the domestic like product.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also Trent Tube Div. v. United States, </em>14 CIT 386, 402, 741 F. Supp. 921, 935 (1990) (according less weight to underselling).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">As noted earlier, the ITC has the discretion to make reasonable interpretations of the evidence and to determine the overall significance of any particular factor in its analysis. <em>See Maine Potato Council v. United States, </em>9 CIT 293, 300, 613 F. Supp. 1237, 1244 (1985). \u201cThe significance of the various factors affecting an industry will depend upon the facts of each particular case. Neither the presence nor the absence of any factor listed in the bill can necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to whether an industry is materially injured, and the significance to be assigned to a particular factor is for the ITC to decide.\u201d S.Rep. No. 249, at 88 (1979) <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 381, 474. Accordingly, plaintiffs assertion that the consistent pattern of underselling \u201cshould be the single most significant factor\u201d is erroneous. The Court finds reasonable the ITC\u2019s analysis and weight attributed to the factors and evidence presented in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Here, the ITC did not neglect the underselling evidence,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but determined that \u201cany price pressure that the subject imports may have placed on the domestic aftermarket drum industry was insufficient to seriously erode the domestic industry\u2019s operation margins or to preclude it from earning larger profits during the latter portions of the period of investigation than at its inception.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 22-23. This conclusion was specifically buttressed by the evidence in the record which revealed a substantial increase in operating income during the latter half of the investigation despite simultaneous increases in subject import volume and market penetration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although operating income declined from 1993 to 1994, when the subject imports were first introduced, the ITC determined that \u201cany negative effects on the domestic aftermarket drum industry from the initial increase in subject imports were not evident by the conclusion of the [POI].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Therefore, the Court finds that the Commission\u2019s determination that there was no nexus between pricing of the LTFV imports and the domestic industry\u2019s operating performance was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Plaintiff also asserts that the ITC did not consider the relationship between the \u201cissues of substitutability and underselling.\u201d Plaintiffs Brief at 15. Although Plaintiff correctly argues that generally the greater the substitutability between imports and the domestic like products, the greater the volume effects and price effects, <em>see R-M Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 219, 226-27, 848 F. Supp. 204, 210 (1994), this Court has held that underselling combined with increasing import vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>umes does not \u201cnecessarily indicate[ ] injury due to pricing in cases involving fungible products* * <em>USX </em>Corp., 12 CIT at 849, 698 F.Supp. at 239. In a material injury analysis, substitutability is but one factor in the evaluation of volume and price. <em>R-M Industries, Inc., </em>18 CIT at 226, 848 F. Supp. at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Moreover, the Commission did not ignore the relationship between substitutability and underselling as claimed by Plaintiff. In her concurrence, Commissioner Crawford specifically analyzed the substitutability between the domestic like product, subject imports and non-subject imports.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Commissioner Crawford determined that even if the LTFV imports had been priced fairly, the domestic prices would not have increased because the more cheaply priced non-subject imports would have captured the demand from the subject imports.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Final Determination </em>at 22, n. 124. Thus, despite her construal of imported and domestic brake drums as good substitutes, the Commissioner found that the subject imports were not having significant effects on the domestic price of brake drums.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Substantial Evidence Supports The Commission\u2019s Determination That LTFV Imports Had No Adverse Impact On Domestic Products</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Concerning the impact of LTFV imports on the state of the domestic industry, Congress requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">the Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">(I) actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization capacity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">(II) factors affecting domestic prices,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">(III) actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">(IV) actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>(V) in a proceedingunder part II of this subtitle, the magnitude of the margin of dumping.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Here, Plaintiff contends that, contrary to the ITC determination, the subject imports adversely impacted the domestic industry. Plaintiff pinpoints several economic factors as the underlying thrust to its claim: an increase in inventories and a decrease in demand for U.S. products in conjunction with the economic factors discussed earlier with regard to price effects.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiffs Brief at 17-19. Additionally, Plaintiff disputes the ITC\u2019s conclusion that the initial decline in operating income (1993-1994) and any other negative effects on the domestic industry were outweighed at the conclusion of the POI by the positive rebound in the domestic industry in 1996. Instead of signifying the domestic industry\u2019s ability to recuperate in the face of Chinese competition, Plaintiff contends the 1996 resurgence resulted from an increase in auto sales and the favorable performance of the U.S. economy in 1996 and.therefore serve as an inappropriate basis for denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Similarly, Plaintiff argues that the ITC\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe aftermarket drum industry showed strong financial performance\u201d fails the \u201c[cjourt\u2019s * * * healthy industry test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.

Nonetheless, the Commission in the discretion assigned to it by Congress, gave more weight to economic factors it felt more relevant and more probative to the investigation. As the Commission determined, other indicators such as capacity, capacity utilization, shipments, operating income and productivity rose duringthe period of investigation, and therefore, it did not abuse its discretion in reaching a negative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The ITC\u2019s Determination That The Domestic Brake Drum Industry Is Not Threatened With Material Injury By The LTFV Imports Is Supported By Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The ITC\u2019s determination of threat of injury is governed by 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(7)(F), which sets forth the economic factors that the Commission must consider in investigating such a threat. The statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other relevant factors\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy (particularly as to whether the coun-tervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement), and whether imports of the subject merchandise are likely to increase,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicatingthe likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for farther imports,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">(VI) the potential for product-shiftingif production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">(VII) in any investigation under this subtitle which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product * * * and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 1671d(b)(l) or 1673d(b)(l) of this title with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">(VTII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">(IX) any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Of the foregoing factors, numbers I and VII are not applicable here because (I) there is no subsidy at issue, and (VII) no agricultural products, raw or processed, are involved. <em>Final Determination </em>at 24, n. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">It is also important to note that the list of factors is not exhaustive. The statute calls on the ITC to consider the enunciated criteria \u201camong other relevant economic factors.\u201d 19 U.S.C. 1677(7)(F)(i)(1994). In making its threat determination, the ITC is required to consider the economic factors as a whole to determine whether further dumped imports are imminent and whether material injury would occur unless an order is issued. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(ii) (1994). \u201cThe presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider * * * shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination.

In examining each of the relevant statutorily specified factors, the Commission determined that the evidence does not indicate the likelihood of substantially increased volumes of LTFV brake drum imports. <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Despite significant increases in the LTFV brake drum capacity during the POI, and the export of an overwhelming majority of LTFV brake drums to the United States, the ITC found there is no likelihood of substantially increased subject imports into the United States. <em>Final Determination </em>at 24^25. This conclusion was buttressed by the fact that subject import volume and market penetration were lower in interim 1996 than in interim 1995. In addition, the ITC found dispositive the emphasis the Chinese producers gave to production for other markets, and the capacity increases during the later portion of the POI which did not simultaneously give rise to an increase in exports of LTFV drums to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The ITC also found, based on the reasoning in its material injury analysis, that since subject imports had no significant price effects on the domestic product at current import volumes, they were unlikely to have such effects in the imminent future. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In addition, the ITC determined that subject brake drum inventories held in China are minimal. Moreover, although inventories of subject brake drums maintained in the United States increased over the POI, the ratios of these inventories to subject imports and to U.S. shipments were lower towards the latter portion of the investigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Finally, the ITC found no information in the record indicating potential for product shifting or any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate imminent material injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Plaintiff Did Not Show That The ITC Failed To Consider Evidence In The Record</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Plaintiff challenges the ITC\u2019s findings, asserting that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">ITC failed to consider or failed to state its reasons behind its analysis of the increasing capacity of the Chinese producers, the increasing volume of LTFV drums imports, the price depressing effects of the imports on the domestic industry, increasing inventories of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ported drums both in the U.S. and in China, the potential for shifting drum production into rotor production * * * and underselling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Plaintiffs Brief at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">An examination of the Commission\u2019s opinion shows that the ITC considered all the relevant economic factors required by the statute. Once again, Plaintiff is arguingthat the ITC should have arrived at a different conclusion based on the factual foundation behind the analysis. Once again, the Court notes that as in a material injury determination, the ITC\u2019s threat determination \u201cis afforded discretion in interpreting the data, and the court does not weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Group, </em>18 CIT at 1224, 873 F.

Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Thus, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the challenged determination is unsupported by substantial evidence, <em>see Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., </em>17 CIT at 802-803, and it is a burden that Plaintiff in this case fails to carry.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">First, Plaintiff claims that the ITC failed to properly consider the increase in capacity for LTFV drums.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Plaintiff also asserts that the ITC failed to explain its \u201cremote\u201d conclusion that \u201cthere is also an increasing emphasis among Chinese producers to increase production for home market consumption and exports to third-country markets.\u201d Plaintiffs Brief at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">As discussed earlier, the ITC acknowledged the increase in capacity, but determined that in light of the prior history, the increase in capacity would not lead to a likelihood of substantially increased subject imports to the United States. More specifically, the ITC reasoned that significant capacity increases during the latter portion of the POI coincided with a decrease in subject drum volume and market penetration. For example, although capacity [ ] by [ ] units from interim 1995 to interim 1996, subject import volume and market penetration decreased from interim 1995 to interim 1996. Therefore, since little correlation existed between capacity increases in China and changes in subject import volumes during the POI, the ITC could not conclude the existence of additional capacity in China alone indicates a likelihood of substantially increased imports to the United States. <em>Final Determination </em>at 25. <em>See Calabrian Corp., </em>16 CIT at 354, 794 F. Supp. at 388 (strong indication of likelihood of injury in the near future is industry\u2019s present state); <em>see also </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1156, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 174 (1984) <em>reprinted in </em>1984 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>U.S.C.C.A.N. 5220, 5291 (determination of threat requires careful assessment of identifiable current trends).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">Moreover, in contrast to Plaintiffs claim, the ITC did not render its conclusion that Chinese producers are increasing production for other markets without foundation, but based its decision on the evidence presented in the record. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 25, n. 140. First, data submitted in response to the ITC questionnaires from the Chinese producers indicate a projected [ ] in exports to other markets from [ ] units in 1996to [ ] in 1997. Defendant\u2019s Confidential Appendix at Doc. No. 33. Second, at the hearing, a witness testified to the significant growth in the automotive industry in China. Commission Hearing Transcript dated February 28,1997 attached to Defendant\u2019s Non-confidential Appendix. Finally, the ITC relied on information submitted by Plaintiff in its prehearing brief which described the Chinese automotive industry\u2019s plan to \u201c develop into a pillar industry of the national economy. \u201d Exhibit 9 of Plaintiff s Prehearing Brief attached to Defendant\u2019s Non-confidential Appendix. Therefore, the Court finds that the ITC reasonably concluded that the increase in capacity Vould not lead to a likelihood of substantially increased LTFV imports into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Next, contrary to Plaintiffs assertion that the ITC did not explain its reasoning for discounting the decrease in U.S. price, the effects of underselling, and the substitutability of the products, the ITC considered the evidence but did not find it likely that the subject drum imports will have significant depressing effects on domestic prices. <em>Final Determination </em>at 25. The ITC specifically referred to its findings involving underselling and substitutability discussed in its material injury determination. Since the ITC previously found that at current levels, the subject imports did not have adverse effects on domestic prices, the ITC found that there is no basis for concluding that \u201csuch price effects are likely to occur in the imminent future. \u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 25.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See Committee of Domestic Steel Wire Rope and Specialty Cable Manufacturers v. United States, </em>17 CIT 233, 818 F. Supp. 376 (1993) (affirming no threat determination despite evidence of underselling since no indication of suppressing effect on U.S. prices); <em>Calabrian Corp., </em>16 CIT at 354, 794 F. Supp. at 388 (\u201cA strong indication of the likelihood of material injury to an industry in the near future is its present state.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Plaintiff protests the ITC\u2019s classification of inventories maintained in China as minimal. [However, an examination of inventories over total shipments results in only a negligible ratio.] <em>See U.S. Steel Group, </em>873 F. Supp. at 702 (affirming no threat determination because, <em>inter alia, </em>Canadian inventory volumes were small as compared with total Canadian shipments). It was not unreasonable for the ITC to conclude that the level of inventories was minimal and therefore did not pose a threat to the U.S. industry. Moreover, as the ITC explained, although inventories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of the subject imports in the United States increased over the POI,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the ratios of LTFV imports inventories to subject imports and to U.S. shipments of subject imports decreased from 1993 to 1995. <em>Final Determination </em>at 25. This decline in ratios indicated that there was no inventory buildup of subject imports in the United States.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Plaintiff also contends that the ITC failed to substantiate its conclusion that no potential for product shifting existed given the fact that five ofthe brake drum producers also produce brake rotors.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Plaintiff states that \u201cthere are five producers who could potentially shift all of their resources from producing drums to producingthe rotors * * Plaintiffs Brief at 28. The Court finds Plaintiffs contention lacks merit. Theoretically, if all five producers discontinued the production of brake drums and shifted their resources in order to produce more rotors, any potentially existing threat to the domestic brake drum industry would diminish. Instead, the ITC found no information in the record indicating any potential for product-shifting. <em>See Stalexport v. United States, </em>19 CIT 758, 784, 890 F. Supp. 1053, 1074 (1995) (threat determination may not be based on conjecture or speculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Additionally, Plaintiff argues that the ITC failed to properly consider additional relevant adverse factors such as U.S. producers\u2019 statement of plans for production, an increase in Chinese drum capacity, underselling, product substitutability, and the financial loss of two U.S. drum producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The Court has already addressed the issues of increasing Chinese drum capacity, underselling and product substitutability and its reasoning and conclusions will not be repeated here. As to the U.S. producers\u2019 statements concerning future plans for production, Plaintiff claims that [the ITC ignored their statements relating to obstacles for future growth in its threat determination.] Defendant claims that Plaintiff miseharacterizes the producers\u2019 statements concerning actual and potential effects concerning plans for product development, capital raising and production efforts.
