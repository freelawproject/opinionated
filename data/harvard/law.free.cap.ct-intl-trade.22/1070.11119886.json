This review involves four producer-exporters: POSCO, POCOS, Union, and Dongbu.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">The court has jurisdiction to review the final results of an antidump-ing duty administrative review pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(l)(D) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">The court upholds the final results of an antidumping duty administrative review unless they are \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">In questions of statutory interpretation, the court determines first whether Congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue. <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). Where a statute is clear and on point, the court gives direct effect to Congress\u2019 intent, but where a statute is silent or ambiguous, the court defers to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its statutory mandate. <em>Id. </em>at 842-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">I. EP v. CEP Classification</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">In its administrative review, Commerce classified all U.S. sales of subject merchandise as Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) sales, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a) (1994). <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18434. Commerce based this decision on an application of the three-part test developed in <em>PQ Corp. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 53, 63-65, 652 F. Supp. 724, 733-35 (1987). This test requires EP (formerly known as \u201cpurchase price\u201d (\u201cPP\u201d)) classification of sales made prior to import and through affiliated entities in the U.S. where the following criteria are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-9\">(1) The subject merchandise was shipped directly from the manufacturer to the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory of the related shipping agent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-10\">(2) direct shipment from the manufacturer to the unrelated buyer was the customary channel for sales of this merchandise between the parties involved; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-11\">(3) the related selling agent in the United States acted only as a processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link with the unrelated U.S. buyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-12\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18423 [hereinafter <em>\u201cPQ. </em>test\u201d]. Where all elements of the test are satisfied, Commerce \u201cconsider^] the exporter\u2019s selling functions to have been relocated geographically from the country of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performs them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-13\">Domestic Producers dispute Commerce\u2019s use of the <em>PQ. </em>test at all, arguing that Congress intended, through the EP and Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d) provisions, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677a(a)-(b) (1994), that Commerce classify as CEP sales transactions which have associated U.S. indirect selling expenses. Thus, Domestic Producers request a remand on this issue. Defendant and Foreign Producers contend that Commerce\u2019s use of the <em>P.Q. </em>test is in accordance with law and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-14\">Domestic Producers further dispute Commerce\u2019s specific application of thePQ. test to these facts, contending that Commerce\u2019s classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>of U.S. sales by the Foreign Producers as EP sales is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, they claim that each Foreign Producer\u2019s U.S. affiliate performs services beyond the mere document processing and information conduit functions described by the <em>P.Q. </em>test\u2019s third prong. Defendant requests a remand to reconsider its classification of the sales as EP because Commerce allegedly did not consider all record evidence. Foreign Producers oppose a remand. The facts individually relevant to POCOS, POSCO, Union, and Dongbu are discussed separately, in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">POCOS</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">To meet a U.S. production order, producer-exporter POCOS first sells subject merchandise to an affiliated Korean trading company, XYI,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which takes title. <em>POSCO\u2019s Section A Questionnaire Response </em>(Oct. 17, 1995), at A-25, C.R. Doc. 3, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 1, at 14. XYI resells the merchandise to another POCOS affiliate, XYA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> located in the United States, <em>id., </em>which takes title and acts as importer of record, <em>Letter from POSCO to Commerce </em>(Feb. 27,1996), at 24, C.R. Doc. 41, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at2 <em>(\u201cPOSCO\u2019s Letter\u201d). </em>XYA then resells the merchandise to the unaffiliated customer. <em>POSCO\u2019s Section A Questionnaire Response, </em>at A-25, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 1, at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">The essential terms of sale are established prior to exportation of subject merchandise from Korea. Customers contact XYA and negotiate the preliminary terms of sale. <em>POSCO\u2019s Letter, </em>Ex.8, at 9, Pi\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 8. There are no published price lists for POCOS\u2019 products. <em>POSCO\u2019s Section A Questionnaire Response, </em>at A-47, Pl.\u2019s App, Tab 1, at 21. Instead, POCOS provides XYA with quarterly base and other price lists<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to whichXYA adds overhead and brokerage and handlingfees to provide a price quotation. <em>Id. </em>at A-41, A-47. XYA transmits the price quotation to POCOS for confirmation. <em>POSCO\u2019s Letter, </em>Ex.8, at 9, Pi\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 8. Upon receipt of POCOS\u2019 confirmation, XYA issues a sales contract to the customer. <em>POSCO\u2019s Section A Questionnaire Response, </em>at A-41, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 1, at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">In addition, XYA arranges and pays for marine insurance, U.S. transportation, U.S. customs clearance, and brokerage and handling services for individual shipments of subject merchandise. <em>Id., </em>at A-33, PI. \u2019s App., Tab 1, at 17. XYA collects payment directly from the customers. <em>POS-CO\u2019s Letter, </em>at 24, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab. 9, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Domestic Producers contend that XYA has wide latitude in setting price and that POCOS does not exercise control when it confirms XYA\u2019s price, but rather simply \u201crubber stamps\u201d the sale. This sharply contrasts with Commerce\u2019s characterization of the relation \u2014 placing con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>trol over the sale fully with POCOS \u2014 implicit in its decision to classify these as EP sales. Specifically, Commerce explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-4\">the selling functions of [XYA] * * * are of a kind that would normally be undertaken by the exporter in connection with these sales. The role of [XYA] * * * in the payment of cash deposits of antidump-ing and countervailing duties, their arrangement of certain movement-related expenses, their involvement in contracts with customers and commissionaires and in activities related to customer payment, are consistent with EP classification and are a relocation of routine selling functions from Korea to the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18433.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">POSCO</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">Producer-exporter POSCO first sells subject merchandise destined for the United States to ABI,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a trading company wholly owned by POS-CO, which takes title to the merchandise. <em>POSCO\u2019s Letter, </em>at 29, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 3. ABI resells the merchandise to ABA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> also wholly owned by POSCO, located in the United States. <em>Id. </em>ABA takes title to the merchandise, and acts as importer of record. <em>Id., </em>at 29-30, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 3-4. ABA resells the merchandise to the unaffiliated customer. <em>POSCO\u2019s Home Market Verification Report </em>(Sept. 18, 1996), Ex. 24, at 54, C.R. Doc. 170, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 29, at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">The terms of sale are established prior to export to the United States. U.S. customers submit purchases orders to ABA with a price per unit stated on the order. <em>Id. </em>at 20, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab. 29, at 7. Then the order is submitted to POSCO in Korea for confirmation, after which ABA issues the invoice to the customer. <em>POSCO\u2019s Letter, </em>at 29-30, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 3-4, <em>POSCO\u2019s Home Market Verification Report, </em>at 78, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 29, at 9. ABA arranges and pays for services such as U.S. inland transportation, U.S. customs clearance, and brokerage and handlingfor individual shipments of subject merchandise. <em>POSCO\u2019s Letter, </em>at 29-30, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 3-4. In addition, ABA collects payment from customers. <em>Id., </em>at 29, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">Domestic Producers requested that POSCO\u2019s U.S. sales be classified as CEP sales. <em>Domestic Producers\u2019POSCO Case Brief </em>(March 5,1997), at 5, C.R. Doc. 226, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 33, at 2. Commerce classified them, however, as EP sales. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18433.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">Union</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">Producer-exporter Union sells to its U.S. affiliate, Union America, which takes title, <em>Union\u2019s Section A Questionnaire Response </em>(Oct. 20, 1995), at 16, C.R.

Dongbu USA\u2019s role in the payment of cash deposits of antidumping and countervailing duties, extension of credit to U.S. customers, the processing of certain warranty claims, and project development are consistent with EP classification and are a relocation of routine selling functions from Korea to the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">\n<em>Id</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">Having classified the U.S. sales at issue as EP sales, Commerce now asserts that it failed to consider all evidence of record and desires a remand to reconsider the classification in light of this error. The court finds this position disingenuous. The documents cited by Government counsel at oral argument have been central to the proceeding. Further, they do not detract from the substantial evidence which supported Commerce\u2019s original determination. Commerce had ample time before oral argument to establish error warranting remand. It did not do so. Nor have the domestic producers established error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">The three-part <em>P.Q. </em>test has been accepted by the court, <em>see Mitsubishi v. United States, </em>15 F. Supp. 2d 807, 813-14 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1998), and its use here did not contradict the statute. The test is simply a means to determine whether the sale at issue for antidumping duty purposes is in essence between the exporter/producer and the unaffiliated buyer, in which case the EP rules apply, or whether the intermediate sale to the affiliate has sufficient substance that the CEP rules apply. There is no conflict between the words of 19U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677a(a)-(b) andthePQ. test. The focus here is on the third prong of the test: whether the sales agent is more than a communication link and a paper processor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">As indicated in <em>U.S. Steel Group </em>\u2014 A <em>Unit of USX Group v. United States, </em>15 F. Supp. 2d 892, 903 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1998), at the time Commerce made the determination at issue, the distinctions drawn under the third prong of the <em>P.Q. </em>test were extremely subtle. Nonetheless, there was nothing of record indicating clearly that the sales agents at issue here took steps beyond those still found acceptable for EP (formerly PP) classification purposes in many cases. <em>See e.g. Outokumpu Copper Rolled Prods. AB v. United States, </em>17 CIT 848, 858-59, 829 F.

While before the final determination Commerce may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>free to assess the evidence differently than it did, it was not error to classify the sales at issue as EP sales. The court suggests that Commerce devise some clearer standards for EP/CEP decision-making, but those standards cannot be applied in a case such as this, where the standards applied were acceptable at the time applied and where substantial evidence existed for the decision made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">II. Collapsing the POSCO Group and Application of the Fair Value and Major Input Provisions to Susbstrate Transfers Between POSCO Group Members</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Commerce collapsed POSCO, POCOS, and PSI into the POSCO Group for its dumping analysis and levied a single antidumping duty on the entire group. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18430. POSCO supplies POCOS and PSI with various types of rolled coil substrate, the major input to the subject merchandise these companies sell in the U.S. <em>Letter from POSCO to Commerce </em>(April 12, 1996), at 26, C.R. Doc. 66, Def.\u2019s Conf. App., Ex. 6, at 3. In its <em>Preliminary Results, </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 51887, Commerce applied 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3) (1994), the fair value<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and major input<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provisions, to calculate substrate costs for the POS-CO group. This method required Commerce to treat each member of the collapsed POSCO group as an individual entity for the purpose of calculating substrate costs. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3). Commerce used the transfer price POSCO charged to POCOS and PSI as the substrate value in its EP calculations. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 51887.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">POSCO challenged this before Commerce, arguing that if Commerce were to levy a single antidumping duty upon the entire POSCO Group, it would be inconsistent to calculate substrate costs by separating the affiliated entities. <em>POSCO\u2019s Response to Petitioner\u2019s Comments </em>(Sept. 25,1996), at 19, PR. Doc. 367, Def. App., Ex. 14, at 2. Domestic Producers countered that POSCO, POCOS, and PSI meet the definition of affiliates in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33) (1994), so the fair value and major input provisions should apply <em>Petitioners\u2019 Rebuttal Brief before Commerce </em>(Dec. 9,1996), at 2, PR. Doc. 421, Def.\u2019s App., Ex. 16, at 2. While collapsing the POSCO Group might be appropriate for levying the antidump-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>ing duty, they argued, such intimate affiliation does not elide corporate boundaries for purposes of calculating substrate costs. <em>Id., </em>at 5, Def\u2019s App., Ex. 16, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">Commerce agreed with POSCO that collapsingthe POSCO Group required Commerce to consider the substrate sales as between different parts of a single entity, not as between separate affiliated entities, so 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3) would not apply. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18430. Commerce revised its calculation accordingly <em>Id. </em>at 18,431. Domestic Producers here contend that Commerce erred in that revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">Domestic Producers contend that Commerce erred when it collapsed POSCO, POCOS, and PSI into the POSCO Group for sales and costs purposes and calculated a single antidumping margin. Domestic Producers argue that because POSCO owns fifty percent of POCOS, POS-CO and POCOS are \u201caffiliated persons\u201d pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(33)(E)-(F) (1994).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They reason that Commerce is precluded from collapsing them, because the statute permits collapsing or affiliation, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">Commerce is directed to \u201cdetermine the individual weighted average dumping margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-l(c)(l) (1994). Through its collapsing practice, Commerce treats closely related companies as a single exporter or producer for purposes of the antidumping inquiry. The statute defines exporters and producers tautologically as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-8\">the exporter of the subject merchandise, the producer of the subject merchandise, or both where appropriate. For purposes of section 1677b of this title, the term \u2018exporter or producer\u2019 incl\u00fcdes both the exporter of the subject merchandise and the producer of the same subject merchandise to the extent necessary to accurately calculate the total amount incurred and realized for costs, .expenses, and profits in connection with production and sale of that merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(28) (1994). The statute is silent as to what constitutes an individual exporter or producer. Where a statute is silent or ambiguous, the court defers to Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its statutory mandate. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">Commerce\u2019s collapsing practice is long standing, <em>see e.g. Certain Fresh-Cut Flowers from Colombia, </em>61 Fed.

L. No. 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994), the issue hears closer examination <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">The statute leaves Commerce the discretion to collapse. The definition of exporter or producer, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(28) permits Commerce to include the producer and exporter of the subject merchandise \u201cto the extent necessary. \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under both the \u201cfair value\u201d and \u201cmajor input\u201d provisions, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3), Commerce \u201cmay\u201d disregard transactions between affiliated parties if they do not reflect market value, but does not appear to be required by the statute to do so.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus Commerce has the discretion to disregard transactions between affiliated parties where appropriate. Commerce has deemed the case of collapsed entities to be such an instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">There is no explicit reference to collapsing in the legislative history. The legislative history reflects Congressional awareness of collapsing. With reference to the definition of exporter or producer in 19 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>\u00a7 1677(28), the Senate noted that where different firms perform the production and selling functions, Commerce <em>may </em>include the costs, expenses, and profits related to sales of subject merchandise of each firm, <em>consistent with Commerce\u2019s current practice. </em>S. Rep. No. 103-412, at 61 (1994) (emphasis added). The court finds Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the statute as continuing to permit collapsing to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">Domestic Producers argue that even if Commerce could collapse the members of the POSCO Group, Commerce erred in not applyingthe fair value and major input provisions, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3), to substrate transfers between POSCO Group companies, because these are mandatory provisions for affiliated companies, collapsed or not. Domestic Producers argue that POSCO and POCOS meet the definition of affiliated parties in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(33)(E)-(F), which make no reference to, or exception for, collapsed companies. The court affirms Commerce\u2019s determination that the provisions did not apply because, once collapsed, the POSCO Group was a single entity, not a group of \u201caffiliated persons.\u201d <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18430-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">While POSCO and POCOS, if considered separately, meet the definition of affiliated persons in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(33)(E)-(F), the fact that the fair value and major input provisions, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3), do not refer to collapsed entities, and only to \u201caffiliated persons,\u201d does not mean the statute requires application of these provisions to collapsed groups. The court finds, rather, that because the statute is silent about, and does not conflict with, Commerce\u2019s collapsing practice, Commerce is within its discretion in deciding to treat collapsed parties as no longer separate affiliates for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3). <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">Commerce reasoned that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(f)(2)-(3) did not apply because \u201ca decision to treat affiliated parties as a single entity necessitates that transactions among the parties also be valued based on the group as a whole.\u201d <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18430. This is consistent with Commerce\u2019s practice of not applyingthe fair value and major input provisions to transfers of substrate between divisions of the same company. <em>Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from the United Kingdom, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 54613, 54614 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996) (final results of anti-dumping duty administrative review). Commerce did apply the provisions to substrate transfers between partially collapsed companies in <em>Large Newspaper Printing Presses from Germany, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 38166, 38187-88 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996) (final determination), but there the companies manufactured different equipment models and were collapsed for cost purposes for selected items only, but not for all purposes, 61 Fed. Reg. at 38188, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">As the agency notes this review marks a change in Commerce\u2019s collapsing practice. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18430-31 (\u201cWe find that our prior practice of collapsing entities while continuing to apply the fair-value provision and the major-input rule is improper.\u201d). As of the administrative decision reviewed in <em>Fag v. United States, </em>No. 98-133, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>slip op., 1998WL 721119 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1998), Commerce hadnot fully-considered whether collapsed companies should be regarded as a single entity or as related parties. Whether or not Commerce\u2019s treatment of collapsed companies as related parties for purposes of calculating constructed value was permissible under the old statute and accorded with pre-URAA administrative practice, as found in <em>Fag (UK.), </em>No. 98-133, slip op. at 14-17, 1998 WL 721119, the court now recognizes Commerce\u2019s revised interpretation and changed practice as not only permissible but preferable as a more logical, integrated application of the statute. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 863 (initial agency interpretation not \u201ccarved in stone\u201d)- see <em>also </em>David M. Gossett, Comment, <em>Chevron, Take Two: Deference to Revised Agency Interpretations of Statutes, </em>64 U. Chi. L. Rev. 681,682 (1997) (courts equally deferential to revised agency statutory interpretations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Commerce determined that POSCO, POCOS, and PSI represent one producer of subject merchandise and collapsed them into a single entity, the POSCO Group, for both sales and costs purposes. Once collapsed, the POSCO Group was treated as a single entity, not a set of affiliated persons. Commerce reasonably determined that it should act consistently with its collapsing determination and not apply inconsistent solitary provisions, thereby arbitrarily increasing respondents\u2019 liability. Therefore, the court sustains Commerce\u2019s decision not to apply the fair value and major input provisions to these entities which were collapsed for all relevant purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">III. Affiliation of POSCO with Union or Dongbu</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">POSCO and Union\u2019s parent company, DSM, own 50 and 49.99percent of their joint venture, POCOS, respectively. <em>POSCO\u2019s Section A Questionnaire Response, </em>at 17, Def\u2019s App., Tab 1, at 11. Commerce determined that POSCO and Union were not affiliated through \u201ctheir respective affiliations with DSM.\u201d <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18417. Commerce concluded that because neither POSCO nor Union owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, 5 percent or more of the other\u2019s outstanding stock or shares, they cannot be deemed affiliated pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(E). <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18417. Commerce also determined that POSCO and Union are not affiliated pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(F), because the evidence does not show that these companies constitute \u201c(t)wo or more persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, any person.\u201d <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18417.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">A. Corporate Relationships</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">Domestic Producers argued before Commerce that if Commerce collapsed POSCO and POCOS into a single entity, then it should also collapse DSM and Union. POSCO and Union would then be affiliated through POSCO\u2019s and DSM\u2019s joint venture in POCOS. The Domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Producers claimed that Union\u2019s and POCOS\u2019 common use of XYA as their sales affiliate in the U.S. underscores POSCO\u2019s affiliation with Union. <em>Letter from AK Steel to Commerce </em>(Feb. 27,1997), at 82, 99-100, 102, 106, 108, C.R. Doc. 224, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 32, at 2-8. Commerce disagreed, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-4\">[sjubsection (F)\u2019s affiliation standard is met where two parties control a third party, as here. But such a finding of affiliation does not mean that the two affiliated parties control one another. The alleged link between POSCO and Union is even more tenuous. Because POSCO does not control DSM, Union\u2019s parent company, DSM is not a vehicle through which POSCO can indirectly control Union, DSM\u2019s subsidiary. In other words, POSCO affiliation with DSM and DSM control of Union do not add up to POSCO control of Union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\"><em>Final </em>Results, 62 Fed. Reg. at 18417-18. Commerce concluded that no record evidence showed either Union or POSCO to be \u201cin a position to control, either legally or operationally, the other party,\u201d as provided by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(G). <em>Id. </em>at 18418.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">B. Supplier Reliance</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Domestic Producers also sought to ground an affiliation between POSCO and Union and one between POSCO and Dongbu on Union\u2019s and Dongbu\u2019s alleged common reliance on POSCO as their main supplier of hot-rolled coil, the principal input material for the subject merchandise. During the period of review, POSCO supplied a large percentage,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> by volume, and a large percentage,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> by value, of all hot-rolled coil consumed by Dongbu, <em>Dongbu\u2019s Letter, </em>at 7, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 15, at 2, and a large percentage,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> by volume, and a large percentage,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> by value, of all hot-rolled coil consumed by Union, <em>Union\u2019s CR Letter, </em>Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 13, at 2. In addition, Union and Dongbu purchased hot-rolled coil from POSCO even though import prices were lower for 15 out of 23 quarters from 1991 through the third quarter of 1996. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18417.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">Commerce rejected Domestic Producers\u2019 claim that POSCO sold to Union and Dongbu at below its cost of production because Domestic Producers\u2019 estimation of costs were based on all possible types of hot-rolled coil, not the specific products sold to Union and Dongbu. <em>Id. </em>While the average estimated cost of production for all types of hot-rolled coil might be higher than POSCO\u2019s prices to Union and Dongbu, Commerce determined that the actual production costs of hot-rolled coil sold to Union and Dongbu were below the sales price. <em>Id. </em>Finally, Commerce determined that POSCO, Union, and Dongbu all compete in the U.S. mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>ket for sales of finished products. <em>Commerce\u2019s Memo to File </em>(Aug. 28, 1996), at 2, C.R. Doc. 143, Dongbu\u2019s App., Tab 5, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Commerce noted that a finding of affiliation is unwarranted unless \u201ca situation exists where the buyer has, in fact, become reliant on the seller, or vice versa.\u201d <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18417. Moreover, \u201c[t]he record shows that Dongbu and Union have alternate sources of supply for [hot rolled coil], that they can and do purchase significant quantities of [hot rolled coil] from abroad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Commerce determined that POSCO was not affiliated with either Union or Dongbu based on their supplier relationships. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">A. Corporate Relationships</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">Domestic Producers here again contend that if Commerce may collapse the POSCO Group and treat it as a single entity, it must also find DSM to be affiliated with the POSCO Group, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(E), through DSM\u2019s fifty percent ownership of POCOS,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and thus to be affiliated with POSCO as a member of the POSCO Group. They likewise argue that from DSM\u2019s alleged affiliation with Union, Commerce should have derived an affiliation between POSCO and Union, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Based on an analysis of POSCO and POCOS as separate entities, not as members of a single collapsed entity, Commerce determined that neither Union nor DSM were affiliated with POSCO, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(33)(E) \u2014 (F). Commerce may not analyze the relationship of members of the POSCO Group to the outside world as if they were independent once it has collapsed them. Commerce should have determined whether DSM, and thus Union, were affiliated with the entire POSCO Group based on DSM\u2019s percentage ownership and control of the POSCO Group through its fifty percent stake in POCOS. All parties agree that POSCO is an extremely large company relative to POCOS, and thus comprises the overwhelming proportion of assets in the POSCO Group. As a result, DSM\u2019s fifty percent stake in POCOS translates to an extremely small stake in the POSCO Group. When DSM\u2019s relationship to the POSCO Group is analyzed correctly, the only reasonable conclusion on these facts is that DSM has insufficient ownership or control over the POSCO Group to find affiliation pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(33)(E)-(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>DSM is not \u201clegally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the [POSCO Group],\u201d as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33). Commerce already determined that POSCO and DSM are unable to restrain or direct the other\u2019s operations. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18417. It follows that DSM and the POSCO Group cannot direct each other\u2019s operations, given that the POSCO Group is both larger and functionally more complex with the addition of POCOS and PSI than POSCO alone. Because DSM is not affiliated with the POSCO Group, Union is not either, as the argument for the latter affiliation depends upon the former. The court therefore sustains Commerce\u2019s determination that POSCO and Union are not affiliated through their corporate relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">B. Supplier Reliance</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Domestic Producers contend that POSCO and Union, and POSCO and Dongbu, are affiliated pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(G) based on POSCO\u2019s role as a major supplier of hot-rolled coil for Union and Dong-bu. Domestic Producers argue that the statute requires no more than a determination that Dongbu and Union <em>may be </em>reliant on POSCO, rather than evidence of reliance in fact, as Commerce more narrowly interprets it.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Domestic Producers maintain that substantial record evidence supports a finding that POSCO\u2019s supplier relationship to Dongbu and Union puts POSCO in a position to exercise actual restraint over Dong-bu and Union. As the court finds Commerce\u2019s interpretation permissible and its factual finding well supported, Commerce\u2019s determination is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Domestic Producers find evidence for their interpretation of the statute in the Statement of Administrative Action (\u201cSAA\u201d), which explains that \u201c [a] company may be in a position to exercise restraint or direction, for example, through* * * close supplier relationships.\u201d SAA at 838. Domestic Producers argue that if Congress had meant exclusive reliance, the drafters would not have used the apparently less stringent terms \u201cclose supplier relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Domestic Producers, however, quote only selectively from the SAA, significantly omitting the end of the sentence containing that language.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-7\">A company may be in a position to exercise restraint or direction, for example, through * * * close supplier relationships <em>in which the supplier or buyer becomes reliant upon the other.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">SAA at 838 (emphasis added). The full sentence supports not the Domestic Producers\u2019 but rather Commerce\u2019s interpretation that a finding of reliance in fact must precede a determination that two parties are af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>filiated pursuant to 19U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(G).M Commerce\u2019s interpretation, that \u201ccontrol\u201d in a supplier relationship pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(G) is predicated on a finding that reliance between the parties exists in fact, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The court also finds Commerce\u2019s determination that Union and Dongbu were not in fact reliant on POSCO, and vice versa, to be supported by substantial evidence. As indicated, Union and Dongbu purchased large percentages,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> by volume, or by value,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> respectively, of their hot-rolled coil from POSCO. <em>Union\u2019s CR Letter, </em>Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 13, at 2; <em>Dongbu\u2019s Letter, </em>at 7 Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 15, at 2. Commerce has declined to find affiliation where a producer supplied 100 percent of its U.S. sales through a single, unrelated U.S. importer but where the parties are free to seek other business partners. <em>See Melamine Institutional Dinnerware Products from Indonesia, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 43333, 43335 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1996) (preliminary determination). That Dongbu and Union buy approximately twenty-five percent of their hot-rolled coil supply from other sources shows they are free to buy elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Aware that Union and Dongbu continued to buy the majority of their hot-rolled coil from POSCO, despite usually lower import prices, Commerce noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-6\">[t]he record indicates that POSCO has a comparative advantage over imported steel for reasons of proximity, cost, reliability of supply, and differences in specifications, grade, and quality, which can explain POSCO\u2019s position as principal supplier to Dongbu and Union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Final Results, 62 Fed. Reg. 18417. Commerce also considered that the cost of production of hot-rolled coil sold to Union and Dongbu was not higher than the sale price. <em>Id. </em>Finally, Commerce reflected that POSCO, Union, and Dongbu all compete in the U.S. market for sales of finished products. <em>Commerce\u2019s Memo to File, </em>at 2, Dongbu\u2019s App., Tab 15, at 2. The court finds that Commerce based its determination on this substantial record evidence that Dongbu and Union are not reliant in fact on POSCO for their hot-rolled coil supply. The court therefore sustains Commerce\u2019s determination that POSCO is affiliated with neither Union nor Dongbu based on a supplier relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">IV Markups</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">Dongbu USA</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">To export subject merchandise to the U.S., Dongbu employs an affiliated broker, Dongbu Express, that arranges for over-land transportation from the production site to the shipping port in Korea. <em>Dongbu\u2019s Section A Questionnaire Response, </em>at 24, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 2, at 8. Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>merce deducted the markups Dongbu paid to Dongbu Express in its EP calculation. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18427.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\">Domestic Producers argued before Commerce that Dongbu USA\u2019s entire markup, which includes movement expenses, sales-related expenses, and profit, likewise should be deducted in Dongbu\u2019s EP calculation because Dongbu USA\u2019s transactions with Dongbu are identical in substance to those between Dongbu and Dongbu Express. <em>Id. </em>at 18425. Commerce determined, however, that Dongbu\u2019s transactions with Dongbu USA were different from those with Dongbu Express because Dongbu USA hired an outside broker to handle import services. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Commerce determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-5\">the costs of arranging for U.S. brokerage and handling, U.S. customs clearance, and, as the importer of record, the payment of customs duties, are reflected in the brokerage fees paid by Dongbu USA and are accounted for on a sale-by-sale basis in [Dongbu USA\u2019s financial records].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\"><em>Id. </em>Commerce concluded from this that deducting any additional fees charged by Dongbu USA was not required to accurately calculate EE <em>Id. </em>Domestic Producers challenge this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">Union America</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">For its corrosion-resistant sales, Union reported \u201cbarging, inspection fees, entry fees, and handling charges incurred in the United States\u201d in its financial records. <em>Union\u2019s Section B and C Questionnaire Responses, </em>at C-27, PR. Doc. 81, Def.\u2019s App., Ex. 29, 4. Commerce deducted these expenditures from Union\u2019s EP as a component of aggregated U.S. movement expenses. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>61 Fed. Reg. at 51885-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">Domestic Producers argued before Commerce that, in addition to the movement charges already reported, the portion of Union America\u2019s markup attributable to the provision of movement-related services should be deducted from Union\u2019s price in the United States. <em>Petitioners\u2019 Union Case Brief (Dec. </em>2,1996), at 16, PR. Doc. 414, Def.\u2019s App., Ex. 11, at 5. Specifically, they argued that any amount charged by Union America exceeding its reported U.S. movement expenses (1) represents \u201ccharges incurred in bringing the merchandise from the place of shipment to the unaffiliated U.S. customer\u201d and (2) reflects \u201cadditional services that would have been sustained by Union in the absence of [Union America].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 17-18, Def\u2019s App., Ex. 11, at 6-7. Domestic Producers also suggested that, because the services provided by Union America were identical in substance to those provided by Dongbu Express, and because no record information permits Commerce to ascertain precisely what portion of Union America\u2019s markup can be linked to the movement of the subject merchandise, Commerce should employ the record data for Dongbu Express as a proxy for the markups charged by Union America. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. Domestic Producers maintain that \u201c[t]he resulting amount should be deducted from U.S. price, along with other previously-reported movement charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Commerce disagreed and concluded, as it had for Dongbu USA, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-3\">[Union America] does not directly perform* * * U.S. brokerage and handling services for Union but rather employs customs brokers to carry out such services, to facilitate customs clearance, and to pay any customs duties. We verified that all U.S. brokerage and handling expenses (i.e., demurrage and wharfage charges) incurred by [Union America] on behalf of Union were fully reported on a sale-by-sale basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18441. Domestic Producers challenge this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Domestic Producers claim that Commerce erred by not considering the movement services provided by Dongbu USA and Union America as parallel to that of Dongbu Express. They repeat their contention that Commerce should have used Dongbu Express\u2019 markup as a proxy to establish the markup percentage attributable to Dongbu USA\u2019s and Union America\u2019s movement expenses. Instead, Commerce deducted from EP the fees Dongbu USA and Union America paid to unaffiliated brokers for services such as customs clearance and handling, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A) (1994). <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18425, 18441. The court rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 analogy and sustains Commerce\u2019s determination that the brokerage fees accounted for all costs incident to bringing the subject merchandise from the original place of shipment in Korea to the United States and that further deductions from Dongbu USA\u2019s and Union America\u2019s markups for movement costs were not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">Commerce\u2019s standard practice is to define movement expenses under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A) as the cost ofa \u201cmarket transaction\u201d between unrelated parties. <em>See High Information Content Flat Panel Displays and Display Glass Therefor from Japan, </em>56 Fed. Reg. 32376, 32393 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1991) (final determination) <em>[\u201cFlat Displays from Japan\u201d] </em>(deduction of markup charged by affiliated companies for U.S. movement expenses from purchase price sales legitimate because markups \u201cwere equivalent to prices based upon market transactions\u201d); <em>see also Toyota Motor Sales, Inc., v. United States, </em>17 CIT 841, 846-47, 829 F. Supp. 1364, 1369 (1993) (Commerce\u2019s deduction of importer\u2019s entire markup from purchase price affirmed because the markup was equivalent to \u201cthe actual expenses relatingto the movement of subject imports that [the importer] would have incurred regardless of the relationship of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>the party performingthe service\u201d). As the statute<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> does not prescribe a method for Commerce to determine the markup proportion attributable to movement expenses, 19U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A), the court defers to Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its mandate. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43. Commerce\u2019s understanding that movement expenses are completely captured by the market price of movement services is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">Commerce\u2019s approach to determining Dongbu USA\u2019s and Union America\u2019s movement expenses was consistent with its approach to Dongbu Express, even though the outcome differed. Dongbu Express\u2019 sole function is freight forwarding, so its markup reflects only movement expenses. Because Commerce concluded that Dongbu affiliate Dongbu Express\u2019 entire markup was equivalent to the commercially reasonably rates an unaffiliated freight forwarder would have charged, it deducted the entire amount. <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18427.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Unlike Dongbu Express, Dongbu USA and Union America perform sales-related document processing. Moreover, Dongbu USA and Union America themselves do not directly perform movement-related services. Instead, they hire non-affiliated brokers to perform brokerage and handling services. Because Dongbu USA and Union America are involved in both sales and movement functions, Commerce had to determine the markup portion attributable to movement expenses. Commerce reasonably concluded that the brokerage charges captured all movement expenses. When Dongbu USA and Union America hired unaffiliated brokers, they paid the market rate for their services, so Commerce did not need to make amarket comparison, as it had made for Dongbu Express, to determine what portion of the markup reflected commercially reasonable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">Domestic Producers\u2019 suggest that Commerce use Dongbu Express as a proxy to determine the movement expense portion of Dongbu USA\u2019s and Union America\u2019s markups, as it didin the case of POSCO\u2019s and PO-COS\u2019 U.S. affiliates. Domestic Producers argue that all four U.S. affiliates provide identical services to their Korean counterparts and should be treated analogously. Theanalogyis false, leading to a senseless result. POSCO\u2019s and POCOS\u2019 U.S. affiliates perform brokerage services in addition to sales-related document processing. As with Dongbu USA and Union America, Commerce had to determine what portion of their markup was attributable to movement expenses. Unlike Dongbu USA and Union America, however, POSCO\u2019s and POCOS\u2019 U.S. affiliates perform the brokerage and handling services themselves. Commerce, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>therefore, could not define their market rate movement expenses according to brokerage fees, because none existed. Instead, Commerce used Dongbu Express\u2019 markup as a proxy to determine the movement expense portion of POCOS\u2019 and POSCO\u2019s U.S. affiliates\u2019 markups that approximated its normal practice of defining movement expenses by market transactions. <em>See Flat Displays from </em>Japan, 56 Fed. Reg. at 32393. Commerce did not face the same problem with Dongbu USA\u2019s and Union America\u2019s markups because they hired outside brokers to perform movement-related services. Thus, Commerce defined their movement expenses by their brokerage fees. To use the Dongbu Express markup to gauge the movement expenses of Dongbu USA and Union America, would be to substitute unnecessarily for an actual market transaction a proxy which is itself acceptable only because it approximates one. This could not possibly produce a more accurate determination. Thus the court affirms Commerce\u2019s movement expense determination for Dongbu USA and Union America.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\"><em>V. </em>POSCO\u2019s Cost Reconciliation</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">Commerce provided a cost of production and constructed value verification agenda to POSCO which outlined the information it needed to check whether costs reported in POSCO\u2019s financial statements reconciled to its cost accounting system and reported manufacturing costs. <em>Letter from Commerce to POSCO </em>(June 25, 1996), at 7, P.R. Doc. 283, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 22, at 2. Requested data included profitability figures for home market, U.S., and third-country sales which Commerce intended to use to reconcile submitted per-unit costs with POSCO\u2019s cost of manufacturing statement. <em>Id. </em>at 8, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 22, at 3. POSCO provided Commerce with all requested information, including a profitability analysis for home market, U.S., and third-country sales. <em>POSCO\u2019s Cost Verification Report, </em>at Ex. 9, C.R. Doc. 26, Def.\u2019s Conf. App. (\u201cExhibit 26\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">After the <em>Preliminary Results </em>were published, Domestic Producers claimed that Exhibit 26 showed POSCO\u2019s reported costs to be lower than those recorded in its financial statement by a small percentage.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Petitioner\u2019s POSCO Case Brief, </em>at 69, C.R. Doc. 226, Def\u2019s Conf. App., Ex. 3, at 21. Domestic Producers argued before Commerce that, consistent with Commerce\u2019s prior practice, POSCO\u2019s reported costs should be increased accordingly. <em>Id. </em>at 69, Def\u2019s App., Ex. 3, at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">POSCO then explained that Domestic Producers\u2019 analysis of Exhibit 26 was flawed because it compared the sales period of review (August 1, 1994 to July 30,1995) to the cost period of review (July 1,1994 to June 30, 1995). <em>POSCO\u2019s Rebuttal Brief, </em>at 119, C.R. Doc. 435, Def.\u2019s App., Ex. 7, at 22. POSCO further clarified that Exhibit 26 contained esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>mated third country sales figures based on POSCO\u2019s home market sales product distribution because the records it kept did not correspond exactly with Commerce\u2019s preferred methodology. <em>Id. </em>at 120, Def.\u2019s App., Ex. 7, at 23. Thus, an exact match between sales and costs figures was not possible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\">Commerce decided not to adjust POSCO\u2019s reported costs, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-5\">the reconciliation provided by the POSCO group establishes that the reported costs are not understated. * * * [and] that the format of the reconciliation necessarily would not result in a perfect match of reported costs to the financial statement, but * * * that the reconciliation did indicate that all costs are captured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18429.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">Domestic Producers contend that Commerce lacked substantial evidence for its conclusion that the cost of manufacturing as reported in POSCO\u2019s financial statements reconciles with the cost of manufacturing data POSCO provided Commerce. Commerce used as evidence an explanation provided by POSCO at the administrative hearing after the Preliminary Results were published in response to Domestic Producers \u2019 challenge that the costs did not reconcile. Specifically, Domestic Producers argue that Commerce is precluded from considering as evidence an explanation proffered after publication of its Preliminary Results because the record was then closed. Domestic Producers further assert that, even if Commerce might consider it, the POSCO Group\u2019s explanation is not substantial evidence because it is a self-serving statement. The court disagrees with Domestic Producers and sustains Commerce\u2019s determination that POSCO\u2019s costs reconcile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">Domestic Producers\u2019 are not independent investigators with power to re-verify Commerce\u2019s verification. <em>Micron Technology, Inc. v. United States, </em>19 CIT 829, 850, 893 F. Supp. 21, 40 (1995). They may not usurp Commerce\u2019s role as fact-finder and substitute their analysis of POSCO\u2019s cost data for the result reached by Commerce in the Verification Report. Moreover, the court will not supersede Commerce\u2019s conclusions so long as it \u201capplies a reasonable standard to verify materials submitted and the verification is supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept. <em>\u201d Hercules, Inc. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 710, 726, 673 F. Supp 454, 469 (1987) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)). At verification, Commerce conducted numerous sales traces which it described in detail. <em>POSCO Cost Verification Report </em>at 22-24, PR. Doc. 343, Def\u2019s App., Ex. 30, at 2-4. The court finds that Commerce applied a reasonable verification standard and had substantial evidence to support its results. <em>See Micron, </em>893 F. Supp. at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">Had Commerce sought information at verification that POSCO failed to provide, POSCO would not have been allowed to submit that information at the administrative hearing. Here, however, Domestic Producers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>first challenged Exhibit 26 at the administrative hearing itself, claiming their analysis showed that POSCO under-reported its costs. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s POSCO Case Brief, </em>at 69, Def s Conf. App., Ex. 3, at 21. To respond effectively, POSCO had to provide information in its Rebuttal Brief for which Commerce had never asked before or during verification. Because <em>Commerce </em>found no discrepancy at verification, POSCO did not <em>then </em>notify Commerce of the third- country sales assumptions inherent in Exhibit 26. Presumably, had Commerce discovered the discrepancy in spot checks and asked for an explanation, POSCO would have submitted the same information at verification rather than in its Rebuttal Brief. Instead, POSCO first became aware that reconciliation was in dispute upon receiving a copy of Domestic Producers\u2019 Case Brief, by which time the record was closed. The court will not penalize POSCO for not having submitted information during verification that it was not then aware it needed to provide. Under these exceptional circumstances, the court sustains Commerce\u2019s use of POSCO\u2019s explanation as record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\">As noted, Domestic Producers also challenge POSCO\u2019s explanation of the cost discrepancy as a self-serving statement unfit for use by Commerce as substantial evidence. <em>See Carlisle Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. United States, </em>9 CIT 520, 533, 622 F. Supp. 1071, 1082 (1985); <em>see also Micron, </em>893 F. Supp. at 27-28. In <em>Carlisle, </em>the court rejected as substantial evidence a letter from defendant\u2019s counsel describing a verification procedure Commerce had failed to describe in its verification report. <em>Carlisle, </em>622 F. Supp. at 1082. Such a self-interested statement could not be relied on to fill a critical gap in the description of Commerce\u2019s verification procedure. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Micron, </em>plaintiff attempted to justify Commerce\u2019s choice of a disputed cost allocation methodology with reference to a single remark made by its representative at the administrative hearing. <em>Micron, </em>893 F. Supp. at 27. The court rejected plaintiffs argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-4\">Standing alone, this statement offered by a self-interested party after the record had been closed hardly constitutes substantial evidence upon which Commerce could base so sweeping a determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Neither <em>Carlisle </em>nor <em>Micron </em>stands for the proposition that self-serving statements <em>per se </em>may not be used as evidence. To the contrary, a self-interested statement can be relied upon as evidence, so long as it is not contradicted by \u201charder\u201d evidence, such as objectively verifiable facts. <em>See Healey v. Chelsea Resources Ltd., </em>947 F.2d 611, 620 (2nd Cir. 1991) (\u201cThe fact that such testimony may be self-serving goes to its weight rather than to its admissibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">Here, Commerce has described in detail its trace of POSCO\u2019s manufacturing costs, <em>POSCO Verification Report, </em>at 22-24, Def. App., Ex. 30, at 2-4, while in <em>Carlisle </em>it left out a detail critical to its analysis. 9 CIT at 533, 622 F. Supp. at 1082. POSCO\u2019s evidence is not meant to redeem Commerce from its failure to submit a complete Verification Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>port. Commerce\u2019s determination that POSCO\u2019s costs reconcile is based on a thorough Verification Report. POSCO\u2019s explanation provides area-sonable basis for Commerce to reject Domestic Producers\u2019 challenge to Exhibit 26. By contrast with <em>Micron, </em>POSCO\u2019s explanation is not one offered by a self-interested party to compensate for an utter lack of evidence for Commerce\u2019s determination. <em>See Micron, </em>893 F. Supp. at 27. For these reasons, the court finds that Commerce\u2019s use of POSCO\u2019s explanation as substantial evidence for its determination was reasonable and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">VI. Dongbu\u2019s Warehousing Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Prior to export, in its warehouse in the port city of Incheon, Dongbu briefly stores unpainted cold-rolled merchandise produced at its factory in Seoul. <em>Dongbu\u2019s Supp. Questionnaire Response </em>(March 1, 1996), at 79, P.R. Doc. 148, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 16, at 4. Dongbu explained to Commerce that warehousing is necessary because the factory is far from the port. <em>Letter from Union to Commerce </em>(March 28,1996), at 15, P.R. Doc. 179, Def.\u2019s App., Ex. 31, at 2. Commerce verified that Dongbu reported the warehousing costs as part of manufacturing costs, <em>HM Verification Report </em>(Aug. 22,1996), at 38, PR. Doc. 327, Def\u2019s App., Ex. 3, at 3, and accepted this designation in its <em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18425.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Domestic Producers argued to Commerce that Dongbu failed to report the pre-sale warehousing expense as an expense \u201cincident to bringing the subject merchandise from the original place of shipment in the exporting country to the place of delivery in the United States,\u201d as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1677a(c)(2)(A). Letter from AK Steel to Commerce </em>(Sept. 5,1996), at 12-13, PR. Doc. 345, Def. App., Ex. 33, at 2-3. Domestic Producers claimed that the date crucial to the antidumping analysis is the date of shipment from the factory to the warehouse, not the date of shipment from the warehouse itself, and further, that Dongbu had \u201cadmitted warehousing <em>finished </em>products after production is completed and after shipment from the production facility. \u201d <em>Letter from AK Steel to Commerce </em>(Dec. 2, 1996), at 19, PR. Doc. 415, Def. App., Ex. 5, at 17. Domestic Producers thus recommended to Commerce that it consider Dongbu\u2019s data to be flawed and instead resort to facts available which could be derived from the warehousing expense data provided. <em>Id. </em>at 20, Def\u2019s App., Ex. 5, at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">Commerce declined to make the downward adjustment recommended by Domestic Producers, and stated that Dongbu</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-9\">indicated that the warehousing expenses in question are not treated as selling expenses, but rather as cost of manufacturing expenses. [Commerce] noted in the same [verification] report that, as such, the amounts reported in Dongbu\u2019s questionnaire response of May 24, 1996, and the method of allocating these expenses, were shown during Dongbu\u2019s cost verification to tie directly to audited financial statements. Therefore, as in the preliminary results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>these reviews, we have continued to treat these expenses as manufacturing overhead expenses, and we have not deducted them from U.S. price for the final review results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\"><em>Final Results, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 18425.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">Domestic Producers contend that Commerce erred by classifying Dongbu\u2019s Incheon warehousing expenses as a manufacturing cost. Defendant and Domestic Producers now request a remand to reclassify Dongbu\u2019s warehousing expenses under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A). Warehousing that occurs at a site other than the merchandise\u2019s place of production, Domestic Producers argue, is properly classified as a movement expense. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">The court does not need to decide this issue because, as all parties agreed at oral argument, the dollar amount at the core of this dispute is quite small. If an error did occur, it was harmless error. Therefore, although Defendant acknowledges that an error may have occurred, the court does not remand because, alone, a reclassification of the warehousing expenses will not result in an adjustment of Dongbu\u2019s dumping margin. Accordingly, the court sustains Commerce\u2019s determination in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1089-10\"> Domestic Producers raised no claims regarding PSI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1089-11\"> The distinctness of POSCO and POCOS, as applied to many of Commerce\u2019s determinations, is contested by AK Steelbecause POSCO owns fifty percent of POCOS.
