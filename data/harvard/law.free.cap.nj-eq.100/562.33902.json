I find that the complainant has not carried the burden of proof necessary to sustain the allegations of the bill. That he has not proven that Abramson was his agent at the time of the purchase by Abramson from Kleinhans, and that Abramson was not acting for himself in said purchase, and that the sale to Davis was from Abramson. Though the deed was made directly from Kleinhans to Abramson, this is not under the evidence sufficient to prove that Abramson was acting as agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b594-11\">\u201cThe bill will be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-12\"><em>Messrs.
