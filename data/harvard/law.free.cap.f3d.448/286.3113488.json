At the time of the accident, Kathy Thompson and her husband were covered under an automobile insurance policy issued to them by USAA Insurance Company (USAA).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-24\">On October 24, 2002, David Peagler (Peagler), the personal representative of the estate of Kathy Thompson, brought this action in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas for Clarendon County. The action was removed to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina on November 25, 2002, based on diversity of citizenship. The action sought a declaration that the automobile insurance policy issued to the Thomp-sons provided coverage for the accident that occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-25\">After the parties entered into a stipulation of facts, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On June 24, 2004, the district court granted Peagler\u2019s motion and denied USAA\u2019s motion. USAA filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>In order to resolve USAA\u2019s appeal, we certified a question to the South Carolina Supreme Court. The South Carolina Supreme Court reformulated the question and answered the following question in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">Did Decedent\u2019s fatal injury arise out of the \u201cownership, maintenance, or use\u201d of a motor vehicle pursuant to S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 38-77-140 (2002), such that the vehicle\u2019s insurance policy provides coverage for the accidental discharge of a shotgun which occurred during the unloading of firearms from a stationary, occupied vehicle which had been used for hunting purposes the previous day?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s negative answer to this question requires that we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Peagler with respect to the coverage issue presented in this appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\n<em>REVERSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-12\"> We note that Peagler filed a petition for rehearing in the South Carolina Supreme Court which was denied by that court on April 26, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
