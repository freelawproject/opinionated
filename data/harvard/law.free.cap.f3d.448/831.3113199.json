His wife, Cheryl Gittinger, failed to file a return for the years 1999 and 2000. The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service notified the Gittingers of the deficiencies. The Gittingers responded by filing the petition at issue with the United States Tax Court, asserting primarily that the government cannot tax their wages as income. The Commissioner moved for summary judgment, and the Gittingers filed a voluminous response. The Tax Court granted judgment for the Commissioner, determining that the Gittingers were liable for the existing deficiencies and penalties. In addition, the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>imposed new penalties. The Git-tingers appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-17\">This is not Mr. Gittinger\u2019s first rendezvous with the Tax Court. He made the same argument to the court in a challenge to his tax liabilities for the year 1996. In that challenge, the Tax Court rejected his contention that wages are not income, and this Court affirmed and granted the Commissioner\u2019s request for sanctions. <em>Gittinger v. Comm\u2019r, </em>138 Fed.Appx. 646, 648 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished) (describing Git-tinger\u2019s argument \u201cas completely and utterly frivolous\u201d). Apparently, Mr. Gittinger wants another go-round.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-18\">The Tax Court correctly described the Gittingers\u2019 petition as consisting of \u201ctax protestor rhetoric.\u201d On appeal, the Git-tingers repeat that rhetoric. They list nineteen separate issues, but only one is pertinent: \u201cWhether the allegations in the petition and ... instant proceeding are \u2018frivolous and groundless?\u2019 \u201d The answer is yes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To see this fact, Mr. Gittinger need only have referred to the result in the action concerning his 1996 tax liabilities. Mr. Gittinger certainly knew how to access that result; he is a licensed attorney who has been practicing law in Texas since 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-19\">Given the frivolous nature of this appeal, \u201c[w]e perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some colorable merit.\u201d <em>Crain v. Comm\u2019r, </em>737 F.2d 1417, 1417 (5th Cir.1984). We AF<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>FIRM the Tax Court\u2019s grant of summary-judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In addition, we agree with the Commissioner that sanctions are appropriate. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(c)(4) (2000) and Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>see also Tello v. Comm\u2019r, </em>410 F.3d 743, 744 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cA party who continues to advance long-defunct arguments invites sanctions.\u201d). It is therefore ORDERED that Appellee\u2019s motion for sanctions in the amount of $6000.00 is GRANTED. <em>See Tello, </em>410 F.3d at 745 (approving the practice of imposing a lump sum sanction).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-11\">. This determination includes consideration of the Gittingers' improper notice argument. Mr. Gittinger contends that the notice was defective because it did not include the \"III\u201d designation. He makes this argument despite the fact that the notice (1) had his social security number on it, (2) was addressed to \"Leonard J. Gittinger,\u201d and (3) was sent to his address.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
