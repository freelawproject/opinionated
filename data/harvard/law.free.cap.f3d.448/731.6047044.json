Castaneda-Barrientos, </em>108 Fed.Appx. 878 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Castaneda-Barrientos v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1113, 125 S.Ct. 1077, 160 L.Ed.2d 1054 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-25\">Castaneda argues that his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Booker </em>because the district court imposed his sentence based on a factual finding that his prior conviction for transporting illegal aliens was an alien smuggling offense \u201cfor profit.\u201d The Government concedes <em>Booker </em>error and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>that the error is not harmless. However, the Government argues the issue was not preserved in the district court in order to be subject to harmless-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">A defendant is not required to specifically reference the Sixth Amendment, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to preserve a <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 543-44 (5th Cir.2005). If a defendant voices repeated objections sufficient to apprise the sentencing court that he is raising a constitutional claim with respect to judicial fact-finding in the sentencing process, the error is preserved. <em>Id. </em>Castaneda referenced <em>Apprendi </em>and specifically stated that he was challenging the constitutionality of the court\u2019s fact-finding regarding his prior conviction for an alien smuggling offense. Thus, the issue is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Because the Government concedes a Sixth Amendment error in violation of <em>Booker </em>that is not harmless, the judgment of conviction is REINSTATED, the sentence is VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
