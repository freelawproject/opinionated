To each of- these answers the demandant replies, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>he ought not to be precluded, &amp;c., because he says that the evidence offered therein to support die fac .s alleged therein is insufficient to prove the said facts, and that the said pleas are severally, in other respects, insufficient and informal; to which he is not bound by the law of the land to answer ; \u2014 wheieiore he prays judgment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">The tenant rejoins that his pleas are severally good, and the evidence offered sufficient in law for the purpose of proving the facts alleged ; and forasmuch as the demandant has not denied that such evidence will be given, but only denied its sufficiency, he prays judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-6\">* <em>Baylies,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK2\">for the demandant, insisted that the case was not within the statute, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> which gives this extraordinary defence only where one is <em>\u201c </em>sued on any bond, contract, mortgage, or assurance, for the payment of any moneys, wares, merchandise, or other commodities.\u201d The great danger of perjury arising out of this provision of the statute will naturally prevent its being extended beyond its necessary construction. This action is not brought on a mortgage, or any other assurance for the payment of money or any other commodity whatsoever.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> <em>Stat. </em>1783, <em>c. </em>55, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b295-7\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Akrq\">Clearly in this action the tenant is not by the statute entitled to this peculiar mode of defence. If he could have proved the case stated in \u2022 his pleas, he should have gone to the jury with his evidence. The pleas are adjudged bad, and the demandant must have judgment for possession of the demandet premises</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
