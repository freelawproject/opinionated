The plain intent, and the * true construction of the condition, is, that <em>Dodds </em>should faithfully perform his duty so long as he continued in the service of the plaintiffs, and that he should continue in that service for two years, unless sooner discharged. If he had continued ten years, the defendants assured his fidelity. The last condition is wholly distinct, and independent of the preceding ones. If there has been a failure in any branch of the condition, the bond is forfeited, and the defendants are liable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-9\"><em>Blake </em>and <em>Mills,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdF\">for the defendants, contended that, from the whole condition taken together, it was apparent that the defendants engaged for the fidelity of <em>Dodds </em>during the two years only. Had the intention been otherwise, it would have been so expressed, and especially since, by the mentioning of two years, it was obvious that the most natural construction would limit the engagement to that term. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-10\"><em>Bigelow </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj8c\">In Lord <em>Arlington\u2019s </em>case, the time was expressly stated in the preamble, and this limited all that followed. Here the whole is indefinite, except the independent covenant, that <em>Dodds </em>should not quit the service of the plaintiffs until after two years. This limitation was plainly introduced for the benefit of the plaintiffs, that they might have the use of <em>Dodds\u2019s </em>services, when he should become more expert in the business, and that they might not be exposed to the inconvenience of frequent changes in their domestic and confidential servants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-11\">The action was continued for advisement; and now,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b242-13\"> 1 <em>Sound. </em>66, <em>Butter </em>vs. <em>Wigge. </em>\u2014 3 <em>Wils. </em>530, <em>Wright </em>vs. <em>Russell. </em>\u20142 <em>W.
