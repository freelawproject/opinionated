The said vessel * then proceeded to the port of <em>Gluckstadt, </em>in the dominions of the king of <em>Denmark, </em>where she arrived on the 14th of January. Upon her arrival at <em>Gluckstadt, </em>the vessel and cargo were immediately seized by the <em>Danish </em>government, and forcibly kept and detained from the master and crew until the 13th of March, at which time, after divers examinations of the master, and crew, and papers, the vessel and cargo were released upon payment of charges and expenses by the master. The cargo was landed by order of the government soon after the seizure.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-9\">\u201c After the release of the vessel andz cargo, as aforesaid, on the 2d of April, the consignee of the cargo, finding it impossible for the vessel to get round to <em>Tonningen, </em>on account of the <em>French </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>batteries at <em>Cuxhaven, </em>at the mouth of the <em>Elbe, </em>consented to receive, and did receive, the said cargo at <em>Gluckstadt, </em>and discharged the bills of lading, and paid the stipulated freight.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">\u201c The master, while at <em>Gluckstadt, </em>procured leave from the <em>Danish </em>government to go to <em>Tonningen, </em>but could not obtain per mission of the <em>French </em>at <em>Cuxhaven </em>to pass out of the <em>Elbe, </em>and so did not attempt to sail to <em>Tonningen. </em>In May, 1810, he cleared out his vessel for <em>New Orleans, </em>and thereupon proceeded down the river about eight leagues towards <em>Cuxhaven, </em>but was not allowed to pass the fort at that place, and returned back to <em>Gluckstadt </em>in three or four days from the time of his departure. \u2014 At the time when said vessel went into the <em>Elbe, </em>the port and batteries of <em>Cuxhaven, </em>at the mouth of said river, and commanding the entrance and navigation thereof, were in possession of the <em>French, </em>and so continued until after the 24th of December, 1810; and on that account, it was not in the power of the master and mariners, at any time after said vessel went into the Elbe, to <em>get </em>her out of said river.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">\u201c It is also agreed that, from the termination of the voyage insured, the said brig was intended to be a <em>seeking </em>vessel; and that, at <em>Gluckstadt, </em>the master believed that he should be able to find employment at <em>Tonningen </em>for said * vessel. The master and crew continued with said vessel, using all reasonable efforts to get her away, until the 24th of September, before which time the master made sundry journeys to <em>Hamburgh, </em>and several applications to the <em>American </em>consul there, and to the <em>Charge des Affaires </em>of the <em>United States </em>at <em>Paris, </em>to obtain a license from the <em>French </em>government for the vessel to leave the <em>Elbe, </em>but none could be obtained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\"><em>\u201c </em>On the 15th of November, the plaintiff offered to abandon to the underwriters, and made regular proof of the facts mentioned, but the underwriters refused to accept the abandonment After the cargo was taken out, as aforesaid, the master expended, out of the funds of the owners, the sum of 2237 dollars 58 cents, in maintaining the crew, and in journeying and laboring for the vessel, with a view to procure her departure from the <em>Elbe, </em>including sundry sums disbursed to agents and others for the same purpose, exclusive of seamen\u2019s wages. \u2014 On or about the 24th of December the wages of the seamen being in arrear, they obtained legal pro cess <em>in rem </em>against the vessel, according to the laws o'\" the kingdom of <em>Denmark; </em>and thereupon said vessel was regularly sold for the payment of the said wages; and the proceeds of said sale, amounting to between 700 and 800 dollars were distributed among the crew in part payment of their wages. The monthly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>amount of the wages of the crew was 161 dollars. \u2014 In going from <em>Heligoland </em>to <em>Gluckstadt, </em>the vessel sustained a general average loss, and the defendant has paid into Court his proportion of said loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">\u201c The parties agree that if, on the foregoing facts, the Court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover as for a total loss, and nothing more, then judgment shall be entered against the defendant for the amount of his subscription and interest; or if the Court should be of opinion that in addition to a total loss, the plaintiff may also recover all or any portion of the expenses incurred about the vessel, and the attempts to liberate her, after the delivery of the cargo as aforesaid, *and for the wages of the crew during said detention, or any part thereof, then the amount of said expenses and wages are to be adjusted by assessors to be appointed by the Court, and judgment to be entered accordingly; \u2014 or if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff cannot recover for a total loss, but may recover for a partial loss, in addition to the general average loss aforementioned, then such partial loss is to be adjusted by assessors, under the direction of the Court, as to the propriety of including the said expenses and wages in such adjustment, and judgment to be entered accordingly. \u2014 But if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff cannot recover either for a total or partial loss, except the general average loss above mentioned, then the plaintiff is to become nonsuit, and the defendant recover his costs.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\">\n<em>Mellen,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJk\">for the plaintiff, contended that the facts showed the plaintiff entitled to recover for a total loss, and that the expenses incurred in the attempts to save the vessel, &amp;c., also constituted a partial loss, in addition to the total loss, which the plaintiff was alike entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">Here was a loss of the thing insured, total in its nature. The ship, in the due course of the voyage insured, had been forcibly taken from the master, and, in consequence of that taking, had been sold from him. By the restraint and detention, the voyage was totally lost, the ship never having been able to arrive at her destined port. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The force used in this case sufficiently distinguishes it from the cases, decided in this Court, of <em>Richardson &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>The Maine F. and M.

The final appropriation of the ship to the payment of the w'ages due the mariners, was in no sense a loss, since it went to pay the debts of the assured, for which he was personally liable. As to the other expenses, for which a partial loss is claimed, it is sufficient to observe that they arose after the voyage insured was ended.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(6)\">\n<p id=\"b31-10\"> 7 <em>Johns.

It is stated that the vessel arrived off <em>Heligoland </em>on the 5th of January, 1810, and that, while waiting there for a pilot, to conduct * her to <em>Tonningen, </em>a storm arose, which obliged the vessel to put into the River <em>Elbe. </em>She then proceeded to <em>Gluckstadt, </em>on that river, where she was seized by order of the sovereign power of <em>Denmark, </em>on the 14th of January, and kept possession of until the 3d of March following, at which time, the vessel and cargo were released and restored to the master, on payment of certain charges, which, by agreement, have been considered as an average loss, and the proportion thereof falling upon the defendant, according to his sub scription, has been paid into Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Soon after the seizure, the cargo was unladen by order of the government; and, after the release of the vessel and cargo, permission was obtained by the master to go to <em>Tonningen </em>from the <em>Danish </em>government; but, there being a <em>French </em>battery at <em>Cuxhaven, </em>which is at the mouth of the River <em>Elbe, </em>and the commander thereof having refused permission for the vessel to pass out of the river, the consignee of the cargo consented to receive, and did receive, the cargo at <em>Gluckstadt, </em>and paid the stipulated freight for the same to the master ; after which attempts were made to get round to <em>Tonningen </em>for the purpose of looking for freight, which is stated to have been the principal object of the voyage. But at <em>Gluckstadt </em>the vessel was cleared for <em>New Orleans, </em>and the master began his voyage down the river; but was not permitted to pass by the battery, and was prevented therefrom by fear of destruction to the vessel; and so the vessel was brought back to <em>Gluckstadt, </em>where she continued until December, 1810 ; when, in consequence of a process instituted by the seamen against her for their wages, she was sold, and the proceeds of the sale were distributed among the crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The expenses while lying at <em>Gluckstadt, </em>and of several journeys made by the master to <em>Hamburgh, </em>to obtain liberty to depart, form the claim for a partial loss, in addition to the expenses which accrued before the delivery of the cargo to the consignee, *Upon these facts, we are all of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, upon the ground that the voyage was completed by the consent of the master, and of the consignee, to deliver and receive the cargo at <em>Gluckstadt, </em>this being a substitution of that place for <em>Tonningen, </em>and it appearing to be voluntary, since no necessity existed at the time, and at most there was but an apprehension that the vessel would be obstructed in her voyage from <em>Gluckstadt </em>to <em>Tonningen, </em>had it been attempted, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At the time that transaction took place, no attempt appears to have been made to pass the battery at <em>Cuxhaven, </em>or even to obtain permission therefor; nor does it appear that the cargo was reladen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>after permission was obtained from the <em>Danish </em>government to pursue the voyage to <em>Tonningen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The policy does not express that the vessel was to go to <em>Tonningen </em>to procure freight, but she is insured from <em>Boston </em>to <em>Tonningen, </em>the object of the voyage, as understood by the parties, being to carry the cargo then on board to the latter place; and it was competent to the parties to put an end to the contract between them, by adopting <em>Gluckstadt </em>as the place of delivery. And this it became their mutual interest to do, after the vessel was driven into the <em>Elbe, </em>and when there were difficulties in the further prosecution of the voyage. The mere fear of being obstructed by the <em>French </em>battery at <em>Cuvhaven </em>could not justify an abandonment of the voyage to the prejudice of the underwriter; and such fear was the only existing cause for substituting <em>Gluckstadt </em>for <em>Tonningen. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">It is true that afterwards\u2014indeed, a month after the cargo was delivered to the consignee and the freight paid \u2014 the vessel proceeded down the river with a clearance for <em>New Orleans, </em>and returned on account of the danger of attempting to pass the <em>French </em>battery. Whether this was such an actual restraint as would have justified an abandonment, had the vessel, with her cargo on board, then been destined for <em>Tonningen, </em>we need not decide; since it is very clear that the * whole purpose of the voyage understood to he insured had been answered by the delivery and acceptance of the cargo at <em>Gluckstadt. </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The expenses previous to that transaction have been, by agreement, considered as an average loss, and by this underwriter have been paid. All the subsequent expenses were at the proper risk and loss of the assured. The plaintiff must, therefore, become nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\"><em> </em>[From the report of the facts agreed upon, it appears that, on account of the <em>French </em>forces at Cuxhaven, 41 <em>it was not in the power of the master and </em>mariners, <em>at any time after the vessel went into the River Elbe, to get her out of said river.\" </em>Was not this a <em>restraint </em>within the terms of the policy ? Was it essential that no force was actually applied to the vessel, or exercised over her by persons in the actual possession of her?
