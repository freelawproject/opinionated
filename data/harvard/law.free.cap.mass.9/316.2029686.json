The owner of an ancient mill may lawfully enter the close of another, and remove a dam erected therein, by which the water of the stream below the mill is made to flow back and prevent the mill from grinding.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-11\">Trespass for breaking and entering the plaintiff's close in <em>Norton, </em>in this county, and breaking down, tearing away, subverting, and destroying, the plaintiff\u2019s mill-dam, belonging to his fulling mill there, and tearing up and subverting the soil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The defendants, as to the force and arms, &amp;c., pleaded the general issue of not guilty,-which was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5U\">* And as to the rest of the trespass charged,- they pleaded in bar, that the defendant <em>Raymond </em>and one <em>Josiah Dean, </em>long before, at the time when, &lt;fcc., and ever since, were owners of a certain ancient mill-dam across the same stream whereon the plaintiff\u2019s dam was situated, and above the same, with certain mills, factories, &amp;c., on their said dam standing and being, and in the sole occupation of the said <em>Raymond; </em>that the said dam of the said <em>Raymond </em>and <em>Dean </em>being an ancient dam, he, the said <em>Raymond, </em>had a right at the time, when, &amp;c., and at all other times, to build, rebuild, alter, and repair, the said dam and mills, and to work the said mills, and to have the water pass off in its natural course, without hinderance or molestation from any person damming or stopping the water below his said mills ; and because the plaintiff, at the time when, &amp;c., by means of his said dam, then lately erected, did stop the water from running off, and cause the same to flow back upon the wheels of the mills of the said <em>Raymond </em>and <em>Dean, </em>to the said <em>Raymond's </em>great damage, hinderance, and molestation, whereby he was prevented from building, &amp;c., he, the said <em>Raymond, </em>at the said time when, &amp;c., in his own right, and the other defendants as his servants, in order to\" remove the hinderance and dam of the plaintiff so obstructing the water, &amp;c., did break and enter the said close, and did pull up and .remove part of the said dam, whereby the water was permitted to run off, as they might lawfully do, and in so doing necessarily subverted a little of the plaintiff\u2019s soil, &amp;c., doing as little damage as possible on this occasion, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">To this plea the plaintiff replied that the defendants committed the said trespass of their own wrong, and without the cause alleged in their plea, and tendered an issue to the country, which was joined by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">A trial was had before <em>Parlcer, </em>J., at an adjourned session of the Court, holden here in May, 1811.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">The judge reports that, upon the supposition that the general issue was upon trial in the cause, the jury were directed by him, if they found the facts to be proved, which are *set forth in the plea in bar, they might return a general verdict of not guilty for the defendants ; which they accordingly did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\">But the question was reserved, whether the facts contained in the plea in bar amounted to a legal defence against the plaintiff\u2019s action of trespass ; and if they did not, or if the judge who tried the cause could not alter the verdict, so as to apply it to the issue joined, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>then a new trial was to be granted ; the plaintiff also reserving the right to move in arrest of judgment for the insufficiency of the plea in bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">At the last October term, all objections to the form of the verdict being waived, <em>Sproat, </em>of counsel for the defendants, argued that this was a private nuisance to Raymond, the occupant of the upper mill, which he had good right to abate, and for that purpose to go upon the plaintiff\u2019s land. The remedy for this nuisance by action would have exposed <em>Raymond </em>to most inconvenient delay, as his operations were of great importance to him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-6\"><em>Tillinghast </em>and <em>Baylies, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6D\">contended that this was not such a nuisance as the defendants had a right to abate. The plaintiff had a right to erect a dam on his own land for the use of his mills; and a natural effect of this would be, that, on occasions when the river should rise from great falls of rain, the water would flow back to the defendant\u2019s mill. But this would not constitute a nuisance, nor justify the defendants in thus violently abating it. If the defendants are justified, parties will hereafter resort to force for redress of supposed injuries, instead of applying to the law ; and private violence will take place of public justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\">The cause stood over to this term for advisement, when <em>the Court </em>conferred together, and not being prepared to give judgment, the action was further continued <em>nisi; </em>and at the following term in <em>Middlesex, the Chief Justice </em>said that two questions had engaged the attention of the Court \u2014 the first, whether judgment could be entered upon the verdict * found by the jury in this case, supposing the facts contained in the plea a sufficient defence against the action,\u2014the case, of <em>Hawks </em>vs. <em>Crofton </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> is in point. There, to an action of trespass for an assault and battery, the defendant pleaded not guilty as to the force and arms, and issue was joined thereon ; as to the special damages, he pleaded <em>son assault demesne, </em>to which the plaintiff replied <em>de injuria sua proprio absque tali causa, </em>on which issue was also joined. There was a general verdict of \u201c <em>guilty of the trespass within written </em>The Court held that the verdict was sufficient to support the judg ment rendered on it. Mr. Justice <em>Foster </em>observed that the \u201cjury could not have found thus, <em>unless </em>the defendant had failed in proving his justification.\u201d Upon the same principle, and with equal reason, it may be said, in the case at bar, that the jury could not have found thus, <em>if </em>the defendants had failed in proving their justification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-8\">Whether that justification is sufficient, is the second point. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>well settled that if A interrupt or divert water from flowing to the mill of another by its ancient course, the owner of the mill may lawfully enter upon A\u2019s land, and remove the interruption. Now, there can be no difference whether the damage to the owner of a mill arise from the water above being diverted from his mill, or from the water below being stopped so as to flow back, and thereby prevent the mill from grinding. The mischief is the same, and the same remedy ought to be furnished. The defendant\u2019s justification is then sufficient. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> 2 <em>Burr </em>698.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\"> 5 <em>Co. </em>101, <em>Penruddock's case. </em>\u2014 9 <em>Co. </em>53, <em>Batten's case. </em>\u2014 <em>Salk. </em>458, <em>Lodie </em>vs. Arnold.\u2014 <em>Yelv. </em>141, <em>Horne </em>vs. <em>Widlake. </em>\u2014 <em>Cro.
