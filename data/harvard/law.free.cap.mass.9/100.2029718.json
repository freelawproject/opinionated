The evidence is annulled by the principle of law, that an infant is incapable of establishing such a contract against himself while under age. He may conclude himself by recognizing the consideration and promise after he comes of age; for this is a con tract and promise made then, the words of which are understood by the reference to the formal promise made in his infancy, and the renewal of it. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The plea in bar is adjudged good.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><em> </em>[In the case of <em>Whiting &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Dutch &amp; </em>Al., (14 <em>Mass.
