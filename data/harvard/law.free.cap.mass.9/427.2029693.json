B replevied from the sheriff the quantity owned by him; and issue being joined on B\u2019s property, and a verdict found for him, he had judgment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-12\">Replevin for seventy-six bags of coffee, containing 8991 pounds. The defendant pleaded property in <em>Timothy Wellman </em>and <em>Benjamin </em>Hopes, and avows the taking, &amp;c., on the 4th of June, 1810, as a deputy sheriff, &amp;c., by virtue of a writ of attachment, at the suit, of <em>Gamaliel Hodges </em>against the said <em>Wellman 8f Hopes. </em>The pleadings closed in an issue to the country upon the plaintiff\u2019s property in the goods replevied This issue was tried at the sittings here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>after November term, 1810, before <em>Sewatt, </em>J., and a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to * the opinion of the Court, upon objections on the part of the defendant to certain evidence admitted at the trial; and whether this action lies in the case proved at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">The objections to the admission of the evidence having been waived by the defendant\u2019s counsel in the argument, it will not be necessary to state that evidence, further than to show the ground of the other objection, taken at the trial, and insisted on in the argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">The plaintiff produced at the trial the receipt of <em>Wellman fy Ropes, </em>dated March 17, 1810, which was proved to have been then given by them to the plaintiff, upon his adjusting his accounts of a voyage performed for them in the schooner Liberty, then recently arrived from <em>La G\u00fcira; </em>which receipt was expressed to be \u201c for seventy-six bags of coffee, containing, as per invoice at <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>&amp;c., being his adventure on board said schooner from <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>and which we hold subject to his order at any time he may please to call for the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">It was also in evidence that the plaintiff became entitled, in the course of the said voyage, to the amount of 828 dollars 80 cents, which he received in <em>Tonningen </em>in his interest, and part of the cargo shipped there for <em>La G\u00fcira; </em>and that of 544 bags of coffee, purchased at <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>with the proceeds of the cargo brought thither from <em>Tonningen, </em>according to the account and invoice made by the Spanish merchant at <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>8991 pounds of coffee, the contents of seventy-six bags, were shipped there for the account of the plaintiff, with the cargo brought in the said schooner; the whole of which, on his arrival at <em>Salem, </em>the plaintiff delivered to the said <em>Wellman $/\u25a0 Ropes </em>at their store, and afterwards took of them the above-mentioned receipt for his seventy-six bags. These were never distinguished by any particular marks, or by a separation of them in any manner from the rest of said coffee; some part oi which, previously to the said attachment, had been shifted into hogsheads, and several bags the said <em>Wellman &amp;/\u25a0 Ropes </em>had dis posed of for their own use, which had been removed * from the said store. But the defendant, in making the said attachment, took all that remained there, that is, thirty hogsheads, three barrels, and three hundred and ninety-six bags of coffee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">It was further proved or admitted that, until the said attachment, the said <em>Wellman fy Ropes </em>had continued doing business at their said store, and in good credit; that they then failed, and became insolvent; and that since the service of this replevin, a quantity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the said coffee, taken by the said attachment, had been seized and levied upon, to satisfy an execution sued out in behalf of the <em>United States </em>against the said <em>Wellman 8f Ropes.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">Upon this evidence, the jury were directed, by the judge who sat in the trial, to return a verdict for the plaintiff, if they believed that said receipt had been given <em>\u25a0bona fide; </em>that, according to the tenor thereof, seventy-six bags, containing 8991 pounds of coffee,, belonging to the plaintiff, had been deposited by him, and intrusted in the care of the said <em>Wellman Ropes; </em>and that the same remained with them and in their store, intermixed with and making a part of the said, coffee attached and taken by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">At the last November term, the cause was argued by <em>Story </em>against the verdict, and by <em>Putnam </em>in support of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\"><em>Story. </em>In this case, the single question is, whether the plaintiff had a sole property in the goods replevied, at the time of the replevin ; for if he had only an undivided interest, it is settled that replevin does not lie. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> We contend that he had only an undivided interest, supposing, upon the facts reported, any interest to be made out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-8\">By the report, it is clear that there was no division or designation of the plaintiff\u2019s property, or of that of <em>Wellman Ropes. </em>The whole cargo formed one mass; and the right of the plaintiff was, at most, but an interest in common. If any part of the cargo had been lost or damnified, it would have fallen proportionally on him. Yet by the present action, if maintained, he would save to * himself the exclusive right to elect a particular parcel, and would throw upon the attaching creditors the loss, as well of these goods, as of those seized at the suit of the <em>United States. </em>In a contest between creditors, certainly, an in justice of this nature ought not to be permitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-10\">In the case of confusion or intermixture of goods, so that the several portions cannot be distinguished, if the intermixture be by consent, the proprietors have an interest in common, in proportion to their respective shares. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> The doctrine of the civil law agrees herewith ; <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> and the same role is laid down by <em>Rracton. </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-11\"><em>Putnam </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARjn\">The question has been correctly stated, and we contend that, after the settlement of the voyage, the property of the plaintiff was, to every essential purpose, separated from that of the other owners. Upon the refusal of <em>Wellman 8f Ropes </em>to deliver the plaintiff his seventy-six bags of coffee, the latter could have maintained trover for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>It is true that, in case of joint property in a single chattel, the whole must bo seized, and the interest of the debtor therein sold ; but the same reason does not apply where the several proportions can be distinguished, and are capable of a separation, as was the case here; and it was the duty of the defendant, when making the attachment, to leave the seventy-six bags, which were allowed on all hands justly to belong to the plaintiff. If the defendant hoped to prevail on these facts, he should have pleaded the general issue of <em>non cep it. </em>At any rate, the objection to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery is merely technical, and on such grounds the verdict ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">The cause stood continued for advisement until this term; and now,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b380-12\"> 2 <em>Mass.

But he was not tenant in' common. Though the bags belonging to him had no distinguishing marks, he might have * taken the number of bags and the quantity of coffee, to which he was entitled, by his own selection, while they remained in the hands of <em>Wellman &amp; Ropes; </em>and the defendant,- as a deputy sheriff, could not change the rights of third parties. Then, if a return were to be ordered, the defendant would still be accountable to the plaintiff for the proceeds. Thus the whole case resolved itself into a question as to the form of the action, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\"><em> </em>[And see <em>Damon </em>vs. Osborn, 1 <em>Pick.
