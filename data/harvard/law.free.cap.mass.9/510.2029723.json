It was admitted that the defendants took possession of the premises, in virtue of the said conveyance made to them on the 4th of September. The plaintiffs contended that this evidence was sufficient to prove the promise set forth in the declaration ; but they further offered two depositions of one <em>E. Centre, </em>to prove an express agreement of the defendants to the same effect; which evidence was objected to by the defendants, and rejected by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">The defendants offered in evidence a deed of release from said <em>Dexter </em>to said <em>Goodwin, </em>dated August 7, 1809, and a deed of release from said <em>Goodwin </em>to the defendants, dated November 18, 1809, both which were read to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">A verdict was taken for the defendants, subject to the opinion of the Court; and if the Court should be of opinion that the said evidence, consisting of the deeds aforesaid, produced by the plaintiffs, was admissible, and that this, together with the possession taken by the defendants, was competent to maintain the issue on the part of the plaintiffs, the verdict was to be set aside, and a verdict entered for the plaintiffs for the sum of 15,109 dollars; otherwise, the verdict was to stand, and judgment be entered accordingly; unless the Court should be of opinion that the said two depositions of <em>E. Centre, </em>offered by the * plaintiffs, were improperly rejected on the trial; in which latter case the verdict was to be set aside, and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">The cause was argued by <em>Dexter </em>and <em>Jackson </em>for the plaintiffs, and by <em>Otis </em>and <em>Sullivan </em>for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-8\">\n<em>For the plaintiffs,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-6Y\">it was insisted that the defendants, by accepting the conveyance made to them by the deed poll of the plaintiffs, witnessed by their taking possession of the premises conveyed, assented to the terms of the conveyance, and so undertook to do all that the plaintiffs were bound to do; they took the premises subject to all the duties and obligations of the plaintiffs. Upon another construction, they get the benefit of the estate without the consideration which was contemplated by the parties to the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-9\">This was in the nature of a trust; and nothing is more clear than that a breach of trust may be the ground of an <em>assumpsit. </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> There are many cases which show that a grantor may derive rights against his grantee. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> The case of rent reserved is the most common: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and the reservation is confirmed by the grantee\u2019s acceptance of the grant, without words of his importing a grant of the rent. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> Nor is there a difference between the reservation of an annual rent and a sum in gross. The same reason applies to all the cases,\u2014that whoever claims an estate under any deed, ought, in reason and equity, to be obliged to take it under the terms expressed in the deed. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> On the same principle, where land is devised subject to the payment of a legacy, the legatee has his action of debt against the devisee of the land, although no privity exists between them; merely on the implied contract, that, if the devisee takes the land, he will fulfil the terms on which it was given him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-5\">\n<em>For the defendants,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al-\">it was said that no action of <em>assumpsit </em>could be maintained against the grantee of land, claiming under a deed poll, by the grantor, for the non-performance of any trust created by such deed; and if there are cases in which such an action may be supported, the evidence in the case at bar will not maintain the present action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AStR\">* Whenever an action is founded upon a deed, the deed must be declared on. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> There is no precedent of such an action as the present. In all the authorities cited in support of it, there existed a moral obligation, furnishing the ground of action, independently of the deed; whereas the duty in this case could not exist without the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">But if, notwithstanding the general principle, such an action could in any cas\u00e9 be maintained, the evidence in this case is incompetent. T?he deed shows no obligation on the defendants to pay this money to <em>Odiorne. </em>It is a conveyance of property, \u201c subject to all the obligations, conditions, and reservations,\u201d mentioned in a former deed of the same property to the plaintiffs. The words necessarily relate to the thing or property conveyed. They could not have the effect to convey to the defendants the covenant, by which the plaintiffs were bound to <em>Odiorne. </em>The plain intent of the parties was to pass the property, with such encumbrances as were attached to it, but not the personal covenants of the plaintiffs. As <em>Odiorne\u2019s </em>rights against the plaintiffs continued, being neither extinguished nor suspended, there was no consideration for any supposed engagement of the defendants. The obligation of the plaintiffs to <em>Odiorne </em>was a mere liability, which they may never meet, as the creditors of <em>Dexter </em>may receive their demands from some other source,- or may release; and thus the plaintiffs would acquire this money for nothing. All the ground of action they can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>pretend to is for an indemnity; and such action does not lie until tite party is damnified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">This is a promise to pay the debt of another, and there is no memorandum in writing signed by the party to be charged; and it is thus within the statute of frauds. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> It is true the promise is to the debtor instead of the creditor; but it is within the letter of the statute, and the mischief as great as if made to the creditor. It is also an agreement concerning an interest in lands, and, not being in writing, is void by the statute of 1783, <em>c. </em>37, &lt;\u00a7&gt; <em>2.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\"> 5 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>603, <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>Jameson. </em>\u2014 <em>Fitz.

It has long been settled that an action lies for rent reserved upon a deed poll. The reason of the principle has a general application; and we are all satisfied that, as a general rule, where land is conveyed by deed poll, and the grantee enters under the deed, certain duties being reserved to be performed, as no action lies against the grantee on the deed, the grantor may maintain <em>assumpsit </em>for the non-performance of the duties reserved. '</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">It was objected that this was an agreement concerning an inter est in lands, and that, no memorandum being signed by the party, the case was within the statute of frauds. But where the law raises the promise, it is not within the statute, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The same answer may be made to the objection that it was a promise to pay the debt of another, and not in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The verdict is to be set aside, and a verdict entered for the plaintiffs for the sum mentioned in the judge\u2019s report of the trial, on which judgment is rendered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\"><em> [Jackson, ex Dem.
