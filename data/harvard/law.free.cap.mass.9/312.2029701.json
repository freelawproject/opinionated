To establish this latter fact, he offered as a witness a justice of <em>the </em>peace, who testified that he could not positively affirm that he ever administered an oath to the complainant as clerk, though he had some faint recollection of having done it; but that he had made no record of such oath. Two other persons testified that they were present when the said justice administered the said oath.. The counsel for the respondent objected to the admission of the said testimony, insisting that the' only competent evidence of the fact was the certificate of the justice\u2019s record. But the court overruled the objection, and admitted the testimony; and, the respondent\u2019s disobedience of orders being admitted, instructed the jury that the complainant had proved himself duly qualified as clerk, and directed them to find a verdict in his favor, which they did accordingly, and judgment was rendered thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-8\">Baylies,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoJ\">for the plaintiff in error, insisted that the witnesses sworn at the trial in the court below were improperly admitted, and that there was no regular evidence of the complainant\u2019s qualification as clerk. 1</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b281-9\">\n<em>But the Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AzB\">were of opinion that, since it was proved that the magistrate made no record of his administering the oath, the evidence admitted was the 1 \u00bfst that could be required. The testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>of the witnesses was therefore legally admitted, and was competent to prove the fact.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b282-6\"><em>Sproat </em>and <em>Holmes </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The judgment was affirmed, with costs for the defendant in error. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> Vide <em>Sherman </em>vs. <em>Needham, </em>4 <em>Pick. </em>67. \u2014 <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Hall, </em>3 <em>Pick. </em>262. \u2014 <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Dedham, </em>16 <em>Mass. </em>141.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
