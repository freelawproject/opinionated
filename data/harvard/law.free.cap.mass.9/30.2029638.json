So, in prosecutions in this state against the putative father of a bastard child, the mother is received as a witness only to such facts as she alone can be presumed privy to. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> In <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Whiting, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> <em>Holt, </em>C. J., refused to receive a witness who might possibly be benefited by a conviction of the defendant for a cheat, merely by the influence the conviction might have on a jury in a civil action, which might be brought upon the note in question. The interest in this case was direct and positive; for by the conviction the witness becomes entitled not only to restoration of the goods stolen, if they can be found, but also, by statute of 1804, <em>c. </em>142, \u00a7 16, * in case they are not restored, to satisfaction out of the future earnings of the convict; and by \u00a7 14, to a recompense <em>out of </em>the county treasury for his labor and expense in the-prosecution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>Morton </em>(Attorney-General) for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\"> 2 <em>Mass.

But in many cases, the party injured, or prosecutor, who may derive a benefit from the conviction, is either expressly or by implication rendered competent, by virtue of the act respecting the offence, or the prosecution of it. But in the statute cited by the prisoner\u2019s counsel in the principal case, there is no express provision to that effect, nor any thing from which it may be very clearly inferred. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
