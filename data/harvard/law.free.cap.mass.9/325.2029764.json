But we think otherwise. Reports are frequently recommitted by the court, when, upon their being read, some defect, in point of form, is discovered ; and this without the suggestion of either party. Or, if a report is recommitted on the motion of one of the parties, who thinks himself aggrieved by it, still no obligation is thereby imposed on the ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>crees to alter the report. They may return it without alteration, if they are fully satisfied of the correctness of it.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ArpL\"><em>Whitman </em>and <em>Ellis </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
