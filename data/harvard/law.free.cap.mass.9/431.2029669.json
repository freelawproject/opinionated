Upon the general issue of not guilty pleaded and joined, a trial being had before Sewall, J., at the sittings here after the last November term, the defendants filed their bill of exceptions, at common law, to the opinion and direction of the judge who sat in the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">From the bill of exceptions, it appears that the plaintiff, to maintain the issue on his part, proved that the chattels mentioned in the declaration were, on the 4th of June, 1810, the property of <em>T. Wellman </em>and <em>B. </em>Ropes; that, on that day, sundry writs of attachment, directed to the sheriff of the county of <em>Essex </em>or his deputy, issued against' said <em>Wellman Sf </em>Ropes, by virtue whereof the said chattels were, on that day, attached by one <em>I). Dutch, </em>a deputy of the plaintiff, then and now sheriff of the said county of <em>Essex, </em>according to the laws of this commonwealth, for the sole and exclusive benefit of the several creditors suing such writs; that said writs of attachment respectively, excepting two which are yet pending in Court, were duly prosecuted, and final judgment rendered thereon, in favor of the several creditors suing the same, at the S. J. Court, November term, 1810, for sums of money exceeding in the whole the value of the chattels aforesaid; and executions issued on * the same judgments within thirty days after the rendition thereof, and the said executions remain unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">The said defendants, to maintain the issue on their part, proved that on the 18th day of September, 1810, two several executions, in favor of the <em>United States, </em>one against said <em>Wellman </em>and one against said <em>Ropes, </em>each for the sum of 5176 dollars principal, 77 dollars 43 cents as interest, and 13 dollars 95 cents costs, were issued from the District Court, &amp;c., directed to the marshal of said district or his deputy; which executions issued on certain judgments recovered against said <em>Wellman Sf Ropes, </em>at the District Court held at <em>Salem </em>on the second Tuesday of September, 1810, on a joint and several bond given by said <em>Wellman Sf Ropes </em>at the custom-house, for duties, for 5176 dollars, which bond was dated on the 15th day of March, 1810, and payable on the 15th day of June in the same year; that the actions, in which the said judgments in favor of the <em>United States </em>were rendered as aforesaid, were first commenced on the-day of August, 1810; but that no attachment of property was made thereon ; that on the 19th day of September, 1810, two certain writs of attachment in favor of the <em>Un'ted States, </em>one against said <em>Wellman </em>and one against said <em>Ropes, </em>issued in due form of law, directed to the marshal of said district or his deputy, returnable to the said District Court on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>first Tuesday of December, 1810, which writs were upon a joint and several bond, given by said <em>Ropes Sf Wellman </em>at the customhouse for duties, for another sum of 5176 dollars, which bond was dated on the 15th day of March, 1810, and was payable on the 15th day of September, 1810; that on the 11th day of October, 1810, the same chattels, being in the custody and possession of the plaintiff under the attachments made by him as aforesaid, in a certain store by him hired for that purpose at <em>Salem </em>aforesaid, the said <em>Sprague, </em>then being a deputy under the said <em>Prince, </em>then and yet marshal of the <em>United States </em>for said district, by virtue of the executions and attachments aforesaid, demanded of the * plaintiff to have the said store opened, in order that said <em>Sprague </em>might seize and take the chattels aforesaid, on said writs of execution and attachment, in behalf of the <em>United States; </em>that upon the refusal of the plaintiff, said <em>Sprague </em>forcibly broke into the store aforesaid, and, by virtue of said writs of execution and attachment in favor of the <em>United States, </em>seized, attached, and conveyed away, the said chattels; and afterwards, on the 15th day of the same October, by virtue of said executions, in due form of law, sold so much thereof as was necessary to satisfy a moiety of each of the said executions, and the residue the said <em>Sprague </em>returned as attached upon the writs of attachment aforesaid in favor of the <em>United States ; </em>that the said writs of attachment were duly prosecuted, and final judgments were rendered in the suits thereby commenced, in favor of the <em>United. States, </em>at the said term of the District Court on the first Tuesday of December; and the said chattels, so attached thereon, were duly sold by virtue of writs of execution issued upon said last-mentioned judgments, and the proceeds thereof applied toward the satisfaction of the same; that after the 4th day of June, 1810, and before the 18th day of September, in the same year, sundry trustee writs or processes, according to the statutes of the commonwealth of <em>Massachusetts, </em>other than the writs of attachment first mentioned, by which said chattels were attached by the plaintiff, were sued in due form of law by divers other creditors of the said <em>Wellman eg\u00edlopes, </em>(which writs and processes were for the sole and exclusive benefit of the several creditors suing the same, and not for \"the ben efit of any other creditor of said <em>Wellman 8f Ropes,) </em>and sundry persons therein named as trustees, and were directed to the sheriff of the said county of <em>Essex </em>or his deputy, commanding them to attach the estate of the said <em>Wellman Ropes </em>to a much greater value than the said chattels; which processes were duly served upon the trustees, and are still pending in the Court of Common Pleas for said county of <em>Essex; </em>and the property attached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>upon said * processes is greatly insufficient to pay the demands declared upon; that said <em>Wellman fy Hopes </em>continued in business until the said attachments made on the said 4th day of June, and then failed in business, and then were, and ever since have continued to be, debtors unable to pay their debts; that said <em>Wellman </em>has continued at his usual place of abode in said <em>Salem </em>ever since his failure as aforesaid, and has not, for any whole day, confined himself within his house; but has sometimes kept his person within doors, and had his doors fastened, and occasionally used other vigilance and caution, to avoid any arrest of his body, for two or three weeks next following the said 4th day of June ; but has never been arrested by any officer, or pursued by any officer for that purpose ; and that said <em>Ropes </em>has always continued abroad in <em>Salem, </em>and has never confined or concealed himself from his creditors at any time. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">Whereupon the counsel for the defendants did insist, on behalf of the defendants, that the several matters, so produced and proved in evidence on their part as aforesaid, were sufficient, and ought to have been allowed and admitted to prove and maintain the issue on their part, and to bar the plaintiff of his action aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">But the counsel for the plaintiff insisted that the matters and evidence aforesaid, so produced and proved on the part of the defendants as aforesaid, were not sufficient, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">The judge who sat in the trial delivered his opinion to the jury aforesaid, that the said several matters, so produced and proved on the part of the defendants, were not, upon the whole case, sufficient to maintain the issue aforesaid on the part of the defendants, and to bar the plaintiff of his action aforesaid thereof against them ; and with that direction left the same to the jury, who gave a verdict for the plaintiff, and-dollars damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-9\">Whereupon the defendants excepted, &amp;c., and prayed the judge to allow and sign the said exceptions; who, finding the same conformable to the truth, allowed, signed, and sealed, the same accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AXI\">* <em>Putnam, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS9\">relied on the 65th section of the statute of the <em>United.
