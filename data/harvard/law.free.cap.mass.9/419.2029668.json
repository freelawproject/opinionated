The heir at law was therefore entitled to hold, until some one could make a title under the will.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">This was a real action, and was tried upon the general issue before Sewall,J., at the sittings here after November term, 1808.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">The judge reported that several questions were left to the jury, upon the testimony and other evidence before them; and their verdict thereon, being for the tenant, was taken, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the validity and effect of a certain devise in the last will of <em>Sarah Chadwick, </em>duly proved and allowed the 6th of May, 1806.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">The devise in question was in these words, <em>viz.: \u201c </em>I give to <em>Joseph Parker </em>the use and improvement of all my buildings and lands, (except, &amp;c.,) in the town of <em>Boxford,, </em>to be so used and improved, &amp;c., and to be kept, &amp;c., during the term of his natural life; and after his decease, I give the use, improvement, and income, of the aforesaid buildings and lands, <em>viz., </em>the incomes and profits arising by renting, or letting the premises to the halves, which may be thought most profitable, to be expended for the use of the schools among the inhabitants living in the north-west parish (formerly called the second parish) in the town of <em>Boxford.; </em>confining it only to the use of the inhabitants of said <em>Boxford, </em>and to be distributed among the schools in the said parish, in the same way and manner as money raised by the town for the support of schools is apportioned among the several districts in the town forever; and keep the said premises, in the name of <em>Chadwick, </em>to the remotest period of time; the income of which to be appropriated to the aforesaid use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">The said last will was made on the 15th of February, 1806, and the testatrix died in the course of the same month. The said <em>Joseph Parker </em>having also deceased, the said <em>Lemuel Wood, </em>on the 29th of December, 1807, being.an inhabitant of the said parish in <em>Boxford, </em>entered, *for himself and the other inhabitants of the said parish, upon the said lands and buildings, including the demanded premises, claiming the same by virtue of the said devise of the remainder thereof, after the death of the said <em>Parker, </em>to the use of the inhabitants of the said parish.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>It also appeared that the said north-west parish of <em>Boxford </em>includes certain inhabitants within the town of Andover; and that the inhabitants of said parish, within the said town of <em>Boxford, </em>were, at the time when said will was made, defined and known as school districts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\">If the opinion of the Court should be that the said remainder is not legally and effectually devised, then the verdict was to be set aside, and a verdict to be entered for the demandant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\">The cause was argued upon this report, November term, 1809, by <em>Prescott </em>and <em>Story </em>for the demandant, and <em>Dane </em>and <em>Putnam </em>for the tenant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-7\">\n<em>For the demandant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahn\">it was contended that there was, in truth, no devise to any person. At most, it was a mere declaration of a trust, and if the trust was created, the heir at law of the testatrix must be the trustee. It is plain, from the whole clause of the will, that the testatrix did not intend that the land itself should ever go out of her family. It was to be kept in the name \u201c to the remotest period of time.\u201d Had her intention been to give the land, she would have used the common language for such a purpose. The inhabitants of <em>Boxford, </em>living within the north-west parish, were no corporation. They could not, therefore, take under the devise ; and no other devisee being named, the heir at law must take as such, or as devisee subject to the trust. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Neither could they take as constituting one or more school districts, which have very limited powers by statute, not including a capacity to hold land; and are, besides, subject to alteration at the will of the town.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-8\">\n<em>For the tenant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajo\">it was argued that devises are not to be held void, if they can be enforced at law; and a devise to * charitable uses will be decreed in chancery, though it be void in law. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-9\">The devise in this case was to the inhabitants of the parish, who are a corporation capable of purchasing and holding lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">If the objection, that part of those inhabitants lived in <em>Andover, </em>should have weight with the Court, still the persons to whom the devise is limited in words, constituted two school districts, and such districts are by statute made corporations capable of holding real estate. As to these districts being subject to alteration, it is -a sufficient answer, that when once the estate had vested, the legislature would readily interpose their aid for its continuance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-11\">Further, if there were, at the decease of the testatrix, no persons capable of taking the estate, it might go to the heir, until a etir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>poration should be created capable of taking and ho.ding, as was the case under Sir <em>George Downing\u2019s </em>will. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> And it may be added, in this connection, that the legislature of this commonwealth have, by statute of 1808, <em>c. </em>47, incorporated certain trustees to receive and manage the tenements in question in this action, conformably to the intentions of the testatrix. Sundry acts of a like kind have been, from time to time, passed by the legislature, as that for the incorporation of the trustees of the free school in <em>Williamstown, </em>(1784, c. 49;) that for incorporating the <em>Hopland </em>school district, (1790, <em>c. </em>26;) that for incorporating trustees of <em>John Doylston\u2019s </em>charitable donations, (1802, c. 44;) and many similar ones, all which had a retroactive effect.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> <em>Bro.

The case finds that the north-west parish includes certain inhabitants of <em>Andover. </em>These latter being excluded from the benefit intended, the remaining * inhabitants are not a corporation, and they cannot take as tenants in common. The heir at law must hold until some one can make title under the will. We give no opinion of the right of the corporation, created by the legislature, to receive and manage the tenements in question ; it being our opinion that the said remainder is not legally devised to those under whom the tenant claims to hold. According to the agreement of the parties, the verdict must be set aside, and a verdict entered for the demandant, upon which judgment is to be rendered, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em> </em>[See <em>Baker &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Fales, 16 Mass.
