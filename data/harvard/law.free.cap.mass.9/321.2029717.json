That the defendant hath made full, instead of half defence, and thereby admitted the jurisdiction of the Court. 2. That A, B, C, and others, are members of said corporation, and live within the county of <em>Bristol. </em>The defendant joined the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">At the last term, <em>Tillinghast, </em>for the plaintiffs, insisted that the case at bar was not within the provision of the statute of 1784, <em>c. </em>28, \u00a7 13, on which the defendant\u2019s plea was predicated. But, if it was, the corporation was established within this county, and most of the corporators were inhabitants thereof.
