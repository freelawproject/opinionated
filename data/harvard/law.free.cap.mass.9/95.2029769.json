The <em>ad damnum </em>being under 70 dollars, the writ was served and returned by a constable, although not directed to him. At the return term in the court below, <em>Howard, </em>for the defendant, moved the court to abate the writ, <em>ex officio, </em>for want of legal service.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-9\">\n<em>Whitman,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV-\">for the plaintiff, moved for and obtained leave to amend the writ, by inserting a direction to the constable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-10\">Upon the appeal, <em>Howard </em>renewed his motion here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b91-11\">Sewall, J., and Parker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8K\">The constable had authority by law to serve the writ.

J., said, \u201cIt may be considered as necessary that there should be a particular direction to the officer, even in cases where his authority to serve is recognized by statute.\u201d And in <em>Brier </em>vs <em>Woodbury, </em>(1 <em>Pick. </em>366,) the same judge, giving the opinion of the Court, said, \u201c The first question, in that case, was whether a constable might by law serve a precept in a civil action, which was not directed to such-an officer; \u2019\u2019 and he adds, \u201c We think this point well settled in the case of <em>Hearsey </em>vs. <em>Bradbury, </em>and recognized as law in <em>Wood </em>vs. <em>Ross.\u201d </em>\u201c <em>It ought to appear on the precept itself, that authority was intendea *o be given to the constable on that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>particular process.\u201d </em>The question then occurs, if the service was a nullity, and void for want of authority in the officer, could an amendment, <em>ex post </em>facto, give it an validity? \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
