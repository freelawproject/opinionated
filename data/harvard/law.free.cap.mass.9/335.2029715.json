Chandler, </em>treasurer of <em>Dorchester Turnpike Corporation.\u201d </em>The notes not being found during the trial, it was agreed that a verdict should be returned for the defendant; but that, if thereafter they should be found and filed in the case, they should be considered as the notes declared on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-7\">It was agreed that, at the time the notes were given, the corporation was indebted to the plaintiff the amount of those notes, and that they were given for that debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-8\">It appeared that, at a meeting of the directors of the corporation, November 20, 1805, the treasurer was requested to settle, by note or otherwise, with all persons to whom the president might give an order for the amount due them for lands, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">It was also agreed that, if the plaintiff was by law entitled to recover, the Court might direct a verdict to be entered for him to the amount of the notes declared on, or so many of them as should be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">The cause was argued at the last March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>it being agreed that the opinion of the Court might be then delivered, and judgment be entered accordingly at the present term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-11\">\n<em>J.

Here it cannot be doubted the corporation is itself liable. The consideration moved wholly from them. It is very apparent that the plaintiff did not, at the time of' receiving the notes, look to the defendant\u2019s personal security-. The whole transaction was on behalf of the corporation. Their property is liable, and the defendant is not. Judgment must be entered for the defendant upo-n the verdict at the next term in <em>Norfolk, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b303-5\"> <em>[Hovey </em>vs. <em>Magill, 2 Con.
