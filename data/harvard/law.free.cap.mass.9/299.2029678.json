The plaintiff was nominated, and the nomination agreed to by the persons present; and one of the members, acting as secretary, recorded the choice. * The plaintiff was present, and declined the agency, but it was insisted on that he should accept; and i.t was said by the company that he must be paid for it. The plaintiff did attend several sessions of the legislature, upon the business, and endeavoring to obtain the charter; but he did not succeed. It was not disputed that the sum demanded was reasonable, provided the plaintiff was entitled to recover any thing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">No evidence was given on the part of the defendants; but certain statements, made by their counsel, were admitted to be true, <em>viz.: </em>That there were other subscribers besides the defendants; that several of the defendants were not present at the meeting when thb plaintiff was appointed agent; and that the defendants were not all of them petitioners to the legislature for the charter, .but were all subscribers for the bank, and would have been members of the corporation, had the l\u00e9gislature seen fit to grant, the charter. It was also stated, and not denied, that some of the defendants did not know of Mr. <em>Spr'oat\u2019s </em>employment, until after the failure of the application to the legislature; but the subscription was completed, and meetings were held, and their proceedings were recorded before the appointment of Mr. <em>Sproat. </em>Several meetings were called, of those who had associated, to settle with Mr. <em>Sproat, </em>at which meetings there was some dispute about the amount of his charge ; but it was not proved that the defendants were present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">The judge observed to the jury, that those who associated for the purpose of establishing a bank must have contemplated an application to the legislature; that the attention of some of the associates, or of some person in their behalf, to state their claims before a committee of the General Court, was usual, if not necessary ; that the act of a part of the associates, in employing the plaintiff, might be presumed to be assented to by all who did not expressly dissent; and that, under the foregoing circumstances, there was an implied promise of all to pay those * expenses which should necessarily arise in the prosecutian of their enterprise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">Under this opinion of the judge, a verdict was taken for the plaintiff by consent; which was to stand, and judgment be rendered thereon, unless the Court should be of opinion that the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>reported did not warrant the verdict, in which case the verdict was to be set aside, and the plaintiff become nonsuit; the objections on the part of the defendants being, that those who were proved to have been present when the agent was appointed were alone liable for his compensation; that there was no express promise, nor any consideration for an implied one; and that the subscription was only an engagement to take shares, and could not be construed into a promise to pay expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">The action was called up at this term, and continued <em>nisi, </em>to be argued at <em>Taunton, </em>next week ; <em>[the Chief Justice </em>observing to the defendant\u2019s counsel, that the only question in the case was, whether, when a number of persons associate for a specific purpose, they are not to be understood as engaging to pay the necessary expenses incurred in endeavors to effect the purpose, according to their respective interests in the association;] when</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>Tillinghast,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AObj\">for the defendants, being called on by the Court, insisted that those only of the associates, who were present and</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdH\">acted in the appointment of the plaintiff as agent, could be liable to remunerate him for his services. Those who were not then present, might have preferred another person for the object, or might have deemed any agent wholly unnecessary. Here, at most, was nothing more than an implied promise, and the implication can arise only from the act of those associates who employed the plaintiff. The act of association was of a quite different nature, and amounted only to an engagement to take certain shares in the proposed stock. Surely a promise to pay money to the plaintiff cannot be implied from that act. In the cases of subscription to turnpikes, the subscribers have not been * held to pay the assessments necessary to the fulfilment of the project; much less can a mere general association bind the subscribers to perform a promise they not only never made, but which they could not have contemplated. Here only a part of the associates employed the plaintiff; another part might have employed another person; and will it be said that all those who had associated would in such case have been liable to compensate the services of as many agents as each different portion of the associates had seen fit to appoint ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ax6n\">When the defendants associated for the purpose of obtaining a charter for a bank, to be established in this town, it is to be presumed that they understood the usual course in which charters of that nature are obtained. There must be a petition to the legislature. There must then be some person whose duty it is to exhibit to the legislature the grounds on which the petition rests, and who is able to remove doubts and objections that may arise. Such a person, it may always be supposed, will be entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>reasonable compensation for his services, whether he succeeds in his undertaking or not.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b273-7\"><em>Baylies </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In the case at bar, the. plaintiff was appointed at a regular meeting of the associates. If any of them were not present, they tacitly agreed to be bound by the acts and doings of those who attended; especially as they did not afterwards protest or object against those acts. Particularly the jury might well infer their assent to an act so necessary to the accomplishment of their views, as the appointment of an agent to solicit from the legislature a charter of incorporation ; and from such assent, a moral obligation arises to make a reasonable compensation for the time and labors of the agent so appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">As no objection is made to the amount of compensation demanded by the plaintiff, and found by the jury, let judgment be entered according to the verdict, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"><em> </em>[Where an agent employed in endeavoring to carry a bill through Parliament for making a railway, sued the chairman of a committee of subscribers to the undertaking for his work and labor and expenses incurred as such agent, and it appeared that <em>the agent himself was a subscriber </em>to the undertaking,\u2014 held that the action would not lie. \u2014 <em>Holmes </em>vs. Higgins, <em>2 D.
