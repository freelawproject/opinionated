The judgment was founded on *a writ of entry, in which the plaintiffs declared that said <em>Callender </em>had no entry, but after the disseisin which one <em>Lemuel Cox </em>did to the plaintiffs within thirty years previous to the date of that writ. The said <em>Cal-lender </em>pleaded to said action, that said <em>Lemuel Cox </em>did not disseise those demandants, as they alleged in their writ. The jury found that <em>Lemuel Cox </em>did disseise the demandants; and they also <em>as </em>sessed, in favor of said <em>Callender, </em>for the buildings and improvements made by the said <em>Callender, </em>and those under whom he claimed, the sum of 476 dollars 33 cents, which the plaintiffs paid to him ; and on the 28th day of June, 1810, the plaintiffs received seisin and possession of the demanded premises, in virtue of a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>issued on said judgment. The disseisin done to the plaintiffs by the <em>said Lemuel Cox, </em>as aforesaid, was more than twenty years previous to the date of the said writ of entry served on the said <em>Callender; </em>and the said <em>Lemuel Cox, </em>and those who claimed under him, had quiet seisin of the premises for more than twenty years next before the date of said writ. Said <em>Callender </em>had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>possession of the premises for the whole space of six years previous to the date of the writ in this action, which was the 18th of June, 1810.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">If, on the above state of facts, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this action for mesne profits, judgment was to be rendered for the plaintiffs, for the amount of rents received by the defendant within six years next before the date of the writ, deducting any sums he should have paid for taxes or repairs during the same time; but if the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover in this action, they were to become nonsuit, and the defendant to have judgment for his costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-6\">\n<em>Amory,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeY\">in support of the action, cited <em>Bacon\u2019s Abr.

When a disseisee enters, having a right of entry, he changes the disseisin into a trespass.
