Upon general notice having been given in manner required by law, <em>Samuel Reed </em>came in, claimed to be sole seised during the life of <em>Hannah </em>Reed, and traversed the seisin of the petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">The parties then agreed, in a case stated, that <em>Samuel Reed, </em>late of <em>Littleton, </em>deceased, was seised of the premises in question, and, being so seised, made his last will and testament, in which, after expressing his intention to dispose of all his worldly goods, and authorizing his executor to sell certain lands in <em>Ashburnham, </em>for the payment of his debts, there is the following clause : \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">\u201c I do give and bequeath to my beloved wife, <em>Hannah Reed, </em>one third part of my personal estate, and <em>the income </em>of my real estate, one third of it, what I own in <em>Littleton </em>and <em>Westford, </em>during her life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\">Then follow several specific and pecuniary legacies to several of the testator\u2019s children, the latter to be paid in six months from his wife\u2019s decease. The will concludes with the following devise : \u2014 \u201c After the above legacies are paid, remainder of my estate I give to my seven sons, to be equally divided amongst them,\u201d with a provision * that such of them as had been advanced in the testator\u2019s lifetime should allow such advancement as a part of their respective shares. The respondent, <em>Samuel Reed, </em>eldest son of the testator, is appointed executor of the said will, which, after the testator\u2019s decease, was duly proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-11\">\u2022 The testator left ten children, of whom the two petitioners and the respondent are three. The testator\u2019s widow, named in the will, was still living, and no portion of the real estate of her husband had been set out or assigned to her since his decease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-12\">If, upon the foregoing facts, the Court should be of opinion that the petitioners were entitled to have partition of any part of the premises described in their petition, the respondent agreed to be defaulted, and that judgment should be rendered for partition of such part as the Court should consider them respectively entitled to; otherwise the petitioners agreed to become nonsuit; and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>either case, it was agreed that the Court should render such judgment for costs as the case might require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-5\"><em>J. Prescott </em>and Abbot,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A31\">for the respondent, contended that there was in the will a constructive devise to the executor, during the life of the widow, in trust to enable him to pay the one third of the income to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">The whole will, taken together, seems to show that the testator intended for his widow a better provision than a devise of one third of his lands. The provision is like an annuity charged upon the lands ; or a legacy becoming due yearly, which can be claimed only of the executor; and as he is liable to pay it, he must, as executor, be considered as having an estate in the lands, to enable him to pay it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\">This construction is favored by the expression \u201c <em>after the above legacies are </em>paid, remainder,\u201d &amp;c. As the word <em>legacy </em>sometimes includes devises of land, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> the testator may be considered as referring to the provision for his wife, as well as the preceding personal legacies. If so, it is clear he intended that no partition should be had of his lands, until after her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aco\">* But if this construction is untenable, still the petitioners cannot have partition as they have prayed for it. If the executor has not all the lands, the widow must be entitled to one third: for a devise of rents, profits, or income, may be construed a devise of the land. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> In such case, the petitioners, not having supported their petition, are not entitled to costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-11\"><em>Bigelow, </em>for the petitioners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aos\">moved for leave to alter the prayer of the petition, so as to ask for their several purparties in ,the two thirds only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-12\">\n<em>Prescott</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADY\">moved that the widow might now be entered as a respondent.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b332-15\"> <em>Com.

A devise of the income of lands is the same in its effect as a devise of the lands. The petitioners have, however, mistaken their rights. During the life of their mother, they are entitled to no more than two seventh parts of two thirds of the land described in their petition.</p>\n<author id=\"b332-13\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AEp\">Let the widow\u2019s appearance be entered; and let the petitioners alter their petition as moved for.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">As to the question of costs referred to us by the parties, the provincial statute giving this process <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> made no provision for costs in any case; and. the statute now in force gives them only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>upon the determination of an issue either of law or fact. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> No such issue has been joined in this action. No costs can, therefore, be allowed. If parties, agreeing to cases stated for the opinion of the Court, would have costs await the decision, it must be made part of their agreement. The agreement in the present case is not sufficient, and no costs can be taxed for either party.
