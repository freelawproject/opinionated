The general issue being joined, a trial was had before <em>the Chief Justice, </em>at the sittings here after October term, 1809, and a verdict found, by consent of the parties, for the demandant, for one moiety only of the lands demanded, subject to the opinion of the Court on the fol-owing case, <em>viz.: </em>\u2014 ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-8\"><em>William Martin, </em>and <em>Anne, </em>his wife, were formerly seised of the tenements demanded in fee simple in her right, and continued so seised until the term of the Court of Common Pleas holden within and for the county of <em>Middlesex, </em>in December, 1782; at which term, by the judgment of the same Court, all the said <em>William\u2019s </em>right, title, interest, and estate, in the tenements demanded, were vested in the commonwealth. Afterwards, in June, 1786, a committee duly authorized by the General Court, bargained and sold all the commonwealth\u2019s right, title, interest, and estate, aforesaid, to <em>Henry Woods, </em>the father of the tenant, who entered by virtue of the same conveyance, became seised of the tenements aforesaid, as the law required, and continued so seised until his death, in February, 1804 ; and on his death, <em>Samson Woods, </em>the tenant, his son and heir, entered into the same tenements, became seised thereof, as the law requires, and continued so seised until the entry of the demandant hereafter mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-9\">The said <em>Anne </em>died in 1793, leaving the demandant, her son, and <em>Gilbert Ainsley, </em>her grandson, her next of kin; and the said <em>William Martin </em>afterwards died July 11, 1799. Afterwards, in February, 1808, the demandant, as heir to his mother, <em>Anne Martin, </em>entered into (he demanded tenements, and became seised thereof, as the law requires, and continued so seised thereof. Afterwards, the said <em>Sam.son, </em>the tenant, reentered upon, and ousted him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-10\">The demandant was born in <em>Boston, </em>in the year 1752, and always dwelt 'here until 1774, having, before that time, been ad mitted an attorney of the inferior Court of Common Pleas for the .county of <em>Suffolk. </em>In 1774, he removed * tram <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Boston </em>to the Island of <em>Jamaica, </em>where he lived and practised law until 1791; except that in March,. 1783, he was in <em>Paris, </em>and thence went to <em>London, </em>under a royal pass, where he resided some time, and then returned to <em>Jamaica. </em>In 1791, he left <em>Jamaica, </em>and came to <em>Boston, </em>with the intention of living and practising law there as an attorney; and was accordingly, in the same year, recommended by the bar of the county of <em>Suffolk </em>to the justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, for admission as an attorney of that Court; but he was not admitted. In the same year he removed to the state of <em>New York, </em>in which state he has ever since dwelt, and now dwells. On the 4th day of August, 1792, he appeared before the Supreme Court of Judicature of that state, and in open Court took and subscribed the oath of abjuration and allegiance to that state, the oaths of office as an attorney and counsellor at law, and the oath to support the constitution of the <em>United States, </em>and was thereupon admitted an attorney and counsellor at law in the said Court. On the 8th day of October, in the same year, <em>James Lansing, </em>Jun., one of the justices of the Supremo Court of Judicature of the state of <em>New York, </em>certified under his hand that the demandant was a citizen of the said state, and duly admitted a counsellor at law of the same court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">The said <em>Gilbert Ainsley </em>is the son of <em>Elizabeth Ainsley, </em>who was a daughter of the said <em>Anne Martin, </em>who survived her. The said <em>Gilbert </em>was born in the year 1774, at <em>Boston, </em>where his mother then lived; and in the same year he removed, with his parents, to the province of <em>Canada, </em>in which province, or in some other part of the now <em>British Dominions, </em>he has ever since dwelt, and not in any of the <em>United States.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\"><em>\u2022 </em>And \u2022 it is agreed by the parties, that, if it appear to the Court that any of the facts aforesaid are improperly admitted in evidence under this issue, then all such facts, so improperly admitted, are to be laid out of the case, which *is to be considered by the Court as if those facts were not in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-7\">Now, if the Court shall be of opinion, from such of the facts aforesaid as are properly admitted in evidence on this issue, that both the demandant and the said <em>Gilbert Ainsley </em>can, by law, inherit lands from the said <em>Anne Martin, </em>and that the entry of the demandant was lawful, then the verdict is to stand. But if the Court shall be of opinion, from such of the facts aforesaid as are properly admitted in evidence, that the demandant can, and that the said <em>Gilbert </em>cannot, by law, inherit lands from the said <em>Anne Martin, </em>and that the said entry was lawful, then the verdict is to be set aside, and a general verdict for the demandant for the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of the tenements aforesaid is to be entered. But if the Court shall be of opinion, from such of the said facts as are properly admitted in evidence under this issue, that the demandant cannot inherit lands from the said <em>Anne Martin, </em>or that his entry aforesaid was unlawful, then the verdict is also to be set aside, and a general verdict for the tenant is to be entered, and judgment is to be rendered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">The cause was argued October term, 1810, by <em>Ward </em>and <em>F Blake </em>for the demandant, and <em>Davis </em>(Solicitor-General) and <em>Bigelow </em>for the tenant. ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>For the tenant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad4A\">it was contended, 1. That the demandant had no right of entry in February, 1808, and if so, he could not recover in this action. That entry was unlawful, because the seisin and possession of <em>Henry Woods </em>was lawful, and gave him an apparent right of possession ; and the mere entry of the lawful owner does not operate to oust the tenant in possession, except he is in by abatement, intrusion, or disseisin. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Further, <em>Henry Woods </em>was seised more than five years, which, with the descent cast, tolled the right of entry. <em>Henry Woods, </em>deriving his title directly from the . commonwealth, could not have been a disseisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6ZB\">* 2. The demandant was an alien, and therefore inca-</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-8\">pable of inheriting. The whole history of his life, as detailed in the case, shows him to have remained a subject of the king of <em>Great Britain. </em>The certificate of Judge <em>Lansing </em>was extrajudicial, and, at the utmost, can import no more than his opinion. <em>[Curia. </em>The certificate can have no effect on the question.] The duty of allegiance and the rights of citizenship are necessarily connected; a man cannot, at the same time, owe two coordinate allegiances. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> The principles maintained by this Court in the cases of <em>Gardner Kilham </em>vs. <em>Ward &amp; Al. </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> determine the demandant to have been an alien at the time of the descent cast; and it is the state of the party\u2019s allegiance, at that time, which fixes the right of inheritance. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-9\">\n<em>For the demandant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amo\">it was insisted that, if he was an alien, it was matter in abatement only, and advantage could not be taken of it under this issue. Even alien enemy is to be pleaded in bar, and cannot be given in evidence under the general issue. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-10\">It is not denied that, if the demandant was an alien at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of the descent cast, he could not inherit at common law. But he never has been for a moment an alien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">He was born in Massachusetts, and has always continued a citizen thereof, owing his natural allegiance thereto. The common law, which was the same at the time of the demandant\u2019s birth, at the time of the descent cast, and at the present time, knows but one rule of allegiance, which is, that it commences at a person\u2019s birth, and continues until his death, whatex'er fanciful theories the writers upon natural law may have invented on the subject. The commonwealth was the successor of the king. There xvas no dissolution of the government. The common law continued in full force, and by it the demandant\u2019s allegiance was transferred to the commonwealth. The rules of good pleading show the law upon the subject. The plea of alienage always shows the party\u2019s place of birth; but it would be a strange plea that, from a person\u2019s being born #in <em>Boston, </em>should infer that he was an alien from the commonwealth of <em>Massachusetts. </em>Every one born within this territory is capable of inheriting, unless expressly disabled by an act of the government. There is no such act applying to this demandant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-7\">By the definitive treaty of peace between the <em>United States </em>and his Britannic Majesty, it is expressly stipulated (article 6) that no person shall suffer any future loss or damage, either in his person, liberty, or property, by reason of the part he may have taken in the war.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-8\">The demandant\u2019s right is perfectly saved by Mr. <em>Jay\u2019s </em>treaty of 1794. If it should be yielded that he was an alien at the time of the descent cast, <em>viz., </em>in 1793, the ninth article of that treaty stipulates, that neither <em>British </em>subjects then holding lands in the territories of the <em>United States, </em>nor their heirs or assigns, shall, so far as may respect the said lands, and the legal remedies incident thereto, be regarded as aliens. At the time of the execution of that treaty, the demandant held the reversion of the lands in question, dependent on the death of his father, then tenant by the courtesy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-9\">As to the demandant\u2019s right of entry, the conveyance to <em>Woods </em>was of no more than <em>William Martin\u2019s </em>interest, which was a life estate only. If the conveyance was of more, it was void so far as it exceeded that. Then, after <em>Martin\u2019s </em>death, in July, 1799, <em>Woods </em>was a disseisor. He died in January, 1804, within five years, and so the demandant\u2019s right of entry was not taken away.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-10\">\n<em>For the tenant in reply.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXT\">It is immaterial what estate the government undertook to convey. If any present interest passed by it, <em>Woods\u2019s </em>entry was lawful; and certainly where the entry of a tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>in possession was lawful, an entry upon him cannot be so, nor can it oust him of his title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">The action stood continued under advisement until this term.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\"> 3 <em>Black.

As we have decided in the case of <em>Ainsley </em>vs. <em>Martin </em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> that <em>Ainsley </em>is not to be considered an alien, the demandant can claim a moiety only of the land demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The question which has most required our attention, respects the demandant\u2019s right of entry. <em>William Martin\u2019s </em>estate in the demanded premises being seized by the government, and judgment of forfeiture having been rendered, the same was conveyed by the agents for the commonwealth to <em>Henry Woods, </em>from whom it descended to the present tenant. After <em>William. Martin\u2019s </em>death, the tenant held an estate at sufferance. The demandant\u2019s <em>entry </em>upon him was lawful.
