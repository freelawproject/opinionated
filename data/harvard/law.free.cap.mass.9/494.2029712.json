Whereupon, one of the jurors was withdrawn from the panel, without the defendant\u2019s consent, and the jury were discharged of the prisoner, and he was remanded to prison. Afterwards, in the same term, another jury was empanelled for his trial, who returned a verdict that the. defendant was guilty. Whereupon he moved that judgment on the verdict should be arrested for the cause aforesaid ; and the indictment stood continued to this terpi for the consideration of the said motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">And now, <em>D. W. Lincoln, </em>in support of the motion, contended that a jury sworn and charged with a criminal cannot be discharged, in a capital case, even with the consent of the prisoner; nor in any criminal case without such consent. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-6\"><em>Davis, </em>(Solicitor-General,)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apk\">for the commonwealth, observed that there was much uncertainty and variance among the old law writers upon this point. But there are many instances where juries, in criminal cases not capital, have been discharged by the inherent authority of the Court; sometimes exercised from the inevitable necessity of the circumstances, but always held to be within the legal discretion of the Court. It is easy to imagine many cases of absolute necessity. And even in the case at bar, no alternative was left, but of withdrawing a juror, or keeping the whole jury imprisoned for an indefinite period. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\"> <em>Co.

The practice of withdrawing a juror, where there existed no prospect of a verdict, has frequently been adopted at criminal trials in this Court, and the exception taken in this case cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The defendant took nothing by his motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
