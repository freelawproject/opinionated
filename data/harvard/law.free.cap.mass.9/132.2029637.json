The defendant pleaded <em>nil debet, </em>with a reservation to give any special matter in evidence, and issue was joined by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-13\">At the trial of this issue, which was had at the last September term here, before <em>Thatcher, </em>J., the plaintiff produced a duly-attested copy of the judgment declared on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-14\">The defendant then read to the jury an attested copy of an execution, issued on the said judgment, dated November 27, 1807 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>and returnable on the first Tuesday of January, 1808, on which was the following return, <em>viz.: \u201c Lincoln, </em>ss.

By virtue of this execution, I have made diligent search, and cannot find any goods, nor moneys, nor estate, of the within-named <em>Daniel</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ap6\"><em>Holden, </em>within my precinct, nor wherewith to satisfy * this execution in any part; so I return it in no part satisfied. Attest. <em>Hezekiah Wyman, </em>Dep. Sheriff.\u201d\u2014 The defendant read also an attested copy of a writ, sued on the 23d day of January, 1808, by the said <em>Allen </em>against <em>Edmund Bridge, </em>Esquire, sheriff of the county of <em>Lincoln, </em>returnable to the Court of Common Pleas in <em>Suffolk </em>county, April term, 1808, for the neglect of said <em>Wyman </em>(who was admitted to have been a deputy of the said <em>Bridge, </em>and to have had the said execution delivered to him in due season for service) in not executing said precept, collecting its contents, arresting the body of <em>Holden, </em>or returning said execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">It was admitted that, while the action against <em>Bridge </em>was pending, <em>Wyman </em>went to <em>Boston, </em>and made an adjustment with <em>Allen, </em>giving him his promissory note for the amount of his judgment against <em>Holden, </em>in consideration of which <em>Allen </em>discharged <em>Bridge </em>from the action he had brought against him, and assigned to <em>Wyman </em>all his, <em>Allen\u2019s, </em>interest in the judgment now declared on, with authority to prosecute this action for the benefit, and at the expense, of <em>Wyman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">It was further in evidence that, while the said execution was in force, the defendant paid about a hundred dollars to one <em>Cornelius Thompson, </em>who then owed the defendant a sum of money, which, with the said hundred dollars, was equal to the amount then due on the execution; and that said <em>Thompson </em>thereupon agreed with the defendant to pay the execution; that <em>Wyman </em>called on <em>Holden, </em>and afterwards on <em>Thompson, </em>a short time before the return day of the execution, and the latter promised <em>Wyman </em>that he would discharge the execution, and requested him to let it expire in his hands, observing that he had some debts due him, out of which he expected to raise the money. It was understood by the witness, who testified to these latter' facts, that <em>Wyman </em>acquiesced in this proposal, and in consequence of this assurance of <em>Thompson, </em>neglected to serve the said execution on <em>Holden.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Arf\">* A verdict was taken for the defendant by consent, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the above facts, contained in the judge\u2019s report. If that opinion should be that the action was not maintainable, judgment was to be entered for the defendant on the verdict; otherwise the verdict was to be set aside, and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-9\"><em>Mellen </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_3\">The action is brought for the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of <em>Wyman, </em>who has, by paying to <em>Allen </em>the amount of the judgment now sued, purchased the judgment; and this is an equitable interest, which courts of law will notice and protect. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Nor is <em>Wyman\u2019s </em>claim affected by the facts appearing, and which show him a deputy sheriff, and to have been negligent in this business. It was to serve <em>Holden, </em>and from a confidence in his promises, and those of his friend <em>Thompson, </em>that <em>Wyman </em>has suffered, and has been obliged to seek an indemnity in this action. The debtor has never paid the money which he honestly owes, and which <em>Wyman, </em>having paid it for him, is, on every principle of justice and equity, entitled to recover.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-5\"><em>Wilde </em>and <em>Orr </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgxL\"><em>Wyman </em>has no equitable claims in this case. By his negligence he became liable to indemnify <em>Allen, </em>and being so liable, and for that cause only, he paid the amount of the judgment, which thus became vacated. He had become himself the principal debtor to the judgment creditor. He could not thus place himself in a better situation than a surety. But a surety who has paid a bond, cannot in that character maintain an action on the bond, because it is by his payment discharged. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> So payment of a judgment is a good bar to an action on the judgment.. <em>Allen, </em>having received satisfaction for his debt, had no further demand. He could not then assign to another what he did not himself possess. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-6\">The action standing continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, the opinion of the Court was delivered at <em>Boston, </em>in July following, at an adjournment of the <em>Suffolk </em>March term, by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\"> <em>1 D. &amp; E. </em>619, <em>Wynch </em>vs. <em>Keely. </em>\u2014 4 <em>D.&amp; E. </em>341, <em>Master </em>vs. <em>Miller.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\"> <em>Com.

As it respects the defendant, he has paid nothing, and although the plaintiff has received a sum equal to the amount of his judgment, we do not see how the defendant can avail himself of 'that sum, to discharge himself from his liability on the judgment. The suit against the sheriff was not for the debt, but for damages for his non-performance of his duty; and only nominal damages might have been recovered, had it appeared that nothing had been lost by the negligence of the officer. Had that suit, therefore, proceeded to judgment and execution, it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>been no legal discharge of the original debtor from the judgment recovered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It is true that the plaintiff may receive his debt twice, if he should recover against the sheriff the full amount of his judgment; but the debtor pays but once, so that he is not injured. Whether an officer, having been sued for his negligent doings on an execution, and having paid the amount of the debt in damages, may not maintain an equitable action against the creditor, provided he afterwards obtains his money from the debtor, is a question between the creditor and the officer, not necessary to be settled here.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">No authority has been cited, and I believe none can be found, to show that the recovery of damages against a delinquent officer, by the creditor, operates a discharge of a judgment against the debtor. It is very clear, however, that an officer, under such circumstances, could not maintain an action against the debtor; for he would be obliged to found his claim upon his own failure of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">It is stated, in this case, that this suit is brought for the benefit of the officer, the debt having been assigned to him on his compromise of the suit brought against his principal by the creditor. Such an assignment may be perfectly equitable between the officer and the creditor. Many cases exist, where a sheriff or bis deputy becomes liable * through misfortune or accident, rather than from wilful neglect of duty; and in such</p>\n<p id=\"Ad9\">cases there seems to be no good reason why the creditor, who receives prompt satisfaction from the officer, should not aid him in obtaining an indemnity from the debtor, who can have no cause of complaint, since he can in no event be made to pay more than his debt. Indeed, the knowledge that the suit is brought for the purpose of restoring to the officer what he may have lost through carelessness, or (as it often happens) from his humanity towards the debtor, ought not to prejudice the suit. It may be the means of restoring all the parties to their rights without injustice to any one of them. Such an assignment being voluntary, there is no danger of protecting fraudulent or criminal officers from the just effects of their own misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">There are some facts which render the case less favorable to the officer, if he were the party whose rights we could respect in law, than in other cases which may exist. It is stated that the debtor paid a hundred dollars to <em>Thompson, </em>who owed him enough, with that sum, to discharge this execution; and that the officer agreed to look to <em>Thompson, </em>and afterwards, at his request, omitted to serve the execution. This, however, cannot come into consideration, in the present case, between the judgment creditor and debtor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>It is a matter to be settled between the officer and the debtor. 11 does not, however, appear that the officer had acquired any legal claim upon <em>Thompson; </em>or that he could ever, in any way, compel <em>Thompson </em>to pay. If he could, perhaps the payment to <em>Thompson </em>might be considered as made to the use of the officer, and so ought to be considered as going in satisfaction of the judgment. The defendant has, however, a just and legal claim against <em>Thompson, </em>which he might at any time have enforced; and he may still enforce it, if he has not lost his remedy by negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The effect of this action, therefore, is to restore all things to their proper place. The debtor, who has paid nothing,' is compelled to satisfy a judgment long since * obtained against him; the officer will be restored to the money he has paid for the debtor; and the latter may recover of <em>Thompson </em>the money paid to him, and the debt he owes him. There is no legal defence to the action, and no equitable principles to excite a regr.et that the plaintiff\u2019s present claim can be enforced. The verdict must therefore be set aside, and a new trial be granted, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\"><em> </em>[In <em>Sherman </em>vs. Boyce, (15 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>443,) it was held that if an officer, having an execution, pays the amount to the plaintiff, with his own money, or with money-raised by the defendant and the officer on their joint credit, the judgment is satisfied, and the officer cannot afterwards enforce the execution against the defendant for his own indemnity, notwithstanding an agreement between them that the execution should continue in full force in the hands of the officer, \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
