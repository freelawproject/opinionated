The justice issued his summons for <em>Bliss's </em>appearance at a day and place appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">The respondent pleaded, 1. The general issue of not guilty, which was joined by th.e complainant. 2. In bar, that having become, by misfortune, disabled and infirm in body, he obtained from the surgeon of the regiment to which the said company belonged, a certificate as follows, addressed to the captain of the company: \u201c Mr. <em>Cromwell Bliss, </em>a soldier in your company, by a. wound in his left hand, has his thumb and fingers rendered useless thereby, and is unable to perform military exercise. <em>Rehoboth, </em>May 5, 1807.\u201d And that on the same day the captain of the company discharged him from doing military duty in the company the full length of time expressed or implied in the certificate, that is to say, for life, by endorsing his name on the said certificate, which was afterwards approved by the commanding officer of the regiment; by force of all which the said <em>Bliss </em>was, and still is, discharged, &amp;c.; and this, &amp;c.; wherefore, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">The complaint replied that <em>Isaac Fowler, </em>who signed the said certificate, was not then the surgeon of the said regiment, upon which issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">After hearing the cause, and adjourning his court to another day for consideration, the justice found that <em>Bliss </em>was, on the day charged in the complaint, a private soldier, as set forth in the complaint, and liable to do military duty in the said company, and that he did unnecessarily neglect to appear, &amp;c., and thereupon sentenced him to pay a fine and'costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">At the last term, <em>Tillinghast, </em>for the respondent, contended that the proceedings should be quashed. Here were two issues joined in good form. Neither of them are found, but other matters foreign to them both; and upon these foreign matters the justice rendered judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-10\">* <em>Wheaton,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKE\">in support of the proceedings, insisted that the special plea in bar ought not to have been received, and so ought now to be thrown out of the case. Then, supposing the cause tried on the general issue, that issue is substantially found ; and the judgment is well supported.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-11\">The cause was continued for advisement; and now,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b291-12\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Afc\">expressed their opinion that as the siiigeon had, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>his certificate, given no limitation of time, it was competent to the justice to inquire whether the infirmity still continued. It would not h^ve been a just construction of the certificate, to suppose it necessarily to continue for the life of the soldier.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Then the finding him to be a soldier belonging to the company, and that he <em>unnecessarily </em>neglected to appear, is a sufficient finding of the general issue ; and as by the statute of 1783, <em>c. </em>42, \u00a7 7, all special pleading in civil actions triable before justices of the peace is rendered needless and improper, it was not necessary to find the issue joined under the special plea in this case. There is sufficient found to maintain the judgment; and let it be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
