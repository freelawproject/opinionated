The judgment was against <em>Whiting </em>as principal, and against his goods, effects, and credits, in the hands' of <em>Andrew Dexter </em>and another, who had been summoned as trustees, and defaulted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">The errors assigned were, in substance, that no issue was joined, upon which the verdict in the case could be given ; and that <em>Dexter </em>was never served with a copy of the original writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">The defendant in error pleaded in <em>nullo est erratum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-10\">Upon the record being read, it appeared that the defendant, in the Common Pleas, pleaded the general issue to the action, to which the plaintiff demurred with reservation, and appealed from the judgment rendered on the demurrer. The record then states that, in this Court, \u201c the demurrer being waived, and the issue, as tendered at said Court of Common Pleas, and on file, being joined,\u201d the cause was committed to a jury, &amp;c., who returned their verdict for the original plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\">It seemed, however, to be understood that the plaintiff had, in truth, omitted to waive his demurrer, and to join the issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-12\">\n<em>Bigelow,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah1\">for the defendant in error, relied on the record as to the joining of the issue. But even if he were to * agree the fact that it had not been joined, he insisted that this omission was cured by the defence made on the part of a <em>Whiling </em>before the jury. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> As to the want of service upon <em>Dexter, </em>this was nothing to the plaintiff in error. There was, in fact, no judgment against <em>Dexter, </em>but merely an order for execution to issue against the effects of <em>Whiling </em>in his hands. And if this amounts to a judgment against <em>Dexter, </em>he ought to have joined in bringing the writ of error. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Or the judgment may be reversed as to the awarding such execution, and affirmed as to the rest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-13\"><em>Whitman </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b465-17\"> <em>Bac.

But the record before us says otherwise, and we are bound by the record. If, however, it were true that the plaintiff below had neglected to join the issue tendered, and had gone to trial, and the defendant had appeared and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>defended the action before the jury, the verdict would have been good, and the judgment to be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">As to the want of service on <em>Dexter, </em>one of the supposed trus tees of the defendant, he is alone interested in that question, and the plaintiff in error loses nothing by the erroneous proceeding against him. If <em>Dexter </em>were to bring his writ of error, we should reverse only that part of the judgment which awards execution against <em>Whiting\u2019s </em>effects in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
