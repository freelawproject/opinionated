The defendant pleads the general issue, which is joined; and also in bar, that at the Supreme Judicial Court, holden at <em>Alfred, </em>in and for this county, on the last Tuesday of October, 1807, <em>Abigail Lyman </em>and the defendant recovered judgment against the plaintiff, for the possession of a certain tract of land described, and costs of suit taxed at 29 dollars 79 cents, unless the said <em>H. </em>should, within two months from, &amp;.c., pay the said <em>Abigail </em>and the defendant the sum of 551 dollars 51 cents, being the amount of the principal and interest due on the mortgage deed declared on; which judgment he avers to remain in full force; and that, on the 15th of August, 1809, it was unsatisfied for said costs only; and the said <em>Abigail </em>having died after the rendition of the judgment, and before the day last mentioned, the defendant on that day purchased</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>out of the clerk\u2019s office a <em>jpluries </em>execution, in which was stated the death of the said <em>Abigail </em>since the rendition of the judgment, * directed to the sheriff or his deputy, and delivered the same to a deputy sheriff, to be executed and returned according to law. The plea then sets forth the exe cution <em>in hese </em>verba, in which, after the recital of the judgment, there is a suggestion of the death of the said <em>Abigail </em>after the rendition of the judgment, and a command to the sheriff to levy the money for which the judgment was rendered, with two dollars and forty cents more for this and three former writs, and to pay it to the said <em>Moses Lyman. </em>There is then set forth the return of the deputy sheriff, that for want of goods, &amp;c., he had committed the said <em>Hamilton </em>to the jail in <em>Alfred. </em>And the plea concludes with stating that the plaintiff was imprisoned, kept, and detained, under the said execution, for the time mentioned in the declaration, as it was lawful, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-5\">To this plea the plaintiff demurs generally, and the defendant joins in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-6\">\n<em>Holmes,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmW\">in support of the demurrer, argued that the arrest and imprisonment were illegal, the execution being void. The statute of 1784, <em>c. </em>28, \u00a7 1, prescribes the form of execution. It is to issue only in favor of the party recovering the judgment. In this execution there is added a material fact, and a <em>scire facias </em>ought to have issued, on which the judgment debtor would have had an opportunity to traverse that fact. The execution, thus varying from the judgment, a satisfaction of it would not have been a satisfaction of the judgment. If the execution could lawfully issue after the death of one of the judgment creditors, it ought to have followed the judgment, and still to have issued in the name of both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">The execution recited in the plea issued nearly two years after the judgment on which it was founded, and the plea sets forth the issuing of no preceding ones. But without a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgment, no original execution can issue after one year from the judgment. If previous executions had issued, it was necessary to set them forth, together with the return of each, that the Court might * judge of the legality of that under which the defendant justifies.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-8\"><em>Mellen </em>and <em>Emery </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP\">The Court will intend that the previous executions were duly issued and returned, rather than that their clerk issued one which, by law, he had no authority to issue. This is the common form of pleading, namely, to set forth the process under which the party claims to justify, and to aver that it duly issued according to law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-9\">Perhaps it was unnecessary to suggest the death of <em>Abigail Ly</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>man </em>in the <em>pluries </em>execution. But it cannot go to vender the exe cution void. Nor was the survivor put to his <em>scire facias </em>by that event. The survivor was entitled to his execution. A payment to him would have satisfied the judgment. He only was entitled to the money; and the precept of the execution was to levy and pay the money to him. In <em>Withers </em>vs. <em>Harris, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Lord <em>Holt </em>says, <em>\u201c </em>Where there are several plaintiffs or defendants, and one of them dies, execution may be sued by or against the survivors, upon suggestion of the death made upon the roll.\u201d The suggestion was I ere made to the clerk, and no doubt entered by him in the records, which must be as good as the roll in <em>England; </em>and he thereupon issued the execution conformably to the fact, truly reciting the judgment as it was rendered. And if this was an error, it was that of the clerk; and it would be inequitable in the highest degree to subject a creditor, pursuing his honest demands with the countenance of the Court, to an action for the misprision of the clerk. But, at any rate, we must insist that this error, if it was an error, did not make the process void, but, at the utmost, only voidable; in which case an action of trespass will not lie.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-5\"><em>Holmes </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae\">The suggestion on the roll mentioned in <em>Withers </em>vs. <em>Harris </em>must be made while the action is pending. It cannot be done after the final judgment is entered up; there is then no court, nor any officer of the court, to receive the sugges-</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK\">tian. The execution must in * every case follow the judgment. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> If it does not, it is void, and every act done under it is tortious. But if voidable only, as it does not pursue the judgment, the party taking it out and causing it to be levied is a trespasser, though the officer may be excusable for serving it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b24-10\"> 2 <em>L.

It would have been sufficient for the defendant generally to have set forth in his plea that he had recovered judgment, that execution had issued thereon, and that, by force of such execution, he had caused the arrest complained of, leaving the plaintiff, in his replication, to show any defects, if any existed. \u2014 Further, the execution is described as a <em>pluries </em>writ, which technically presupposes two or more writs issued and returned before it; and as the judgment was rendered at October term, * 1807, and there are but two terms of the Court holden in this county annually, an execution must have been issued within a yeai and a day of the\" judgment, and have been returned, to have author ized the clerk to issue an <em>alias </em>execution, and that <em>alias </em>must have been returned before the <em>pluries </em>could legally have been issued; and what ought by law to have been done, we may presume was done, before this execution was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">But a more important objection is, that the clerk has issued the execution in a form not provided by law, and that it does not strict ly pursue the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The judgment is rendered in favor of <em>Abigail Lyman </em>and <em>Moses Lyman, </em>for the possession of certain lands and tenements; and a writ of <em>habere facias </em>had issued upon that judgment, commanding the sheriff to put the said <em>Abigail </em>and <em>Moses </em>in possession, and to levy the costs of suit. It is alleged in the plea in bar, that the judgment remained unsatisfied for the costs only, and the writ of execution is set forth in the plea. In the writ the clerk has recited, before the mandatory part, that <em>Abigail Lyman </em>had died since the rendition of judgment; and the sheriff is commanded by the writ to raise the money, and cause it to be paid to <em>Moses Lyman, </em>the surviving party to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">It is contended by <em>the </em>plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that this writ of execution, so issued, was void; and that the arrest under it was therefore illegal. The principle assumed by the counsel is, that where there are two or more judgment creditors, and before execution issues one of them dies, the survivors are put to their <em>scire facias </em>before they can have execution upon their judgment. No authority has been produced in support of this principle ; but, on the contrary, the course of the books shows that the proper mode of proceeding in such case would be to take out the execution conformed to the judgment, in the name of all the creditors, without regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>death of any one; <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and this should have been the course *here. A <em>scire facias </em>seems necessary only when the execution is to issue in the name of some person not</p>\n<p id=\"A_8\">a \"party to the record, as an executor or administrator; or where, by lapse of time, the right to an execution is lost, and the party in interest wishes to revive it. Probably, however, in a case like the present, on suggestion made to the Court of the death of one of the creditors in a judgment, where the interest survived, after judgment and before the issuing of an execution, the execution would be ordered to issue in the name of the survivor only.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">But it appears that, in <em>England, </em>the deceased party may be omitted-in the execution, upon a suggestion on the roll of the intervening death. This is, without doubt, a suggestion out of court, in the office of the legal keeper of the rolls, and seems to be analogous to the proceeding of the clerk in the case before us, and it probably led to the course adopted. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> We are not, however, satisfied with the regularity of the practice, although we are by no means prepared to say that the execution was for this cause void. Had it issued in the name of <em>Abigail Lyman </em>and <em>Moses Lyman, </em>the latter would have had the sole control over it; he alone could have discharged it, and he was alone entitled to receive the avails of it. The situation of the debtor was in no degree changed; his rights remained the same, and his remedy for any defect or omission the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">We therefore think that as, on motion to the Court by the surviv ing judgment creditor, the clerk would probably have been directed to issue it in the name of the survivor only, his issuing it in that manner, without order, is not such an irregularity as makes the execution void even against the creditor himself; and that the arrest was not an unlawful act. <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\n<em>Plea in bar adjudged good.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b26-8\"> [2 <em>Tidd.
