Because the supposed slander, mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, is alleged to have been uttered by the defendant against the plaintiff, in the discharge of his duty as town clerk of <em>Rutland, </em>in receiving, sorting, and counting, votes for the moderator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>of a town meeting, which, by law, is no part of the official duty of the clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">2. Because the defendant was a constituent of the plaintiff in his said office of town clerk, and was a legal voter in said meeting; and the supposed slander is alleged to have been uttered of the defendant in the discharge of the duties of his said office. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-6\">\n<em>Lincoln,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aihm\">in support of the motion, insisted that the words charged are not actionable. It is laid down, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> as a general rule on this subject, that, to make words actionable, there must be some certain or probable temporal loss or damage. No imputation of the breach of legal or moral obligation, unless enforced by temporal sanctions, will be sufficient to found an action. The charge, in the case at bar, did not expose the plaintiff to any temporal loss; for it was no part of his duty to count the votes for moderator, which properly belonged, at that time, to the chairman of the selectmen. Such, at least, was the general practice before the late statute of 1811, <em>c. </em>9, which passed since the speaking the words complained of. Indeed, the express provision, in this last act, that town clerks shall preside in the election of the moderator, shows strongly that such was not their official duty before. By the statute in force at the time of the town meeting referred to in this case, *(1786, c. 75,) the only duties assigned to a town clerk are, to record all votes of town meetings, and to administer the oaths to the other town officers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-7\">But, if the plaintiff was in the legal exercise of his office, he was amenable to his constituents, and it was as well their duty as their right to watch his official conduct, and to censure it when, in their view, it should be improper. Words which import the charge of a crime may, notwithstanding the falsity of them, be justified, if they have been only published in a course of justice, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> as by a barrister or a witness. The same reason applies to words spoken by a legal voter, in animadverting on the conduct of an officer in town meeting. If he would correct it, then was his only time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-8\"><em>Bigelow </em>and <em>Blake </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\"> 6 <em>Gwillim\u2019s Bac.

As the first of these was not attempted, it is contended that \"the latter cannot apply, for that the words do not respect any conduct to which the plaintiff was bound in virtue of his office as town clerk. We have considered this last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Doint, and are satisfied that, as it is the duty of the clerk to record the choice of a moderator, he cannot duly execute this duty unless he first sort and count the votes given in. It was, therefore, necessarily incident to his office; and the motion fails on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It was objected, then, that the defendant, as a voter in the meeting, had a legal right to scrutinize into, and to animadvert upon, the plaintiff\u2019s official conduct; and the circumstance was likened to legal proceedings in a course of justice. But we perceive ho such analogy. If a citizen, observing the town clerk, or other officer, swerving from the line of his duty, decently suggests his error to him, there could certainly be nothing censurable in such conduct. But it would be mischievous in a high degree, if a citizen could, with impunity, falsely charge an officer *with wilful misconduct, before the assembly of his fellow-citizens. No man of character would be willing to accept an office, if, in consequence, he ceased to be protected by the law from the calumnies of his fellow-citizens who might be disposed to slander him. It is observable, too, in the present case, that the slander was repeated. It had not the apology of sudden impulse, nor could it have been uttered for a lawful or an innocent purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"><em>Judgment on the </em>verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
