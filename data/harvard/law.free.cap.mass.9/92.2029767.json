We, the above named, having been sworn as above, have appraised, and do hereby appraise, the one undivided fourth part of the one undivided eighth part of the whole real estate, with the privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging, which the late Colonel <em>Edward Anderson, </em>of <em>Windham, </em>in said county, deceased, died seised and possessed of; the said whole estate being in said town of <em>Windham, </em>and in the town of <em>Gray, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>in said county, reference for the description of said estate being had to the inventory of the same ; * the said real estate having been shown to us by <em>George Tate </em>and <em>Charles </em>Johnson, the creditors, the said fourth part being the estate of the within-named <em>John Anderson, </em>to satisfy the within execution ; allowance in the appraisal of said one fourth part being made for the encumbrance of the widow <em>Mary Anderson\u2019s </em>thirds in said estate. Dated at <em>Windham, </em>13th November, 1807,\u201d and signed by the three appraisers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">The officer certifies the choice of the appraisers, and their having appraised the \u201c estate above mentioned,\u201d at the sum of 319 dollars 25 cents, and adds, \u201c I have this day, agreeable to law, delivered possession and seisin of the said <em>John Anderson\u2019s </em>estate to them, the said <em>George Tate </em>and <em>Charles Johnson, </em>the creditors, to have and to hold the same, in common with the heirs of <em>Edward Anderson, </em>with the encumbrance of <em>Mary Anderson, </em>widow\u2019s dower, to them, the said <em>George Tate </em>and <em>Charles Johnson, </em>their heirs and assigns forever, in full satisfaction, &lt;fcc.,and have left them in quiet possession thereof.

If such a paper has crept into that office, it may be taken away at any time; and then even this slender aid to the return will fail.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b89-13\">The opinion of the Court, the action being continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, was delivered at an adjournment of the last March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>by</p>\n<author id=\"b89-14\">Parker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afo_\">This is debt on judgment, and the plea m bar specially sets forth a satisfaction, by alleging an execution issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>upon the judgment, and a levy thereof upon an undivided portion of certain lands descended to the judgment debtor from his father, lying in <em>Windham </em>and <em>Gray, </em>in the county of <em>Cumberland; </em>into possession of which the plaintiffs were put by the sheriff, who re turned the execution satisfied. To this plea there is a demurrer, with several special causes assigned, most of which apply to supposed defects in the plea, in not alleging certain facts necessary to make the levy valid. But as the execution, and the .doings thereon by the officer, are set forth <em>in hcec verba, </em>and are made a part of the plea, and, as- it sufficiently appears that the defects particularly relied upon in the special causes assigned, do not exist, we are to consider whether any substantial defects exist, by reason of which the land levied upon did not pass to the plaintiffs ; for if that should be the case, then the plea is bad, in not showing a satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">And we are all of opinion that the proceedings under the execu tian are so defective, that the plaintiffs did not thereby acquire any title to the land set off, but that the title still remains in the judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The statute of 1783, c. 57, \u00a7 2, requires that the land to be set off shall be described by metes and bounds, and shall be appraised. There is here no description of the land whatever, but only a cer tain undivided portion of the defendant\u2019s inheritance is said to be levied on; and the only way of ascertaining where the land is, is to examine * the inventory of his father\u2019s estate, to which reference is made in the return of the appraisers and of the sheriff, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Whether such inventory contains a true description of the parcels of land belonging to the defendant\u2019s father, does not appear, .as it is not made part of the case. Neither does it appear that the land was ever appraised, or that the appraisers or the sheriff entered upon any of the land, to appraise or to set off the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">It would seem that the sheriff, understanding that the debtor\u2019s father died seised of certain real estate, and that one fourth part of the same had descended to the debtor, had caused that part to be set off to the creditors, to satisfy the debt, without entering upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>any part of the land, or causing the appraisers to enter upon it, that they might make a just estimate of its value. This loose proceeding is not a compliance with the statute, and the title to the estate was not affected by it. The consequence is, that the defendant is the owner of his inheritance, as before, and that the judgment declared on remains in force, unaffected by any thing done under the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>jDefendant\u2019s plea in bar adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\"><em> </em>[In <em>Boylston </em>vs. Carver, (11 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>515,) it was held that a reference in the return of the officer to deeds of the same land on record, for a description, in which deeds there was a sufficient description by metes and bounds, was sufficiently certain. And see <em>Cutting </em>vs. Rockwood, (2 <em>Pick. </em>443,) when returns on several executions of a delivery of seisin \u201c of 5 acres and 100 rods of land, of an average value, lying in common and undivided with <em>Jonathan </em>Bachelor, in the following form, &amp;c., containing 122 acres, and-an equal proportion of the buildings standing thereon; said farm bounded, &amp;c., at the same, dec.,\u201d were held to be good. See Jackson, <em>ex dem. Carman, </em>vs. <em>Roosevelt, </em>13 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. Jackson, <em>ex dem. </em>Livingston, vs. Delancey, 13 <em>Johns.
