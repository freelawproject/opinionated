But instead of having a discharge entered upon the execution, which <em>Ames </em>was about to do, he, at the request of <em>Hammatt, </em>(who stated that he wanted the execution, in order to raise by it out of <em>Jones\u2019s </em>effects one half of the debt,) gave <em>Hammatt </em>a separate receipt, purporting that he had received the sum paid, in full satisfaction of the execution. <em>Hammatt </em>then delivered the execution to Wyman, and directed him to seize and sell the household furniture of James, which was accordingly done by <em>Wyman, </em>the regular steps having been taken to notify the sale; and <em>Hammatt </em>was the purchaser of the articles for which the present action is brought. No return was made by <em>Wyman </em>of this sale upon the execution; no bill of sale was given, nor any delivery of the goods to <em>Hammatt; </em>but the same remained in the possession of <em>Jones, </em>(who acted as clerk at the auction,) and were intermixed, without any distinguishing mark, among other furniture of <em>Jones\u2019s. </em>No receipt was ever given by <em>Hammatt </em>for the purchase, nor any credit in any way passed to <em>Jones. </em>After this, the first-mentioned execution against <em>Jones </em>in favor of <em>Barker, </em>was put into <em>Wyman\u2019s </em>hands, who delivered it to <em>Davenport, </em>the other defendant, by virtue of which the same articles of furniture, being still in <em>Jones\u2019s </em>possession, were seized and sold; and for this taking the present action was brought against the two defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">The judge instructed the jury that, if they were satisfied such was \u2666he meaning and understanding of the parties to the transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>they might consider the payment of the money by <em>Hammatt </em>to <em>Ames </em>as an advance made on account of <em>Jones\u2019s </em>moiety of the judgment, which was not to avail to vacate the execution, as to such moiety, but that as to it <em>Wyman </em>was still to proceed to sell <em>Jones\u2019s </em>gooas in virtue of the execution, it was lawful for <em>Wyman </em>to sell as he did; that the sale was legal, and vested the property in the vendee, although the officer had not made a particular return of the sale; or, if otherwise, that it * did not lie in the mouth of <em>Wyman </em>to impeach his own sale on that ground; that the continued possession of the goods by <em>Jones </em>was evidence of fraud to those only who did not know the real state of the property; and the lending them by <em>Hammatt </em>to <em>Jones, </em>unless they were to be holden at the will of the borrower, was not such a fraudulent act as the creditors of <em>Jones </em>might avail themselves of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the directions of the judge; and a verdict being returned for the plaintiff, the action stood continued to this term, for the consideration of the exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-6\"><em>Mellen </em>and <em>Orr,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apd\">for the defendants, contended that the sale of the goods in question by <em>Wyman, </em>was void for want of authority in him, and as it was a fraud against <em>Barker, </em>the creditor, who after-wards caused them to be regularly seized and sold on his execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">The execution against <em>Hammatt </em>and <em>Jones, </em>under which the first pretended sale was made, was completely paid and satisfied by the payment of the amount of the judgment by the plaintiff to Mr. <em>Arnes, </em>the creditor\u2019s attorney. Nor is it of any importance, in this view of the subject, that the payment was made wholly by one of the judgment debtors ; for a release of one of several joint debtors on a judgment is a release of all; so the escape of one in execution, and satisfaction made by the sheriff, or a discharge by the creditor of one in execution, without satisfaction, shall operate as a release to the other. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-8\">The sale was also void on the ground of fraud, to which the plaintiff was a party. There was neither a consideration paid, nor a delivery made, nor possession taken of any part of the goods At common law, possession, either actual or constructive, is essential to maintain trespass. An imperfect seizure of goods on a <em>fieri facias, </em>which is in full force, with a view of accommodation to the judgment debtor, is a fraud against creditors. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-9\">As to any understanding or agreement between the parties to the transaction, if any such existed, it was not until after the exe cution was satisfied by <em>Hammatt.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJZq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>* <em>Wilde </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWY\">The defendant <em>Wyman\u2019s </em>conduct was grossly fraudulent, as it respected the plaintiff. He refrains from making a proper return of the first execution, on which the plaintiff\u2019s title was to depend; and then procures another execution to be levied on the very goods he had before legally and <em>bond fide </em>sold to the plaintiff. The money paid by the plaintiff to <em>Ames </em>was neither paid, nor received; as a dis charge of the execution; but was advanced expressly and solely on the condition that the plaintiff should still have the benefit of the execution, to enforce upon <em>Jones </em>the payment of his half. This was perfectly legal in one party and the other. The possession of the goods by <em>Jones, </em>after the sale, was perhaps <em>prima facie </em>evidence of fraud; but it was controllable by other evidence, as is all other <em>prima facie </em>evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-6\">The action being continued <em>nisi, </em>the opinion of the Court was delivered in <em>Boston, </em>at an adjournment of the last March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\"> <em>Com.

This objection was overruled at the trial; but, upon consideration, the Court is of opinion that it ought to have prevailed; that the property did not pass to <em>Hammatt, </em>so as to enable him to maintain trespass against the officer; for that a written return by the officer, stating particularly his proceedings, is necessary to vest in any purchaser under an execution, a property in the goods of the debtor. If the sale were otherwise valid, the proper remedy of the purchaser is by an action of the case against the officer, for failing to make his return; but he cannot make title to the goods, without showing, by the return of the execution, that the directions of the law have been observed in the sale, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>But there is another objection, which goes more directly to the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action ; and that is, * that on the payment by <em>Hammatt, </em>a joint debtor in the execution, and liable to pay the whole, the execution was discharged, and the judgment satisfied, notwithstanding an entry of satisfaction was not made upon the execution. <em>Peterson, </em>the creditor, had received all his money : he could not afterwards have legally caused the execution to be levied; nor could he have authorized <em>Hammatt </em>to have it done, he being a party to it, and obliged to pay it. The judgment was satisfied by this payment; and, if a suit had been brought upon it, the receipt given by <em>Ames </em>would have been perfect evidence of payment. The execution was <em>functus officio. Wyman </em>was therefore right in considering the sale to <em>Hammatt </em>as void, and in making no return upon the execution. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The only way attempted to get rid of this difficulty was, to con sider the payment of the money by <em>Hammatt </em>as no payment, with respect to one moiety of the debt, which it was supposed <em>Jones </em>ought to have paid. And the jury were permitted to make that distinction, and upon it found their verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">But there was no room for such distinction. One of the judg ment debtors paid the whole execution, and this gave him a right of action against his fellow-debtor, but did not keep alive the execution for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We are of opinion, also, that the circumstances attending this sale clearly show a trust and confidence between <em>Hammatt </em>and <em>Jones, </em>which would avoid the sale as to any <em>bona fide </em>creditor; and that the verdict, as to this point, is altogether against evidence, there being nothing in the case tending in any degree to abate the violent presumption, arising from the loose nature of the transaction, that the whole was for the benefit of <em>Jones, </em>and that no change of property between him and <em>Hammatt </em>was intended to take place, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The opinion of the Court therefore is, that the verdict be set aside, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"><em> </em>[In <em>Ladd </em>vs. <em>Blunt, </em>(4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>402,) Parsons, C. J., seems to have considered a sale of goods upon execution as valid, even in case the officer should neglect to make any return upon the execution. And in <em>Howe </em>vs. Starkweather, (17 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>243,) <em>Parker. </em>C. J., on the authority of <em>Titcomb </em>vs. <em>The Union Marine Fire Ins. </em>Co., (8 <em>Mass. </em>Rep. 335,) said, \u201c Generally a purchaser of chattels at a sheriff\u2019s sale, having received the goods and paid for them, would have the property, notwithstanding any irregularity of the officer making the sale. Purchases would not be made, and the interests of debtor and creditor would suffer, if sales made by one having lawful authority, and appearing to have exercised it lawfully, should be avoided on account of some irregularity, which could not be known at the time.\u201d But he added, \u201c Even in such cases, however, the return of the officer ought to show a compliance with the law, or the purchaser would be unable to maintain his property.\u201d Why would not as great, or even greater, inconvenience and mischief result from holding all sales to be a nullity, where the officer should neglect to malte a return in due form upon the execution ? In <em>Ingersol </em>vs. Sawyer, <em>(Pick. </em>276,) the Court express a doubt whether, even in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the case of a sale of an equity of redemption, the purchaser might not maintain a title under the sale, even without any return whatever. In <em>Jackson, ex Dem.. Kane, vs. Sternbergh, </em>(1 <em>J. C </em>153,) it is held that the title of the purchaser will not be affected by an incorrect return to a <em>fieri facias. </em>In <em>Farne </em>vs. <em>Hamilton, </em>(1 <em>Bay, </em>10,) it was held that a sale of lands was valid, though no return was made of the execution. And, in <em>Evans </em>vs. <em>Rogers, </em>(2 <em>Nott </em>&amp; M' <em>Cord, </em>563,) it was held that the title need not be evidence by a return. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\"><em> </em>[Vide <em>Reed vs. Pruyn, </em>7 <em>Johns.
