The motion for a directed verdict was properly denied. One who creates or maintains a situation which involves an unreasonable risk of injury to others because of their expectable lawful action is properly regarded as negligent. <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>71 N. H. 427, 431. Since the defendant, for the accommodation of its meter, saw fit to maintain a hole in the floor of the plaintiff\u2019s cellar, it was its duty to exercise reasonable care to protect persons lawfully in the cellar from the danger of falling into the hole. If for this purpose it chose to make use of a protective covering constructed by someone else, it thereby became responsible for structural defects therein which were discoverable by due care, and for the maintenance thereof in a reasonably safe condition. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>82 N. H. 350, 359. There was evidence that for three or four years before the accident the box over the defendant\u2019s meter had been structurally defective by reason of the board across the end which made it impossible to fit the cover into place. Clearly the defendant\u2019s meter-readers who saw the box every three months, were chargeable with knowledge of this defect, and since, according to the evidence, they were specifically charged with the duty of replacing all covers securely, their knowledge of conditions which made this difficult or impossible was the knowledge of the company. 3 Labatt, Master <em>&amp; </em>Servant (2d <em>ed.), s. </em>1052 <em>c. </em>There was also evidence from which it might be found that the cover was not placed squarely over the opening by the defendant\u2019s agent at the time of the last meter-reading, in spite of the meter-reader\u2019s declaration to the contrary. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence negatived the probability that anyone else had touched the cover since his visit, and from her description of the accident, it was a legitimate inference that the cover was not in place at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">That persons rightfully in the cellar might step on the cover was clearly expectable conduct on their part. The location and construction of the box both invited its use in this way. Its location in the floor near the hanging shelf and the gas meter made it a convenient support for anyone to step upon in case added height became desirable to facilitate reaching or inspection. Its substantial construction offered an assurance of safety for this use. The testimony that the plaintiff had at previous times stood upon it in order to get preserves from the shelf and to put money in the gas meter, was evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>its attractiveness and apparent suitability for this purpose.' The evidence that this portion of the cellar was somewhat dimly lighted increased the likelihood of its use to raise the line of vision by anyone desiring to observe closely the gas meter or the contents of the shelf. Herein lies the distinction between this case and <em>Rowan </em>v. <em>Company, </em>79 N. H. 409, upon which the defendant strongly relies. The court there found no evidence to justify a conclusion that the defendant should have anticipated that the plaintiff would stand on the bathtub cover. There is ample evidence of the corresponding fact in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Nor was the plaintiff forced to rely upon the theory of constructive knowledge in order to charge the defendant with an appreciation of the risk that persons visiting the cellar might get into the box if the cover was not properly replaced, for there was evidence of actual appreciation also. The servant of the defendant, who read the meter last before the accident, testified that he was instructed \u201cto be sure and put the covers on tight\u201d and understood that one of the purposes of this order was to make sure that the covers were put in \u201cgood and safe so a person won\u2019t get in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">A conclusion that the defendant was negligent in maintaining the box in an unnecessarily dangerous condition <em>(Caldon </em>v. <em>Company, </em>75 N. H. 532, 533) both by reason of the structural defect therein and the improper management of the cover, was fully justified by evidence of the foregoing facts, and received further confirmation from the testimony that the defendant had in common use at the time of the accident another type of meter box constructed of metal, the installation of which would have obviated all the dangers incident to the use of the box in question. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Company, </em>81 N. H. 421, 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The defendant argues that \u201cas plaintiff was not attempting to stand on the cover, and did not get upon it by mistaking it for the floor, what her rights of recovery, if any, might have been in those or other foreign circumstances is immaterial.\u201d The same idea was expressed in one of defendant\u2019s requested instructions and restated at the oral argument in the contention that the legal cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury was her unexplained loss of balance which the defendant had no reason to anticipate. In <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Railroad, supra, </em>a similar claim was unsuccessfully urged, and the court there pointed out that \u201cthere may have been a cause for the loss of balance which legally and logically was the proximate cause of the injury ... for which the defendants were legally responsible.\u201d The present case involves a corollary of this proposition. Here we have, not an ante<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>cedent cause for the plaintiff\u2019s loss of balance, but a subsequent intervening cause of her injury for which the defendant was responsible, and without which her momentary loss of balance would, in all probability, have been innocuous. If the plaintiff had voluntarily stepped on the cover, and had been injured because it was insecurely placed, the defendant apparently would not deny that the accident was due to the condition of the cover, although the rightfulness of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct might not be conceded. There seems to be no logical reason for concluding that the involuntary nature of her act destroyed this causal connection. Since the defendant was chargeable with knowledge that persons rightfully in the cellar were likely to step upon the cover, the fact that the plaintiff stepped upon it involuntarily was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">2. One of the defendant\u2019s employees, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified that the company had cast iron boxes which it used for the protection of meters, and, subject to exception, he was further permitted to testify that it was the defendant\u2019s custom when it had a \u201cmeter below the ground to put in one of these round boxes made of metal.\u201d The witness subsequently testified that his knowledge of this custom only covered a period of \u201ca little over a year\u201d before the trial, and hence did not extend back to the date of the accident. The witness was later permitted to testify, subject to exception, that \u201cyou could put one of those iron boxes around the meter\u201d in question. The defendant argues that \u201cThis was an inadmissible subsequent conduct admission, and of prejudicial character.\u201d This argument would apparently be valid were it not for the fact that another witness afterward testified that the round meter boxes were in use by the defendant at the time of the accident. This testimony met the objection that their use as described by the previous witness might be regarded as an admission by subsequent change, and cured whatever error there may have been in the rulings of the court above referred to, \u201cupon the general principle, that where testimony is incompetent or inadmissible when received, if, by the introduction of subsequent testimony, it is made competent, the objection is removed.\u201d <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>41 N. H. 479, 481; <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>65 N. H. 107, 110; <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>49 N. H. 553, 584; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Company, </em>44 N. H. 143, <em>145; Lyford v. Thurston, </em>16 N. H. 399, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">3. The testimony that the plaintiff had, upon previous occasions, stood on the meter box to get preserves and to put money in the gas meter, was properly admitted, not for the purpose of charging the defendant with actual knowledge of her conduct, but in order to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the convenience and apparent suitability of the box for this purpose, and the resulting probability that it would be so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">4. The exceptions taken during the argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel are without merit. Referring to one Martin Delaney, the last man who read the defendant\u2019s meter before the accident, counsel remarked, \u201cAnd didn\u2019t we have a chase to get that fellow,\u201d whereupon the defendant claimed an exception. A reading of the record discloses the fact that plaintiff\u2019s counsel had great difficulty in finding out from defendant\u2019s agents the name of this man, and the foregoing comment was not improper. Nevertheless, at the suggestion of the court, the remark was withdrawn, and the court said to the jury, \u201cIt is all out of the case.\u201d Clearly the rights of the defendant were in no way prejudiced by this occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Continuing his argument, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said, \u201cMartin Delaney was finally summoned here, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d and to this statement the defendant claimed an exception. Counsel then said. \u201cI will withdraw the word \u2018summoned.\u2019 He has been in court and testified, Your Honor.\u201d To this the court replied, \u201cAll right.\u201d The court\u2019s remark was tantamount to a ruling that the error, if any, had been corrected, and in any event, the incident was of such a trivial nature that it would be absurd to disturb the verdict on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">5. Equally unavailing is the exception taken by the defendant to the following portion of the charge: \u201cIf you find that the defendant adopted this box and cover for the protection of its meter and failed to exercise a reasonable-degree of care to make it reasonably safe for such rightful, lawful uses which the defendant\u2019s agents ought reasonably to have anticipated, . . . defendant was negligent.\u201d As indicated in the first section of this opinion, the foregoing statement of the law was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">6. Counsel concede that defendant\u2019s request No. 10 \u201camounted to a practical denial of plaintiff\u2019s case,\u201d and for the reasons set forth above, it was properly denied. Defendant\u2019s other exceptions have not been argued, and are understood to have been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
