There was no evidence that the driver of defendant\u2019s truck was negligent. 2. The evidence is conclusive that the plaintiff was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">1. There was evidence from which it might be found that the defendant\u2019s truck was started from a stationary position in a city street and after traveling a distance of 46 feet at a speed of from five to seven miles per hour, ran down the plaintiff who was all the time within the range of the driver\u2019s vision. The indefinite and evasive testimony of the driver would warrant a finding that from the time when the truck started until the moment of the accident, he was looking to the left and that he paid no attention whatever to the right side of the street from which the plaintiff was approaching. Under these circumstances the jury was clearly justified in finding that the driver was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">2. With respect to the question of the plaintiff\u2019s care, this case is governed by the decision in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Souther, </em>83 N. H. 29. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>was evidence that before the plaintiff started to cross the street he looked to the left and saw the defendant\u2019s truck stopped in the highway less than 50 feet distant. He then lifted from the rear end of his own truck onto his left shoulder a bunch of bananas and immediately started to cross the street. The bananas made it impossible for him to look to the left during his progress, and he was struck after he had gone about 7 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">If the possibility that defendant\u2019s truck might start at any moment was one which the plaintiff should have recognized, he might, without \u201cnegligence or imprudence\u201d assume that it would be operated with due care for his safety. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>66 N. H. 200, 203; <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>79 N. H. 529. \u201cThat it looked safe to undertake the crossing in the way he did might be found, and negligence in thus carrying out the undertaking is not conclusively shown.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Souther, supra. </em>We have here in actuality the facts of the supposititious case stated <em>arguendo </em>in <em>Piateck </em>v. <em>Swindell, ante, </em>402 where it was said: \u201cIf the defendant\u2019s car had been stationary, clearly the plaintiff would not have been careless in failing to keep it under observation.\u201d We are still content with this conclusion. There appears to be less reason for holding that the plaintiff was negligent in carrying on his shoulder a load which obstructed his view to the left than there would have been in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Souther, supra, </em>for holding that the deceased was negligent because \u201c he gave no attention to traffic after leaving the sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The distinction between the case at bar and <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>82 N. H. 120, upon which the defendant strongly relies, is that here the plaintiff had positive reason to believe, from observation made immediately before he started to cross the street, that the presence of the defendant\u2019s truck involved no threat of danger to him, whereas in the <em>Olsen </em>case the plaintiff had no reason for believing that the defendant\u2019s tracks would not be occupied at the time when he tried to cross them. \u201cHe was aware that cars were running every few minutes, and reasonable care on his part demanded some precautionary act approximately contemporaneous with the impending danger. He could nob elect to watch only for automobiles and close his eyes to an equally perilous situation.\u201d <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Railroad, supra, </em>122.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The exceptions taken by the defendant to the argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel have not been argued and appear to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-9\">Snow, J. did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
