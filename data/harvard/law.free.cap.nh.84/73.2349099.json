P. L., c. 311, s. 1; <em>Worthen </em>v. <em>Railroad, 71 </em>N. H. 520; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Tuftonborough, </em>72 N. H. 63, 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Under the earlier will, which would be in force if the appeal should be sustained, whatever sum remained in the hands of the trustee after the death of the testator\u2019s son would go to the son\u2019s heirs. <em>Clyde </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>78 N. H. 322; <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>70 N. H. 436; <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Banfield, </em>55 N. H. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u201cA contestant of a will must have some direct legal or equitable interest in the decedent\u2019s estate, in privity with him, whether as heir, purchaser, or beneficiary under another will, which would be destroyed or injuriously affected by the establishment of the contested will.\u201d <em>Braasch </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>191 Ala. 210, 213, 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The suggestion that the appellant\u2019s interest is direct, since the testator\u2019s son by reason of his incapacity must die intestate, is untenable. The interest which a person must possess to enable him to attack the validity of a will is such that if he prevails in the contest he will be entitled to a distributive share in the testator\u2019s estate. <em>Angell </em>v. <em>Groff, </em>42 D. C. (App. Cas.), 198, 201. The contestant does not bring himself within this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u201cUnder statutes generally a proceeding to contest a will can be maintained only by a \u2018person interested\u2019 or by a person \u2018aggrieved\u2019 at the time the will is admitted to probate.\u201d <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>233 Mass. 136, 139. See <em>Storrs </em>v. <em>Hospital, </em>180 Ill. 368. At the time of probate in the present case the testator\u2019s wife was still living. But the appellant is no better off if his interest at the time of contest controls. He is not a beneficiary under the former will, as was the case in <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Sohier, </em>63 N. H. 507. Nor is he one of the testator\u2019s heirs. His status is merely that of heir presumptive to the testator's son, and it is the general rule that during the lifetime of the testator\u2019s heir, one who stands in the relation of heir to him has no interest as such to contest the will. <em>Braasch </em>v. <em>Worthington, supra; Angell </em>v. <em>Groff, supra; Taff </em>v. <em>Hosmer, </em>14 Mich. 249; <em>Cornwell </em>v. <em>Cornwell, </em>11 Hump. (Tenn.), 485, 487; L. R. A. 1918 A 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
