H. 116, defendant\u2019s exceptions must be overruled. The defendant\u2019s answer to the question of the witness, in either of the forms which were findable upon the evidence, clearly imported an admission of excessive speed. It is difficult to see how this admission could, under the circumstances, have been separated from the reference to insurance, but however this may be, it is plain that the trial court was not asked to make the attempt and defendant\u2019s general exceptions are therefore unavailing. <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>Flibotte, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
