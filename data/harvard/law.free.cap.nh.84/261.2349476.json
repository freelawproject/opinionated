Application of sufficient heat to cause severe burns can hardly be deemed to be other than violent. And the happening was accidental. The physician intended to apply a proper amount of heat only. Through his negligence he made an excessive application. This is as much an accident as though he had carelessly dropped a red hot iron upon his patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">It is not even necessary to invoke the rule of construction which has here been applied to fire insurance policies <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>83 N. H. 200), and which is equally applicable to those insuring against accident <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>Corporation, </em>224 N. Y. 18). Upon any rational interpretation of the terms used to describe the risks insured against, the policy covered the plaintiff\u2019s misadventure.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
