No reason is apparent for the adoption of so strained a construction. The language of a will should be literally interpreted unless there is evidence that it was used in a different sense. <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>76 N. H. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The natural import of the clause in question is simply that the trustees shall convert into cash (when it can be done advantageously) the real estate remaining in their hands after the beneficiary\u2019s death instead of applying to the probate court in accordance with the provisions of P. L., c. 309, s. 14, for leave to convey such real estate to the persons entitled thereto under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">This disposes of the first and second grounds of appeal. The third ground presents merely a question of fact which has been decided adversely to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
