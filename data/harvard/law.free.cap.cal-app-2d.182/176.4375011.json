J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-l\">Plaintiff appeals from a judgment denying its prayer for reimbursement of cost of relocating and reconstructing a portion of defendant\u2019s sanitary sewer facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Priority of defendant\u2019s sewer line over plaintiff county\u2019s bridge and Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District\u2019s easement for drainage.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Record</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">The developers of a subdivision in Contra Costa County known as Gregory Gardens constructed in 1950 a sewer line in Grayson Creek and in the fall of that year defendant sanitary district accepted it. In June, 1951, said developers recorded maps of Gregory Gardens Unit Number 5 and Unit Number 7. By these maps Harriet Drive, which crosses Grayson Creek, was offered to the county as a street. The offer was accepted by the board of supervisors and the Harriet Drive Bridge was constructed over the creek and the sanitary district\u2019s sewer. The two units are separated by the center line of Grayson Creek. The 20-foot strip of each unit respectively adjoining said center is marked on the map \u2018 \u2018 drainage reserve. \u2019 \u2019 In 1957 the flood control district planned the deepening of Grayson Creek which necessitated the relocation of the sanitary district\u2019s sewer line at the bridge. At the request of the flood control district, the county relocated the sewer line and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>bridge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cost of the sewer line restoration was $12,023.90. The county brought this action against the sanitary district for reimbursement of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Sanitary District\u2019s Prior Right</p>\n<p id=\"AD7\">Although plaintiff attempts to make a very complicated situation out of the ease, it actually is a very simple one. It is merely a situation in which the sanitary district\u2019s right and easement to use Grayson Creek for its sewer line was prior in time to the rights of the two other public bodies and therefore prior in right. Plaintiff's main contention \u2018 is that because the sanitary district\u2019s right was not of record and the county\u2019s right of way (in accepting roads offered for dedication on a map, the county accepts only a right of way (see Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 905)) appears on the maps, and the maps show strips marked \u2018\u2018 drainage reserve, \u2019 \u2019 these facts give prior rights to the county and the flood control district over the sanitary district\u2019s prior right, of which it is conceded both the county and the flood control district had full knowledge before they acquired whatever rights the maps gave them. As stated above, the situation is a simple one. The developers who owned the land built the sewer. They then transferred the sewer to the sanitary district which accepted it and maintained it thereafter. The fact that apparently no formal easement was granted does not affect the right of the sanitary district to maintain the sewer line as against subsequently acquired rights which, as here, were acquired with knowledge of the existence of the sewer line. (The court so found.) The county\u2019s right of way, and the flood control district\u2019s rights arising from the words \u201cdrainage reserve\u201d on the map, are subject to the right of the sanitary district to maintain its sewer line, because the former\u2019s rights were acquired with knowledge of the sanitary district\u2019s rights and subsequently thereto. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Cella </em>(1953), 122 Cal.App.2d 72 [264 P.2d 98], where the plaintiffs without an easement of record were maintaining a water pipeline across property later purchased by the defendants with knowledge of the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the line. The court held that the defendants therefore took title subject to the plaintiff\u2019s easement by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Section 6518, Health and Safety Code, which plaintiff claims has some application to this case, does not apply. It deals with the requirement that a sanitary district laying its sewers in a public street must restore the street to proper condition, under the supervision of the county engineer or road commissioner, at the cost of the district. Here, the sewer was laid before the area became a street, and now, for the benefit of a flood control district there has to be a change in the location of the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Plaintiff also would apply here cases like <em>Southern Cal. Gas Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>50 Cal.2d 713 [329 P.2d 289], and <em>Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Southern Calif. Edison Co., </em>51 Cal.2d 331 [333 P.2d 1], which hold that where there is a relocation of a highway or flood control structures which necessitates a relocation of public utilities facilities, the cost of such relocation must be borne by the latter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Obviously a sanitary district bears no resemblance to a privately owned public utility. It is a public corporation organized under the provisions of the Sanitary District Act of 1923 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 6400 et seq.) Moreover, the sanitary district\u2019s right to a sewer line in the street is due, first, to the fact that it was there when the county acquired the street, and secondly, to the rights given by section 6518, Health and Safety Code. A privately owned public utility, on the other hand, derives its right to streets under franchises which require it to move its facilities whenever required by the authorities at its own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">As said by the Honorable Wakefield Taylor in his memorandum of decision, the sanitary district\u2019s right to maintain its sewer line \u201cis a species of real property and neither the Flood Control District nor the County Board of Supervisors acting on behalf of said District and for its purposes has any right to appropriate or interfere with property already dedicated to a public use, without legal process and the payment of just compensation. The cost of relocation should not be borne by the taxpayers of the County generally nor by the taxpayers of the Sanitary District, but rather by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the people resident within the Flood Control zone benefited by the improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Tobriner, J., and Duniway, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 19, 1960, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 24, 1960. Peters, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-5\">At oral argument the county\u2019s counsel frankly admitted that one of the reasons for the county relocating the sewer line which admittedly was done for the flood control district\u2019s benefit alone (and the court so found) was that it was believed that if the flood control district did the work, section 63-5, subdivision 13, West\u2019s Water Code\u2014Appendix, would bar it from seeking reimbursement from the sanitary district, but that the county could.require reimbursement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Section 680, Streets and Highways Code, requires that a franchise holder must at its own expense relocate its facilities which are in a state\u2019s highway, when necessary for the improvement of such highway. There is no such requirement as to facilities of governmental bodies such as districts, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
