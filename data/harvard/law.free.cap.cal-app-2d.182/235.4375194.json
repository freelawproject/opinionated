The complaint was filed in 1950. On December 12,1958, notice of overruling of respondent\u2019s demurrer to the complaint was served upon her then attorney, who obtained an order extending her time to answer to January 12, 1959. On a date not disclosed by the record, but between January 12 and February 9, 1959, respondent\u2019s default was entered. Judgment upon the default was entered only against respondent on February 9, and respondent\u2019s motion to vacate the default was filed February 16, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Affidavits in support of respondent\u2019s motion were filed by her former attorney of record in this case, Mr. Moses, and by her present attorney, Mr. Hoogs. Both emphasize the number and complexity of the proceedings between the parties hereto. Mr. Hoogs avers that he had become so \u2018 \u2018 confused and confounded\u201d by the many cases and the variety of procedural steps taken in each that he found it \u201cextremely difficult to keep an accurate\u201d calendar of the time required for each act to be done in behalf of his client. Mr. Moses also states that the death of a relative on January 12, 1959, left him \u201cpersonally upset and preoccupied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The litigious history of appellant\u2019s disputes with his former wife (see <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, </em>178 Cal.App.2d 140 [2 Cal.Rptr. 716] and <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, </em>180 Cal.App.2d 44 [4 Cal.Rptr. 693] for a brief summary of a portion of this litigation) lends weight to the view that the confusion of the two attorneys was not unreasonable. Neglect of an attorney in less complex circumstances has been held excusable <em>(Shively </em>v. <em>Kochman, </em>23 Cal.App.2d 420 [73 P.2d 637]) and pressure of legal business accumulated because of concern over the illness of a son has been similarly recognized <em>(Stub </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>35 Cal.App.2d 685 [96 P.2d 979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">An order setting aside a default is viewed with favor on appeal and will be reversed only when \u201cit clearly appears that there has been a plain abuse of discretion\u201d <em>(Hover </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>122 Cal.App.2d 852, 856 [266 P.2d 60]; <em>Andres </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>168 Cal.App.2d 344 [335 P.2d 1005]).  All presumptions favor such an order, and the burden is on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>appellant to show an abuse of discretion <em>(Stub </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In light of these rules, and in view of respondent\u2019s promptness in moving to set aside her default, we conclude that no abuse of discretion by the trial court has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Kaufman, P. J., and Stone, J. pro tern.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 28, 1960.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-15\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
