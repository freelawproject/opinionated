Said motion was denied on the ground that it was premature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">(6) That on November 13 an amendment to the information charging three prior felony convictions was filed and the cause was then advanced one day for trial to November 16, and again the defendant moved for a dismissal on the ground that he had not been brought to trial within the 60-day limit, which was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-12\">(7) That on November 16 and prior to the impanelment of the jury defendant again moved to dismiss upon the same ground as heretofore mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-13\">(8) That on November 17, outside the presence of the jury, defendant interposed a motion for dismissal upon the same grounds, which motion the court denied, and thereupon the trial continued, which resulted in the jury finding the defendant guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">It is apparent from the foregoing that between the date of the filing of the information on September 8, 1959, and the commencement of the trial on November 16, 1959, 69 days elapsed, which in the absence of any showing for the delay beyond the 60-day period would bring into play the provisions of section 1382 of the Penal Code. However, 16 days of the total of 69 days were requested by the defendant and must be deducted therefrom, leaving a balance of 53 days, a time well within the 60-day limit and in full compliance with the statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinelli </em>(1953), 118 Cal.App.2d 94, 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>[257 P.2d 37]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Peter </em>(1912), 20 Cal.App. 151 [128 P. 415].)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Kaufman, P.
