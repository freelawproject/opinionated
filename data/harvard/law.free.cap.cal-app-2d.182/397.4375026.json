That is the principal question presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Respondent Watkins was convicted of three counts of violation of the Corporate Securities Act (Corp. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 26104, subd. (d), 26104, subd. (f). One conviction was by jury verdict, and two by plea. Appellant Real Estate Commissioner then filed an accusation against Watkins, asserting nine grounds of disciplinary action. Only those based upon the three convictions, without assertion of moral turpitude, are here material. Records of the three judgments were presented to the hearing officer, without any evidence to indicate whether the crimes involved moral turpitude. That officer found against Watkins on each ground of the accusation, and recommended revocation of this license on each ground separately. The commissioner adopted this recommendation and ordered revocation. Watkins brought this proceeding in mandamus, and the trial court directed that the commissioner\u2019s order be vacated and the matter remanded for further administrative proceedings. The commissioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Section 10177 of the Business and Professions Code provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">\u201cThe commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of any real estate licensee who has done any of the following: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">\u201c(b) Entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, or been found guilty of, or been convicted of, a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Violation of the Corporate Securities Act does not necessarily involve moral turpitude <em>(In re Hatch, </em>10 Cal.2d 147 [73 P.2d 885]). Thus the issue is whether the phrase \u201cinvolving moral turpitude\u201d modifies only the words \u201ca crime,\u201d or applies to the entire phrase \u201cfelony or a crime.\u201d Since the parties do not question that the crimes here are felonies, the only problem before us is whether guilt of any felony, irrespective of moral turpitude, is a ground for revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tion of a real estate license. This precise question has not been determined, although analogous statutes have been construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u201cThe conviction of a felony, or of any offense involving moral turpitude\u201d was ground for revocation of the license of a doctor (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2383, before 1957 amendment). Under that statute it was held that \u201cthe conviction of a felony, in and of itself, without any qualifications, constitutes unprofessional conduct\u201d <em>(Furnish </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>149 Cal.App.2d 326, 330 [308 P.2d 924, 309 P.2d 493]).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">On the other hand, the phrase \u201cconviction of a felony or misdemeanor, involving moral turpitude\u201d which is a ground for disbarment of an attorney (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6101) has been held to require a showing of moral turpitude whether the conviction is of a felony or a misdemeanor <em>(In re Rothrock, </em>16 Cal.2d 449 [106 P.2d 907, 131 A.L.R. 226]; <em>In re Hallinan, </em>43 Cal.2d 243 [272 P.2d 768]). It should be noted, however, that a cognate section of the State Bar Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6102), as it read when those cases were decided, related to suspension pending final judgment and referred only to \u201cconviction of an attorney of a crime involving moral turpitude. \u2019 \u2019 As amended in 1955, section 6102 more strongly emphasizes the requirement of turpitude. This lends strength to the view that the Legislature intended any crime, whether felony or not, to be a ground for disbarment only if it involves moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We consider the language of the code section applicable to doctors more nearly comparable to the phraseology we are considering than the code provision concerning attorneys. This view is somewhat strengthened by the history of section 10177. As adopted in 1943, it provided for revocation of a real estate license if the licensee had \u201c[b]een convicted of a felony\u201d (Stats. 1943, ch. 127, p. 842). The 1949 amendment, in addition to a substantial recasting of the section, added the words \u201cor a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d Had the intention been to modify the word \u201cfelony,\u201d more apt language could have been chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> A general rule of statutory construction is that \u201cmodifying phrases are to he applied to the words immediately preceding them and are not to be construed as extending to more remote phrases\u201d <em>(City of Santa Barbara </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>25 Cal.App.2d 325, 327 [77 P.2d 306], and cases there cited). Of course, this rule is subject to the exception that \u201cWhen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be applicable to all\u201d <em>(Porto Rico Ry. etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Mor, </em>253 U.S. 345 [40 S.Ct. 516, 64 L.Ed. 944], as quoted in <em>Wholesale Tobacco Dealers Bureau </em>v. <em>National etc. Co., </em>11 Cal.2d 634, 659 [82 P.2d 3, 118 A.L.R. 486]). Here, however, the latter rule does not appear applicable. \u201cCrime\u201d is a general term, including misdemeanors as well as felonies (Pen. Code, \u00a7 16).  If \u201cinvolving moral turpitude\u201d is held to modify \u201ca felony\u201d as well as \u201ca crime,\u201d the word felony in section 10177, subdivision (b), becomes wholly redundant.  A cardinal rule of construction is that every word in a statute is presumably intended to have some meaning and that a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided (45 Cal.Jur.2d 627).  In the light of this rule, as well as the statutory history of the section which made conviction of \u201ca felony\u201d ground for discipline for six years before the words \u201cor a crime involving moral turpitude\u201d were added, we conclude that guilt of a felony is ground for revocation, whether or not the felony involves moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Thus the revocation is justified on each of the three counts based upon respondent\u2019s guilt of felonies. The commissioner\u2019s order was based upon each of nine counts, separately and severally. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to consider the remaining charges, as those we have discussed fully support the order of revocation <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>166 Cal.App.2d 783, 788 [333 P.2d 771]).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Judgment reversed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Kaufman, P.
