She was injured while walking down a common stairway leading from the third to the second story of the building. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and the case is here on an exception to the refusal of the judge to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">On all the evidence it could not rightly have been ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care, and the defendant now makes no contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to the contrary. It contends that the evidence did not warrant a finding that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">It also contends that certain testimony of one Michaud, who was summoned by the defendant but was called as a witness for the plaintiff after both parties had rested at the trial, cannot here be considered as affirmative evidence on the issue of negligence of the defendant. The witness had varnished the stairway one or two months before the plaintiff\u2019s accident and testified as to the condition, at that time, of brass nosings on the edges of the stair treads and of the screws by which they were attached. The record states that he was \u201cCalled by the plaintiff in rebuttal\u201d of the testimony of a witness named Hyams who apparently had been called by the defendant. The record does not show that the defendant\u2019s present contention was made at the trial or what testimony was given by the witness Hyams. If we assume that the contention is now open to the defendant and that the testimony of Michaud went beyond mere rebuttal of testimony given by Hyams and corroborated testimony introduced by the plaintiff before she rested her case, the contention cannot be sustained. The trial judge in his discretion could properly admit, after the defendant had rested, testimony supporting the plaintiff\u2019s contentions which might have been introduced in the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief. <em>Young </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>273 Mass. 567, 572. <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Canning, </em>180 Mass. 461, 464. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>109 Mass. 57. <em>Chadbourn </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>5 Gray, 312, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The defendant\u2019s janitor, who had charge of the stairway in question, was called as a witness by the defendant and was examined as to the condition, soon after the plaintiff was injured, of the stairway and the place where she fell. After the defendant had rested, the plaintiff introduced a written statement signed by the janitor and testimony of oral statements made by him as to the condition of the stairway, contradictory of evidence given by him as a witness. The record indicates that the contradictory evidence was properly limited to the impeachment of his testimony at the trial. <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>Brockton Public Market, Inc. </em>257 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Mass. 6, 11. Since this evidence was limited at the trial to impeachment of the testimony of the janitor, we do not consider it in our decision of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">The plaintiff had come down a flight of eight stairs leading from the third floor to a landing and was at the edge of the landing and about to go down a second flight of eight stairs leading to the second floor when the toe of her shoe was caught by a portion of a brass binding or nosing on the edge of the landing which was \u201csticking up.\u201d She endeavored to grasp a banister at her right but failed to do so and fell to the second floor. There was evidence that there was a rubber mat on the landing which was held in place by the nosing. A witness, who examined the place of the plaintiff\u2019s fall soon after its occurrence, described the appearance of the nosing at that spot in words and by illustration. She testified that the nosing was about an inch wide and fastened to the landing with screws, and that, at a point about six inches from one end, the nosing was \u201craised up so that she could lay her fingers under it,\u201d and illustrated \u201chow she put her fingers under it, as it was then standing up.\u201d She also testified that the projecting part of the nosing was near a \u201cscrew which was loose and not down tight; that the screw wasn\u2019t loose so that you could see it,\u201d but \u201cthat, when her fingers went under it, the screw would move; that it wiggled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">There was evidence that on all the stair treads and landings constituting the stairway there were rubber mats which were not tacked down but were kept in place by brass nosings screwed down at the edges of the stair treads and landings. The witness Michaud, earlier herein referred to, testified as to the condition of the screws by which the brass nosings were fastened when he worked on the stairway a month or two before. He then saw that the screws in the nosings had been there for some time and that \u201cSome would come up a little, but not much; sometimes when I was walking on it, it would spring.\u201d He was then asked the question: \u201cYou indicate the brass screws would spring?\u201d and answered: \u201cWould come out; we put in new ones where they were slipping.\u201d He also testified that he tight<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ened up the screws; that some of the screws were \u201cno good\u201d and new screws were put in their places; that, after the stairs were varnished, the screws were tightened up; and that he did not know how many he tightened, it was hard to tell, he thought it might be a dozen.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">The defendant\u2019s janitor, who had held that position for over a year and a half before the plaintiff\u2019s injury and \u201chad charge of the hallways\u201d in the building and was \u201cin and out of the building at all times,\u201d was called as a witness by the defendant and testified that shortly after the accident he examined the place where the plaintiff fell and did not find the nosing on the edge of the landing loose or any screw sticking up. On cross-examination he testified that screws in the nosings got loose from time to titile because of people walking over the stairs and \u201cthen he would tighten them down,\u201d and that he did not tighten the same screws every time; if he saw a screw loose he would tighten it. He would put a new screw in a nosing if there was a screw lost and this he did three or four times a year. He also testified that he \u201ccould tell when the screws were working up slack when he was mopping the stairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">A substantial projection of a portion of a brass nosing at the edge of a stair tread or landing is manifestly a potential source of danger to persons descending a stairway. See <em>Marquis </em>v. <em>John Nesmith Real Estate Co. </em>300 Mass. 203; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>South End Amusement Co. </em>299 Mass. 317; <em>Loudon </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>277 Mass. 33; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>219 Mass. 103. Such a condition existed at the edge of the landing at the place and time of the plaintiff\u2019s fall. It could be found to have been the result of a loose screw in the brass nosing. The condition which caused the plaintiff\u2019s fall was not in existence at the time the plaintiff became a tenant. Therefore the defendant owed the plaintiff an obligation with respect to that condition of danger when it later appeared in an area used in common which remained in its control. Its duty was to use reasonable care to discover and remedy such condition. <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Cushner, </em>300 Mass. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>A landlord\u2019s knowledge or lack of knowledge of a defect, appearing after a letting, on portions of his premises used in common and remaining within his control and his opportunity or lack of opportunity to acquire such knowledge are elements to be considered in determining whether or not he used reasonable care in the discovery of such later appearing defects. In the present case the defendant corporation had put an agent, its janitor, in \u201ccharge of\u201d the stairway. His knowledge or opportunity for knowledge of a defective condition on the stairway must be taken to be the knowledge and opportunity for knowledge of the defendant. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>152 Mass. 45, 48. <em>Jamrog </em>v. <em>H. L. Handy Co. </em>284 Mass. 195, 199-200. <em>Sarna </em>v. <em>American Bosch Magneto Corp. </em>290 Mass. 340, 343. <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>J. J. Newberry Co. </em>297 Mass. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">There was evidence warranting a finding not only that the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s fall was .a loose screw in the nosing at the edge of the landing but also that throughout the stairway generally the screws had a tendency to become loose. They would become loose merely from people walking over the stairway; from time to time it was necessary to tighten screws; some screws became useless and had to be replaced by new ones. It was not difficult to determine when screws were getting loose: the janitor could tell by observation when the screws were \u201cworking up slack.\u201d In view of conditions, known to the janitor, existing generally throughout the stairway, and the likelihood that a dangerous condition might come into existence at the edge of any stair tread or landing, we think there was evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant did not use reasonable care to discover and remedy the dangerous condition at the edge of the landing which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
