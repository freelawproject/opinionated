L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 113, and G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10), to reach and apply the obligation of the defendant Massachusetts Bonding and Insurance Company as the insurer of the defendant Brasor under a compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance policy to the payment of a judgment recovered by the plaintiff against one Tannyhill.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The demurrer was rightly sustained. It appears from the bill itself that the liability which resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s judgment against Tannyhill was not of the kind which is covered by a compulsory policy. It was not \u201cfor bodily injuries\u201d to the plaintiff or for \u201cconsequential damages consisting of expenses incurred by a husband, wife, parent or guardian for medical, nursing, hospital or surgical services in connection with or on account of such bodily injuries,\u201d as provided in the compulsory policy. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A. The judgment was rendered against Tannyhill as the servant of the plaintiff for sums which the plaintiff had been compelled to pay to persons who had been injured by Tannyhill\u2019s negligence while driving Eraser\u2019s insured automobile in the course of his employment by the plaintiff. To hold that a claim against an agent to recover the money loss caused by his inefficiency is a claim for personal injury would stretch the words of the statute and of the policy beyond reason and beyond the purpose of the compulsory insurance law, especially in view of the careful definition in the statute itself of the type of consequential damages recoverable under the policy by persons not themselves suffering bodily injury. <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>284 Mass. 231, 236. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>273 Mass. 146, 154. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>288 Mass. 532.
