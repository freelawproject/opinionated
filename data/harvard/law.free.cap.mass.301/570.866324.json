At its Brockton station the defendant maintained a covered passageway with a floor made of \"a cement material having a trade name \u2018terrazzo.\u2019 \u201d In rainy weather the roof leaked and the floor became wet. The floor had settled in places, but one could hardly notice that unless there was water on the floor. On May 3, 1933, when the floor was wet, although the plaintiff did not feel any water under her feet, she \u201cfell into \u2018a lot of water,\u2019\u201d about a quarter of an inch deep.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Evidence that the floor was wet did not of itself warrant a finding that it was dangerously slippery. Evidence that the plaintiff fell while walking along the wet passageway did not of itself warrant a finding that her fall was caused by slipping or by the wetness of the floor. The evidence falls short of showing that a condition of the floor negligently allowed to exist bore a causal relation to the injury. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Director General of Railroads, </em>245 Mass. 158, 162.
