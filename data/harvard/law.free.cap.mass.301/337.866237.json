By the second count of the declaration the plaintiff sought to recover compensation for personal injuries. The case was tried to a jury on an auditor\u2019s report and other evidence. On motion of the defendant a verdict for him on the second count was directed and the plaintiff excepted. The direction of a verdict was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">There was evidence that the defendant backed the automobile which he was operating against the front of a motor truck which the plaintiff was operating. The bill of exceptions recites that \u201cin substance the auditor found that the defendant was negligent and the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and that as a result the plaintiff\u2019s car was disabled from proceeding because the front bumper was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>wedged against the left front wheel. The plaintiff got out and pulled the bumper away and as a result a preexisting hernia on the left side was aggravated and the plaintiff sustained a new hernia on the right side. The auditor then made an alternative finding as follows: (relating to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries) \u2018If, as a matter of law, this is a causal connection with the accident, then the plaintiff, Ferris, is entitled to recover for his pain, suffering, loss of earning capacity, and necessary hospital and medical expense, the sum of $800, and if not a causal connection that so far as personal injuries are concerned, finding is for the defendant.\u2019\u201d The defendant makes no contention that findings were not warranted that he was negligent and that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. The defendant contends, however, that the evidence did not warrant a finding that his negligence was the legal cause of any physical injury sustained by the plaintiff. This contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The plaintiff testified in part that \u201cwhen the defendant struck his car, the wheel (steering wheel) hit him and he went back and hit his back. \u2018He felt something crack on his left side, sharp just like cut with a knife and he doubled up.\u2019 After the defendant drove away the plaintiff started his motor but found he could not drive his car because the bumper was striking the left front wheel. He then got out of his car; he still had pains. He took the bumper and pulled it up and back from the wheel. He felt a worse pain on the left side when he pulled the bumper away. He then drove home.\u201d A physician testified that he examined the plaintiff on July 9, 1936, and found both a right and a left inguinal hernia, that \u201cin addition he found tenderness over the lumbar spine from the second to the fourth vertebrae and over the right sacra-iliac region,\u201d and that his diagnosis was \u201csprain of lumbar spine, right indirect inguinal hernia and left indirect inguinal hernia.\u201d Another physician testified that he examined the plaintiff in September and diagnosed \u201cthe condition as bilateral hernia,\u201d and \u201cperformed an operation to correct these herniae.\u201d He further testified \u201cthat the collision itself was not an ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>quote cause for the hernia but the pulling and lifting of the bumper was an adequate cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The testimony of the plaintiff to his having been hit by the steering wheel and having hit his back, and to the pain which he then suffered, together with \u2022 the medical testimony, warranted, at least, findings that at the time of the collision he sustained an injury to his back, and that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the legal cause thereof. See <em>Berard </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany </em>Railroad, 177 Mass. 179,180-181; <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Gaffey, </em>207 Mass. 102, 105-107; <em>Coddaire </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>270 Mass. 41, 47; <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, </em>299 Mass. 246, 249. Neither the plaintiff\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that he \u201cfelt a worse pain on the left side when he pulled the bumper away,\u201d nor any other evidence in the case, even if it tended to show aggravation of the injury to his back by his act of pulling the bumper away, precluded a finding that some injury to his back resulted from the collision and, consequently, from the defendant\u2019s negligence, without a break in the causal connection between such negligence and such injury. It could have been found that, notwithstanding the intervening act of the plaintiff, the defendant\u2019s negligence continued \u201cto be efficiently, actively, and potently operative\u201d to produce such injury <em>(Wallace </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>292 Mass. 251, 255), and that this intervening act was \u201ca normal response to the stimulus of a situation created by the actor\u2019s negligent conduct.\u201d Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 443, see Comments (a) (b). And it could not have been ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff\u2019s intervening act amounted to negligence contributing to cause such injury. A verdict for the plaintiff in some amount, therefore, was justified, and consequently the direction of a verdict for the defendant was error. See <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>D. A. Schulte, Inc. </em>275 Mass. 379, 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In view of the conclusion stated we need not consider whether the negligence of the defendant could have been found to have been a legal cause of aggravation \u2014 by the plaintiff\u2019s act of pulling the bumper away \u2014 of the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s back, or whether damages properly could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>be recovered by the plaintiff only for the original injury, considered apart from such aggravation thereof. No such question is involved in the direction of the verdict or raised by any request for a specific ruling. See <em>Coddaire </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>270 Mass. 41, 47. For a like reason we need not consider whether it could have been found that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a legal cause of either or both of the plaintiff\u2019s hernias, or of aggravation thereof, so that the plaintiff could recover damages therefor. These questions may not arise in the same form at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
