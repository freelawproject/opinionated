The declaration is in two counts, the first alleging gross negligence, and the second negligence. The case was tried before a judge of a district court, who found for the plaintiff upon the first count and reported the case to the Appellate Division for the Northern District. It now comes before us on an appeal from an order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report. The only question for determination is whether the judge erred in refusing to give the defendant\u2019s request for a ruling that \"The evidence does not warrant a finding that the defendant at the time of the accident was grossly negligent in the operation of her automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff would warrant the finding of the following facts: On September 19, 1935, the plaintiff was riding as a guest in an automobile operated by the defendant but owned by the latter\u2019s mother. The plaintiff was seated on the rear seat of the vehicle; the defendant and her husband were seated on the front seat. The weather was fair, and the road was dry. The defendant was driving the vehicle in. a westerly direction on Montwaite Avenue in Framingham, at a speed of forty to forty-five miles an hour. The vehicle approached the intersection of that avenue and Franklin Street, which runs approximately north and south. Although familiar with this intersection the defendant continued at undiminished speed. When the vehicle operated by the defendant was about a car\u2019s length from the intersection, the plaintiff observed an automobile driven by one Aubey about to enter the intersection from the right at a speed of about eight miles an hour. The plaintiff cried, \u201cMy God, look ouL\u201d The defendant did not look to the right but entered the intersection at the rate oT speed already described. ~WKen \"at about the center of the intersecting ways, the defendant looked to the right and saw Aubey\u2019s vehicle in which he was driving with his wife and \u201chis little grandchild.\u201d Although intending to cross the intersection and go down Franklin Street, Aubey, fearing that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s car would hit him\u201d turned to the right down Montwaite Avenue leaving the path to the left clear for the \u201cdefendant\u2019s car.\u201d The defendant, however, continued to look to the right at Aubey\u2019s vehicle but swung the automobile operated by her to the left, without looking in that direction; it was heading directly for a tree \u201cat or near the southwesterly corner of the intersection,\u201d and the plaintiff \u201cscreamed.\u201d The defendant then looked to the left, but at that time \u201cher car was almost upon the tree.\u201d Its speed increased, it struck the tree and the plaintiff was injured. Immediately after the accident the defendant said to Aubey\u2019s wife, \u201cThank God I didn\u2019t hit you or that dear baby, I don\u2019t remember what happened, I stepped on them [the brakes] but I guess . . . [they] didn\u2019t hold.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Later she stated to the plaintiff that she \"was . . . afraid . . . [she] would hit the child\u201d and that she \u201cthought . . . [she] put . . . [her] foot on the brake but it must have been on the gas.\u201d In her testimony the defendant admitted that she did not materially diminish the speed of the vehicle on entering the intersection, and did not look to the right until almost at its center; that when she saw Aubey\u2019s automobile she did steer to the left without looking in that direction because she could not take her eyes off the child in Aubey\u2019s automobile; that when she did look to the left the automobile she was operating was about two feet from the tree; and that it struck the tree with great force. The subsidiary findings of the trial judge establish substantially the facts just related. They have not been controverted by the defendant. The judge further found that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and that the defendant was guilty of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">From the evidence and subsidiary facts found by the judge it therefore appears that the defendant was operating the vehicle and entered the intersection at an excessive rate of speed without looking to the right of the intersection (see G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 90, \u00a7 17), and that, although warned by the cry of the plaintiff just before entering the intersection, she continued to operate at an undiminished rate of speed. The juHglTwas not bound to find that the defendant\u2019s stated inability to \"take her eyes off the child\u201d in Aubey\u2019s automobile was \u201calmost instinctive.\u201d Compare <em>Folan </em>v. <em>Price, </em>293 Mass. 76, 78. When the situation fraught with danger became apparent to her she increased instead of diminishing the speed of her vehicle and diverted her attention from the road in the direction in which she had turned the vehicle. See <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>289 Mass. 577. She has argued that, in the circumstances surrounding the accident, her inattention to the road in the direction in which she had turned the vehicle was but momentary, and that the facts in the present case are distinguishable from those in such cases as <em>Picarello </em>v. <em>Rodakis, </em>299 Mass. 33, and <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>284 Mass. 205. While it could have been found that but a short space of time did elapse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>between the time when the defendant looked to the right at Aubey\u2019s vehicle and the occurrence of the accident, that is but a single element, and must be considered together with all the surrounding circumstances in determining whether the conduct of the defendant constituted gross negligence. See <em>Quinlivan </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>298 Mass. 138, 140. The judge could have found that in driving into the intersection at an excessive rate of sneed without looking to the right, and in consequence failing to observe that Aubey\u2019s vehicle had already entered the intersection; in failing to heed the warning cry of the plaintiff and to diminish the speed of tne vehicle; and in turning the vehicle to the left at a still greater rate of speed-without looking in that direction, the defendant was guilty of heedless and palpable violation of the legal duty owed by her to the plaintiff. See <em>Altman </em>v. Aronson., 231 Mass. 588; <em>Meeney </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>276 Mass. 218; <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>275 Mass. 149. We are of opinion that in all the circumstances it cannot be said as a matter of law that the judge was not warranted in finding gross negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">On the thirtieth day of June, 1938, the Honorable Fred Tarbell Field was appointed Chief Justice of this court, having held the office of Associate Justice since the thirtieth day of January, 1929.
