There was a finding for the defendant and a report to the Appellate Division. Thereafter the defendant made a motion that the report be dismissed for failure to prosecute it in accordance with the rules of the court. The plaintiff made motions for an extension of time for filing his brief and for \u201can extension of time for filing copies of the final report and other necessary papers to the appeal of said case.\u201d See Rule 28 and Rule 31 of the Rules of the District Courts (1932). The Appellate Division denied the defendant\u2019s motion and allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motions, and filed a decision: \u201cPrejudicial error found, new trial ordered.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The defendant claimed an appeal from the denial of its motion, the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s motions and the decision of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">The appeal must be dismissed. It is here prematurely. The orders and decision of the Appellate Division were all interlocutory. There has been no \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Appellate Division, from which alone an appeal to this court lies. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 109. <em>Real Property Co.
