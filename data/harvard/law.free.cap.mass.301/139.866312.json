The parties stipulated that the court might determine their rights up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to the date of the decision as if the writ were issued on that day. The decisive question is whether the evidence was adequate to support findings of disability within the terms of the two policies, continuing to the date of the decision in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">The first policy provides indemnity \u201cif the insured as the result of injury or disease is permanently unable to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation of financial value.\u201d The disability provisions of the second policy become operative \u201cif the insured is and will be wholly and presumably permanently unable to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation of financial value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We do not discuss the effect of the auditor\u2019s report, although his findings were generally favorable to the plaintiff, as the evidence at the trial apart from the auditor\u2019s report was ample to support the judge\u2019s finding as to both policies. There was evidence that the plaintiff was suffering from \u201ccoronary sclerosis,\u201d which \u201cdoes not get better, once it is established\u201d; that he was \u201ctotally disabled from performing any work whatsoever, physical or mental\u201d; that he could not work without risk, as any excitement or effort might precipitate an attack, and \u201cwe never know which attack is going to be fatal\u201d; and that his condition was permanent with no prospect of recovery. This evidence is not as matter of law overcome by further proof that the plaintiff, tiring of \u201cbeing put on the shelf,\u201d against medical advice and as an experiment, took the risk for a time of doing \u201cvery light work in the office,\u201d avoiding \u201call mental or physical emotion,\u201d and continuing under treatment; that the test \u201cproved the opposite of beneficial\u201d; that within the first week the plaintiff \u201chad three spells\u201d and at the end of a month was \u201cin terrible shape\u201d; that \u201cwe have found he is unable to do even the lightest of his tasks\u201d; that the plaintiff was in his office \u201can hour or two a day, and only perhaps a few days out of the week\u201d; that \u201call he did when he was there was to occasionally accept payment from a customer\u201d; and that he frequently took tablets which had been prescribed for him to use when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>he had an \u201cattack.\u201d The question was still one of fact. It was for the judge to say whether the plaintiff really atf any time did do or could do work for which he could obtainu \u201ccompensation\u201d of \u201cfinancial value,\u201d and if he did or could whether such work involved excessive risk to life or health. In a number of recent decisions this court has construed language similar to that used in the policies here involved, and it is unnecessary to repeat what has been said in those cases. <em>Rezendes </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>285 Mass. 505. <em>Treblas </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>291 Mass. 138. <em>Adamaitis </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>295 Mass. 215, 219. <em>Boss </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>296 Mass. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The defendant lays stress upon the facts that the plaintiff did not testify at the trial before the judge, which took place in May, 1937, and that there was no direct evidence as to his condition or as to what he was doing since the previous December. There was, however, some evidence that the plaintiff was in California at the time of the trial, and there was no requirement of law that he should attend in person. The evidence already outlined as to the permanent nature of his ailment was sufficient to support a finding that he had not ceased to be incapacitated up to the date of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">If, as the defendant further contends, the specific findings of the judge are, taken by themselves alone, in any respect inadequate to permit recovery as to both policies, his general finding for the plaintiff implies such permissible specific findings as may be necessary to support it. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>290 Mass. 388, 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendant\u2019s requests for rulings need not be discussed in separate detail. We find no error in the rulings with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
