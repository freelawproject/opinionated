Each drove a truck apparently owned by Buckles, delivering milk to customers. On that day, after delivering his load of milk, the plaintiff parked the truck which he operated in front of a restaurant, and went in to have dinner. The defendant came in, and asked the plaintiff to help on the defendant\u2019s route, because snow on the ground had delayed the defendant in his work. The plaintiff went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>with the defendant on the truck which the latter was operating, and helped deliver the load. On the return journey to the restaurant, where the plaintiff had left his truck, the plaintiff was hurt in a collision which could have been found to result from negligence of the defendant in the operation of the truck in which the plaintiff was riding. The plaintiff testified that his day\u2019s work was not completed until he had returned his truck to the garage of the common employer, Buckles.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Buckles testified without contradiction that on the day in question he was insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, and that the plaintiff had given no notice under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 24, preserving his common law rights. He testified in substance that the operator of one truck had authority to obtain assistance from the operator of another truck who had finished his route, and that the latter had authority to give such assistance. On cross-examination he testified exactly to the contrary; but he was not asked to make a definite choice between his contradictory statements. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 405. Therefore the jury could accept either as the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The judge directed a verdict for the defendant on each count. One count was for gross negligence, and that was waived. Another count was for a violation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 89, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, and no recovery can be had upon that count. <em>Pittsley </em>v. <em>David, </em>298 Mass. 552. But the first count was for ordinary negligence, and the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions raise the question whether the verdict was properly directed as to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">There was evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s injury did not arise \u201cout of and in the course of his employment,\u201d nor \u201cout of an ordinary risk of the street while actually engaged, with his employer\u2019s authorization, in the business affairs or undertakings of his employer.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26. <em>Higgins\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 345. It could have been found that the plaintiff departed from the course of his employment to do an act unauthorized and even positively forbidden. <em>Borin\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 452. <em>Koza\u2019s Case, </em>236 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Mass. 342. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>264 Mass. 557. <em>Coulombe </em>v. <em>Horne Coal Co. </em>275 Mass. 226. <em>Horton\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 572. <em>Eifler\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 1. <em>Roberts\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 316. <em>McManus\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass. 65. <em>Lazarz\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 538. <em>Ferreira\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 405, 406. <em>Maguskas\u2019s Case, </em>298 Mass. 80. <em>Wozniak\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 471. Upon such a finding the injury would not be compensable under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, and the cases of <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Barre, </em>286 Mass. 593, and <em>Caira </em>v. <em>Caira, </em>296 Mass. 448, would not stand in the way of a recovery in tort. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc., </em>300 Mass. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The evidence warranted a finding that the plaintiff was riding on the defendant\u2019s truck for the benefit of the defendant, and consequently was entitled to have the defendant exercise the full measure of reasonable care for his safety. <em>Lyttle </em>v. <em>Monto, </em>248 Mass. 340. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>283 Mass. 166. <em>Semons </em>v. <em>Towns, </em>285 Mass. 96, 100. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>295 Mass. 238, 243. <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Simco Trading Co. Inc. </em>297 Mass. 282. <em>Weida </em>v. <em>MacDougall, </em>300 Mass. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The direction of a verdict for the defendant on the first count, which was for ordinary negligence, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
