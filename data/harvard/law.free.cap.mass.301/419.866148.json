The defendant\u2019s answer contained a general denial and a plea of payment. The case was tried to a jury and at the close of the evidence the defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict, which was denied subject to his exception. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The only exception argued by the defendant before us was that taken to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">The evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff would warrant the jury in finding the following facts: The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>plaintiff had known the decedent, who was about seventy years of age, for about thirty years. They had worked together prior to the plaintiff\u2019s marriage and thereafter the decedent visited the plaintiff frequently, over a period of twenty-five years, and on many occasions was her guest over \u201cweek ends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">About August 1, 1931, the decedent told the plaintiff she would like to make her home during the rest of her life with the plaintiff. The decedent said that she would leave the plaintiff \u201chalf the money she had.\u201d The plaintiff was to care for the decedent, and did take care of her from August 1, 1931, to July 2, 1935, furnishing her with \u201cboard, room, laundry and companionship and also took her to church under the above agreements.\u201d The plaintiff expected to be paid for her services \u201cby getting one half of the money that the decedent left when she died.\u201d She received no money for the services rendered to the decedent except about $100 which was for extra meals when the decedent had visitors. In July, 1935, the plaintiff became unable, by reason of poor health, to continue to furnish the services agreed upon to the decedent and at that time \u201csent for the decedent\u2019s sister-in-law to come for her.\u201d The decedent left the plaintiff\u2019s home on July 2, 1935, and died on January 19, 1936, leaving a will which contained the following provision: \u201cI give and bequeath to Mrs. Nora Hathaway wife of Mr. Herbert Hathaway, of 207 Massasoit Road, Worcester, Massachusetts, the total sum of cash deposited by me in my name in the Savings Department of the Worcester County Bank.\u201d At the time of the decedent\u2019s death there was no deposit standing in her name in the savings department of the Worcester County Bank. There was no evidence that the decedent had a deposit in the savings department of that bank or of any bank in Worcester at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Entirely apart from any infirmities in the express contract which might arise under the provisions of the statute of frauds (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 259, \u00a7 5), it is obvious that the plaintiff could not rely upon that contract as she had not fully performed its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The fact, however, that the plaintiff, after having complied with the terms of the agreement for almost four years, became unable by reason of poor health to continue to do so, does not preclude her from recovering for the board and lodging furnished and the services rendered to the decedent. The agreement was of such a nature as to admit only of a personal performance by the plaintiff, and the parties thereto must be taken to have acted upon the assumption of the continued ability of the plaintiff to perform. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>5 Allen, 306, 307. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Met. 440. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Conlan, </em>10 Allen, 85, 86. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Fall River Iron Works Co. </em>119 Mass. 82, 83. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>155 Mass. 253, 254. <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Blevins, </em>262 Mass. 577, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The sole count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration on an account annexed was sufficient, since the case proved would be correctly described by the common counts for \u201cBoard (and lodging) furnished by the plaintiff for the\u201d decedent and \u201cWork done by the plaintiff for the\u201d decedent. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 147, Forms, (1) (f) (d). A \u201cplaintiff who declares on a count on an account annexed has by legal intendment made with respect to the item stated in the account annexed all the allegations contained in all the common counts . . . .\u201d <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>185 Mass. 306, 310. <em>Beverly Hospital </em>v. <em>Early, </em>292 Mass. 201, 202-203, and cases cited. <em>DeMontague </em>v. <em>Bacharach, </em>187 Mass. 128, 132. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>108 Mass. 91, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">No question is presented for our determination as to the measure of damages. The sole exception of the defendant which has been argued is to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict in his favor. Since the evidence would warrant a finding for the plaintiff, the judge could not have properly ordered a verdict for the defendant. The defendant\u2019s exception to the admission of certain evidence, not having been argued, is treated as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
