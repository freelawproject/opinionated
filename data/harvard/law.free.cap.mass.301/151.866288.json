The path \u201chad been shoveled in the snow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">The plaintiff and the defendant were sisters-in-law. The defendant had been ill, and the plaintiff at her request had gone to her house about eight o\u2019clock in the evening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>for the purpose of rendering some assistance. Upon starting for home about an hour later, at a place where the path crossed a driveway, the plaintiff fell upon an accumulation of slippery ice about three feet in diameter which \u201cwas smooth in general,\u201d but \u201cthe edges of which were rough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We have stated all of the testimony bearing upon the alleged negligence of the defendant. There is an entire absence of any evidence as to the nature of the underlying surface of the path or driveway, or as to the state of the weather, or as to what caused the ice, where it came from, how thick it was, the appearance and position of its \u201crough\u201d edges, or how long it had been there, except that the plaintiff herself testified that when she went to the house she \u201cnoticed no ice on the walk.\u201d It is common knowledge that in this climate on a February night a number of conditions might exist which within a very short time' could cause the formation of ice that would satisfy this meager description without fault of the owner and without reasonable opportunity on his part to remove it or to warn against it or even to ascertain its presence. <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>145 Mass. 476, 479. <em>Labrie </em>v. <em>Donham, </em>243 Mass. 584. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>280 Mass. 288, 290. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>299 Mass. 318.
