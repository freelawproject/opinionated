The roadway had been ploughed out to a greater width, about twenty-two or twenty-three feet, and snow was piled on both sides about three feet high. The driveway and its connection with the highway were free from snow. The plaintiff was waiting for a truck which was approaching from the south on the easterly side of the highway. The truck and the defendant\u2019s automobile, which was travelling south on the west side of the highway, reached a point opposite the driveway at about the same time. There was evidence warranting a finding that as the defendant\u2019s automobile got close to the driveway it swerved to the west, without any impelling necessity, and its right side hit the plaintiff, who was seen by the defendant when fifty or sixty feet away and who was standing still two or three feet from the earlier course of the automobile. There was evidence that there was plenty of room for the defendant\u2019s automobile to pass between the truck and the plaintiff without striking either. Upon this evidence, the jury could find the defendant negligent. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>217 Mass. 52. <em>Forzley </em>v. <em>Bianchi, </em>240 Mass. 36. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>263 Mass. 252. <em>Spain </em>v. <em>Oikemus, </em>278 Mass. 544. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>284 Mass. 84. <em>Derby </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc. </em>295 Mass. 438. <em>Perricotti </em>v. <em>Andelman, </em>298 Mass. 461.
