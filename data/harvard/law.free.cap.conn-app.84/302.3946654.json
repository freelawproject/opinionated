Alvord, for having operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The plaintiff sought judicial review of the defendant\u2019s order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, and the trial court reinstated the plaintiffs license. On appeal, the defendant claims that substantial evidence existed in the record to support its suspension order, and, thus, the court improperly determined that the hearing officer\u2019s finding of fact that the plaintiff had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of \u201c0.07 [percent] or more\u201d prohibited the license suspension. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter with direction to reinstate the defendant\u2019s suspension order.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The facts are as follows. At approximately 5:13 p.m. on January 5, 2003, Trooper Daniel Bavosi of the state police observed the plaintiff operating his motor vehicle erratically and effectuated a stop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bavosi detected a strong odor of alcohol on the plaintiffs breath, noticed that his eyes were glossy and bloodshot, and asked the plaintiff whether he had consumed any alcoholic beverages. After the plaintiff responded that he had consumed \u201ca couple,\u201d Bavosi administered field sobriety tests. The plaintiff passed the alphabet and walk-turn tests, but failed the horizontal gaze nystagmus and the one-leg stand tests. Bavosi arrested the plaintiff for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">At the state police barracks, the plaintiff submitted to Breathalyzer tests. The first test, administered at 6:04 p.m., indicated a BAC of 0.152 percent; the second test, administered approximately thirty-one minutes later, indicated a BAC of 0.126 percent. Consequently, the defendant suspended the plaintiffs license for nine months in accordance with \u00a7 14-227b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to the plaintiffs request under \u00a7 14-227b (e), the department of motor vehicles provided an administrative hearing in accordance with \u00a7 14-227b (g) to allow the plaintiff to contest his license suspension. Acting on behalf of the defendant, the hearing officer found, inter alia, that the plaintiff had \u201csubmitted to the test or analysis and the results indicated a BAC of 0.07 [percent] or more.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Accordingly, the defendant ordered the suspension of the plaintiffs license.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court from the defendant\u2019s order pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a). The court sustained the plaintiffs appeal because the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs BAC was \u201c0.07 [percent] or more\u201d failed to satisfy the 0.08 percent BAC requirement, as provided in \u00a7 14-227a (a). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u201c[J]udicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [(UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . [R]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . <em>Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>254 Conn. 333, 343, 757 A.2d 561 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The defendant claims that because all four suspension criteria set forth in \u00a7 14-227b (g)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were satisfied, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>court improperly overturned the defendant\u2019s decision to suspend the plaintiffs license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At issue in the present case is the third criterion set forth in \u00a7 14-227b (g), namely, whether substantial evidence existed in the record to support the defendant\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had operated a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.08 percent or more. Although the defendant found that the plaintiff \u201csubmitted to [Breathalyzer tests] and the results indicated a BAC of 0.07 [percent] or more,\u201d our review of the record indicates that substantial evidence existed to support the defendant\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff operated a motor vehicle while he had an elevated blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Bavosi testified that the plaintiff failed the horizontal gaze nystagmus and the one-leg stand field sobriety tests. Further, the plaintiff submitted to Breathalyzer tests, the results of which indicated a BAC of 0.152 percent and 0.126 percent, respectively.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cAn administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 343. In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the plaintiffs Breathalyzer test results clearly were in excess of the 0.08 percent elevated BAC requirement set forth in \u00a7 14-227a (a). On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s order to suspend the plaintiffs license was reasonably supported by the evidence and it must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to reinstate the defendant\u2019s order suspending the plaintiffs license.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In this opinion FOTI, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\"> Bavosi testified that before he stopped the plaintiffs vehicle, he saw the defendant on Interstate 395 \u201cmaking several tight swerves within the line\u201d and then \u201ccross the fog line . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle wliile under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.

I would affirm the judgment of the trial court ordering the reinstatement of the plaintiffs motor vehicle operator\u2019s license. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The plaintiff, Justin M. Alvord, sought an administrative hearing, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (g), in order to obtain the return of his license. Pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (g), the hearing \u201cshall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis or did such person submit to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicated that such person had an elevated blood alcohol content; and (4) was such person operating a motor vehicle.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) defines \u201celevated blood alcohol content\u201d as the \u201cratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is <em>eight-hundredths of one per cent </em>or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u201cIf, after such hearing, the [defendant commissioner of motor vehicles] finds on any one of the said issues in the negative, the commissioner <em>shall </em>reinstate such license or operating privilege. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The statutes are crystal clear. Unless the defendant finds that the operator\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) was eight-hundredths of 1 percent or more, the defendant shall reinstate the operator\u2019s license. The defendant\u2019s only finding with respect to the plaintiffs BAC in this case was \u201c0.07 [percent] or more.\u201d Because the defendant failed to find that the plaintiffs BAC was 0.08 percent or more, the defendant, according to \u00a7 14-227b (h), must reinstate the plaintiffs license.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The majority excuses the defendant\u2019s failure to find that the plaintiff had a BAC of 0.08 percent or more because there is \u201csubstantial evidence [in the record] to support the defendant\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff operated a motor vehicle while he had an elevated blood alcohol content.\u201d Nevertheless, the majority\u2019s reliance on the evidence in the record cannot control the outcome of this case for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">First, as previously pointed out, \u00a7 14-227b (h) mandates that the plaintiffs license be reinstated on the defendant\u2019s failure to find any one of the issues required under \u00a7 14-227b (g). A finding that an operator\u2019s BAC is \u201c0.07 [percent] or more\u201d does not satisfy a finding that the operator had an elevated blood alcohol content, as statutorily required. The legislature recently enacted Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, which directs the court, including this appellate court, to give effect to the plain and unambiguous words of a statute. \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cWe cannot ignore the plain wording of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>256 Conn. 193, 207, 770 A.2d 491 (2001). \u201cIt is plain error for the trial court [and this appellate court] to fail to apply an applicable statute.\u201d <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 39, 699 A.2d 101 (1997). \u201cIf courts were free to pick and choose what part of a statute ... to rely on and what part to ignore, then the courts . . . would, in effect, draft the law as well as construe its meaning.\u201d <em>Florez </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>156 F.3d 438, 443 (2d Cir. 1998). Indeed, by disregarding the mandate of \u00a7 14-227b (g), the plaintiffs due process rights are implicated. See <em>Otero </em>v. <em>New York City Housing Authority, </em>484 F.2d 1122, 1135 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Second, the majority looks for support in the results of two Breathalyzer tests performed on the plaintiff. The first test indicated that the plaintiff had a BAC of 0.152 percent. The second test, administered approximately thirty-one minutes later, indicated that the plaintiff had a BAC of 0.126 percent. Although the defendant found that the Breathalyzer test results \u201cindicated a BAC of 0.07 [percent] or more,\u201d the defendant\u2019s subordinate findings make no mention of the Breathalyzer tests. \u201c[J]udicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [(UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . [R]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this [appellate] court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>questions of fact.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>254 Conn. 333, 343, 757 A.2d 561 (2000). In other words, it is not for this court to determine the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Finally, whether the plaintiff was operating his vehicle erratically, smelt of alcohol or allegedly failed a sobriety test does not support a finding that the plaintiff had a BAC of 0.08 percent or more, as required by \u00a7 14-227a (a). Indeed, contrary to the majority\u2019s \u201cfinding,\u201d the record in this case reveals that the plaintiff passed physical tests such as the walk and turn test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Accordingly, as a result of the failure of the defendant to find that the plaintiff had a BAC of 0.08 percent or more, I believe that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed and that the defendant should be ordered to reinstate the plaintiffs license.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">I also disagree with the rescript in the majority opinion. Fairness would dictate that, on remand, the trial court should determine whether the defendant incorrectly denied the plaintiffs motion to reconsider his decision on the basis of a report from James E. O\u2019Brien, Ph.D., M.D., in which O\u2019Brien opined that in this case, the BAC could not be determined with reasonable scientific certainty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\"> The defendant in his brief concedes that \u201cthe plaintiff successfully completed\u201d some of the field sobriety tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\"> In the report that the plaintiff wanted the defendant to consider, O\u2019Brien states in relevant part: \u201cIn regards to your inquiry as to whether or not [the plaintiffs] blood alcohol level was indeed at or above 0.08% w/w cannot be answered with reasonable scientific certainty. This is based on the fact that [the plaintiffs] blood alcohol decreased 0.026% in the 31 minutes between the two tests. This value is equivalent to a decline of 0.050% per hour. The normal decline in the alcohol level for 31 minutes would be 0.009% (0.018% per hour). A decrease of this magnitude (0.050% per hour) is almost three times the normal decline of 0.018% per hour and is most rare, if not medically impossible, to metabolize sufficient alcohol to result in such a large decline. This marked decrease can only be explained by either one or both of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tests being incorrect. In view of this, the tests must be considered invalid and [the plaintiffs] blood alcohol level cannot be established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The dissent does not rely on O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter, as claimed by the majority in its footnote 7. The dissent refers to O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter to point out that although the majority reverses the judgment of the trial court on the basis of the majority\u2019s conclusion that a BAC finding of 0.07 percent or more satisfies the statutory requirement of 0.08 percent or more, there was another issue before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">The second issue was whether the defendant abused his discretion by refusing to grant the plaintiffs petition for reconsideration, which was predicated on O\u2019Brien\u2019s report. The trial court never reached that issue because it logically concluded that a BAC of 0.07 percent or more does not equal a BAC of 0.08 percent or more. Accordingly, even if the majority is correct, the rescript in this case should be that the matter is remanded to the trial court, to consider whether the defendant abused his discretion by failing to grant the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. The decision of the trial court foreclosed any consideration of the motion to reconsider. Certainly, the plaintiff had no reason to raise the issue after the trial court orally ruled in his favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
