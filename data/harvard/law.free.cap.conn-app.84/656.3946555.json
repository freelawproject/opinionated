Carrano, Jr. On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly (1) increased, sua sponte, the number of peremptory challenges allowed to the plaintiff in order to equalize her number of challenges with that of the several defendants, (2) admitted the testimony of the plaintiffs medical expert on causation of death, (3) concluded there was sufficient evidence of causation of death and (4) allowed the question of economic damages to reach the jury without an adequate evidentiary basis. We conclude that the court acted improperly with respect to the granting of peremptory challenges and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Carrano was admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital on March 12,1992. He required treatment for a necrotic finger and a colonoscopy to determine whether and to what extent surgery would be an appropriate next step in treating his Crohn\u2019s disease. Carrano underwent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>colonoscopy and treatment for the necrotic finger. He was released from Yale-New Haven on March 21, 1992, and died at home early the next morning. Thereafter, the plaintiff initiated this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The defendants first claim that the court improperly granted the plaintiff additional peremptory challenges not authorized by General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7\u00a7 51-241 and 51-243 (a). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Prior to juiy selection, on April 24, 2001, the court increased, sua sponte, the number of the plaintiffs peremptory challenges from eight to twenty to equalize her number of challenges with that of the defendants. At that stage of the litigation, there were five defendants who claimed to lack a unity of interest<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 51-241 and 51-243 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>each defendant four peremptory challenges for a total of twenty. Given that there were at most two plaintiffs\u2014 the plaintiff acting in her individual and representative capacities \u2014 the maximum number of challenges to which the plaintiff was entitled by \u00a7\u00a7 51-241 and 51-243 (a) was eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The court concluded that this twenty to eight disparity in peremptory challenges was unfair and decided to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by increasing the plaintiffs allotment of peremptory challenges to twenty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants took exception to the court\u2019s determination but were overruled. During jury selection, the plaintiff exercised fifteen<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of her twenty peremptory challenges. At trial, the court directed a verdict for two of the defendant physicians.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury found the three remaining defendants liable and awarded approximately $3.4 million in total damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Our review of the court\u2019s decision to increase the plaintiffs number of peremptory challenges from eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>to twenty is guided by our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Kalams </em>v. <em>Giacchetto, </em>268 Conn. 244, 256-64, 842 A.2d 1100 (2004). \u201c[T]he granting of more challenges than provided by law is subject to review for abuse of discretion. In conducting that review, we consider whether the granting of the challenges harmed either party or was inconsistent with an efficient and orderly judicial process.\u201d Id., 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The plaintiff argues that the court\u2019s discretion to grant additional peremptory challenges is broad enough to include the situation here, where the court awarded additional challenges to only one side in the litigation to equalize the two sides\u2019 control over jury selection. She also argues that her exercise of at least seven more peremptory challenges than prescribed by statute did not harm the defendants. We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">First, as to the issue of the breadth of a trial court\u2019s discretion, a careful reading of <em>Kalams </em>reveals a narrow discretion when applied to a case like the one now before us. <em>Kalams </em>refers only to the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant <em>each side </em>in litigation additional challenges. All of the relevant cases cited in <em>Kalams, </em>and <em>Kalams </em>itself, involve a court\u2019s decision to grant more peremptory challenges to each side. In fact, most of the cases discussed are criminal cases, which require an equal number of peremptory challenges for the state and the defendant. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 845, 661 A.2d 539 (1995) (trial court may allow parties more peremptory challenges than provided by law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 624-26, 513 A.2d 638 (1986) (trial court, which had at outset of jury selection mistakenly granted each party eight peremptory challenges instead of four to which they were entitled, should have left mistake intact). Thus, the court was constrained by the number of peremptory challenges allowed by \u00a7\u00a7 51-241 and 51-243 (a). We accordingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>conclude that the court improperly awarded the plaintiff additional peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We next consider whether the defendants suffered harm. See <em>Kalams </em>v. <em>Giachetto, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 264. Here, the plaintiffs receipt of twelve more challenges than that to which she was entitled (of which she used seven) fundamentally altered the composition of the jury that decided the c\u00e1se in her favor. Prior to the adoption of the amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 51-241 and 51-243 (a) adopting a \u201ctwo to one rule,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> when only one side in litigation was granted additional peremptory challenges solely to lessen a disparity in challenges, the other side is harmed and a new trial is necessary. See <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>65 Conn. App. 738, 744, 783 A.2d 1085, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 938, 786 A.2d 425 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">A new trial is the only appropriate remedy \u201cbecause the use of the challenges at the original trial can never be reconstructed. If each [side had the appropriate number of] challenges, a wholly different jury panel might have been selected.\u201d <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center, </em>55 Conn. App. 460, 467, 738 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>1151 (1999). We conclude that the court abused its discretion in granting additional peremptory challenges to the plaintiff, causing the defendants to suffer harm. Accordingly, a new trial is necessary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly admitted the testimony of the plaintiffs only medical expert over their objections under <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998). We conclude that the court properly admitted the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">An autopsy determined that the cause of Carrano\u2019s death was pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). While it was not disputed that the pulmonary edema caused the death, the cause of the pulmonary edema itself was a main issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The plaintiffs expert, Robert Pieroni, a physician board certified in internal medicine, theorized that the pulmonary edema was caused by a massive fluid overload, which Carrano\u2019s body could not sufficiently eliminate, essentially causing him to drown. Pieroni testified that the defendants negligently failed to address several treatable conditions that caused and exacerbated the fluid overload and that the defendants failed to alter or halt courses of treatment that were inadvisable for patients with signs of excess fluid.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Pieroni referred to his identification of a combination of causes leading to one result as a \u201cmulti-factorial\u201d diagnostic method. The factors he identified as contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>uting to the pulmonary edema were massive edema or \u201canasarca\u201d (excess fluids in the upper and lower extremities, sacrum and buttocks that caused noticeable and extreme swelling); progressive anemia (Carrano lost one third of his blood volume while at Yale-New Haven Hospital); sepsis; fever; pneumonitis; a low potassium-high sodium diet; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and hospital-administered fluids including saline, intravenous antibiotics, and \u201cGo-Lightly,\u201d a gallon of which Carrano drank to cleanse his colon for the colonoscopy. In sum, Pieroni testified that no single factor caused the pulmonary edema, but that the combination of those many factors caused it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The defendants\u2019 experts testified that the pulmonary edema could not possibly have been caused by massive fluid overload given Carrano\u2019s relatively healthy heart and healthy kidneys.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They also offered alternate theories of causation and disputed the relevance or existence of many of the above enumerated factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Prior to and at trial, the defendants attacked the scientific reliability of Pieroni\u2019s testimony by filing a motion in limine to exclude it and later moving to have it stricken and judgment entered for the defendants. Each time, the court recognized that some of the factual bases for Pieroni\u2019s opinion were questionable, but it nonetheless sent Pieroni\u2019s testimony to the jury. The court reasoned that the defendants\u2019 purported attacks on the scientific reliability of Pieroni\u2019s method (the \u201cmulti-factorial\u201d diagnostic method) were not attacks on his method. Rather, the defendants\u2019 attacks were on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the underlying factual bases for Pieroni\u2019s conclusions, the existence of which would be disputed fact questions for the jury. The court also concluded that even if the defendants attacked the \u201cmulti-factorial\u201d diagnostic method, they would have failed because \u201canalysis of multiple signs and symptoms to arrive at a cause is a well recognized diagnostic methodology in the field of medicine and needs no explication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We review rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion. \u201c[U]nless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201c[T]he scientific evidence that forms the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion must undergo a validity assessment to ensure reliability. ... In <em>Porter . . . </em>[the Connecticut Supreme Court] followed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), and held that scientific evidence should be subjected to a flexible test, with differing factors that are applied on a case-by-case basis, to determine the reliability of the scientific evidence. . . . [Scientific evidence, and expert testimony based thereon, usually is to be evaluated under a threshold admissibility standard assessing the reliability of the methodology underlying the evidence and whether the evidence at issue is, in fact, derived from and based upon that methodology . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 154, 167-68, 847 A.2d 978 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Despite the court\u2019s considerable and active role in screening out unreliable expert testimony, \u201c[a] judge frequently should find an expert\u2019s methodology helpful [and thus admissible] even when the judge thinks that the expert\u2019s technique has flaws sufficient to render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the [expert\u2019s] conclusions inaccurate. He or she will often still believe that hearing the expert\u2019s testimony and assessing its flaws was an important part of assessing what conclusion was correct and may certainly still believe that a jury attempting to reach an accurate result should consider the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We find that this was precisely the case here. Although the court recognized a number of possible flaws in Pieroni\u2019s factual assumptions and interpretations, it found no fault with the \u201cmulti-factorial\u201d diagnostic method. The defendants have offered no justification for rejecting the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201canalysis of multiple signs and symptoms to arrive at a cause is a well recognized diagnostic methodology in the field of medicine and needs no explication.\u201d See <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 170 (some scientific principles are so well established that they require no threshold admissibility inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The court properly allowed the jury to be the arbiter of fact. \u201cOnce the methodology underlying an expert conclusion has been sufficiently established, the mere fact that controversy, or even substantial controversy, surrounds that conclusion goes only to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of such testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 83. The defendants assail the \u201cmulti-factorial\u201d approach only insofar as it was applied using facts they disputed and led to a conclusion with which they disagreed. They offer nothing to suggest that the method itself is unreliable or that Pieroni\u2019s review of the records was inadequate. More importantly, the defendants did not do so at trial. We accordingly conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Pieroni\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>The judgment against the defendants Yale-New Haven Hospital, Garth Bailantyne and Mary Harris is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-12\"> The defendants on appeal are Yale-New Haven Hospital; Garth Ballantyne, a physician; and Mary Harris, a registered nurse. Two others, the defendant Andrew Elliot and the substitute defendant Barbara Kinder, executrix of the estate of the defendant Elton Cahow, moved successfully for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>directed verdict following the close of evidence. We refer in this opinion to Yale-New Haven Hospital, Ballantyne and Harris as the defendants. Our decision today does not reinstate the plaintiffs cause of action against Elliot or the estate of Cahow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> Dusring the pendency of litigation, the plaintiff has remarried and is now known as Mary Sholomicky. We shall refer to her as the plaintiff in order to distinguish her from her late husband, whom we shall refer to as Carrano.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\"> Because we conclude that a new trial is necessary, we need not consider the defendants\u2019 third claim regarding the sufficiency of the plaintiffs evidence. We do, however, consider the defendants\u2019 second claim concerning the admissibility of evidence because it is likely to recur at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Although the defendants\u2019 fourth claim also is likely to recur at retrial, it merits little discussion. They claim, essentially, that there was an inadequate evidentiary basis for the jury to calculate economic damages. We agree. Economic damages normally require nontestimonial evidence; <em>Giordano </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>39 Conn. App. 183, 207, 664 A.2d 1136 (1995); and must be proven to a reasonable certainty. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>267 Conn. 336, 350 n.7, 838 A.2d 170 (2004). The plaintiffs evidence of economic damages was inadequate as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> The court appears to have concluded that the defendants lacked a unity of interest, given the number of peremptory challenges it awarded. That issue was not raised on appeal, nor was the issue of whether the plaintiff, whose sole individual claim was loss of consortium, had a unity of interest with Carrano\u2019s estate. We therefore do not address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">\u201c[A] \u2018unity of interest\u2019 means that the interests of the several plaintiffs or of the several defendants are substantially similar,\u201d which allows the court discretion <em>to </em>treat <em>the </em>several plaintiffs or the several defendants as a single party for the limited purpose of jury selection. General Statutes \u00a7 51-243 (a); see <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>65 Conn. App. 738, 750, 783 A.2d 1085, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 938, 786 A.2d 425 (2001) (no unity of interest found where liability of each defendant separate and distinct from liability of others); see also Practice Book \u00a7 16-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 51-241, entitled \u201cPeremptory challenges in civil actions,\u201d provides: \u201cOn the trial of any civil action to a jury, each party may challenge peremptorily three jurors.

Alternate jurors shall have the same qualifications and be selected and subject to examination and challenge in the same manner and to the same extent as the jurors constituting the regular panel. In any case when the court directs the selection of alternate jurors, each party may peremptorily challenge four jurors. Where the court determines a unity of interest exists, several plaintiffs or several defendants may be considered as a single party for the purpose of making challenges, or the court may allow additional peremptory challenges and permit them to be exercised separately or jointly.

Presently, the maximum disparity in peremptory challenges between plaintiffs and defendants allowed in civil cases is a ratio of two to one. Thus, if there are two plaintiffs and five defendants, all lacking a unity of interest, the defendants will be granted twenty peremptory challenges and the plaintiffs\u2019 total will be increased from eight to ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The statutes were both amended to include that \u201c[a] unity of interest shall be found to exist among parties who are represented by the same attorney or law firm. In addition, there shall be a presumption that a unity of interest exists among parties where no cross claims or apportionment complaints have been filed against one another. In all civil actions, the total number of peremptory challenges allowed to the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall not exceed twice the number of peremptory challenges allowed to the defendant or defendants, and the total number of peremptory challenges allowed to the defendant or defendants shall not exceed twice the number of peremptory challenges allowed to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.\u201d Public Acts 2001, No. 01-152, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> We note that the court\u2019s concerns about the discrepancy in peremptory challenges; see footnote 6; were well founded, especially in light of the amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 51-241 and 51-243 (a). Nevertheless, those later adopted amendments have no effect on this case. If anything, the legislature\u2019s decision to amend the statutes confirms our understanding that the law, as it existed at the time of jury selection, prohibited the court\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> The defendants make much of the fact that Pieroni initially testified that Carrano\u2019s pulmonary edema was caused by congestive heart failure. On redirect examination, Pieroni corrected himself, noting that \u201cin 99 percent of cases\u201d the two terms are used interchangeably, but this was a rare case where that nomenclature would be incorrect. We accept Pieroni\u2019s revised testimony, considering that the trial court found that it was a matter of semantic and not scientific inaccuracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
