The principal issue is whether the defendant\u2019s rights to due process were violated as a result of his alleged incompetence at the time of his acceptance of the plea agreement. The trial court determined that the defendant had entered his plea in a knowing and voluntary manner. We agree and therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In a two count information, the state charged the defendant, Keith Mordaksy, with threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62, and breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181. This information arose out of an alleged threat to kill a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">On September 4, 2002, after the defendant\u2019s arrest, he appeared before the trial court in the first of a series of hearings. Because of several spontaneous and disorganized comments that the defendant made at that hearing, the state raised concerns about his ability to understand the proceedings. As a result, the court, on its own motion, ordered a competency examination pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (c) and continued the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Shortly thereafter, on October 30, 2002, the parties again appeared before the trial court for a competency hearing. In the meantime, a competency monitor and treatment team (competency team) had examined the defendant. Testifying on behalf of the competency team, Helen Gori, a clinical social worker, told the court that, although the defendant had prematurely ended an evaluation session,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the competency team had been able to observe the defendant\u2019s behavior and to evaluate his comments and answers to questions. The competency team had concluded that it was unclear whether the defendant understood the charges against him and that it was unlikely that the defendant could cooperate with his attorney or assist in his own defense. Nonetheless, the competency team also concluded that, with sufficient inpatient treatment, the defendant could be restored to competency within sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On February 28, 2003, the court held another hearing after having been informed that the competency team had completed another evaluation report. In this report, dated February 11, 2003 (report), the competency team unanimously found the defendant competent to stand trial. Specifically, the report described the defendant\u2019s ongoing cooperation with several treatment measures, including taking his prescribed medication. The report concluded that, despite the defendant\u2019s expression of some grandiose and psychotic delusions, he was \u201cwell able to separate out his delusional beliefs from consideration of his current legal situation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>At that hearing, consistent with the report, the defendant waived his right to a competency hearing and asked the court to find him competent. After reviewing the competency team\u2019s report, the court made such a finding. Also at that time, at the request of defense counsel, the court appointed a guardian ad litem for the defendant. Finally, the court instructed the defendant that, until his next court date, he was to continue to receive treatment at a local mental health facility and to take his prescribed medication as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On March 12, 2003, at the plea hearing that is the subject of this appeal, the defendant pleaded guilty to second degree breach of the peace under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state agreed to nolle the threatening charge as well as other unrelated motor vehicle infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The state offered the following factual basis for the <em>Alford </em>plea. On July 18, 2002, the victim, a twelve year old girl, and her two younger brothers, were leaving a grocery store in Stafford. As they left, an older black man, later determined to be the defendant, was sitting in a black car with a red stripe. The man allegedly rolled down his car window and threatened to kill the victim. The children returned home immediately and reported the incident to their mother, who called the police. In light of the children\u2019s description, the police identified the defendant as a possible suspect and proceeded to locate and interview him. They arrested him after he admitted that he had driven a car matching the vehicle described by the children in the proximity of the identified grocery store.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>After conducting a canvass of the defendant, the court accepted his <em>Alford </em>plea. The court determined that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s plea is knowingly and voluntarily made with the assistance of competent counsel, also with the assistance of his guardian ad litem.\u201d In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced the defendant to ninety days imprisonment, execution suspended, and nine months of probation with special conditions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Although the defendant did not move to withdraw his plea in the trial court, in this appeal he challenges the validity of his plea agreement. He claims that the trial court (1) improperly concluded that his plea of guilty was knowing and voluntary without holding a separate evidentiary hearing into his competence to enter into a plea agreement and (2) conducted a constitutionally defective plea canvass. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">As a threshold issue, we must address whether intervening events have rendered this appeal moot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of a moot case. <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 377-78, 660 A.2d 323 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The issue of mootness arises from the fact that, during the pendency of this appeal, the defendant\u2019s probation, as stipulated in the plea agreement, has expired. Accordingly, if we were to agree with his claim about the invalidity of the plea agreement, we would be unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>to provide him any practical relief with respect to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Nevertheless, an otherwise moot question may qualify for review under the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception. This exception permits review if other actions in the future (1) will encounter similar time constraints precluding appellate review, (2) will affect a group of similar complainants for whom this litigant may reasonably serve as a surrogate and (3) will similarly raise a question of public importance. Id, 382. All three criteria are satisfied under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">First, the defendant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, which, as a matter of statutory law, is punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of one year. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-26 (a). This truncated exposure to imprisonment makes it unlikely that the constitutionality of a plea agreement involving a misdemeanor can ever be heard before the expiration of the term of punishment. Second, this defendant reasonably may serve as a surrogate for similar misdemeanor defendants. Finally, because the defendant has raised a constitutional issue with respect to his competence to enter into a plea agreement, he has presented an issue that qualifies as a question of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We conclude, therefore, that we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal. Neither party has argued to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">At the outset, the defendant concedes that each one of his claims about the validity of his plea is unpreserved. Ordinarily, a defendant who challenges the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea should move to withdraw his guilty plea or file a postsentence motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>with the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 39-26; <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>220 Conn. 6, 16, 595 A.2d 851 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Nonetheless, the defendant asks for review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The state concedes that both of the defendant\u2019s claims meet the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for review and they are of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>75 Conn. App. 615, 619, 816 A.2d 712 (\u201c[t]he propriety of a guilty plea implicates a defendant\u2019s due process rights\u201d), cert. granted on other grounds, 263 Conn. 920, 822 A.2d 244 (2003), appeal withdrawn May 14, 2004, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 901, 853 A.2d 520 (2004) (state was granted permission to file late petition for certification). Therefore, we may proceed to an analysis of whether a due process violation clearly exists. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40. Accordingly, we will address the defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was involuntary and the plea canvass was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">COMPETENCE TO ENTER A PLEA</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal is that the trial court violated his due process rights to a fair trial because it accepted his <em>Alford </em>plea without ordering, on its own motion, another evidentiary hearing concerning his competence. In the defendant\u2019s view, the court had before it substantial evidence that established a reasonable doubt about his competence to plead guilty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">As a matter of constitutional law, it is undisputed that \u201cthe guilty plea and subsequent conviction of an accused person who is not legally competent to stand trial violates the due process of law guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; U.S. Const., amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; see <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>383 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>U.S. 375, 378, 86 S. Ct. 836, 15 L. Ed. 2d 815 (1966).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>253 Conn. 1, 20, 751 A.2d 298 (2000). This constitutional mandate is codified in our state law by \u00a7 54-56d (a), which provides that \u201c[a] defendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while he is not competent. For the purposes of this section, a defendant is not competent if he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Although our state law presumes the competence of defendants; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (b); \u201cthe rule of <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>[supra, 383 U.S. 375] imposes a constitutional obligation, under the due process clause, [for the trial court], to undertake an independent judicial inquiry, in appropriate circumstances, into a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial or to plead guilty.\u201d <em>States. Watson, </em>198 Conn. 598, 605, 504 A.2d 497 (1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cCompetence to stand trial is a legal question, which must ultimately be determined by the trial court. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 786, 785 A.2d 573 (2001). Thus, \u201c[t]he decision to grant [an evidentiary] hearing [to determine a defendant\u2019s competence] requires the exercise of sound judicial discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>199 Conn. 359, 366, 507 A.2d 992 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The defendant concedes that neither he nor his counsel requested a <em>Pate </em>hearing at the time of his plea hearing. As a result, the trial court did not make an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>explicit finding of competence, or more precisely a finding that the defendant had a sufficient present ability to understand the nature of the plea proceedings. Nevertheless, our case law has held that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s scrutiny of the voluntariness and the intelligence of a plea . . . necessarily implies that it has made an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competence to plead.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The defendant maintains that, in light of the evidence and circumstances of which the court was aware, it abused its discretion by failing to order a competency hearing on its own motion. Our case law firmly holds that \u201c[a] defendant who challenges the validity of his guilty plea for lack of an evidentiary inquiry into his competence must make a showing that, at the time of his plea, the court had before it specific factual allegations that, if true, would constitute <em>substantial evidence </em>of mental impairment. . . . Substantial evidence is a term of art. Evidence encompasses all information properly before the court, whether it is in the form of testimony or exhibits formally admitted or it is in the form of medical reports or other kinds of reports that have been filed with the court. Evidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">To establish that the trial court had the requisite substantial evidence to raise a reasonable doubt about his competence, the defendant points to three facts. These facts are (1) his long history of mental illness, (2) his conduct during the plea canvass and (3) his counsel\u2019s initial representation to the court that the defendant was incompetent to enter a plea. We are not persuaded that, on this record, the trial court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>discretion by failing to conduct a renewed evidentiary inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Long History of Mental Illness</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The defendant first argues that the trial court\u2019s awareness of his long history of mental illness and repeated failures to take his prescribed medication constituted substantial evidence of mental impairment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Our point of departure is the accepted principle that \u201c[c]ompetence to stand trial ... is not defined in terms of mental illness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 230, 511 A.2d 310 (1986). \u201cAn accused may be suffering from a mental illness and nonetheless be able to understand the charges against him and to assist in his own defense . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Therefore, the test for determining competence focuses not solely on a historical assessment of mental illness but on \u201cwhether [the defendant] has sufficient <em>present ability </em>to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 663, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996); see also <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s view, we find that the record supported the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the defendant had a sufficient present ability to plead guilty. Although the defendant had been declared incompetent several times in the past, the competency team assigned to evaluate his mental health concluded that he had been restored to competence several weeks prior to the plea hearing. In their report, the competency team concluded that with the aid of medication, he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201cbeen able to engage in clear and coherent discussions of his legal situation.\u201d This finding is consistent with our case law that holds \u201cthe fact that [a] defendant was receiving medication and would require medication during the course of the trial does not render him incompetent.\u201d Sta<em>te </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In response, the defendant places significance on the fact that four weeks had passed between his competency hearing and his plea hearing. He has not cited, and we have not found, any case law that establishes a bright line rule as to when a competency report becomes stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In our view, the relevant inquiry for a trial court is to determine whether the defendant\u2019s condition has materially changed since a previous finding of competence. During the court\u2019s canvass, the defendant affirmed that he was taking his medications as directed and was able to understand the proceedings. While the defendant\u2019s subjective appraisal of his condition is not dispositive, the court was in the best position to weigh this appraisal in light of the competency team\u2019s report and the court\u2019s own previous finding of competency issued a month before the plea hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>81 Conn. App. 294, 303, 838 A.2d 1064 (2004) (\u201c[T]he trial judge is in a particularly advantageous position to observe a defendant\u2019s conduct during a trial and has a unique opportunity to assess a defendant\u2019s competency. A trial court\u2019s opinion, therefore, of the competence of a defendant is highly significant.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">As a result, as far as the record shows, the trial court reasonably could find that the defendant\u2019s past struggles with his mental illness and his former failure to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>his medication did not negate his present willingness to continue his treatment. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s history of mental illness did not, by itself, require a new evidentiary inquiry into his competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Conduct During Plea Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The defendant also argues that his behavior and commentary during the plea canvass constituted substantial evidence to raise a reasonable doubt about his competence to plead guilty. Although some of the defendant\u2019s comments concededly were strange and irrational, the state argues that, overall, his ultimate answers to all of the court\u2019s questions were coherent, comprehensive and exhibited an adequate understanding of the proceedings. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The first category of statements that the defendant points to relate to his alleged confusion about legal matters. For instance, despite his stated agreement to make an <em>Alford </em>plea, he continually proclaimed his innocence of the offenses with which he had been charged. In the defendant\u2019s view, these statements indicate his lack of understanding of the plea proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The defendant, however, overlooks that an <em>Alford </em>plea does not require an admission of guilt but rests on a defendant\u2019s concession that the state had enough evidence to convict him of the crime with which he was charged. See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). Because there is no inconsistency between claims of innocence and an <em>Alford </em>plea, the defendant\u2019s protestations did not demonstrate that he did not understand the proceedings in which he was participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The defendant also points to other statements made at the plea hearing, which, in his view, demonstrate his misunderstanding of the legal system. Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>defendant spoke of pursuing an independent civil action or of attempting to get his charges nolled in the future. The record does not substantiate the defendant\u2019s claim that any of these statements demonstrated that he failed to understand the present proceedings. It follows that the statements had no bearing on his alleged lack of competence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In addition to this alleged legal confusion, the defendant points to other allegedly bizarre responses during the court\u2019s questioning. For example, during the canvass, in response to the trial court\u2019s inquiry into whether his treatment at the local mental health facility was going well, he responded: \u201cYeah, I am hanging out with them. I\u2019m taking them for advantage because I just hit a telephone pole. Someone ran me off the road a couple of days ago. I got a bunch of stitches in my head, right now, and my knees got stitches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In his argument to this court, the defendant maintains that this statement should have alerted the trial court to inquire into his competence. Inferentially, the defendant asks us to assume that this motor vehicle incident never occurred. Yet, as the defendant concedes, the record is silent on this issue. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider evidence that was purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Finally, the defendant argues that he provided unresponsive and bizarre answers concerning his use of his prescribed medication. The record indicates to the contrary. Despite some extraneous commentary, the defendant indicated that he had taken his prescribed medication and was able to understand the proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court reasonably could find that the defendant\u2019s behavior at the plea canvass did not demonstrate mental incompetence. In the absence of substantial evidence of mental impairment, the court did not abuse its discretion by continuing with the plea proceedings without a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Opinion of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is premised on his contention that his attorney unequivocally informed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>court prior to the plea canvass that the defendant was incompetent to enter a plea. In the defendant\u2019s view, despite the fact that his counsel subsequently expressed the opposite view, his initial opinion constituted sufficient evidence of incompetence to require an evidentiary competency hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">It is undisputed that, prior to the plea canvass, the defendant\u2019s counsel informed the court that he had concerns about the defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty. Apparently, counsel feared that the medication that the defendant was taking might impair his understanding of the plea proceedings. The defendant\u2019s guardian ad litem, disagreeing with that assessment, thought that the defendant was competent to enter a plea. In light of this difference of opinion, defense counsel proposed that the court should \u201ccanvass him, specifically, and . . . ask him about the medications that he is taking, because he has raised an issue with me that he would accept this plea bargain.\u201d The court conducted the requested canvass. The defendant affirmed that he had taken his medication but also affirmed his ability to understand the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Thereafter, defense counsel raised no further issues about the defendant\u2019s competence, despite a further inquiry by the court. Addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that he had been coerced into pleading guilty, defense counsel stated: \u201cI believe that this plea is <em>voluntary on his part, even though I also believe that he suffers from delusions. </em>I also understand that his guardian ad litem feels that he is competent to enter this plea.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of this record, the trial court reasonably could find that both the defendant\u2019s counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>his guardian ad litem ultimately agreed on the defendant\u2019s competence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In sum, in light of all of the circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to conduct a separate evidentiary hearing into the defendant\u2019s competence under the circumstances of this case. The defendant did not present specific factual allegations that, if true, would constitute substantial evidence of mental impairment. The court reasonably could find that the defendant\u2019s courteous cooperation with the plea proceedings outweighed the irrelevant comments that he interjected on a few occasions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See State v. George B., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 787-88. The court reasonably could rely on the defendant\u2019s representation that he was taking his prescribed medication and on the competency team\u2019s report that, with medication, the defendant was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">ADEQUACY OF PLEA CANVASS</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Even if the trial court properly concluded that a separate evidentiary hearing was not warranted, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>dant claims that his plea should be set aside because his plea canvass was constitutionally defective. To decide the merits of this claim, we must undertake a plenary examination of the relevant circumstances. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Groppi, </em>81 Conn. App. 310, 313, 840 A.2d 42, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 916, 847 A.2d 311 (2004). We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The guidelines that determine the validity of a plea canvass in our system of law are well established. To protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process, the trial court must ascertain, on the record, that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was made intelligently and voluntarily. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 120, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). \u201cTo ensure compliance with this constitutional mandate, Practice Book [\u00a7 39-19] requires that the trial court address the defendant personally and determine that he fully understands the nature of the charge against him. The court must also advise him of (1) the mandatory minimum sentence, (2) the maximum possible sentence, and (3) the fact that he has the right to plead not guilty, the right to be tried by a jury, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and the right against self-incrimination. The court must also ensure that the plea is voluntary .... Practice Book [\u00a7 39-20].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Benitez, </em>67 Conn. App. 36, 43, 786 A.2d 520 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 922, 792 A.2d 855 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the plea canvass has three parts. Specifically, he argues that the court\u2019s canvass did not adequately address (1) his use of medication, (2) his understanding of the state\u2019s evidence and the charges against him and (3) his ability to understand the penalties associated with the charged offenses. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">It is undisputed that the defendant participated in the plea canvass at a time when he was taking medication. We have already upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that, while medicated, the defendant had the competence to participate in the plea proceedings. Under the circumstances of this case, the defendant\u2019s use of medication was a positive factor supporting the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary agreement to a plea bargain. See <em>Sherbo </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>21 Conn. App. 172, 184, 572 A.2d 378, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 808, 809, 576 A.2d 539 (1990) (prescribed medication improved ability to understand plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The defendant nonetheless maintains that the court\u2019s canvass did not make a sufficient inquiry, on the record, into his current use of alcohol or drugs. Although he asserts that the court failed to elicit any response into whether he was currently using drugs or alcohol, the record does not bear this out. His claim that the court should have inquired more closely into the specific types of medication that he was taking fails to take into account the court\u2019s actual knowledge of the drugs prescribed for the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the absence of an evidentiary representation that the defendant was taking drugs other than his prescribed medication, we cannot fault the plea canvass on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The defendant also asserts that the trial court did not make a sufficient inquiry about the manner in which he was affected by the prescribed medications that he was taking. The defendant argues that, because of the nature of his extraneous comments at the plea canvass, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the court should have disregarded his affirmation that he was able to understand the proceedings while under the influence of his prescribed medication. This argument is another version of the defendant\u2019s previous claim that these comments cast doubt on the defendant\u2019s competence. We have already rejected that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The defendant also maintains that the plea canvass was inadequate because it did not manifest his understanding of the state\u2019s evidence and of the charges against him. He faults the canvass for failing to contain a sufficient description of the state\u2019s evidence, the elements of the offense, and his necessary waiver of his constitutional rights. This is not the usual appellate claim that the court\u2019s questions were incomplete or inadequate. Rather, the defendant attempts to raise again his earlier claim that he was incompetent to plead guilty because of his random interjections of innocence and the possible pursuit of a future civil action. We have already decided that that claim is untenable. Indeed, the record demonstrates direct and responsive answers by the defendant in response to the court\u2019s questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the plea canvass was defective because he did not fully understand the penalties associated with the crime of breach of the peace in the second degree. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">During the court\u2019s canvass, the trial court explained to the defendant the terms of the plea agreement. It informed the defendant that the maximum penalty for breach of the peace in the second degree was six months imprisonment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At that point, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>asked the court whether it was indeed four months, noting the three different degrees described by law. The court immediately reaffirmed that the sentence was six months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In the defendant\u2019s view, this exchange demonstrates his confusion about the penalties associated with his plea, which in turn required the trial court to conduct a more thorough canvass. In light of the court\u2019s immediate clarification of the sentence that the defendant might expect, this claim is groundless. The record demonstrates that the court unequivocally informed the defendant of the sentence that he faced if he agreed to the plea agreement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In sum, we conclude that trial court\u2019s plea canvass ensured that the defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. On the record, the trial court took all the necessary steps that our law requires to ensure that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> The defendant ended the session when he learned that his attorney would not be present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> The competency team determined that while \u201c[the defendant] continues to harbor a complex delusional belief system . . . [t]his does not intrude onto his rational consideration of his legal options. He understands the charges he is facing, the range of penalties, and the choices he had. He has indicated that he wishes to resolve his cases through the court system and feels he would be fairly treated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), permits a criminal defendant to plead guilty without admitting that he committed the crime in order to take advantage of a plea bargain and to avoid the risk of conviction after a trial and possibly a more severe sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"> These special conditions were that the defendant was to \u201cseek whatever treatment and counseling deemed appropriate by the North Central Mental Health District ... to take all medications as described . . . [and] to comply with all conditions as imposed by the North Central Mental Health District.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-12\"> Although neither party has raised or briefed this issue, we consider it sua sponte.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> \u201cThis statutory definition mirrors the federal competency standard enunciated in <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960) (per curiam).\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 271, 849 A.2d 648 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> Our Supreme Court has recently clarified \u201cthat the \u2018independent inquiry\u2019 required by due process whenever an allegation of incompetence has been made is a hearing before the court, not an independent psychiatric evaluation as provided by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 272, 849 A.2d 648 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Indeed, it should be noted that the trial court handled all of the prior proceedings involving the defendant\u2019s mental state, thus enhancing its ability to assess the defendant\u2019s competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> Specifically, the defendant points to a statement that he made in response to his counsel\u2019s advice that any appeal filed after the entering of a guilty plea would be difficult to overturn. The defendant remarked: \u201cI do enough paperwork, I <em>could </em>jam [my attorney] up for nine months, and never see a probation officer, and I finally get it nolled.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal, this statement simply indicates a recognition of the wide range of choices available to him prior to engaging in the plea bargaining process and not an intention to pursue this avenue after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Moreover, the record is ambiguous as to the defendant\u2019s repeated references to his pursuit of a separate civil action. It is not clear whether the \u201ccivil case\u201d to which the defendant alluded referred to a complete misunderstanding of the plea proceeding, a pending grievance against his own counsel, or a possible malicious prosecution claim against the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> The following colloquy occurred between the trial court and the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">\u201cThe Court: And are you currently, or presently, under the influence of alcohol, drugs, medication\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: No. Drugs \u2014 lot of drugs, they gave me, a lot of pills. I sound like I\u2019m drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">\u201cThe Court: ... I understand because we have been here several times together, almost on a weekly basis, the drugs you are taking . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: [T]hey gave me a box drugs about this size.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">\u201cThe Court: And is it your opinion that any of those drugs that your are currently taking renders you unable to understand what we are doing here today?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: No. I understand what is going on here.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">\u201cThe Court: You know what is going on?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: You seem to be ... a pretty good judge, and [I] will accept the plea. And at the most I can do is try to file an appeal, and I\u2019m not gonna, because it\u2019s probably not going to happen. I\u2019ve done it once before, on a three year probation bid and I got away for the whole three years, just [because] I kept doing paper work, and probation didn\u2019t want to bother me. This will be all blown over in nine months.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> Subsequently, the trial court, on the basis of its observations of the defendant with his counsel, found \u201cno issue, with respect to coercion, in that relationship . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\"> We do not mean to suggest that the court would have been required to conduct a competency hearing if defense counsel had continued to express doubts about his client\u2019s ability to participate in the plea proceedings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 788. The court necessarily would have to weigh the opinions of defense counsel and of the guardian ad litem in light of its own observations and the report from the competency team.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> Perhaps, the most striking example of this interplay occurred prior to the court\u2019s canvass:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: I don\u2019t plan on getting into any trouble for nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.
